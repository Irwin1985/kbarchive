	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
	- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	A program may exhibit a memory leak if the program causes Security.dll to be
	loaded and unloaded repeatedly while the process is running. You can observe the
	memory leak by using Windows NT Performance Monitor to track Private Bytes for
	the program process.
	
	An example of a program that can exhibit this problem is an SNA program running
	on a Windows NT client using the SNA Server Client for Windows NT. Each time the
	SNA program (or process) initiates a new host session, the underlying SNA Server
	client causes Security.dll to be loaded to perform Windows NT user validation to
	determine if the user is authorized to gain access to SNA Server.
	
	Over time, a computer may stop responding (hang) if a process experiencing this
	problem is left running long enough to exhaust the system's memory resources.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	Security.dll creates a critical section when it attaches to a process that
	causes it to be loaded. This critical section is not deleted when Security.dll
	detaches from the process when it is unloaded, which causes the memory leak.
