-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you promote a new PDC on a network that routes only TCP/IP, browse lists
may no longer contain the names of all the computers and domains on the network.

CAUSE
=====

In network where only TCP/IP is routed, the primary domain controller (PDC) acts
as the domain master browser. The PDC is also be the master browser for its
subnet. Every other subnet (an independent broadcast region) has a separate
computer acting as the master browser.

Every 12 minutes, the master browser for each subnet:

- Sends a directed master browser announcement to the Domain Master Browser.

- Establishes a TCP/IP connection to the domain master browser, and pulls two
  browse lists from it. One is a list of all machines in the domain that are
  participating in browsing, and the other is a list of all domains that have
  been discovered.

Upon receiving the master browser announcement from a subnet master browser, the
PDC should establish a TCP connection to it and pull the updated browse lists
for that subnet. It should then merge those lists into the complete browse list,
which it maintains.

A timing condition exists in Windows NT 3.5 where the user-mode portion of the
browser code may not have an IRP posted to receive master browser announcements.
When this occurs, the domain master browser begins to drop master browser
announcements. This causes it to stop collecting browse lists from the subnet
master browsers. Computers on those subnets will age out of the master browse
list and no longer be visible in browse lists.


RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain an updated BROWSER.DLL file from Microsoft . The new BROWSER.DLL file
should be installed on any machine that may be promoted to PDC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the service pack release containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
