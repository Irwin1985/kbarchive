-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Mac OS (ALL) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, you can have
difficulty connecting to the Maildata share on the server and/or logging into
Mail. The error message displayed is:

  The Preference file could not be found. Where is your postoffice located?

CAUSE
=====

The following are possible causes of the above error:

1. The client is being launched for the first time, and the MS Mail/PC LANs
  Prefs cache file has not been created yet.

2. The client has lost its connection to the Maildata share, and the connection
  needs to be re-established.

3. The client's rights on the server are insufficient for it to function.

4. The MS Mail/PC LANs Prefs file is corrupt.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. The MS Mail/PC LANs Prefs cache file will be created when you launch the
  Macintosh client.

  a. Launch the Mail client. The following message will be displayed:

  The Preference file could not be found. Where is your postoffice created?"

  b. Select Find PO.

  c. In the Where is the Mail Data Folder? dialog box, select Desktop. Select
     the Maildata server share found on the Desktop.

  d. A new dialog box will be displayed, Select Postoffice [postoffice name]?.
     Select the OK button. Type your user and password information.

  e. Select the OK button. Mail will launch.

2. Verify that the PC Maildata share can be seen on the Macintosh Desktop. If
  you see the share icon, this confirms that the connection to the server has
  been made. However, if the PC Maildata share cannot be seen, perform the
  following steps to establish the connection:

  a. From the Apple menu, choose the Chooser. Then select AppleShare and the
     appropriate AppleTalk zone and Maildata server. Select the OK button.

  b. In the Connect to the File Server [server name] as: dialog box, select
     Registered User, and type the information for the name and password that
     will enable the workstation to login to the Maildata server. Select the OK
     button.

  c. In the Select Items You Want to Use: dialog box, select the Maildata
     share, and select the checkbox to enable the share to be opened at system
     startup.

  d. Accept the default of Save my Name Only, and select the OK button. The
     Maildata share icon should appear on the Desktop.

3. If the Maildata share is mounted on the Desktop, and the Macintosh client
  still cannot find the postoffice, verify that you have sufficient rights to
  connect to the Maildata share. You should have the following rights to the
  Maildata subdirectory on the Mail for PC Networks server:

  Network Operating System            Rights Required for Macintosh Users
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Windows NT                          Full Control
  LAN Manager                         All Permissions
  NetWare                             Read, Write, Create, Erase,
                                       Modify, and Filescan

4. If the PC Mail postoffice can be seen and the access rights have been
  verified, the MS Mail/PC LANs Prefs file may be corrupt.

  a. To create a new one, drag the MS Mail/PC LANs Prefs file that is located
     in the System Folder to the Trash.

  b. Launch the Mail client. The following message will be displayed:

  The Preference file could not be found. Where is your postoffice created?"

  c. Select Find PO.

  d. In the Where is the Mail Data Folder? dialog box, select Desktop. Select
     the Maildata server share found on the Desktop.

  e. A new dialog box will be displayed, Select Postoffice [postoffice name]?.
     Select the OK button. Type your user and password information.

  f. Select the OK button. Mail will launch.
