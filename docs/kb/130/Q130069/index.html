The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The "RPC Server is too busy..." message indicates that SERVICES.EXE or one of
its threads may have hung. A thread may remain in a blocking state and appear to
be hung if a resource is not available.

SERVICES.EXE is a process which functions as the service control manager. It also
runs a variety of Windows NT user mode functions as threads including server,
browsing, event log, and RPC services. The symptoms are typically returned by
workstations performing commands including net view, event log, and other
related RPC requests. Client RPC requests to the pipe \SRVSVC, will result in
Server Message Block (SMB) errors returned with STATUS_PIPE_NOT_AVAILABLE by the
server. If the failure involves a SERVICES.EXE access violation, a DRWTSN32.LOG
will be present in the %SYSTEMROOT% directory. Often, NET USE sessions provided
by the server remain active and new sessions can be established. The following
messages may be returned to client requests involving the RPC services:

  Error 1723: The RPC server is too busy to complete this operation.
  Error 1722: The RPC server is unavailable.
  Error 1721: Not enough resources are available to complete this operation.

CAUSE
=====

One possible cause of these symptoms involves the use of a 15 character
computername that is resolved through the Sockets interface to domain name
service (DNS). A parsing error can occur resulting in intermittent heap
corruption. If DNS resolution is configured through the Control Panel TCP/IP DNS
dialogue box, the computername may be resolved in this manner. The results of
the heap corruption are not predictable. However, an access violation in
SERVICES.EXE may result if a critical data structure is damaged. Also, the
server will only attempt to resolve the name in order to establish a session
with the computer in question. These operations may not occur frequently.
However, the computer browsing service, print services or messenger service may
initiate requests for such operations.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the new LMHSVC.DLL file.

LMHSVC.DLL has been modified so that the computer name is correctly parsed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
