SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines how you can restore, from tape, one computer profile onto
another computer. This procedure is intended for Intel-based (X86) computers.

The procedure can be used to transfer your basic operating system (OS)
configuration from an Intel 486 computer to an Intel Pentium computer. This
procedure assumes that the tape drives on the original and new computer have a
compatible tape format.

NOTE: Windows NT backup is intended to be used as a disaster recovery utility to
maintain your system by backing it up and restoring it to the SAME computer.
When you restore to a different computer you may encounter problems, due to
hardware differences between the two computers.

This is an unsupported use of Windows NT backup. Microsoft makes no warranty,
implied or otherwise, that it will restore your system correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the HDD controller (either IDE or SCSI) on the new computer is the same type
of controller used on the previous computer:

1. From the original computer, perform a backup of the complete OS and all other
  files that you wish to transfer.

  NOTE: If you are using Windows NT Backup, be sure you backup the registry
  (this requires administrator privileges).

2. Load Windows NT onto the new computer.

  Partition and drive information should be set up the same as the original
  computer. The partition sizes on the new computer should be at least as big
  as the partitions on the original computer.

3. Load the backup software for the tape drive that is attached to the new
  computer.

4. From tape, restore the complete OS and all necessary files into directories
  of the same name as the original computer. Be sure to restore the Registry.

5. Reboot the computer.

The original computers profile is now restored onto the new computer.

If the original computer has a SCSI controller and you want to restore Windows NT
onto a computer with a different SCSI controller:

1. Before you make your complete back up of the original computer, load the
  driver for the SCSI controller that is in the new computer.

2. Reboot the computer.

3. An error appears stating "One or more services failed to load." Continue.

4. Perform a back up of the complete OS and all other files that you wish to
  transfer.

5. Load Windows NT onto the new computer.

  Partition and drive information should be set up the same as the original
  computer. The partition sizes on the new computer should be at least as big
  as the partitions on the original computer.

6. Load the backup software for the tape drive that is attached to the new
  computer.

7. From tape, restore the complete OS and all necessary files into directories
  of the same name as the original computer. Be sure to restore the Registry.

8. Reboot the computer

9. An error appears stating "One or more services failed to load." Continue.

10. Remove or rename the SCSI controller driver that was in the original
  computer. All drivers are located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
  directory. Removing the old driver will keep the computer from showing the
  "One or more services failed to load" message at boot. You can also remove
  reference to the old driver from the Registry.

11. Reboot the computer

The original computers profile is now restored onto the new computer.

NOTE: Both example one and two are intended as a guide that will allow transfer
of the Windows NT OS from one similar computer to another. However, there may be
instances that this procedure will not work. If the new computer has additional
hardware that was not present in the original computer, it may be necessary to
install drivers before the additional hardware will function properly.
