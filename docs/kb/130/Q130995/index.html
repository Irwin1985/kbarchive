-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect over an existing Remote Access Service (RAS) link to a
remote resource you have access rights to, one of the following messages appears
after you enter the correct password (your RAS connection remains unaffected):

From File Manager:

  Stop. Access is denied.

From MS-DOS Command Prompt:

  System error 1326 has occurred.
  Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.

These symptoms occur after you call a RAS server from your RAS client and the RAS
server authenticates you successfully.

CAUSE
=====

Your local logon credentials differ from the remote domain credentials.

The RAS server does not log you on to the remote domain with your user account,
password, and domain credentials you enter in the RAS Authentication dialog box.
It only uses these credentials to verify that you have permission to physically
access the network as a dial-in client. To validate your access to protected
resources on the remote domain, the remote domain controller checks the
credentials you entered when you first logged on locally, not the RAS
Authentication dialog box credentials you entered just before calling the RAS
server.

Therefore, if your local logon credentials differ from the remote domain
credentials, you cannot access protected resources on the remote domain and one
of the messages above appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of these three solutions to gain access to your remote resources:

- Log on to the remote domain after you establish the RAS connection.

- Automatically log on remotely at Windows NT startup (before RAS link).

- Supply your remote credentials each time you connect to a remote share.

These solutions are explained below. They assume that the administrator of the
remote domain has previously granted you access rights to the share you are
trying to connect to.

Log On to the Remote Domain After You Establish the RAS Connection
------------------------------------------------------------------

Log off your local domain and log on to the remote domain by pressing
CTRL+ALT+DEL.

For this to work, the following actions must occur:

- The administrator of the remote domain needs to create a domain account for
  your computer.

- Your computer needs to join the remote domain. For instructions on how to
  join a remote domain over a RAS link, please see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q125856 Joining a Domain from a Windows NT Workstation Running RAS

NOTE: If the symptoms still occur, and you are sure you are supplying the correct
credentials, check with your network administrator to see whether you have
access permissions to the remote share.

Automatically Log on Remotely at Windows NT Startup (Before RAS Link)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You can avoid logging off and on again after each RAS connection. To do this, you
need to follow the requirements in the above section titled "Log On to the
Remote Domain After You Establish the RAS Connection." Then do one of the
following:

- Use your remote domain credentials when you are logging on during startup of
  Windows NT even though the RAS connection does not exist yet.

-or-

- For completely transparent local and remote access, make your local user
  account, password, and domain name credentials the same as your remote domain
  credentials.

  NOTE: Making the local domain name identical to the remote domain name is a
  security issue and may require reinstallation of Windows NT, depending on
  which version of Windows NT you are running. Check with your administrator
  regarding the security issue. Consult your Windows NT documentation regarding
  changing your domain name.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q126701 TITLE : RAS: Use Cached Credentials to Log On to a Different Domain

Supply Your Remote Credentials Each Time You Connect to a Remote Share
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If your computer is not part of the remote domain, or if you do not want to log
on to the remote domain by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, use one of the following
procedures to gain access to your remote resources. Depending on which of your
remote credentials differ from your local credentials, one of the following
solutions applies.

- When Only Your Passwords Differ:

  If only your passwords differ, enter your password for the remote domain when
  you are prompted for it.

  NOTE: If the symptoms still occur, but your passwords are the same on both
  domains, then you or your system logon cache must have supplied a different
  user name or domain name. For more information on supplying the correct
  credentials, read the information below.

- When Using File Manager and Your Domain Names or User Names Differ:

  Supply your remote domain credentials in the Connect As field in the File
  Manager Connect Network Drive dialog box. If your local domain name is
  different than the remote domain name, enter your credentials as follows:

  &lt;remote_domain_name&gt;\&lt;remote_user_name&gt;

  NOTE: If the remote domain name and local domain name are identical, then
  enter only your remote user name.

- When Using the NET USE Command:

  Supply your remote domain credentials with the /USER command switch of the NET
  USE command. For example:

  NET USE R: \\Finance\Data /USER:Corporate\FredMgr

  where Corporate is the remote domain name and FredMgr is the remote user name.
