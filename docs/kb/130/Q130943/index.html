-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows 95 includes the ability to act as a Novell NetWare server when you
install the Microsoft "File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks" service.
With this service installed, a Windows 95-based computer advertises itself on
the network in one of two ways:

- SAP Advertising (Service Advertising Protocol)

- Workgroup Advertising

By default, SAP advertising is disabled. Computers running Windows 95 with the
Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks can connect to a Windows 95- based
computer acting as a Novell NetWare server. However, Microsoft Windows NT and
real-mode NETX or VLM clients require you to enable SAP advertising to connect
to this server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SAP advertising is how Novell NetWare servers advertise their services (such as
file server and print server services). If SAP advertising is enabled, the
Microsoft "File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks" service advertises
like a Novell NetWare server by sending a broadcast every 60 seconds.

When a Novell NetWare client boots without a preferred NetWare server specified,
it sends a request for the nearest NetWare server (GetNearestServer). The
quickest NetWare server to respond is the one the client connects to. If SAP
advertising is enabled on the Windows 95-based computer acting as a NetWare
server, it may respond to this request before an actual NetWare server responds.
While the Windows 95 server is designed to respond slowly, it may respond
quicker than an actual NetWare server.

When the "File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks" service is enabled, two
new folders are created in the Windows folder: Nwsysvol and Login. The Login
folder contains Login.exe. If a computer starts without specifying a preferred
server and connects to a Windows 95 server, the Windows 95 server:

1. Makes an implicit connection to the NETX/VLM client and maps the first drive
  to sys:\login.

2. Connects to a true Novell NetWare server and sets this server as the primary
  and preferred server for the NETX/VLM client. The server it uses is based on
  the following (in order of preference):

   - Preferred server specified by the client with the "/ps=" or "Preferred
     server" setting in the Net.cfg file.

   - The pass-through server used by the Windows 95-based computer.

3. Login.exe performs a global logout, remaps, and starts the login process with
  the true NetWare server. There is a chain execution with Login.exe from the
  true NetWare server using identical parameters to finish the connection for
  the NETX/VLM client.

  If the pass-through server used by the "File and printer sharing for NetWare
  Networks" service does not have an account for you, enter

  login &lt;ServerName&gt;

  where &lt;ServerName&gt; is the name of a NetWare server on which you have an
  account. In normal circumstances, NETX/VLM clients should always specify a
  preferred server. The real-mode client does not detect any of these events,
  it just receives the login connection it wanted with a NetWare server, even
  though a Windows 95 server first answered its "GetNearestServer" broadcast.

Windows NT
----------

In order for Windows NT computers with Client Service for NetWare to be able to
connect to Windows 95-based computers acting as Novell NetWare servers, you must
enable SAP advertising.

To Enable SAP Advertising
-------------------------

To enable SAP advertising on a Windows 95-based computer, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
  Network.

2. On the Configuration tab, click "File and printer sharing for NetWare
  Networks", and then click Properties.

3. In the Property box, click SAP Advertising.

4. In the Value box, click Enabled, click OK and then click OK again.
