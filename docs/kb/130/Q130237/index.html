The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

READ NOLOCK is no longer required in Visual FoxPro version 3.0.

In version 2.x of FoxPro, all records involved in a read were automatically
locked when the record pointer was moved. This caused contention problems in a
multiuser situation. The most common symptom of contention problems was the
failure of a second user to be able to load a screen without getting a "Record
in use by another" error. To avoid problems, many developers chose to use READ
NOLOCK to prevent FoxPro from locking records automatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FoxPro Version 2.x Solution
-------------------------------

READ NOLOCK actually performed two separate functions:

- The record(s) involved in the read were not locked until the developer issued
  a SHOW GETS LOCK command.

- The fields on the screen were automatically disabled until the lock was
  obtained.

The Visual FoxPro Solution
--------------------------

Both functions can be duplicated through different commands in Visual FoxPro.

To prevent locking a record until edits begin, use buffering. If you want to lock
a record as soon as the edit starts, use pessimistic-row or pessimistic-table
buffering. If you want to lock a record only when a write is attempted, use
optimistic-row or optimistic-table buffering. You no longer need to place this
code in a command button on the form. Buffering is usually enabled through the
form's BUFFERMODE property, or through a CURSORSETPROP("Buffering") command
executed in the form's INIT method.

Buffering will not enable and disable fields in the same manner as a READ NOLOCK
command. The SETALL method can be used, however, to set the ENABLED property to
.T. or .F. as desired for all controls on a form. The following command disables
every control on a form named frmTEST:

     frmTEST.SETALL("ENABLED",.F.)

This code would typically be placed in the click event of a command button to
disable all fields when the record pointer was moved. The command button would
be disabled, along with all fields in the form.

Points to Consider
------------------

The examples in this article duplicate the functionality of one version 2.x
command (READ NOLOCK) with new version 3.0 commands. You can still use the READ
NOLOCK command in version 3.0; however, by continuing to use the version 2.x
READ commands, you are limiting the functionality of your application.

The READ NOLOCK command automatically disables every screen control tied directly
to a field in your .DBF, whether it was a GET field, a list box, check box, or
other control. Controls tied to a memory variable are not disabled. However, the
SETALL() method in Visual FoxPro disables all controls on the form, including
command buttons, whether they are tied to a field in your table or not. By using
this approach, you need to enable each command button you want to have active.

The opposite approach is to use the optional third parameter on the SETALL method
to disable only controls of a certain type, such as text boxes, or to disable
individual controls through the control's ENABLED property. You must prevent
Visual FoxPro from locking the record automatically by using optimistic
buffering in conjunction with disabling fields.

Before deciding which technique to use, determine the desired end result. If you
want to duplicate a version 2.x user interface using Visual FoxPro 3.0, use
optimistic buffering and enable and disable controls as required.

If you want to avoid the locking problems inherent in version 2.x, and it is
acceptable to have all fields enabled as the user enters the form, use
optimistic buffering alone.
