-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the SNA Server Windows 3.x client software is configured to use TCP/IP
sockets, Netware IPX/SPX, or Banyan IP (any client-server transport except named
pipes), the SNA client software (WNAP) uses a separate user login to the Windows
NT servers running SNA Server to ensure security is maintained. This article
describes ways to automate this client login process using SNA Server versions
2.1 and 2.11.

SNA Server 2.1
--------------

When you log into Windows NT Server using TCP/IP, Netware IPX/SPX or Banyan IP
from Windows 3.x clients, the two WNAP command lines noted below can be used to
remove the Domain Login dialog box when starting WNAP manually.

Add an icon in the Windows Startup group for WNAP.EXE (the SNA Windows 3.x client
process) that has the following command line option. This causes WNAP to start
automatically when Windows is started:

  "WNAP /USER: /PWD:" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: There must be no space after the semi-colon (:).

This command lets the user login to the Windows NT Server using the guest account
(provided that the guest account is enabled and has no password).


The next command requires that the user have a valid account in the Windows
NT/SNA Server domain:

  WNAP /USER:&lt;userid&gt; /PWD:&lt;password&gt;

SNA Server 2.11/3.x
-------------------

The following additional options are available under SNA 2.11 and 3.x:

1. The following two new options can be added to the [WNAP] section of the
  WIN.INI file:

  LogonUserName=&lt;USERID&gt;
  LogonPassword=&lt;PASSWORD&gt;

  WNAP will parse these entries and use them when a application is first
  started, reducing the need for starting WNAP manually with command line
  parameters.

  Also, to use the guest account using the parameters in WIN.INI, add the
  entries as such:

  "LogonUserName=guest
  LogonPassword=" (without the quotation marks)

  NOTE: There must be no space after the equals sigh (=).

2. Automated use of Windows for Workgroups 3.11 cached domain password.

If the above WIN.INI entries are not present on a Windows for Workgroups 3.11
client, and if the user is using the cached domain password feature of Windows
for Workgroups (enabled in the network Control Panel Startup dialog box by
selecting "Log On to Windows NT or LAN Manager Domain"), the user password is
automatically retrieved from Windows for Workgroups.


WNAP will start automatically when an SNA Server application (3270, 5250, or an
application written to the SNA Server APIs is started), or when Windows is
started (if a WNAP icon is added to the Startup group). If the cached domain
password method is used, WNAP retrieves the username when WNAP is started. If
the Windows for Workgroups user logs off and on, WNAP is still running under the
previous user context.

To resolve this problem, WNAP can be configured to terminate automatically when
the last SNA application ends by adding AutoTerminate=Yes to the [WNAP] section
of the WIN.INI file. By default, WNAP remains running even if the Windows for
Workgroups user logs off and then logs back on. The user should quite all SNA
applications before logging off in Windows for Workgroups. This ensures that
WNAP will quit so that it will be restarted again when the new Windows for
Workgroups user logs in and starts an SNA application.

To enable the AutoTerminate feature:

1. Add AutoTerminate=Yes to the [WNAP] section of the WIN.INI file.

2. Start WNAP automatically by starting an SNA application. If WNAP is started
  manually, WNAP will not unload, even if AutoTerminate is set to Yes.

With some emulators the WNAP will quit when the last connection is disconnected.
With other emulators you need to exit from the emulator. This behavior depends
on how the emulator is implemented. With the SNA Server applets the WNAP won't
unload before you exit from the applet.

Windows for Workgroups Domain Password Expiration
-------------------------------------------------

If the Windows for Workgroups user's domain password expires, or if user is
required to change their domain password on the next domain login attempt, the
SNA client login dialog will fail with Error 546. To solve this problem, the
Windows for Workgroups user must login and change their domain password first.
The user may then need to update their SNA client configuration to reflect their
new password. There is no additional user interaction required when using the
Windows for Workgroups cached domain password.
