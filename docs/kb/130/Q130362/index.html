SUMMARY
=======

The Hewlett-Packard (HP) JetAdmin service is an administrative tool you can use
to install and configure HP printers connected to a network using an HP
JetDirect print server. This article describes how to install and troubleshoot
the HP JetAdmin service.

Note that the HP JetAdmin service included with Windows 95 was written by
Hewlett-Packard. If you need further information about this service, please
contact Hewlett-Packard or consult the online Help system.


NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

  http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/cposupport /ccsearch/getdoc?doc=bpj05973

  or

  http://www.hp.com/cposupport/network ing/support_doc/bpj06765.html

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX based). For further
information see:

  http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/cposupport /ccsearch/getdoc?doc=bpj06723

  or

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installation
------------

Before you install the HP JetAdmin service, print a self-test page. Please see
the printer documentation for information about how to print a self- test page.

NOTE: Many external HP JetDirect devices have a Test Page button.

The test page contains two pertinent pieces of information:

- The firmware revision number. The firmware revision number for the JetDirect
  card must be 3.06a or higher to work with Windows 95. If the firmware
  revision number is not 3.06a or higher, contact Hewlett- Packard for an
  update.

- The network node address of the JetDirect card. 0800092AABFE is an example of
  a network node address.

To install the HP JetAdmin service, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double click the Network icon.

3. Click the Add button, double-click Service, click Hewlett-Packard, and then
  double-click the HP JetAdmin service you want to install.

  NOTE: If you use Direct mode, you must install the HP JetAdmin service on
  every computer that will print to the JetDirect printer. This mode is not
  recommended for large networks because only one workstation can print at a
  time.

4. Click OK and then restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.

  When Windows 95 restarts, an icon for the HP JetAdmin service appears in
  Control Panel and an HP Network Printers folder appears in Network
  Neighborhood.

5. Double-click the HP JetAdmin icon in Control Panel.

6. On the Printer menu, click New, and then follow the tips in the Network
  Browser window.

  If the JetDirect card has never been configured, its node address appears in
  the Unconfigured Printers list as the specific printer model that it is
  installed in or as Unknown Printer.

7. Type a name for the printer, and then click Continue.

8. Double-click the Network Neighborhood icon, and then double-click the
  HP_Network_Printers folder.

9. Double-click the printer icon and answer all the questions in the Printer
  Install Wizard to complete the installation.

NOTE: To print directly to a HP JetDirect printer, you must install the IPX/SPX
protocol in Windows 95. With this protocol installed, you can install support
for a HP JetDirect printer as if it were a networked printer. The port
designation is \\HP_Network_Printers\&lt;xxxxxx&gt;, as if it were a networked
printer.

If the Hewlett-Packard JetDirect services are not listed in the Select Network
Service dialog box, the driver information database may need to be rebuilt. The
primary .inf file used to install HP JetDirect is the Hpnetprn.inf file in the
Windows\Inf folder (in a local installation).

For information about rebuilding the driver information database, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q137377 Removing Drivers from Wizard Hardware Lists

  Q139206 Hardware List Not Updated After Installing New .inf File

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you cannot access the JetDirect printer, try the following steps:

1. Verify that you have network connectivity by connecting to other computers
  using Network Neighborhood.

  For more information about network troubleshooting, see the "If you have
  trouble using the network" topic in online Help.

2. Remove all networking components, restart your computer, and then reinstall
  the networking components (including the HP JetAdmin service).

3. Set the JetDirect card back to the factory default settings. For example, to
  set a JetDirect card in an HP 4 Plus printer to the factory default settings,
  press down and hold the Online button on the printer while you turn the
  printer on. For an external JetDirect device, press down and hold the Test
  Page button while you plug in the power cord.

  For additional information about setting a JetDirect device back to the
  factory default settings, please contact Hewlett-Packard.

4. After you reset the JetDirect card, double-click the HP JetAdmin icon in
  Control Panel, and then click New on the Printer menu. The JetDirect card's
  node address should appear in the Unconfigured Printers list.
