-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and you attempt to
switch between the Windows client and the Remote client, the System Selector may
fail with the following error:

  The mail driver could not be deactivated because the file
  C:\windows\system\xxxxxxxx.xxx could not be found.

where xxxxxxxx.xxx is one or more of the Mail client components referenced in the
following section of the FILES.INI file for the currently active client:

  [Transport]
  FILES=

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the file that the System Selector is attempting to
deactivate is in a directory other than WINDOWS\SYSTEM (typically in the WINDOWS
directory). The System Selector fails because the file is not at the expected
location.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you activate a Mail client with the System Selector, the mail client's DLLs
and other files are moved to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. The previously active
client's DLL and other files are moved to the WINDOWS\MSMAIL\PROVIDER
directory.

NOTE: The PROVIDER is a placeholder for the specific mail driver subdirectory
name. For example, the driver subdirectory for Microsoft Mail is
WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSMAIL.

For the System Selector to complete the procedure properly, Windows should be
invoked from the drive on which it is installed. If the client has invoked
Windows from a batch file that does not execute Windows from the local drive and
directory where Windows is installed, this procedure may fail. If a batch file
is being utilized to invoke Windows, the user should ensure that the batch file
makes this drive and directory active when executing WIN.COM.

For example, if the following batch file commands are executed to start Windows,
the System Selector may copy files to the WINDOWS directory instead of
WINDOWS\SYSTEM, which would result in the above stated error condition:

WRONG.BAT
---------

F:Login
C:\WINDOWS\WIN

The following batch file would execute the procedure correctly:

RIGHT.BAT
---------

F:Login
C:
CD WINDOWS
WIN
