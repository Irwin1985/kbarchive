SUMMARY
=======

This article covers:

- Hierarchical File System Specifications

- Determining Allocation Block Size

- Allocation Block Size Table

- HFS Volume Organization

- Decreasing The File Size On Large Hard Drives

This article also explains why different HFS structures on different hard drives
can cause small files to take up more space on a larger drive than they do on a
smaller drive.

Hierarchical File System Specifications
---------------------------------------

The following sections cover specifications and associated terminology used to
describe the Macintosh HFS structure. The following numbers apply to both System
6 and System 7.

Volume
------

A volume is either an entire disk, or a section of a disk, partitioned into
separate parts. If you partition a single drive then each partition is
considered a volume.

- The maximum volume size is 2 gigabytes. Under System 7.5, the maximum is 4
  gigabytes.

- The maximum number of volumes is limited only by the amount of available
  system memory.

- The maximum file size is 2 gigabytes.

- The maximum number of files on a volume is 65,536.

- The maximum number of files in a folder is 32,767.

- The maximum size of the data fork in a file is 2 gigabytes.

- The maximum size of the resource fork in a file is 16 megabytes.

Logical block
-------------

A logical block is a unit of drive space composed of up to 512 bytes. A logical
block is numbered from 0 to n, n being the last block on the volume (not
necessarily the last block on the hard disk). To figure out the number of
logical blocks, divide the volume size by 512 bytes.

Allocation block
----------------

An allocation block is a unit of storage on a volume, composed of one or more
logical blocks. The larger the volume, the more logical blocks comprise one
allocation block. The maximum number of allocation blocks per volume is 65,536;
most volumes have slightly less.

The size of your hard drive determines the minimum size of each file. In both the
Macintosh and MS-DOS environment, you can have up to 65,536 blocks on a drive
(because both operating systems address the allocation blocks with 16-bit
addressing). Drives larger than 512 megabytes cannot use 8K blocks because there
are not enough addresses. Thus, if a 2 gigabyte drive is one Macintosh
partition, the smallest file size allowed is 32K. If you save a TeachText file
with one character in it, it would take up 32K of disk space.

A non-empty file fork always occupies at least one allocation block, no matter
how many bytes of data the file fork contains. If the data fork and resource
fork of a file contain data, the file uses two allocation blocks. If all the
files are only one allocation block long, then there can be as many files on the
volume as there are allocation blocks for the volume. However, when a file is
longer than one allocation block, the total number of possible files decreases.
For example, on a volume with 65,535 allocations block, you can have:

  65,536 files, each one allocation block long.
  32,768 files, each two allocation blocks long.

   2,048 files, each 32 allocation blocks long.
   1,024 files, each 64 allocation blocks long.

All of the numbers above refer to the system's record structures. Other elements
place tighter restrictions on the actual number of usable files in the root
directory. The Standard File dialog uses the List Manager. The List Manager has
a limit of 32K of data, which is somewhere between 800 and 900 files. Though
more files can be handled in a directory, the List Manager will not display the
first 32K.

A second element concerns the performance of the Finder when you have
approximately 800 to 900 files per directory. Even simple operations, such as
moving the icon of a file, tend to slow down considerably when this many files
exist in a directory. This limitation changes depending on the speed of the
individual Macintosh model.

Determining Allocation Block Size
---------------------------------

To calculate the allocation block size:

1. Take the size of the drive in megabytes and multiply it by 2000. (There are
  2000 disk blocks in 1 megabyte of disk space).

2. Divide that number by 65,536. (Because the Macintosh cannot have more than
  65,536 allocation blocks).

3. Round this number up and multiply it by 512.

The result is the number of bytes in the allocation block. For example, if you do
the math with a 230 MB drive:

  230 x 2000 / 65536 = 7.019
  7.019 rounded up = 8
  8 x 512 = 4096 bytes

So larger hard drives mean larger allocation blocks, and consequently, more
wasted space for small files. If you have a large drive with a lot of small
files, the hard drive space is being used less efficiently than if most of your
files average 32K in size.

NOTE: Since drives come from different manufacturers, it is possible to get
different values. For example, 500 megabyte drive might be slightly larger than
500 megabytes. This would result in different logical block sizes than those
listed in the Allocation Block Size Table below. The difference is typically not
more than 512 bytes. The difference is most noticeable on the larger drives. For
example, a 500 megabyte drive has a logical block size of 8192 bytes. But the
500 MB drive in some Macintosh computers is actually 540 MB, which has a logical
block size of 8704.

Allocation Block Size Table
---------------------------

Here is a complete list of allocation block sizes for the various volume sizes,
based on the formula described above:

  Volume Size    Allocation Block Size       Minimum file size

HFS Volume Organization
-----------------------

The first two logical blocks (labeled 0 and 1) of a volume are the boot blocks.
This is where the information for mounting the volume is stored.

The third logical block (labeled 2) is the Master Directory Block, or MDB for
short. This block contains part of the data structure of a flat directory
volume. It contains the volume information and the volume allocation block map.
This block is where the information for the hard disk, such as number of files
in the directory and the last time the drive was initialized, is stored.

Logical blocks 3 to x (see the following table) contain the volume bitmap. This
block is a data structure containing a sequence of bits, one bit for each
allocation block. The volume bitmap stores a reference to every piece of data
that is in the allocation blocks and indicates whether the block is allocated or
free for use. Volume bitmaps exist both on hierarchical directory volumes and in
memory.

Volumes may have as few as 32,768 allocation blocks and as many as 65,536
allocation blocks. This table defines what logical block the volume bitmap ends
on based on the number of allocation blocks:

  Allocation Blocks            Last Volume Bitmap Logical Block
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  &gt; 61,440                     18
  &gt; 57,344                     17
  &gt; 53,248                     16
  &gt; 49,152                     15
  &gt; 45,056                     14
  &gt; 40,960                     13
  &gt; 36,864                     12
  &gt; 32,768                     11

Allocation blocks begin after the volume bitmap. The catalog, extents and data
files are contained in the allocation blocks.

The catalog file is a list of all files and folders stored in a volume. The
catalog file maintains the relationships between the files and directories on a
hierarchical directory volume. It corresponds to the file directory on a flat
directory volume. The catalog file is organized and accessed using a B-tree
structure. The files are arranged in alphabetical order evenly balanced on the
tree so that finding a Z does not take any longer than finding an A. This
structure is the glue that keeps the catalog file together. The extents tree
file contains the locations of all the files on a volume. (An extent is a series
of contiguous allocation blocks). The extents tree file is where the information
about the data files you have created is stored (such as where to find file, and
how many extents a file is divided into). Any file you create may be broken up
into multiple extents. The extents are linked together, behind the scenes, with
information from the extents tree file to give the appearance of one data file.

The next, and largest, section of the volume contains all the actual data files
and applications which are referenced using the above files.

The next to last block on the hard disk contains the alternate master directory.
This alternate is a backup to the MDB kept on logical block 2. It is used when
the file manager determines that the MDB is corrupt and needs to be rewritten
with the correct information.

The very last block is empty. It is used to check for bad sections of the hard
disk.

Decreasing The File Size On Large Hard Drives
---------------------------------------------

To decrease the file size on a large hard drive, partition larger drives into
smaller partitions or logical drives, each with a maximum of 65,536 blocks.
However, Apple does not offer a tool for creating multiple Macintosh partitions
for System 7.1. Future versions of the operating system and HD SC Setup will
support smaller file sizes on larger hard drives.

The following third-party utilities offer a solution for creating multiple
Macintosh partitions:

- Hard Disk Toolkit (HDT) by FWB Software, Inc.

- SilverLining by LaCie Ltd.

- Micronet Utility by MicroNet Technology

- MicroTech Utility by MicroTech International

- Drive 7 by Casa Blanca Works, Inc.
