SUMMARY
=======

The Data Outline control included with the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
version 2.0 and 7.0 is not included with the Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools. However, you can obtain version 1.2 of the Data Outline ActiveX
control for Microsoft Access 97 free from Microsoft's download services.

This article discusses the following topics related to using version 1.2 of the
Data Outline control:

- When to Use the Data Outline Control
- Getting help with the Data Outline Control
- Distributing the Data Outline Control with Run-Time Applications

For information about obtaining version 1.2 of the Data Outline ActiveX control,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q162359 ACC97: Access 97 Data Outline ActiveX Control Available in Download
  Center

MORE INFORMATION
================

When to Use the Data Outline Control
------------------------------------

Version 1.2 of the Data Outline control is the same as version 1.1 of the Data
Outline control, which is included with the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
version 7.0. The only difference between the two controls is that version 1.2
has been modified for use in a Microsoft Access 97 database. There are no
feature enhancements or fixes included with the new control.

Version 1.2 of the Data Outline control was created to make it easier for you to
upgrade databases in Microsoft Access 97 that contain the Data Outline control.
Although you can add the new Data Outline control to a form in Microsoft Access
97, consider using another control, such as the TreeView control, for any new
development. Microsoft Access will not provide an updated Data Outline control
for future releases.

For information about migrating to the TreeView control from the Data Outline
control, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q162523 ACC97: Migrating from Data Outline Control to TreeView Control

Getting Help With the Data Outline Control
------------------------------------------

Version 1.2 of the Data Outline ActiveX control is provided, as is, from
Microsoft's download services; Microsoft Product Support Services does not
provide assistance beyond helping you to install the updated control. However,
there are other sources of help for using the Data Outline control:

- The Msdboutl.hlp Help file included with the Microsoft Access Developer's
  Toolkit version 7.0 contains information about version 1.1 of the Data
  Outline control, its properties and methods. Because version 1.2 of the Data
  Outline Control is the same control updated for Microsoft Access 97, the
  Msdboutl.hlp Help file applies to it as well.

- When you download the new control, it includes a sample database called
  Outlin97.mdb. This is a Microsoft Access 97 database containing sample forms
  that use version 1.2 of the Data Outline Control in different ways. You can
  study the design of those forms to see how to use the control in your
  database.

  NOTE: Outlin97.mdb contains tables linked to the Northwind sample database.
  You must have Northwind.mdb on your hard drive to use Outlin97.mdb. If
  Northwind.mdb is in a folder other than the default Samples folder on your
  computer, you may receive the following error when you open Outlin97.mdb:

  You can't run Outline.MDB until you locate Northwind.mdb

  If that happens, open the database again while holding down the SHIFT key to
  disable the AutoExec macro. Delete the following linked tables, and manually
  link them with the tables in your Microsoft Access 97 copy of the Northwind
  sample database:

     Customers
     Employees
     Order Details
     Orders
     Products
     Shippers
     Suppliers

- If you have the Control Wizards button clicked on the toolbar when you add
  the new Data Outline Control to a form in Design view, the Data Outline
  Control Wizard helps to guide you through creating the levels in the control.

Distributing the Data Outline Control with Run-Time Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------

When you download version 1.2 of the Data Outline control, the compressed file
contains updated support files that you need to include when you distribute a
run-time application using the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition (ODE).

When you add version 1.2 of the Data Outline control (Msdbout2.ocx) to the List
of Files box in the ODE Setup Wizard, you receive the following message:

  The Setup Wizard could not find the Dependency (.DEP) file for the
  ActiveX control 'msdbout2.ocx'. If this control requires additional
  files to be installed, the control may not register or function
  properly.

Be sure you also add the following support files to the List Of Files box to
distribute with your run-time application:

  Mfc40.dll
  Msvcirt.dll
  Msvcrt40.dll
