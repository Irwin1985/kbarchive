SUMMARY
=======

DLLSKEL is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that contains the source code
for a minimal dynamic-link library (DLL) for the Windows environment. DLLSKEL
demonstrates how to correctly implement and compile a multiple-segment DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This sample has two parts: the multiple-segment DLL and an application for the
Windows environment. The application has all the features of the Generic sample
application provided with the Windows Software Development Kit and a menu item
that calls a function exported from the DLL. The DLL function creates a message
box when it is called by the application.

The DLLSKEL sample demonstrates implicitly loading a DLL. However, the
modifications required to explicitly load the DLL are straightforward.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Dllskel.EXE

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To properly implement a DLL, one must consider several program details. DLLSKEL
demonstrates how to address all these details to create a simple DLL.

In the DLLSKEL sample, the DLL has multiple code segments. The Windows exit
procedure (WEP) is placed in a fixed segment while the remainder of the code is
placed in movable, discardable segments. The WEP must reside in a fixed code
segment so that it can be called at all times, even when the system has very
little free memory. Consider the situation in which Windows has discarded the
segment containing the WEP. When Windows calls the WEP, the segment must be
loaded back into the system and all relocations to other segments must be fixed
up, which might require other segments to be loaded. If the system does not have
enough memory to load all the required segments, or if some of the segments no
longer exist, Windows will report an unrecoverable application error (UAE) or
general protection (GP) fault because it cannot completely load the segment
containing the WEP. If the WEP is placed in a fixed code segment, the
relocations are fixed up only once, which completely avoids this situation.

The WEP was originally designed to allow a DLL that hooked an interrupt to unhook
it before termination, not to provide a general-purpose cleanup procedure for a
DLL. Under Windows 3.0, the WEP is called on a very small stack located in the
Windows Kernel, which will overflow if the WEP calls Windows functions. There is
enough room to unhook an interrupt, however. Under Windows 3.1, the WEP is
called on a 4K stack in the Windows Kernel, which provides enough room to call
Windows functions and to perform general DLL cleanup. Because the WEP is called
only once during the lifetime of a DLL, it cannot be used to clean up each
application instance that uses the DLL. Under Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, if a
DLL requires each application instance to call a cleanup routine, the DLL must
explicitly provide the routine, which each application instance must explicitly
call.

An implicitly loaded DLL is loaded into memory before the calling application is
completely loaded. Therefore, the LibMain() function, which is analogous to an
application's WinMain() function, will be called before the application's
message queue is initialized. Therefore, the DLL must not call functions that
send messages to the application in LibMain(). Similarly, an implicitly loaded
DLL is terminated after the calling application has been removed from memory.
Therefore, nothing in the WEP must require the application to exist.

The LoadLibrary() function loads a DLL explicitly; the FreeLibrary() function
unloads a DLL. To modify DLLSKEL to explicitly load and free the DLL:

1. Call the LoadLibrary() function to load the DLL. Save the library module
  handle.

2. Call the GetProcAddress() function, specifying the library module handle and
  the name of the function, to retrieve the pointer to the DLL function.

3. Call the FreeLibrary() function to free the DLL.

4. Modify the makefile to remove the call to IMPLIB and remove DLLSKEL.LIB from
  the linker command line.
