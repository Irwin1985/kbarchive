SUMMARY
=======

Termwait.exe is a self-extracting file in the Microsoft Download Center that
demonstrates how an application can launch a child task and then wait for it to
complete before executing specific code. Termwait.exe uses notification messages
from the Toolhelp dynamic-link library (DLL) to determine that the child task
has completed. The techniques demonstrated by the Termwait.exe sample work for
both Windows and MS-DOS (non-Windows) child tasks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The Termwait.exe sample application calls the NotifyRegister() function to
install a notification callback function before it calls the WinExec() function
to launch the child task. If a callback function is registered, it is called
before any task in the system terminates. The notification callback function
calls the TaskFindHandle() function to fill a TASKENTRY data structure with
information about the terminating task. When the callback determines that the
child task has terminated, it notifies the Termwait.exe application.

When it spawns the child task, Termwait.exe sets its bChildIsExecuting global
variable to TRUE. The notification callback resets this variable to FALSE when
the child task is complete. Any code that must not execute while the child task
is running can query the value of the bChildIsExecuting flag. During the wait,
any menu selections that will cause reentrancy problems should be disabled.
Doing so keeps the user informed about the options that are presently valid. In
the TERMWAIT sample, the AfterChildHasTerminated() function contains code that
is executed only after the child task has completed.

If an application tracks a number of child tasks, its NotifyRegister() callback
function should process both the NFY_STARTTASK and NFY_EXITTASK notifications.
The callback function uses these notifications to maintain a list of child task
handles. Note that while no two tasks will have the same handle, it is possible
for task handles to be reused. Consequently, if one task ends and a new task
begins, the new task can use the same task handle.

Version 3.1 of the Windows SDK is required to build the Termwait.exe sample.
However, the compiled code is compatible with both Windows 3.0 and 3.1. Note
that because the TOOLHELP.DLL is not part of the default installation for
Windows 3.0, it must be installed into the Windows system directory (by default,
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM) before Termwait.exe will run. The TOOLHELP.DLL file is
provided as a redistributable file with the Windows 3.1 SDK.

NOTE: The NotifyRegister callback function must be placed in a separate source
file and this file must be compiled with /GA/GEa. This is because the
NotifyRegisterCallback function is called with the Data Segment (DS) of the task
that installed the callback and the Stack egment of the task which is notifying
the callback. So SS != DS and /GA/GEs cannot be used to compile this file.
