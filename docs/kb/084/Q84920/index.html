-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When upgrading a shared network installation (using the SETUP /N command) from
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 to Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the Windows 3.0
files contained in the shared directory must be removed completely and replaced
with files from Windows 3.1 before performing the upgrade for the Windows user
directories.

The Windows 3.1 SETUP /N command can only be used to upgrade Windows 3.0 user
directories if the directories were originally created using the SETUP /N
command from the Windows 3.0 program.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the following steps to correctly upgrade a Windows 3.0 shared network to
Windows 3.1:

1. All users on the network exit from Windows.

2. Log onto the network as supervisor.

3. Remove all the read-only attributes on the Windows 3.0 files in the shared
  directory using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command or Novell FLAG command. (The shared
  directory was created using steps 1-9 on page 553 of the "Microsoft Windows
  User's Guide" for version 3.0, and should contain between 282-286 files.)

  From the Windows Shared Directory MS-DOS Prompt, type the following command:

  attrib -r *.*

  -or-

  flag *.* rw

  Note: The flag *.* rw command is for Novell users only.

4. If no third-party applications, DLLs, or drivers have been installed (for
  example PC Tools, Norton Desktop, drivers from OEMs or the SDL), and their
  files do not reside in the same shared directory as Windows 3.0:

  a. Delete the Windows 3.0 files.

     -or-

  b. Move the Windows 3.0 files to a new location. (If these files are moved,
     make sure they are not placed in a directory that is in the path or on a
     Novell search drive.)

  If ANY third-party applications, DLLs or drivers have been installed (PC
  Tools, Norton Desktop, drivers from OEMs or the SDL) and their files reside
  in the same shared directory, perform the following procedure to remove only
  those files that were provided by Windows 3.0:

  a. Place the Windows 3.0 Disk 1 in a floppy drive.

  b. Make the floppy drive the current MS-DOS drive.

  c. At the floppy drive MS-DOS command line, enter the following MS-DOS
     command

  FOR %A IN (*.*) DO DEL x:\path\%A

     where "x:\path" is the network drive and path to the Windows 3.0 shared
     directory.

  d. Repeat steps a-c above for each of the original Windows 3.0 floppy disks.

  NOTE: In a small number of cases, third-party display drivers will either be
  using the 386grabber (*.gr3) and 286grabber (*.gr2) files supplied by Windows
  3.0 or replacing the Windows 3.0 grabber files with their own and using the
  same filename. In these cases, Windows 3.1 Setup will not update the
  SYSTEM.INI file for the Windows 3.1 grabber files (*.3gr and *.2gr) and you
  will get errors upon loading Windows 3.1 after upgrading the user if you
  delete these files. To be absolutely safe, copy the *.gr2 and *.gr3 files in
  the shared Windows directory to a floppy or separate directory before
  performing the above procedure, and copy them back if needed.

5. Follow the instruction on page 9 of the "Microsoft Windows Getting Started"
  guide for version 3.1 to place the Windows 3.1 files into a clean Windows
  shared directory by executing the following command:

  SETUP /A

  NOTE: If you have a network requiring a workstation driver update for Windows
  3.1, you may want to upgrade the workstation network software before
  completing the next step. For example, Novell users should update the IPX to
  3.1 and NETX to 3.26 or IPXODI to 1.2 and LSL to 1.21.

6. Have each user follow the instructions on page 8 of the "Microsoft Windows
  Getting Started" guide for version 3.1 to upgrade the Windows user files to
  Windows 3.1. When prompted for the directory to install to, specify the
  location of the existing Windows 3.0 user directory. (User directories
  generally have less than 20 files in them and do not have a subdirectory
  called SYSTEM.) This will upgrade all necessary files and Windows 3.1 will
  now be operational.

For additional information on setting up Windows on a network, see pages 6-9 of
the "Microsoft Windows Getting Started" guide for version 3.1, pages 71-74 of
the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit," and the NETWORKS.WRI file in the Windows
3.1 directory.
