-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows MIDI Mapper provides a way for users to customize MIDI setups
to meet the special needs of their MIDI systems. For proper MIDI file playing,
you must have the correct MIDI setup selected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MIDI files played with the Media Player (MPLAYER.EXE) application supplied with
Windows 3.1 are played according to the configuration of the current MIDI setup,
NOT the current value of the patch maps or key maps that appear in the Names
box.

The patch maps and key maps that are used are specified within each MIDI setup.
Changing the current patch map setting that is visible from the MIDI Mapper Show
Patch Maps option in the Name box will not affect the patch map that is used by
the Media Player unless the current MIDI setup uses that patch map. The same
functionality applies to the Key Maps setting of the Show option of the MIDI
Mapper.

If Media Player is not playing MIDI files correctly, the current MIDI setup may
need to be changed or a custom (new) MIDI setup may need to be created for the
system.

Use the information below to determine if a suitable MIDI map exists for the
system, or to create a new MIDI map.

Determining the Current MIDI Setup
----------------------------------

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Run the MIDI Mapper application. If the MIDI Mapper icon is not present, this
  indicates that no MIDI-compatible driver is installed. Before proceeding, you
  must correct this problem by installing a MIDI-compatible driver using the
  Drivers application within the Control Panel.

3. After the MIDI Mapper starts, change to Show Setups by pressing ALT+S. The
  current MIDI Mapper setup will be displayed in the Name box.

Components of a MIDI Map
------------------------

A MIDI map is composed of four components:

1. Dest Chan (Destination Channel): The channel used by the synthesizer to play
  the sounds on the source channel.

2. Port Name: The MIDI output port that the sounds on the source channel are
  sent to or played on. A correct value in this box is key to producing desired
  results. Determining the correct port name is discussed later in this
  article.

3. Patch Map Name: The name of the patch map to be used with the source channel.
  Patch maps are used to define which instruments are to be used with the MIDI
  device. Different patch maps can be assigned for each channel through this
  field.

4. Active: Determines if MIDI information from the source channel is sent to the
  port.

Choosing Which Channels to Configure
------------------------------------

A few general guidelines are offered below. Consult the sound card manufacturer
to determine which channels the sound card supports if MIDI files do not sound
correct when used according to the guidelines below.

FM Synthesizers will work best with the last four channels, 13-16. Common sound
cards in this category are the Media Vision Thunder Board and the Sound Blaster
I and II cards.

MIDI cards with genuine synthesizers (based on actual sampled sounds) will work
best with the first ten channels, 1-10. Common sound cards in this category are
the Roland LAPC-1, Roland Sound Canvas, and Turtle Beach MultiSound card.

Examining MIDI Port Settings of a MIDI Map
------------------------------------------

The proper port should be verified for each channel supported by the MIDI device.
If no sounds are played from Media Player with MIDI files, check the port
settings of the MIDI map very carefully. Many sound cards have multiple ports
and the correct one should be chosen.

For example, the Media Vision Pro AudioSpectrum card supports two MIDI ports: one
for connecting an external MIDI connector box through a 15-pin connector, the
other for an internal FM synthesizer.

When editing a MIDI map, view the port settings supported by the synthesizer by
highlighting the Port Name box and examining the list box (press ALT+DOWN
ARROW). This reveals the port options for the Pro AudioSpectrum card:

  Pro Audio MIDI Output
  Media Vision FM Synth

In this case, the Pro Audio MIDI Output option is the external MIDI port, and the
Media Vision FM Synth option is for the built-in MIDI synthesizer connected to
the same speakers that generate output for .WAV files.

If nothing is connected to the external MIDI port, no MIDI sounds will play if
this port is selected. If .WAV files can play (startup sounds, and so on), then
an internal synthesizer should be able to be selected if the card supports
MIDI.

Problems Playing Certain MIDI Files
-----------------------------------

Not all MIDI files are the same. Depending on how the MIDI file was authored or
created, the MIDI file might contain MIDI information on channels other than
those supported by the MIDI device. Usually a MIDI file will contain data on
channels 1-10 or 13-16. If no output is produced, create a MIDI map that uses
all channels. (The MIDI file supplied with Windows 3.1, CANYON.MID, contains
MIDI information on all channels.)

For more information, see pages 185-198 in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide"
version 3.1 manual.
