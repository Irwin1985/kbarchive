The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows has more than one password for
each user. These passwords have different functions and may not necessarily be
the same word.

There is no function within Mail Remote for Windows to keep the passwords the
same. This is due to different password requirements for different mail systems
you might be accessing with Mail Remote for Windows.

There is more help about password management in the online (MSRMT.HLP) and
offline (RMTPSS.HLP) Help files that are included with Mail Remote for Windows.

NOTE: The first password you are prompted for when you launch Mail Remote for
Windows is usually the password for accessing your mail message store (the .MMF
file, MSMAIL.MMF, by default). However, this is totally dependent upon the
current driver for Mail Remote for Windows. You can change drivers for Mail
Remote for Windows by running the Microsoft Mail System Selector.

Generally, there are two passwords associated with each driver. The first
password is for access to your local .MMF message file. There is usually another
password for accessing the remote mail host. There might also be secondary
passwords for some mail systems, such as AT&amp;T EasyLink.

For example, if you have the Mail Remote driver loaded, when you start Mail
Remote for Windows, you are prompted for a Login password. This provides access
to your local MSMAIL.MMF file. You can change this when Mail Remote for Windows
is running by choosing Change Password from the Mail menu.

When you dial in to your postoffice for messages, there is a dial-in access
password assigned to your postoffice by your mail administrator. To change this
password, choose Communications from the Mail menu, then choose Dialin
Password.

NOTE: Do not change host-access passwords until you have confirmed the new
password with your mail system administrator. You will not be able to send or
receive mail from that host system unless you are using the correct password.
