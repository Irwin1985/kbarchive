MORE INFORMATION
================

LAYOUTS.WRI Lists Wrong Size for MONOUMB2.386
---------------------------------------------

The LAYOUTS.WRI file included with the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for
version 3.1 incorrectly lists the expanded size for MONOUMB2.386. The listed
size is 46161 bytes.

The actual size of the expanded MONOUMB2.386 file is 4745 bytes.

LAYOUTS.WRI Lists Wrong Size for UNIDRV.DLL
-------------------------------------------

The LAYOUTS.WRI file included with the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for
version 3.1 incorrectly lists the expanded file size for UNIDRV.DLL. The listed
size is 119008 bytes.

The actual size of the UNIDRV.DLL file included with the original WRK is 119296
bytes, and the file date is 3/10/92.

NOTE: The UNIDRV.DLL file is occasionally updated and the file size and date may
change.

For more information about this driver, query the following in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  unidrv.dll and windows and update

PRINTERS.WRI Incorrectly References Minoutlineppem
--------------------------------------------------

Section 4.5 of the PRINTERS.WRI file included with Microsoft Windows 3.1 and with
the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for version 3.1 incorrectly spells the
WIN.INI PostScript setting "minoutlineppem."

Section 4.5, "Controlling TrueType Font Downloading on PostScript Printers,"
references the following WIN.INI setting:

       minoutlineeppem=&lt;number&gt;

This is spelled incorrectly. It should be spelled as follows

       minoutlineppem=&lt;number&gt;

where &lt;number&gt; refers to points per em space (an em space is a unit of
measurement where the width of the space is about as wide as it is tall).

Using the incorrect spelling results in Windows using the default value of 101
points per em space.

NOTE: If you change the minoutlineppem setting, you must exit and restart Windows
for the changes to take effect.

Additional information on the minoutlineppem setting can be found by querying on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  postscript and minoutlineppem and win.ini

Page 12 Incorrectly States T3100/20 Laptop Requires Updated BIOS
----------------------------------------------------------------

Page 12 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1
incorrectly states that BIOS version 4.2 or later is necessary for the T3100/20
laptop computer to run Windows.

The T3100/20 works with Windows 3.0 with a BIOS of 2.01, provided CGA is selected
as the display.

For more information about this model, query on the following keywords:

  toshiba and bios and t3100

Page 12 Incorrectly States Which Phoenix ROM BIOS Needs Update
--------------------------------------------------------------

Chart 1.4 on page 12 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 states:

  According to Phoenix, any BIOS dated earlier than 1988 should be upgraded.
  There are several OEM versions of Phoenix BIOS that cause problems. Contact
  the computer manufacturer for more information.

The information above should state:

  "...any BIOS dated 1988 and earlier should be upgraded."


Page 12 Incorrectly States Information Regarding AMI BIOS
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 12, chart 1.4, incorrectly states the following in the AMI BIOS box:

  1989 - Causes intermittent UAEs and system hangs.

  1991 - Serial port problems. Most often seen as mouse and modem
  problems.

The 1989 BIOS description should read as follows:

  1989 - On a computer with an IDE hard disk, you may experience intermittent
  unrecoverable application errors (UAEs) or general protection (GP) faults,
  and the system consequently hangs.

The 1991 BIOS description should not be included because AMI has confirmed that
this information is erroneous.

Page 17 Flowchart Incorrectly States SMARTDrive Cache Parameter
---------------------------------------------------------------

Page 17, chart 1.8, of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 states the following in the fifth flowchart step:

  Note: The SMARTDrive command line can be edited to allow caching of "stacked"
  volumes by adding a +&lt;drive&gt; (where &lt;drive&gt; is a "stacked"
  volume). If caching...

The +&lt;drive&gt; parameter is incorrect. The correct command line syntax to
turn on the SMARTDrive disk cache is as follows:

  C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE &lt;drive&gt;+

SMARTDrive automatically detects the existence of Stacker and caches the
underlying Stacker drive. SMARTDrive should not be used to cache a Stacker
volume. Typing "smartdrv /?" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command
prompt lists the command line parameters for SMARTDrive with their meanings.

Page 21 Flowchart Incorrectly Uses LANMAN10.DOS for LANMAN10.386
----------------------------------------------------------------

The flowchart on page 21 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for
Windows 3.1 incorrectly uses the term LANMAN10.DOS where LANMAN10.386 is
intended.

Page 23 IRQ Line in SYSTEM.INI Referenced Incorrectly
-----------------------------------------------------

In Flowchart 2.5 B on page 23 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide
for Windows 3.1, the following line is incorrect:

  Leave the IRQ9=Global line in the SYSTEM.INI.

The line should read:

  Leave the IRQ9Global=Yes line in the SYSTEM.INI file.

Page 30 Flowchart Shows Incorrect Directory for TESTPS.TXT
----------------------------------------------------------

The "Cannot Print on Stand-Alone PC" flowchart (4.1) on page 30 of the "Microsoft
Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1 suggests that you copy the
TESTPS.TXT file from the Windows directory to the PostScript printer if you have
a PostScript printer.

The TESTPS.TXT file is located in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, not the
Windows directory.

Page 78 Incorrectly States .SHH File Prompts for Directory
----------------------------------------------------------

Page 78 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" guide for Windows 3.1 states that
if the [windir] section of the SETUP.SHH file is left blank, Windows Setup
prompts you for a directory. This information is incorrect.

If the directory is not specified in the [windir] section, the dialog box never
appears, and Windows installs to the default directory WINDOWS.

The system settings template file, SETUP.SHH, that comes with Windows is used to
create a custom system settings file. This file is used in conjunction with the
SETUP /H:&lt;filespec&gt; option (where &lt;filespec&gt; is SETUP.SHH with its
fully qualified path if SETUP.SHH does not exist in the Windows directory). The
[windir] section is used to specify the directory where the user files are
installed.

To work around this situation:

1. Add the line "C:\*" (without the quotation marks) to the [windir] section of
  SETUP.SHH:

        [windir]
        C:\*

  C:\* is an invalid directory, and this entry forces Setup to prompt you for a
  valid directory.

2. Run Setup. Setup displays a red warning box that states that an error has
  occurred and asks you to press ENTER to continue or press F3 to exit.

3. Press ENTER. The next screen prompts you for the correct directory.

4. Type the name of the directory where you want to install the Windows user
  files and press ENTER.

Page 131 Incorrectly States SETUP /N Creates Directories
--------------------------------------------------------

When you initiate a network setup (using the SETUP /N command) for Windows 3.1,
you should be able to create directories and copy files to them by modifying the
SETUP.INF file.

The "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1 documents this
procedure on page 131; however, this procedure does not create the directory.

If you follow the example listed in the WRK guide, SETUP /N should create the
APPDIR directory within the Windows user directory and copy the files in the
[custom.apps] section. However, this directory is never created and Setup copies
the files to the Windows user directory before completing the installation.

To create the APPDIR directory, use the MS-DOS MD (MAKE DIRECTORY) command.

Page 143 Incorrectly Lists Sound Blaster Driver Versions
--------------------------------------------------------

Page 143 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1
incorrectly states the association of Sound Blaster drivers and versions as
follows:

  SNDBLST.DRV=SoundBlaster 1.5 DSP driver
  SNDBLST2.DRV=SoundBlaster 2.0 DSP driver

The correct associations are:

  SNDBLST.DRV=SoundBlaster 1.0 DSP driver (for a Sound Blaster version 1.0 card
  or a version 1.5 card with an old DSP 1.05 chip)

  SNDBLST2.DRV=SoundBlaster 1.5 DSP driver (for a Sound Blaster version 1.5 card
  with a DSP 2.0 chip, or a version 2.0 card [this is the Sound Blaster Pro])

With the Sound Blaster Pro card (these have DSP versions 3.x), you can use
SNDBLST2.DRV; however, Windows may display a warning message when setting the
port and IRQ, indicating that new drivers are needed from the manufacturer.

These drivers are available from Creative Labs Technical Support.

For more information, query on the following words:

  dsp and specific and soundblaster

Page 172 Incorrectly Lists iNegCurr= Value
------------------------------------------

Page 172 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1
lists an incorrect value for the iNegCurr= entry in the [intl] section of the
WIN.INI file. The Windows Resource Kit (WRK) lists both "($1)" and "$ 1-" as
having the iNegCurr value of 0. The value for "$ 1-" is incorrect. The correct
value for "$ 1-" is 10.

The [intl] section of the WIN.INI file describes how to display dates, times,
currency amounts, and other items for countries around the world. The default
values reflect U.S. options.

The iNegCurr entry indicates the format to use for negative values for currency.
This entry can be changed by choosing the International icon from Control Panel,
and using the Currency Format option.

Valid entries for the iNegCurr= entry are:

  Value    Format
  ---------------

  0        ($1)
  1        -$1
  2        $-1
  3        $1-
  4        (1$)
  5        -1$
  6        1-$
  7        1$-
  8        -1 $
  9        -$ 1
  10        $ 1-

For example, the entry iNegCurr=5 would cause a negative currency value to be
displayed in the format "-1$."

Page 176 Incorrectly Documents TTIfCollisions=
----------------------------------------------

Page 176 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1
incorrectly documents the TTIfCollisions= entry of the [TRUETYPE] section of the
WIN.INI file. The same error occurs in the WININI.WRI file.

Both page 176 and WININI.WRI state the following about the TTIfCollisions= entry
in the WIN.INI file:

  If you set this value to 0, Windows will use the TrueType version.

The correct statement should be:

  If you set this value to 1, Windows will use the TrueType version.

The TTIfCollisions= entry specifies whether to use TrueType fonts in place of
other fonts if both types of fonts are installed on the system and have the same
font name.

Page 196 Incorrectly Indicates COMxFIFO is Boolean Aware
--------------------------------------------------------

Page 196 of the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1
incorrectly identifies On/Off as functioning with the COMxFIFO switch. The
SYSINI.WRI file included with the WRK also incorrectly identifies TRUE/FALSE as
functioning with this switch.

The SYSTEM.INI's [386Enh] setting COMxFIFO= is not fully Boolean aware. It can be
set to either 0 for off or 1 for on, but does not correctly understand
True/False, On/Off, Yes/No.

COMxFIFO=1 and COMxFIFO=0 are the usable switches (where "x" is the
communications port).

For more information about this setting, query on:

  commq&amp;a and windows 3.1

Page 196 Incorrectly Documents COMMdrv30= as COMdrv30=
------------------------------------------------------

The "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" (WRK) guide for Windows 3.1 incorrectly
documents the SYSTEM.INI [386Enh] switch for using the Windows 3.0
communications driver on page 196. The WRK incorrectly spells the switch as
COMdrv30=. The correct spelling of this switch is COMMdrv30=.

This error also exists in the WRK's version of the SYSINI.WRI dated 4/6/92.

  COMMdrv30=&lt;Boolean&gt;

This switch should be set for Yes or True, if you are:

- Using the COMM.DRV driver that came with Windows 3.0

  -or-

- Using a third-party driver compatible with the Windows 3.0 communication
  driver, but not with Windows 3.1's driver. When set to True or Yes, the
  Virtual COM Driver (VCD) will use its own copy of the serial communications
  driver's interrupt handler. By default, this line does not exist, which is
  the same as saying COMMdrv30=False or No.
