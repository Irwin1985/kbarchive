SUMMARY
=======

An ODBC application can call SQLGetInfo() with an fInfoType of
SQL_ACTIVE_STATEMENTS to determine the number of active statement handles that
an ODBC driver can support on a connection. This article explains how the
concept of 'active statement' is far removed from the states of statement
handles in an ODBC State Transition table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An ODBC application may be written such that one statement handle (hstmt) on a
connection (hdbc) is used to fetch data from the back end, and a second hstmt
within the same hdbc is used simultaneously for other tasks, such as generating
updates. But an application must not assume that the driver will support such
behavior from the application. The application must first call SQLGetInfo with
the fInfoType of SQL_ACTIVE_STATEMENTS to see if multiple active hstmts are
supported. In ODBC, an hstmt is defined as active if it has results pending. The
term 'results' means rows from a select or the number of rows affected by an
insert, update or delete operation (such as row count).

If a driver supports only one active hstmt per hdbc, applications written as
above will not work. They must allocate a second hdbc, make a new connection,
and then allocate another hstmt within this new hdbc to be able to concurrently
use both hstmts, that is, concurrently having one hstmt with results pending as
the rows are being fetched, and using the other hstmt for other
application-specific tasks.

It must be noted, however, that even for a driver that supports only one active
hstmt per hdbc, it may be possible to allocate more than one hstmt within the
hdbc, that is, such a driver may support multiple hstmts per hdbc but not
multiple active hstmts per hdbc. In such cases, applications must be careful to
not use other hstmts within the hdbc when results are pending on a hstmt within
the hdbc.

The following examples assume a driver that supports only one active hstmt per
hdbc, without limiting multiple hstmts per hdbc.

  SQLAllocStmt(hdbc, &amp;hstmt1)
  SQLAllocStmt(hdbc, &amp;hstmt2)

Example 1
---------

  SQLExecDirect (hstmt1, "select * from &lt;a zero-row table&gt;", SQL_NTS)
  //Since the above select generated no results, it's OK to use hstmt2
  SQLExecDirect(hstmt2, "select * from &lt;table&gt;", SQL_NTS)

Example 2
---------

  SQLExecDirect(hstmt1, "select * from &lt;table that has rows&gt;", SQL_NTS)
  // The above statement generates a results set
  SQLExecDirect(hstmt2, "some update statement", SQL_NTS)
  // Error with SQLState 24000 "Invalid Cursor State"

Example 3
---------

  SQLExecDirect(hstmt1, "delete  from &lt;table that has rows&gt;", SQL_NTS)
  // The above delete generates a row count (the number of rows
  affected)
  SQLExecDirect(hstmt2, "some update statement", SQL_NTS)
  // Error with SQLState 24000 "Invalid Cursor State"

Because there are results pending on hstmt1, the last SQLExecDirect on hstmt2 in
Examples 2 and 3 results in SQLState 24000 "Invalid Cursor state." Note that in
example 3, if SQLRowCount had been called after the first SQLExecDirect to
determine the number of rows affected, the second SQLExecDirect would have been
valid.
