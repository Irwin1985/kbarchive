The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to log in to Schedule+, you may receive the following message:

  Not a Valid File

This message is generally followed by a dialog box asking if you would like to
delete this file and create a new calendar file to replace it.

Or, the following message may also appear when you try to log in to Schedule+:

  Invalid Password

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur when the SCHEDULE.KEY file, which exists in the CAL directory
of the Mail database, is either missing or corrupted. To see if this is the
case, the administrator should add the following line to the SCHDPLUS.INI file:

  StartUpOffLine=1

When Schedule+ is operating offline, it uses the local USERNAME.CAL file and
doesn't need to check the SCHEDULE.KEY file on the server.

NOTE: Although the SCHEDULE.KEY file is hidden by default, it can be visible or
hidden. It does not matter as long as this file exists in the CAL subdirectory
of the Mail database.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, the administrator should do the following:

Try to retrieve the SCHEDULE.KEY file from a current backup copy. This must be
done to successfully recover a resource room's calendar file on this postoffice.
Because resource rooms have no local backup copies, there is no way to retrieve
the information other than from a backup.

If this does not help, or if a SCHEDULE.KEY backup is not available, do the
following:

1. Backup (to be safe) and then delete all *.CAL files from the CAL directory.
  (Because each Schedule+ user has two copies of this file--one on the local
  computer and one on the server--you can safely delete this file, knowing that
  the next time you log in, your local calendar file will be uploaded to the
  server.)

2. Backup (to be safe) and then delete all SCHEDULE.* files from the CAL
  subdirectory. (The SCHEDULE.KEY file is regenerative. Thus, in previous
  attempts to log in, a new SCHEDULE.KEY file may have been created. Delete
  it.)

3. Have all users log in to Schedule+ to upload their local calendar files and
  create a new SCHEDULE.KEY file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Do NOT delete the server copy of the CAL file under the following
situation:

  If a User rarely uses the Schedule+ file, but has an assistant who maintains
  the Schedule+ file (using File, Open Other's Apt Book), the changes the
  assistant makes will not be reflected in the user's local CAL file until the
  user enters Schedule+. If the user never enters Schedule+, all recent
  schedule changes only reside in the CAL subdirectory.

The SCHEDULE.KEY file is an index to each user's calendar file on the server.
This file keeps track of who belongs to each hexadecimal-numbered .CAL file in
the CAL directory.

The first time any user tries to use Schedule+, a SCHEDULE.KEY file is created on
the server, noting who belongs to the file. The hexadecimal- numbered
xxxxxxxx.CAL file numbers DO NOT match the hexadecimal-numbered .MMF files that
exist in the MMF directory because not everyone who uses Mail uses Schedule+.

Each consecutive person to log in and use Schedule+ has a hexadecimal number
assigned to them that will be entered in the SCHEDULE.KEY file for future use
when logging on.

In the case above, where the SCHEDULE.KEY file is missing or corrupt, users can
be inadvertently pointed to the wrong hexadecimal-numbered .CAL file on the
server even when using the MVCAL.EXE utility. When this occurs, one of the above
error messages is generated.

The MVCAL utility is included with Application Note WA0641, "Database Maintenance
Utilities." You can have this Application Note mailed or faxed to you by
contacting Microsoft Product Support Services.
