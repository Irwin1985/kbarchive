-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It may be necessary, because of performance or other reasons, to replace a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer with a new, more powerful system.

This article explains how to move Exchange Server to a new computer, if the
original computer will be off the network and the new computer will have the
same name as the original computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you move Exchange Server to the new computer, verify that the original
computer is not the only Microsoft Windows NT domain controller in the domain.
While this computer is shut down as part of the moving procedure, there must be
a domain controller that can validate logon requests.

If the original computer is a Primary Domain Controller (PDC), make sure that
there is at least one other backup domain controller (BDC) in the Windows NT
domain. After you shut down the original computer, upgrade the BDC to a PDC.

If the original computer is a BDC, make sure that the PDC in the domain is up and
operational, or that there are other BDCs that can be upgraded to become the
PDC.

The steps below explain how to move Exchange Server to a new computer that has
the same hardware platform as the original computer. That is, either both
computers are Intel, or both computers are Alpha.

For the purposes of these steps, the two computers are referred to as the
"original computer" and the "new computer," even though both computers have the
same NetBIOS computer name.

How to Move Exchange Server to a New Computer with the Same Name as the Original Computer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To move Exchange Server to a new computer consists of the following steps, which
are expanded later:

1. Backing up information from the original computer.

2. Installing Windows NT and Exchange Server on the new computer.

3. Installing Windows 2000 and Exchange Server on the new computer.

4. Restoring the Exchange Server data to the new computer.

5. Configuring the Key Management server (KM server).

6. Restoring and reconfiguring connectors.

Backing Up Information from the Original Computer:

1. At the original Exchange Server computer, start the Exchange Server
  Administrator program. Note the following information:

   - The organization and site names.

   - The configuration parameters of any connectors that are installed on the
     original computer. You may want to print screen dumps of the different
     pages of the connector properties.

  Quit the Exchange Server Administrator program, and then note the drive
  configuration of the original computer.

2. At the original computer, stop all of the Exchange Server services.

3. Copy the entire Exchsrvr directory to another computer on the network, or to
  a tape drive. If the log, database, and working directories are on different
  drives, make sure that you copy the Exchsrvr directories from every drive.

4. Start the Exchange Server Performance Optimizer utility, and then note the
  locations of the directory service, information store, message transfer agent
  (MTA), and Internet Mail Service files. You can quit the Performance
  Optimizer utility after you get the necessary information. You can also get
  this information from the registry.

  You may want to run the perfwiz -v command, and then note any customized
  settings on the original computer.

  Also, note the version and service pack number of Exchange Server that is
  installed on the original computer.

5. If the KM server service is installed, stop the KM server service, and then
  back up the Security directory. If the original computer is running Exchange
  Server version 5.5, there is no Security directory, because the KM server
  information is stored in the Exchsrvr\Kmsdata directory. Also back up the KM
  server Startup disk.

6. Shut down the original computer, and then turn it off. Make sure that there
  is an operational domain controller in the Windows NT domain.

Installing Windows NT and Exchange Server on the New Computer:

1. Using the Server Manager utility, remove the computer account for the
  original computer, and then re-add it.

2. Install Windows NT on the new computer, using the same computer name that the
  original computer used. If necessary, make the new computer a BDC. Ensure
  that the original computer is turned off before you install Windows NT on the
  new computer.

3. Reconfigure the drives on the new computer exactly as they were configured on
  the original computer.

Installing Windows 2000 and Exchange Server on the New Computer:

NOTE:If the server is not a domain controller, do not perform step one and
proceed to step 2.

1. Run the Active Directory Installation Wizard (DCPROMO) to demote the server
  to a member server.

2. To disjoin the server from the domain, click Properties, click the Network
  Identification tab, click Properties, and then click Workgroup.

3. In Active Directory Users and Computers on a domain controller, remove the
  computer account that corresponds to server that you have just removed from
  the domain.

4. Install Windows 2000 on the new computer, and then name the computer the same
  computer name that the original computer used. Ensure that you reconfigure
  the drives on the new computer exactly as they were configured on the old
  computer.

5. Join the server to the domain.

  NOTE: It may be necessary to run the Active Directory Installation Wizard
  (DCPROMO) to promote the member server to a domain controller.

Restoring the Exchange Server Data to the New Computer:

NOTE: When you install Exchange on the new server, create a new site with the
same site name, organization name, and server name as the previous server being
replaced. DO NOT join the site.

1. Install Microsoft Exchange 5.5 on the new server, and then click the option
  to create a new organization. When you receive the prompt, use the same
  organization and site names that were used on the original server. Install
  the same service packs and hotfixes that were installed on the original
  server.

2. Run the Performance Optimizer utility and verify that all of the paths are
  the same as those noted in the previous steps.

3. Stop the Exchange System Attendant Service (MSExchangeSA) from either the
  Control Panel services interface or from a command prompt type "Net Stop
  MSExchange" (without the quotation marks). This procedure stops all other
  Exchange services as well.

4. Copy the Exchsrvr directories that you backed up from the original computer
  over the Exchsrvr directories on the new computer. Make sure that you copy
  the directories to the correct drives.

  If the original computer and the new computer do not have the same hardware
  platform, then only copy the Dsadata, Dxadata, Imcdata, Mdbdata, and Mtadata
  directories. You may also need to copy the Ccmcdata, Insdata, Kmsdata, and
  Tracking.log directories if the corresponding components were installed or
  enabled on the original computer.

5. Start the system attendant and directory services.

6. Start the information store service. If the Application event log states that
  you need to run Isinteg -patch when you start the information store, at a
  Windows NT command prompt, run the following command

  isinteg -patch

  and then restart the information store service.

Configuring the KM Server:

You installed the KM server in the "Installing Windows NT and Exchange Server on
the New Computer" section, step 7, before you restored the Exchange Server
directory from the original computer to the new computer.

1. Stop the KM server service on the new computer.

2. Copy the Kmspwd.ini file from the KM server Startup disk for the original
  computer to another disk. Label the disk "KM Server Startup Disk - New
  Computer."

3. Perform one of the following steps, depending on the version of Exchange
  Server that the original computer was running and the new computer is
  running:

   - For Exchange Server version 4.0 or 5.0, at the new computer, rename the
     Security\Mgrent directory to the Security\Mgrent.original directory. Copy
     the Security\Mgrent directory from the backup of the Security directory of
     the original computer (that you made in the "Backing up Information from
     the Original Computer" section, step 5) to the Security directory on the
     new computer.

  - or -

   - For Exchange Server version 5.5, at the new computer, rename the
     Exchsrvr\Kmsdata directory to the Exchsrvr\Kmsdata.original directory.
     Copy the Exchsrvr\Kmsdata directory from the backup of the Exchsrvr
     directory of the original computer (that you made in the "Backing up
     Information from the Original Computer" section, step 3) to the Exchsrvr
     directory on the new computer.

4. Place the new KM server Startup disk for the new computer (labeled "KM Server
  Startup Disk - New Computer") into the disk drive of the new computer.

5. Start the KM server service on the new computer.

6. Use the Performance Optimizer utility to make any desired changes.

7. Start all of the Exchange Server services.

Restoring and Reconfiguring Connectors:

Restore all of the information that relates to site connectors and X.400
Connectors on the new computer. You need to reconfigure any Internet Mail
Connector or Dynamic RAS Connectors. You may also need to reconfigure
third-party connectors.

Exchange Client Profiles
------------------------

After you complete the steps in this article, Exchange Server runs on the new
computer in the same way that it ran on the original computer. Exchange Clients
can connect to the new Exchange Server computer just as they connected to the
original computer.

Use of Offline Backups Instead of Online Backups
------------------------------------------------

In the procedures in this article, you use an offline backup, instead of an
online backup. This allows you to move all of the data that existed at the time
that the Exchange Server services were stopped to the new computer. This
includes data that may have arrived after the last online backup, as well as
transient data in the MTA or connector queues.

If you perform an online backup, to be sure that you move all of the data to the
new computer you need to copy transaction logs, as well as the MTA and Internet
Mail Service data files.

It is more effective to copy the entire Exchsrvr directory on each drive to the
new computer. This procedure requires that you configure the locations of the
different logs and databases exactly the way they were configured on the
original computer, but it guarantees that there is no loss of data.
