SUMMARY
=======

If a Microsoft Exchange Messaging Connector and a Microsoft Exchange Replication
Connector have been set up between two Microsoft Exchange Sites and you no
longer want either of the Sites to know about the other as if replication had
never occurred, you can simply delete the Replication Connector. All data that
had been replicated via the connector will automatically be deleted over a
period of time.

It is also a good idea to run a Knowledge Consistency Check after deleting the
Replication Connector in order for the data to be updated immediately.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Deleting a Replication Connector does not just prohibit any new additions and
deletions from being made to the Microsoft Exchange Directory. It actually
causes the Directory to be returned to its original state, as if replication had
never occurred.

To delete the Replication Connector, simply press Delete while the Replication
Connector is highlighted in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. This
will generate the following message:

  Deleting the directory replication connector that connects with Site
  'site name' will stop replication with that site. To re-establish
  replication with that site, you must add a new directory replication
  connector. Are you sure you want to delete the directory replication
  connector?.

Click Yes. You will then get a prompt asking if you want to delete the
replication connector in the remote site also. After clicking Yes, you will get
the following confirmation:

  The directory replication connector has been deleted from both the local
  site and the remote site. Allow up to an hour for replicated data to be
  completely deleted.
