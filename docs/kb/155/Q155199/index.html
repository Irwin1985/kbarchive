SUMMARY
=======

Word does not provide a built-in method for applying two different page
numbering schemes in one document. This article describes how to create one page
numbering scheme for the entire document and another scheme for each section of
the document.

For example, a 10-page document has three sections with the following number of
pages in each section:

4 pages in section 1 (physical pages 1-4)
2 pages in section 2 (physical pages 5-6)
4 pages in section 3 (physical pages 7-10)

Using the method below, you can create two-page numbering schemes to look like
the following:

The header will display the numbering scheme of:

  &lt;Page Number&gt; of &lt;Total Number of Pages in Section&gt;

The footer will display the numbering scheme of:

  &lt;total number of pages in the document&gt;

So, on page 3 of section 1 (the third physical page of the total document), the
header will display Page 3 of 4 and the footer will display 3. On page 2 of
section 3 (the eighth physical page of the total document), the header will
display Page 2 of 4 and the footer will display 8.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This process assumes that you have a document with multiple sections, and
that you are familiar with inserting field codes.

To create a numbering scheme that uses consecutive numbering throughout the
document and a second numbering scheme that numbers each section beginning at 1,
use either method below:

Method 1: Use SEQ Fields
------------------------

1. Place the following two field codes on the first page of the document:

  {SEQ variable1 \h \r {SectionPages} }

  {SEQ variable2 \h \r0}

  NOTE: the \r is followed by the number zero, not the letter "O".

2. Place the following field codes at the beginning of each section after the
  first section:

  {SEQ variable2 \h \r {={SEQ variable1 \c} } }

  {SEQ variable1 \h \r {={SectionPages}+{SEQ variable2 \c} } }

3. Position your insertion point at the top of the document and on the View
  menu, click Header And Footer.

4. In the Header, position your insertion point where you want the page number,
  type the word "Page" (without the quotation marks) and a space, and then
  click the Insert Page Number button on the Header And Footer toolbar.

5. On the Insert menu, click Page Numbers, and then click Format.

6. Under Page Numbering, click Start At (1 should appear in the Start At box),
  and then click OK twice.

7. Position the insertion point after the Page field, type " of " (without the
  quotation marks, and including the spaces before and after the word "of"),
  and on the Insert menu, click Field. Under Categories, click (All). Under
  Field Names, click SectionPages, and then click OK.

8. Click Show Next on the Header and Footer toolbar. (Note: you should see
  Header-Section 2 in the header area of the document.) On the Insert menu,
  click Page Numbers, and then click Format. Under Page Numbering, click Start
  At (1 should appear in the Start At box), and then click OK twice.

9. Repeat step 8 for each section of your document.

10. Click Show Previous on the Header And Footer toolbar until it displays
  Header-Section 1 in the Header section of the document. Click the Switch
  Between Header and Footer icon on the Header and Footer toolbar. (Note: You
  should see Footer Section 1 in the footer area of your document.)

11. Place the following field code in the footer to show the page number of the
  total number of pages in the document:

  {={SEQ variable2 \c}+{Page} }

12. Click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.

The sequence fields include the \h switch which formats the fields as hidden.
Although you can display hidden text by clicking the Show/Hide button on the
Standard toolbar, you should turn hidden text off before you print because
hidden text affects page breaks and can result in incorrect page numbering.

Method 2: Use PAGEREF Fields
----------------------------

To create the Header section numbering scheme, follow these steps:

Page numbering starts at 1 for each section, and the PAGEREF field yields the
number of pages in each section. Page numbering appears as "Page X of Y" on each
page, where X is the current page in the current section, and Y is the number of
pages in the current section. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

2. In Section 1, position your insertion point where you want the page number
  and then click the Insert Page Number icon on the Header and Footer toolbar.

3. On the Insert menu, click Page Numbers, and then click Format.

4. Under Page Numbering, click Start At (1 should appear in the Start At box),
  and then click OK twice, and then click Close on the Header and Footer
  toolbar.

5. Repeat the following instructions in each section of your document to insert
  a bookmark at the end of the section:

  a. Select some text at the end of the last page of the section.

  b. On the Insert menu, click Bookmark.

  c. Type a Bookmark Name, such as Sec1 for Section 1, and then click Add.

6. On the View menu, click Header and Footer, and then follow these steps:

  a. Starting at Section 1 of your document, position the insertion point after
     the Page field that you inserted in step 2, and then type " of " (without
     the quotation marks, and including the spaces before and after the word
     "of")

  b. On the Insert menu, click Field. Under Categories, click (All). Under
     Field Names, click PAGEREF, click Options, click the Bookmarks tab, select
     the name of the bookmark you inserted to mark the end of the current
     section, and then click Add To Field.

  c. Click OK twice.

  d. Click Show Next on the Header and Footer toolbar. (Note: you should see
     Header-Section 2 in the header area of the document.) If Same As Previous
     is turned on (you will see the words Same As Previous on the right side of
     the dotted line surrounding the header or footer), click the Same As
     Previous button on the Header and Footer toolbar. The words Same As
     Previous will disappear from the right side of the dotted line surrounding
     the header or footer. Also, on the Insert menu, click Page Numbers, and
     then click Format. Under Page Numbering, click Start At (1 should appear
     in the Start At box), and then click OK twice.

  e. If your field codes are not turned on, press ALT+F9 to turn then on. With
     field codes turned on, the following code will appear:

  {PAGE} of {PAGEREF BookmarkName \* MERGEFORMAT}

     where BookmarkName is the name of the bookmark you inserted in step 5.

  f. Change the BookmarkName within the PAGEREF field to the name of the
     bookmark for the respective Section.

  g. Repeat steps d and f for each section of your document.

  h. Click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.

  Note: you may need to update the field (press F9) for it to appear correctly.

To create the Footer numbering scheme, do the following:

1. Position your insertion point at the top of the document and on the View
  menu, click Header And Footer. Click the Switch Between Header and Footer
  icon on the Header and Footer toolbar.

2. In Section 1, click the Insert Page Number icon on the Header and Footer
  toolbar.

3. Click Show Next on the Header and Footer toolbar. (Note: you should see
  Header-Section 2 in the header area of the document.) If Same As Previous is
  turned on (you will see the words Same As Previous on the right side of the
  dotted line surrounding the header or footer), click the Same As Previous
  button on the Header and Footer toolbar. The words Same As Previous will
  disappear from the right side of the dotted line surrounding the header or
  footer.

4. If your field codes are not turned on, press ALT+F9 to turn then on. With
  field codes turned on, delete any {PAGE} field in the footer.

5. Enter the following field into the Footer of Section 2:

  {={PAGE} + {PAGEREF BookmarkName (section 1)}}

  Note: The BookmarkName should be the PREVIOUS Section's BookmarkName.

6. Click the Show Next button on the Header and Footer toolbar and then follow
  these steps:

  a. You should see Header-Section 3 in the header area of the document. If
     Same As Previous is turned on (you will see the words Same As Previous on
     the right side of the dotted line surrounding the header or footer), click
     the Same As Previous button on the Header and Footer toolbar. The words
     Same As Previous will disappear from the right side of the dotted line
     surrounding the header or footer.

  b. If your field codes are not turned on, press ALT+F9 to turn then on.

  c. With field codes turned on, change the field to the following:

  {={PAGE} + {PAGEREF BookmarkName (section 1)}
  + {PAGEREF BookmarkName (section 2)}}

7. Repeat step 6 for each section of your document.

  Note: You will need to edit the field placed into the footer for each
  additional section by adding the following to the end of the existing field
  code between the two end braces ({}):

  + {PAGEREF BookmarkName (previous section x)}

  Note: x represents the PREVIOUS section number.

  For example, Section 4 of our example would be:

  {={PAGE} + {PAGEREF BookmarkName (section 1)}
  + {PAGEREF BookmarkName (section 2)}
  + {PAGEREF BookmarkName (section 3)}}

8. Click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.
