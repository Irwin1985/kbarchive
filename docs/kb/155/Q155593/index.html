The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This symptom occurs with a Systems Management Server (SMS) client that has the
SMS client software installed and is using a NetWare redirector. The SMS client
does not report its inventory to a Windows NT server when the client's
redirector is switched to MS Networking.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an SMS client's redirector has been changed in this fashion, the following
error message appears when Invdos.exe is executed from the login script:

  No network found.

This problem potentially applies to any client operating system SMS supports that
can also support more than one of the following network types:

  2 = Windows NT 3.x or higher
  3 = LAN Manager 1.x
  4 = LAN Manager 2.x (includes WFWNET)
  5 = NetWare 2.x
  6 = NetWare 3.x or higher

After the network type has been changed, the client will not be moved to the new
SMS domain until it has run the SMS login script or Runsms.bat three times. The
client will receive the message

  Different site/domain combination

until the move to the new domain is completed.

CAUSE
=====

After the SMS client software has been successfully installed on a client, the
type of networking used by the client is not reevaluated if the client switches
to a different redirector.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is possible to avoid having to deinstall and reinstall the SMS client
components by manually editing the Sms.ini file on the client.

1. Locate the NetworkType value in the [SMS] section of the Sms.ini file.

2. Change its value to match the type of networking the client now uses to gain
  access to the SMS logon server.

  For example, if the client was originally using NetWare VLMs and then later
  switched to MS Networking and logging in to Windows NT servers, change from
  "NetworkType=6" to "NetworkType=2." This will allow the client to properly
  report to the new Domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
