- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot video display in Windows NT version
4.0. The following items are included with Windows NT to help you troubleshoot
video problems:

- Hardware Compatibility List

- Setup.txt file

- Readme.wri file

- Video drivers from other manufacturers

- VGA mode

- The ability to easily change display settings

- Last Known Good Configuration

MORE INFORMATION
================

Hardware Compatibility List
---------------------------

The Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List is available in the Support folder
on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM as a file named Hcl.hlp. The Hardware Compatibility
List is a listing of computers and peripherals that have passed compatibility
testing with Windows NT 4.0. Before you install Windows NT or if you are
experiencing problems with your video adapter, make sure your video adapter
appears on this list.

Although your video adapter may not appear on the Hardware Compatibility List, it
may work with Windows NT. If a device does not appear on the Hardware
Compatibility List, Microsoft does not guarantee the device will work properly
with Windows NT.

For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q142865
  TITLE : Microsoft Support Policy on Hardware Not On Windows NT HCL

Setup.txt and Readme.wri Files
------------------------------

If your video adapter appears on the Hardware Compatibility List and you continue
to experience problems, check for information concerning your video adapter in
the Setup.txt and Readme.wri files.

The Setup.txt file is available in the I386 folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM
and the Readme.wri file is available in the Winnt\System32 folder.

Video Drivers from Other Manufacturers
--------------------------------------

If your video adapter appears on the Hardware Compatibility List, additional
information is not available in the Setup.txt or Readme.wri file, and you
continue to experience problems, check the Drvlib\Video folder on the Windows NT
4.0 CD-ROM for an updated video driver.

This folder contains video drivers written by third-party manufacturers for their
video adapters that are provided for your convenience. If you have a question
concerning any of these drivers, please contact the manufacturer of that driver.
If these adapters are not detected during Setup, the standard VGA driver is
installed.

Perform the following steps to manually add one of these drivers:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

2. Click the Settings tab, click Display Type, and then click Change.

3. Click Have Disk and then click Browse to browse the Windows NT CD-ROM for the
  appropriate video driver for your display adapter.

4. After you locate the appropriate video driver, click OK, read the message
  about third-party hardware vendors, and then click Yes.

5. Click Reboot when you are prompted.

Drivers for the following adapters and chip sets are in the Drvlib\Video folder
on the CD-ROM:

VGA Mode
--------

If Windows NT does not start or if distorted or unreadable text appears on the
screen, start your computer using VGA mode. By default, the Windows NT boot
loader menu offers options to start normally or in VGA mode. To force Windows NT
to use the standard VGA driver, choose the VGA Mode option.

If VGA mode works correctly, please see the "The Ability to Easily Change Display
Settings" section in this article. If VGA mode is unsuccessful, please see the
"Last Known Good Configuration" section in this article.

The Ability to Easily Change Display Settings
---------------------------------------------

If VGA mode lets you run Windows NT, changing the display settings may let you
run Windows NT normally. The following three display settings, if set
incorrectly for your video adapter or monitor, may prevent Windows NT from
loading:

- Color Palette

- Desktop Area

- Refresh Frequency

NOTE: The Font Size setting affects only the size of the text on the screen. It
does not prevent Windows NT from loading.

Perform the following steps to change display settings:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.

2. Click the Settings tab.

3. Try each of the following steps, restarting Windows NT after each change,
  until Windows NT starts normally. Repeat the steps as necessary.

  a. Reduce the Color Palette setting. To do so, click a lower setting in the
     Color Palette box.

  b. Reduce the desktop area. To do so, move the Desktop Area slider to the
     left.

  c. Reduce the refresh rate. The current setting may be too high for your
     monitor. To reduce this setting, click a slower refresh rate in the
     Refresh Frequency box.

Last Known Good Configuration
-----------------------------

If Windows NT does not start in VGA mode, start Windows NT using the last known
good configuration. To do so, restart your computer and press the SPACEBAR when
you see the "Press spacebar NOW to invoke Hardware Profile/Last Known Good menu"
message. The last known good configuration works only if you have not
successfully logged on since the problem began.

If the last known good configuration works, see the "Driver" section in this
article. If the last known good configuration does not work, try to recover your
system with the Emergency Repair Disk. Please see your Windows NT documentation
for more information about the Emergency Repair Disk.

Driver
------

If the last known good configuration works, there may be a problem with the
installed video driver. Please consult the video adapter manufacturer for a
possible video driver update.

NOTE: Because of changes to the Windows NT 4.0 video subsystem, most Windows NT
3.x video drivers do not work in Windows NT 4.0.
