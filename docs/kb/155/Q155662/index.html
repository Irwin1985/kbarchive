SUMMARY
=======

The following article discusses ways to troubleshoot audio problems you may
encounter when running Monster Truck Madness. This information is from the
Monster Truck Madness Readme.txt file.

SOUND DOES NOT PLAY CORRECTLY

If Monster Truck Madness does not play sound properly, try the
following list of troubleshooting steps.

Verify that your speakers and the Windows 95 volume control are
  enabled and turned up.

Confirm that you do not have Mute Sound selected on the Options
  menu in Monster Truck Madness.

Verify that Windows 95 can play .wav files:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
     Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Sounds icon.

  3. Try to play a .wav file.

If Windows 95 is not able to play a .wav file, check to see
  that a sound card is enabled:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
     Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the System icon.

  3. Click the Device Manager tab.

  4. Click the plus sign next to Sound, Video and Game Controllers.

  5. If there is no Sound, Video and Game Controllers entry or
     you have no sound card listed under this entry, contact the
     manufacturer of your computer or sound card and request help
     reinstalling the sound card drivers.

If you are able to play a .wav file in Windows 95, ensure that
  sounds are enabled and recognized in Monster Truck Madness:

  1. Start Monster Truck Madness.

  2. On the Options menu, click Sound.

  3. Verify that the Play Sound Effects and/or Play Music check
     boxes are selected.

  4. Click Advanced.

  5. Verify that Monster Truck Madness recognizes a sound card by
     looking under the Sound Card Detected label. The name of your
     sound card should be displayed.

  6. To see if Monster Truck Madness will play a sound file, click
     Test.

SOUND CLIPPED OR DELAYED

If sound in Monster Truck Madness seems clipped or delayed, try the
following troubleshooting steps:

On the Options menu, click Sound.

Click Advanced.

If the sound is choppy or clipped, increase the number of buffers
  slightly. If there is a delay in the sound effects, decrease the
  number of buffers slightly.

To apply the new settings and hear the results, click Test.

If the sound is still clipped, increase the buffer size slightly,
  and then click Test. If you decrease the buffer size too much, the
  sound will seem choppy.

Continue to experiment until the sound is smooth and timed
  appropriately.

NOTE: You can always restore original settings by clicking Default.

ENSONIQ SOUNDSCAPE CARD INFORMATION

If you're having problems installing Monster Truck Madness with the
Ensoniq Soundscape sound card, but you know that there is nothing
wrong with the sound card, try this:

Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

Double-click System.

In the System Properties dialog box, click the Device Manager tab.

Double-click Sound, Video and Game Controllers.

Click Ensoniq Soundscape, and then click Properties.

In the Ensoniq Soundscape dialog box, click the DOS Settings tab.

Under Synth Routing, make sure Internal is selected.

Close all dialog boxes and reboot.

Reinstall Monster Truck Madness.
