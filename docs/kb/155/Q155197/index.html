SUMMARY
=======

Unattended Setup is the method by which original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),
corporations, and other users install Windows NT in unattended mode. To start
Windows NT Setup in unattended mode, you must specify the following command:

  winnt[32] /u:&lt;answer file&gt; /s:&lt;install source&gt;

where &lt;answer file&gt; is a file containing information to automate the
installation process and &lt;install source&gt; is the location of the Windows
NT installation files. In this article, &lt;answer file&gt; is referred to as
the Unattend.txt file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unattend.txt File Format
------------------------

In general, an answer file consists of section headers, parameters, and values
for those parameters. Most of the section headers are predefined (although some
may be user-defined). It is not necessary to specify all the possible parameters
and keys in the Unattend.txt file if the installation does not require them. The
file format is as follows:

  [section1]
  ;
  ; Section contains keys and the corresponding
  ; values for those keys/parameters.
  ; keys and values are separated by "=" signs
  ; Values usually require double quotes "" around them
  ;
  key = value
  .
  .

  [section2]
  key = value
  .
  .

Description of Unattend.txt File Parameters
-------------------------------------------

[Unattended]

This section header is used to identify whether an unattended installation is
being performed or not. It should exist or the Unattend.txt file may be ignored.
Parameters that can exist in this section are discussed below.

OemPreinstall
Value: Yes | No

Determines whether an OEM pre-installation is being performed or not. When the
value is Yes, other subdirectories may be copied if they exist. No means a
regular unattended Setup is being performed copying only the Inetsrv, System32
and Drvlib.nic subdirectories. If using sysdiff and you performed a sysdiff
/inf, this value must be set to Yes.


NoWaitAfterTextMode
Value: 0 | 1

This key determines whether the text mode portion of Setup should automatically
start into GUI mode or not. It is only valid when OemPreinstall = Yes. The
default behavior is to halt after text mode during a preinstallation. 0
indicates that Setup should halt after text mode and 1 indicates that Setup
should automatically restart into GUI mode after text mode is complete.

NoWaitAfterGuiMode
Value: 0 | 1

This key determines whether the GUI mode portion of Setup should automatically
restart to the logon screen or not. It is only valid when OemPreinstall = Yes.
The default behavior is to halt at the end of GUI mode Setup. 0 indicates that
Setup should halt after GUI mode and 1 indicates that Setup should automatically
reboot after GUI mode is complete.

FileSystem
Value: ConvertNTFS | LeaveAlone

This key specifies whether the primary partition should be converted to NTFS or
left alone. In general, partitions greater than 512 megabyte (MB) should be
converted to NTFS. If this value is set to "CovertNTFS" it is done after the
first restart of unattended setup.

ExtendOemPartition
Value: 0 | 1

The ExtendOemPartition key is used to install Windows NT on a disk that is larger
than 2 gigabytes (GB) in size. This key causes text-mode Setup to extend the
partition on which the temporary Windows NT sources are located into any
available unpartitioned space that physically follows it on the disk. The
temporary install source must be a primary partition and limited to 1024
cylinders only. Writing beyond the 1024th cylinder may cause the installation to
stop responding. 0 implies that the partition may not be extended and 1
indicates that it must be extended. When the value is 1, the FileSystem key must
be set to ConvertNTFS. When the value is set to 1, oempreinstall must be equal
to yes.

For example if you have a 10 GB hard disk, most MS-DOS based partitioning tools
only allow you to create a 2GB partition. When you have this value set to "1",
setup extends the drive out to the maximum of 7.8GB.

This is based on how the drive is translated by the system / controller BIOS, and
may be less than the maximum of 7.8GB. If the drive is being translated using
CHS values of 1024 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors per track, then you can
extend to volume to the 7.8GB limit, however, if the Sectors per track is only
32, the maximum partition size will be reduced in half or approximately 4GB. The
same holds true if the number if heads is reduced. Make sure you have drive
translation "enabled" in the system/controller bios to make sure you can grow
the partition to the maximum permitted size of 7.8GB.

ConfirmHardware
Value: Yes | No

This key determines whether a user should manually confirm hardware and mass
storage devices detected by the Setup program. Yes indicates that a user must
manually confirm the hardware detected and No implies Setup should install the
detected devices. For a complete unattended installation, this key should be set
to No.

NtUpgrade
Values: Yes | No | Manual | Single

This key determines whether a previous version of Windows NT Workstation or
Server should be upgraded or not. It should be set in order to perform an
upgrade. Yes indicates that the detected Windows NT installation should be
upgraded. If multiple installations are detected, the first installation found
is upgraded. No implies that the upgrade should be aborted if a Windows NT
installation is found. This is the appropriate value when OemPreinstall = Yes.
Manual implies that the user must specify which previous installation should be
upgraded. Single indicates that the upgrade should continue only if a single
Windows NT installation is found. If multiple installations are found, the user
must manually select which installation to upgrade.

Win31Upgrade
Values: Yes | No

The Win31Upgrade key determines whether previous installations of Windows or
Windows for Workgroups 3.x should be upgraded to Windows NT. Yes indicates that
the Windows installation should be upgraded and No means do not upgrade the
installation if found.

OverwriteOemFilesOnUpgrade
Values: Yes | No

This key determines whether OEM-supplied files that have the same name as Windows
NT system files should be overwritten during an unattended upgrade or not. Yes
means overwrite the files and No means do not overwrite if found. The default
behavior is to overwrite OEM-supplied files.

TargetPath
Values: * | &lt;path name&gt; | Manual

This key determines the installation directory in which Windows NT should be
installed, and implies that Setup should generate a unique directory name for
the installation. This is usually WINNT.x where x is 0, 1, and so on. &lt;path
name&gt; is user-defined installation directory. Manual indicates that Setup
should prompt the user to enter the installation path. Note, do not use drive
letters in this value. For example if you want to have Windows NT installed to
winnt40, your unattend.txt should have the value:

 TargetPath = \winnt40

NOTE: Do not use drive letters such as c:\winnt or d:\winntws. To specify a drive
other than the boot partition, you must use the commandline switch /t: with your
setup command. For example, "winnt32.exe /t:d:" (without the quotation marks) to
install Windows NT to the D drive.

ComputerType
Values: &lt;hal description&gt; [, Retail | OEM]

This key indicates the type of Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to be loaded by
the Setup Loader, and installed by text-mode Setup. If this key is not present,
Setup attempts to detect the type of computer and install the appropriate retail
HAL. It is only valid when OemPreinstall = Yes. The &lt;hal description&gt;
string identifies the HAL to be installed. It must match one of the strings in
the [Computer] section of the Txtsetup.sif file (for a retail HAL), or the
Txtsetup.oem file (for an OEM HAL). Retail informs Setup that the HAL to be
installed is part of the Windows NT product. OEM indicates that the HAL to be
loaded is OEM- supplied. If the HAL is OEM-supplied, the driver name must also
be listed in the [OemBootFiles] section of the Unattend.txt file. Listed below
are some examples of these values:

  Descriptions are from the COMPUTER Section of TXTSETUP.SIF
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  ComputerType = "AST Manhattan SMP","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "Compaq SystemPro Multiprocessor or 100% Compatible","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "Corollary C-bus Architecture","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "Corollary C-bus Micro Channel Architecture","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "IBM PS/2 or other Micro Channel-based PC","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "MPS Uniprocessor PC","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "MPS Multiprocessor PC","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "MPS Multiprocessor Micro Channel PC","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "NCR System 3000 Model 3360/3450/3550","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "Olivetti LSX5030/40","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "Standard PC","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "Standard PC with C-Step i486","RETAIL"
  ComputerType = "Wyse Series 7000i Model 740MP/760MP","RETAIL"

If you have your own special HAL, your line should read as follows:

  ComputerType = "This is my special HAL","OEM"

Remember that when you use an OEM supplied HAL, the driver name must also exist
in the [OemBootFiles] section.

KeyboardLayout
Value: &lt;layout description&gt;

This key indicates the type of keyboard layout to install. If this key does not
exist, Setup detects and install a keyboard layout. &lt;layout description&gt;
must match one of the right hand strings (in "") in the ["Keyboard Layout"]
section of the Txtsetup.sif file.

Example:

  KeyBoardLayout = "US-International"

NOTE: If you are using a localized version of Windows NT, refer to the
Txtsetup.sif file located on the second installation floppy disk for the
appropriate string to add in the Unattend.txt file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[MassStorageDrivers]

This section contains a list of SCSI drivers to be loaded by the Setup Loader,
and installed during text-mode Setup. If this section is absent or empty, Setup
attempts to detect the SCSI devices on the computer, and install the
corresponding retail drivers.

This section instructs Setup that the default end-user interface may be modified
by the keys below.

Banner
Values: &lt;text string&gt;

This key specifies a text string to be displayed in the upper left corner of the
computer screen. The text must contain the "Windows NT" sub-string or it may be
ignored. To specify more than one line, you can separate the different lines
using the * character. Example:

  Banner = "My own Windows NT setup"

Logo
Values: &lt;file name&gt; [,&lt;resource id&gt;]

This key specifies a bitmap to be displayed in the upper right corner of the
screen. If this line has only one field, it is assumed to be a .bmp file located
in the $OEM$ directory of the distribution share point. However if two fields
are specified, the first field is the name of a DLL and the second is a base-10
number that represents the resource ID of the bitmap in the DLL. The DLL
specified should be located in the $OEM$ directory. Example:

  Logo = Myown.bmp

Background

  Q166028 Installing 3rd-Party Video drivers with Txtsetup.oem Unattended

You can use the next three parameters instead of the [DisplayDriver],
[OemBootFiles] sections and custom Txtsetup.oem files to install third- party
video drivers. The drivers and files required by the video adapter should exist
in the $OEM$\Display directory on the distribution share point.

InstallDriver
Value: 0 | 1

This key specifies whether a third-party driver is being installed or not. If
value is 0, the InfFile and InfOption keys are skipped.

InfFile
Values: &lt;inf file name 1&gt;, &lt;inf file name 2&gt;, ...

This key specifies a list of .inf file names for display drivers to be installed.
You can specify only one .inf file per driver. That is, S3.inf, Matrox.inf, and
so on.

InfOption
Values: &lt;inf option 1&gt;, &lt;inf option 2&gt;, ...

Specifies a list of options that should be selected from the corresponding .inf
files specified with the InfFile key. For example, the display tool installs the
S3 765 entry in the S3.inf file and the Millennium 3D entry in the Matrox.inf
file if the following keys are specified:

  InfFile = s3.inf, matrox.inf
  InfOption = S3 765, Millennium 3D

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Modem]

This section header is used to identify whether a modem should be installed or
not. It is used by Remote Access Services (RAS) to install a modem if DeviceType
= Modem in the list of RAS parameters. This section cannot be empty if you want
to install modems using RAS in unattended mode.

InstallModem
Value: &lt;modem parameter section&gt;

This key defines a section where modem installation parameters are defined. The
key must exist in order to install any modems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[&lt;modem parameter section&gt;]

The modem parameter section lists the keys and values required to install a modem
on a particular COM port. If the [&lt;modem parameter section&gt;] section is
blank, RAS performs modem detection on its preconfigured ports and install any
modems it finds.

&lt;COM port number&gt;
Values: &lt;Modem description&gt; [, &lt;Manufacturer&gt;, &lt;Provider&gt;]

The &lt;COM port number&gt; key specifies the COM ports on which modems are
installed. The COM port numbers must match ports configured or to be configured
by the RAS installation. &lt;Modem description&gt; must match a modem
description in a Mdmxxxxx.inf file that corresponds to the modem to be
installed. This string must be enclosed in quotation marks. The
&lt;Manufacturer&gt; and &lt;Provider&gt; fields are optional fields that
identify the manufacturer and provider of a particular modem in cases where the
&lt;modem description&gt; string is not unique to a particular manufacturer.

An example of the [Modem] section is listed below:

  [Modem]
  InstallModem = MyModemParameters

  [MyModemParameters]
  Com2 = "Hayes V-Series Ultra Smartmodem 9600"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[Network]

This section informs Setup that Networking should be installed. If empty, the
user may be presented with various error messages. If this section header is
absent; network installation may be skipped.

Attended
Value: Yes | No

This key is specified if you want the user to install networking manually during
an unattended installation. The value is ignored so if you want a complete
unattended installation, this key should not be specified at all.

JoinWorkgroup
Value: &lt;workgroup name&gt;

This key is used to define the workgroup in which the computer may participate.

JoinDomain
Value: &lt;domain name&gt;

This key is used to define the domain in which the computer may participate.

CreateComputerAccount
Values: &lt;username&gt;, &lt;password&gt;

This key enables the computer account to be created during setup. The username
and password is for a domain account that has the right Add Workstations To
Domain. Note that for this value to work, the network card must be able to
contact the Domain controller. This is crucial for computers that are only using
the TCPIP protocol and Domain controller is on a different segment. We must have
a way to resolve the IP address. If the account does not have the privileges to
add workstations to the domain or cannot contact the domain controller, setup
prompts you that it is unable to create the account and bring you back to the
Join domain dialog.

InstallDC
Value: &lt;domain name&gt;

This key is used to specify the name of a domain to be installed. It is only
valid when installing a primary or backup domain controller and the
AdvServerType key has been set accordingly.

DetectAdapters
Value: &lt;detect adapters section&gt; | ""

This key is used to detect network adapter cards installed on a computer. Either
this key or the InstallAdapters key must exist in order to install network
cards. If the value is "", the first card detected may be installed.

InstallAdapters
Value: &lt;install adapters section&gt;

This key defines a section in which the network adapters to be installed are
listed. If this key is present, the adapters listed in the section are installed
by default, they are not detected.

InstallProtocols
Value: &lt;protocols section&gt;

This key defines a section in which the network protocols to be installed are
listed.

InstallServices
Value: &lt;services section&gt;

This key defines a section in which the network services to be installed are
listed. Listed below is a list of services that can be installed during
unattended setup:

  NWWKSTA - Client service for Netware
  SNMP = SNMP service
  RAS = Remote access service
  NETMON = Network monitor
  STCPIP = Simple TCPIP
  TCPPRINT = TCPIP Printing service
  INETSTP = Install internet server
  SAP = SAP service

InstallInternetServer
Value: &lt;internet information server parameters&gt;

This key defines a section in which parameters for installing the Internet
Information Server(IIS) are listed. During installation on Windows NT Server,
IIS is installed by default.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

[&lt;Detect Adapters Section&gt;]

This section is pointed to by the DetectAdapters key described earlier.

DetectCount
Value: &lt;number of detection attempts&gt;

Indicates the number of detection attempts Setup should make.

LimitTo
Value: &lt;netcard inf option&gt;

This key specifies a list of netcard .inf options to which the detection should
be limited. The netcard .inf options for particular cards can be found in the
[Options] section of the corresponding Oemnadxx.inf file. For example:

  LimitTo = AMDPCN

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[&lt;Install Adapters Section&gt;]
&lt;Netcard Inf option&gt; = &lt;netcard parameter section&gt;, &lt;oem path&gt;

&lt;Netcard Inf option&gt;
Value: &lt;netcard parameter section&gt;

This key points Setup to the section that contains descriptions for a particular
network adapter card. The &lt;netcard inf options&gt; for particular cards can
be found in the [Options] section of the corresponding Oemnadxx.inf files.
Example:

  [Installadapters]
  AMDPCN = AMDPCNParameters

&lt;oem path&gt;

The oem_path points to the location of the OEM supplied files. If the path starts
with a drive letter, then the literal path is used to find the OEM driver. If,
however, the path starts with a backwards slash (\), then the path given may be
appended to the path to the installation source. Example: for a driver located
in $OEM$\NET\subdirectory_a, oem_path would be set to
\$OEM$\NET\subdirectory_a.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

[&lt;netcard parameter section&gt;]

This section contains the parameters for a particular network adapter card whose
&lt;netcard inf option&gt; has been specified in the [&lt;Detect Adapters
Section&gt;] or the [&lt;Install Adapters Section&gt;] of the Unattend.txt file.
These values can be found by parsing the appropriate Oemnadxx.inf, or
oemsetup.inf file for the network card. They can also be found by looking the in
the registry of a Window NT computer with the adapter already installed and
functioning properly. To do this, use Regedt32.exe and look in the following
registry key:

  Hkey_local_machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\&lt;%netcardkeyname%&gt;;X

where X = 1 or ordinal of adapter installed. In this key look at the parameters
key and note the values.

NOTE: All values in the registry appear as Hex but in your unattend.txt file,
these values must be converted to decimal. For example, the value of
IOBaseAddress =0x300 in the registry must be set to IOBaseAddress = 768 in the
answer file. Listed below is an example of these parameters:

  [EE16Params]
  !AutoNetInterfaceType = 1
  Transceiver = 3
  !AutoNetBusNumber = 0
  IoChannelReady = 2
  IoBaseAddress = 784
  InterruptNumber = 10

NOTE: These values differ for each type of network card but the numbers must
always appear in decimal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
