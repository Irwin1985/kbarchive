-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 systems being used to distribute DLC
802.2 link services for use by branch SNA Servers and/or Host Integration 2000
servers in a Distributed Link Service (DLS) environment may experience an
application exception in Snalink!UpdateDLSData.

NOTE: The problem only occurs when a DLS connection terminates unexpectedly.
Therefore, the Application Event log may contain events normally associated with
connection outages prior to the application exception. Common connection outage
events logged by SNA Server/HIS 2000 include the following events: 23, 227, 226.

CAUSE
=====

The application exception occurs when a NULL message pointer is passed into the
UpdateDLSData function.
