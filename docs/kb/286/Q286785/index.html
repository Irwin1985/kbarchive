-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Neither the DblClick() event of all Visual FoxPro (VFP) base controls, nor
controls within the VFP integrated development environment (IDE) itself, respond
when all of the following are true:

- VFP, or an application that was created with VFP, is running on a Microsoft
  Windows 2000 server with Terminal Services installed.

- The application is being used through a Terminal Services client session.

- The Terminal Services client session is using Citrix MetaFrame ICA client
  software.

Users may need to triple-click in order to perform actions that normally require
only a double-click.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Microsoft Terminal Server client does not have this problem. If using the
Microsoft client is not an option, however, Citrix has posted a hotfix that
resolves this issue.

To locate this hotfix, browse to the following Web site

  Citrix Solution Knowledge Base
  http://knowledgebase.citrix.com

and search for the Document ID CTX805270. According to Citrix, applying this
hotfix resolves a problem in which "... using Visual FoxPro and browsing a
table, users had to triple-click on a Memo field to view it."

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

These steps assume the availability of a Windows Terminal Server computer that is
running Citrix MetaFrame version 1.8 Service Pack 1 and the Citrix ICA client
software. VFP should be installed on the server.

1. Connect to a Windows Terminal Server that is running Citrix MetaFrame 1.8 SP1
  using the Citrix ICA client.

2. Open VFP, and then open a new form in the form designer.

3. Double-click the form.

At this point, a code window usually opens and allows you to edit the FORM.Load
event. However, in this case you do not see this window, because the designer
does not respond properly to the double-click.
