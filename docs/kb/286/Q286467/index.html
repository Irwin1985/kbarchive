If the problem continues to occur, remove and then reinstall the game. To do
this, use the following methods in the order in which they are presented.

  Change/Remove.

Delete the MechWarrior Vengeance Folder

5. Click Find Now.

6. Right-click the MechWarrior Vengeance folder, click Delete, and then click

Clean Boot the Computer
-----------------------

To clean boot the computer, use the appropriate method for your version of
Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows Me:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click Selective startup.

3. Click to clear all of the check boxes under Selective startup.

4. On the Startup tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box.


5. Click OK. When you see the prompt to restart your computer, click Yes. After
  the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the check boxes you cleared in the General tab are still
cleared. Proceed to step 6 if all of the check boxes are cleared. If you see a
disabled or gray check box, your computer is not clean-booted and you may need
assistance from the manufacturer of the program that places a check mark back
into Msconfig.

6. After you verify that your computer is clean-booted in step 5, you can
  isolate the issue. If the original issue does not reoccur after the clean
  boot, select one item at a time under Selective startup, and then restart the
  computer to see if the additional entry reproduces the original issue.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.
