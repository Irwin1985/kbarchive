-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are executing a query against the DB2OLEDB drive, you may experience an
error message similar to this:

     Interface: Unknown
     Result: 0x80004005 = E_FAIL

This error will occur if you are trying to retrieve a DB2 data column that is
more than 300 bytes in length, with the host character code set identifier
(CCSID) set to "290". The ODBC driver would work fine.

CAUSE
=====

SNANLS.dll, which handles converting single-byte character stream (SBCS)
EBCDIC-to-Unicode-to-ANSI and SBCS ANSI-to-Unicode-to-EBCDIC, was overrunning a
static buffer.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+-------------------------------+
| Filename   | Date     | Time  | 
+-------------------------------+
| SNANLS.dll | 01/22/01 | 12:00 | 
+-------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0.
