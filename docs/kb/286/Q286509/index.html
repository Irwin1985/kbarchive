-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
- Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to enable the Global Positioning System (GPS) features in
Streets and Trips 2001 or Microsoft MapPoint 2001, you may receive the following
error message:

  No GPS device found on this machine. Verify your GPS device is connected and
  turned on. Choose Configure GPS Receiver from the GPS menu to ensure that
  your device is attached properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditioning is true:

- The GPS Device is not plugged into your computer.

- The GPS add-in is not configured to the correct port.

- The GPS device is not set to NMEA 2.0 compliance.

- The GPS device is plugged into the communications (COM) port that is in use
  by another program.

- The computer has infrared ports that have the same interrupt request (IRQ) as
  the COM port.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow the troubleshooting steps below.

Make Sure the GPS Device Is Configured Properly
-----------------------------------------------

The GPS device should be configured to the following settings:

1. On the Tools menu in Expedia Streets and Trips 2001 or in MapPoint 2001,
  point to GPS, and then click Configure GPS Receiver.

2. Select an available communications (COM) port from the list, and then click
  Next.

3. Click OK.

The device should meet the following requirements:

- INTERFACE should be NMEA/NMEA.

- The Standard should be NMEA 0183 2.0.

- The baud rate should be 4800.

Check the GPS Device in HyperTerminal
-------------------------------------

1. Start HyperTerminal.

2. On the "Make new connection" screen, type 'test' into the field name and
  click OK.

3. On the next screen, in the "connect using" box, select "Direct to Com X"
  where X is either 1 or 2. Click OK.

4. On the Port Setting screen, change "Bits per second" to 4800 and "flow
  control" to "none".

5. Click OK.

At this point you should start seeing a continual stream of data, which looks
something like this:

$GPRMB,A,,,,,,,,,,,,V*71
$GPGGA,225224,3400.000,N,06854.375,E,1,07,2.0,638.3,M,-37.5,M,,*6D
$GPGSA,A,3,06,10,17,,22,23,,26,30,,,,4.3,2.0,3.0*33
$GPGSV,3,1,09,06,86,096,51,10,18,043,40,17,49,307,47,21,04,225,00*74
$GPGSV,3,2,09,22,14,310,39,23,40,223,46,24,04,081,00,26,37,119,45*7B
$GPGSV,3,3,09,30,24,202,42,,,,,,,,,*43
$PGRME,15.0,M,22..5,M,15.0,M*1B
$PGRMM,WGS 84*06

If the data is obviously garbled, as in the following

lkdxflkhglkjhflkllkj^%^%#$*(%)%)()($)()(___$%()*)#$%___%(*)#(*()*
#*#$(*)(*$^________$^(
*($*$(^________$#*^%)$
#$*(!%*($_^++$+OI{*U{NE(R(){E09[b*%}*$#+NB*6NB8646n__*^4n0b5e796n3876
__%*($N+BW)$_^N^N0964w--___#(*^%NB+W{$=6n0BW(*n4){)(Wu6n

there is probably a communication problem between the GPS and the computer.

Occasionally, problems such as these can be resolved by modifying the settings of
the GPS or the serial port. If this does not resolve the issue, contact your GPS
manufacturer.

Clean Boot the Computer
-----------------------

Clean boot your computer. To do this, use the appropriate method for your version
of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me):

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click "Selective startup".

3. Click to clear all of the check boxes under "Selective startup".

4. On the "Startup" tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box.


5. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes. After
  the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

  IMPORTANT: Look closely at the General tab to ensure that the check boxes you
  cleared are still cleared. Proceed to step 6 if none of the check boxes is
  selected. If you see an unavailable check box (appears dimmed), your computer
  is not truly "clean-booted" and you may need assistance from the manufacturer
  of the program that places a check mark back into Msconfig.

6. After you verify that your computer is clean-booted in step 5, you can
  isolate the issue. If the original issue does not reoccur after the clean
  boot, select one item at a time under "Selective startup", and then restart
  the computer to see if the additional entry reproduces the original issue.

How to Return from a Clean Boot State
-------------------------------------

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click "Normal startup".

3. Click OK. Click Yes when you are prompted to restart your computer.

Microsoft Windows 98:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:
   - Process Config.sys File

   - Process Autoexec.bat File

   - Process Winstart.bat File (if available)

   - Process Win.ini File

   - Load Startup Group Items

4. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q192926 How to Perform Clean-Boot Troubleshooting for Windows 98

Microsoft Windows 95:

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, and then select Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

2. At the command prompt, type "win" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER. Press and hold down the SHIFT key until the Windows startup
  sequence is complete.

3. Disable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer.

  For information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
  documentation for the program.

4. Quit all running programs except Explorer and Systray. To do this, press
  CTRL+ALT+DELETE, click the program that you want to quit, and then click End
  Task. If you receive a message that the program is busy or not responding,
  click End Task again. Repeat this step to quit all programs except Explorer
  and Systray.

  Q177604 Multimedia: Troubleshooting Using Clean Boot of Windows 95

Decrease the COM Port Buffer
----------------------------

The buffer settings are located in the Device Manager under the appropriate COM
port's "Advanced Settings" button. Decreasing these settings may allow a GPS to
be seen or to function more reliably within the application.

Issues That Are BIOS Related
----------------------------

The following contains suggestions for changing settings in the basic
input/output system (BIOS). Improperly setting some options in the BIOS could
cause significant problems on the system. Please consult your reference manual
when working in the BIOS and use caution.

Some BIOS support what is called "serial timeout." If this is turned on, problems
may arise. Set this to OFF. Make sure that the resource hexadecimal address and
IRQ match those in Device Manager as well.
Also note that Infrared ports can often cause trouble with GPS detection. If the
option is available, DISABLE the infrared port.

Check IR Port and Modem Settings
--------------------------------

In some cases, it may be necessary to disable the IR port or to disable or remove
an internal modem (scanner card, bus mouse card, and so on) which may be sharing
a virtual COM port with the computers external serial port. For example, if a
modem that is installed uses COM3, it may not be possible for a GPS device to be
seen within the software if the GPS is attached to COM1.

Check for and Remove Ghost Devices
----------------------------------

To remove ghost devices, follow the steps below in the order given.

Check Device Manager:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

  modem software and infrared support software, specifically infrared support
  for Windows 95 version 2.0.

- Look for and remove any software that is for infrared or COM port use.
