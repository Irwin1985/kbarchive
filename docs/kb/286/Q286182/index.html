SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a method to convert a raw security identifier (SID) into a
string security identifier (SID) by using Microsoft Visual Basic on Windows NT
4.0 or Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SID Components
--------------

An SID value includes components that provide information about the SID structure
and components that uniquely identify a trustee. An SID consists of the
following components:

- The revision level of the SID structure.

- A 48-bit identifier authority value that identifies the authority, such as a
  Windows NT/Windows 2000 domain, that issued the SID.

- A variable number of subauthority or relative identifier (RID) values that
  uniquely identify the trustee relative to the authority that issued the SID.

The combination of the identifier authority value and the subauthority values
ensures that no two SIDs will be the same, even if two different SID-issuing
authorities issue the same combination of RID values. Each SID-issuing authority
issues a given RID only once.

SIDs are stored in binary format in an SID structure. To display an SID, you can
call the ConvertSidToStringSid function to convert a binary SID to string
format. To convert an SID string back to a valid, functional SID, call the
ConvertStringSidToSid function.

These functions use the following standardized string notation for SIDs, which
makes it simpler to visualize their components:

  S-R-I-S-S...

In this notation, the literal character "S" identifies the series of digits as an
SID, "R" is the revision level, "I" is the identifier-authority value, and
"S..." is one or more subauthority values.

The following example uses this notation to display the well-known
domain-relative SID of the local Administrators group:

  S-1?5-32-544

In this example, the SID has the following components. The constants in
parentheses are well-known identifier authority and RID values defined in
WINNT.H.

- A revision level of "1".

- An identifier-authority value of "5" (SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY).

- A first subauthority value of "32" (SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID).

- A second subauthority value of "544" (DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_ADMINS).

Notice that the subauthority values are long integers. This makes converting the
raw SID into its string form very straightforward.

General Steps in the Conversion Process
---------------------------------------

1. Bind to a user object either by creating it or by using its ADsPath.

2. Retrieve the ObjectSID property.

3. Use the Convert_ObjectSID_To_SDDL function provided in the Visual Basic code
  section of this article.

  The code is very well commented. Each step in the process is explained
  carefully. If the general flow is still unclear, consult MSDN
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/default.asp) for additional details.

How to Use the Visual Basic Code Provided
-----------------------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic project.

2. Create a new Visual Basic code module inside the project.

3. Copy and paste the following code into a new Visual Basic module.
