The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 contains a flaw that affects
the way that a URL is handled if it has a specific construction and its length
is within a very narrow range of values. If such a URL were repeatedly sent to
an affected system, a confluence of events could cause a memory allocation error
that would result in the failure of the IIS service.

IIS 5.0 is affected by the same vulnerability as the Microsoft Exchange 2000
Server vulnerability that is described in the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q287678 XWEB: Malformed URL Can Cause Service Failure in IIS 5.0 and Exchange
  2000 Server

Mitigating factors:

- The vulnerability would not enable the attacker to gain any administrative
  control over the server or to alter any data on it.

- The affected services automatically restart in the event of a failure;
  therefore, an affected system would resume service almost immediately.

- A successful attack against an Exchange server would only disrupt Web-based
  mail clients' use of the server. The server would continue to be available
  for MAPI-based clients such as Microsoft Outlook.

- The ISAPI involved in this vulnerability authenticates the user before
  servicing the request; therefore, a properly configured Exchange server would
  be at less risk than an IIS server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

IMPORTANT: Because the flaw occurs in two different code modules, one of which is
installed as part of IIS 5.0 and both of which are installed as part of Exchange
2000, it is important for Exchange 2000 administrators to install both the IIS
and Exchange patches below.
