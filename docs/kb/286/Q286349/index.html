-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Host Print service (Nnaprint.exe) that is included with SNA Server and Host
Integration Server 2000 may experience an application exception in function
TRNSDT!ibm_pc when it is processing multiple print jobs. If DRWTSN32.exe is
configured as the system's default debugger and it is configured to create a
User.dmp, the stack dump shown in the User.dmp will be similar to the
following:

&gt; KS
0cb7fab0  630023b8  0x00000000
0cb7faf0  630017b2  TRNSDT!ibm_pc+0x3d8
0cb7fba4  60d96fc9  TRNSDT!TrnsDt+0x632
00000037  00000000  PPD3270!cnvprtbuf+0x162 [ s3dsdbj.c @ 3065 ]

CAUSE
=====

The application exception described in this article is caused by problems
loading and unloading TRNSDT.dll, which is used for National Language Support
(NLS) in SNA Server and Host Integration Server 2000. There are conditions under
which a print server thread could unload this DLL while another print server
thread is still using it. This can result in a NULL pointer being passed to the
failing function, resulting in an application exception.


RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+------------------------------------+
| File name   | Date       | Time    | 
+------------------------------------+
| Ppd3270.dll | 01/25/2001 | 02:11PM | 
+------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



Host Integration Server 2000

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0 (all SP), 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, and Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the documented instance of this problem, the Drwtsn32.log did not contain the
FAULT, so it was not useful in determining the failing function. However, the
Drwtsn32.log may contain more information on other systems that experience this
failure. In these cases, the failing stack will look similar to the User.dmp
stack shown here. In addition, the Drwtsn32.log file will contain information
similar to the following when Snaprint.exe traps:

Application exception occurred:
       App: obj\i386\snaprint.exe (pid=188)
       When:  11/21/2000 @ 10:37:16.503
       Exception number:  c0000005 (access violation)

NOTE: There may be application exceptions in Snaprint.exe that are caused by
problems other then the one described here.
