Product(s): See article

In a Microsoft QuickBASIC program, the output from either a compiled
or interpreted program can be redirected from the SCREEN to a file by
using the redirection "&gt;" operator in MS-DOS. This will also redirect
stream devices, such as the LPT1 printer, to MS-DOS.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 for MS-DOS, to Microsoft QuickBASIC Interpreter (Academic
Edition) Version 1.00, and to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00,
and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC PDS Version
7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

----------------

The following are the only two forms of output from BASIC that can be
redirected to a file:

1. Output from the standard PRINT statement

2. Output from the PRINT #Num, statement, where #Num is the "CONS:"
   device OPENed for output (OPEN "CONS:" FOR OUTPUT AS #Num)

Also, if you are testing a program inside the editor environment in
QB.EXE from QuickBASIC Version 4.00, 4.00b, or 4.50, QBX.EXE from
BASIC PDS 7.00, or in QBI.EXE from QuickBASIC Interpreter (Academic Edition)
Version 1.00, you can redirect the output of all programs run in the
environment, as follows:

   QB  &gt; LPT1
   QBX &gt; LPT1
or
   QBI &gt; LPT1

The QB, QBX, or QBI editor environment will behave normally, but
output from the BASIC program running in the environment will be
redirected to the printer. You can also redirect to a file on disk
as follows:

   QB  &gt; myfile.dat
   QBX &gt; myfile.dat
or
   QBI &gt; myfile.dat

The screen output obtained by opening the "SCRN:" FOR OUTPUT AS #Num2,
and executing the statement PRINT #Num2 can't be redirected to a file.

The following is an example of redirecting the output of a QuickBASIC
program to a file:

Code Example
------------

OPEN "CONS:" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
OPEN "SCRN:" FOR OUTPUT AS #2

PRINT "This is a regular print"
PRINT #2, "This is a print to scrn:"
PRINT "This is a regular print"
PRINT #1, "This is a print to cons:"

CLOSE #1
CLOSE #2
END

Once the program is compiled, you can redirect the output to a file by
executing the following line at the DOS prompt:

   EXEName &gt; OutputFileName

When this is executed, the OutputFileName will contain the following:

   This is a regular print
   This is a regular print
   This is a print to cons:

And the screen will contain the following:

   This is a print to scrn:
