This article demonstrates how to control the text mode cursor by
directly accessing the BIOS with CALL INTERRUPT. There are two ways to
control the text mode cursor. The BASIC LOCATE statement enables a
program to position the cursor, size the cursor, and turn the cursor
on and off. This article describes how this can be done by CALLing the
BIOS INTERRUPT 10 hex, with function 12 hex, with subfunction 34 hex,
which allows a program to turn the cursor on or off. BIOS INTERRUPT 10
hex with function 1 allows a program to set the cursor size.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50
for MS-DOS and to Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.00, and 6.00b for MS-DOS
and Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00 for MS-DOS.

The text mode cursor and its size, blinking, and position are all
controlled by the video hardware. The text mode cursor is not created
by the QuickBASIC editor, compiler, or its applications. Because the
hardware supports cursor emulation only in text mode (that is, SCREEN
0 in BASIC) there is no graphics mode cursor. This is not a problem or
limitation of QuickBASIC.

Even though there is no hardware-generated blinking cursor in a
graphics mode, the BIOS does keep track of the current text position.
The program can call BIOS INTERRUPT &amp;H10 functions &amp;H2 and &amp;H3 to get
and set the current position of the cursor. If desired, a graphics
mode cursor can be placed on the screen by the program itself. BASIC
uses a solid, nonblinking block cursor in graphics mode. This graphics
mode cursor is placed there by the QuickBASIC editor and compiler.

The cursor is controlled by CALLing BIOS service routines that allow
the cursor to be enabled, disabled, and resized. The largest possible
cursor fills one entire character box. Depending on the graphics
adapter, one character box can have a different number of scan lines.
For the BIOS routines to work regardless of the video adapter, the
BIOS routines assume that there is an 8-pixel by 8-scan-line format
for the cursor. This means that you can set the cursor to eight
different sizes by CALLing the BIOS.

For more information on CALLing both BIOS and DOS INTERRUPTs query
on the word QB4INT.

The following code example demonstrates how to use the BIOS service
routines to turn the cursor off, turn it back on, and how to resize
the cursor to each of the possible sizes.

Code Example
------------

REM $INCLUDE: 'qb.bi'
' FOR QBX.EXE editor the include file is 'QBX.BI'

DIM inregs AS regtype, outregs AS regtype
CLS
' Set up the parameters to disable the cursor emulation.
inregs.ax = &amp;H1201  ' AH = 12H for function 12H
                    ' AL = 1 to disable the cursor.
inregs.bx = &amp;H34    ' Subfunction 34
' Disable the cursor:
' For QB.EXE : run QB /L QB.QLB, or LINK to QB.LIB, to enable
'    CALL INTERRUPT.
' For QBX.EXE: run QBX/L QBX.QLB, or LINK to QBX.LIB, to enable
'    CALL INTERRUPT.
CALL interrupt(&amp;H10, inregs, outregs)
PRINT "The cursor should be off. Hit ENTER to bring it back "
WHILE INKEY$ = "": WEND

' Set up parameters to enable cursor emulation.
inregs.ax = &amp;H1200 ' AH = 12H for function 12H
                   ' AL = 0 to enable the cursor.
inregs.bx = &amp;H34   ' BX = 34H for subfunction 34H.

'Enable cursor emulation.
CALL interrupt(&amp;H10, inregs, outregs)

' Even though the cursor has been enabled, it will not show.
' This is because we need to set the size.  The following
' loop cycles through the sizes.

FOR i = 1 TO 8 ' 0 - 8 is the maximum size.

   inregs.ax = &amp;H100 ' AH = 1 for function 1.
   inregs.cx = i     ' CH = 0 for starting line.
                     ' CL = ending line.
   CALL interrupt(&amp;H10, inregs, outregs)
   PRINT "Hit return to increase the cursor size: "
   WHILE INKEY$ = "": WEND
NEXT
END
