To enter most ASCII character byte values in the QB.EXE editor,
including characters without their own keys, you can hold down the ALT
key while typing in the numeric value for the character on the numeric
keypad and then releasing the ALT key. The character with that code
will be inserted at the current cursor position. For example,
ALT+1+7+2 is the symbol for one-fourth (1/4).

Extended ASCII characters (values 128 to 255) are useful for typing
line-drawing characters, foreign alphabet characters, or other special
symbols into quoted strings or comments (REM or ') in your code. For
example, QCARDS.BAS for QuickBASIC 4.50 uses extended ASCII characters
to make attractive screen boxes.

This information applies to QB.EXE in Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions
2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS, to QB.EXE in
Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS, and to
QBX.EXE in Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

Most of the ASCII characters (32 through 255) can be entered using the
ALT key, including the normal alphabetic characters. For example, if
the ALT key is held down while the number 65 is typed on the numeric
keypad (with NUM LOCK active) and then ALT is released, "A" is
inserted at the current cursor position, since the ASCII code for "A"
is 65 (decimal). This ALT key technique also works at the MS-DOS
command line and in many other programs in MS-DOS.

How to Handle ASCII 0-31 Control Codes
--------------------------------------

Note that you cannot use the above ALT key method to embed ASCII
character codes 0 through 31 into your source code. (ASCII characters
0 through 31, which are often called control characters, have special
program-specific meanings.) You also cannot type ASCII 240 using the
ALT key in QB.EXE or QBX.EXE (ALT+2+4+0). If you want to use a
character with ASCII value 0-31 or 240 as output from your BASIC
program, you can use the CHR$() function to generate the character.
The CHR$() function can be used to generate any ASCII (0-127) or
extended-ASCII (128-255) character for output from a BASIC program.

However, in QuickBASIC 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and in Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b, the PRINT statement does not display
any character for control codes 7, 9-13, and 28-31 at run time
(whether the character is embedded in a string with CTRL+P or created
with the CHR$() function). For more information, query on the
following words:

   ASCII and PRINT and SCRN and CONS

NOTE: In QB.EXE 4.00 and later and in QBX.EXE 7.00, you can use the
CTRL+P key to enter some of the control codes from 1 through 31. As an
example, for 1 press CTRL+P+A, for 2 press CTRL+P+B, for 3 press
CTRL+P+C, ..., and for 31 press CTRL+P+_ (CTRL+P+underscore).
Many of these control codes can be typed into string constants or
comments in your source code. WARNING: BC.EXE may not accept some
control codes embedded in your source file. Also, the QBX.EXE editor
does not let you enter the following CTRL+P sequences: CTRL+P+@ (0),
CTRL+P+J (10), CTRL+P+M (13), CTRL+P+\ (28), or CTRL+P+^ (30).
Microsoft recommends using the CHR$() function to generate the control
characters you need instead of typing control characters directly into
the source file.
