SUMMARY
=======

In FoxPro versions 2.x, many developers used the SCATTER and GATHER commands to
edit data in memory variables. These commands allowed the developer to verify
the contents of each field before placing the data in the .DBF file, and
resolved some record locking issues.

Visual FoxPro has added a data buffering feature that can be used as an
alternative approach to using SCATTER and GATHER in your programs. Data
buffering provides the following benefits to you as a developer:

- When you use buffering, you can automatically access the validation rules for
  fields and records that have been entered into the data base container. When
  you use memory variables, you cannot automatically access these rules.

- You can determine when a record is locked (prior to editing, or after editing
  and before saving) to handle contention for record locks in a multiuser
  environment. In this respect, the buffering features eliminate the need for
  READ NOLOCK.

- Table buffering allows you to save edits for multiple records in memory at
  the same time. For example, you can keep all of the line items for an invoice
  in memory and write them at one time if the user chooses to save the invoice.

- Visual FoxPro provides several new functions to assist you in applying or
  discarding updates to a table, and in verifying data integrity in a multiuser
  environment.

Step-by-Step Example for Implementing Buffering in a Form
---------------------------------------------------------

You can easily implement buffering in a form as an alternative to scatter and
gather. The following example walks you through the process of creating a table
with validation on a specific field and designing a form that uses buffering to
enforce this validation on a form.

1. In the Command window, issue this command:

     SET DEFAULT TO \VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP\DATA

2. Create a new form.

3. From the View menu, choose Data Environment. From the Data Environment menu,
  choose Add Table. Add an existing .DBF to the data environment. To take
  advantage of field or record level validation, you must make the .DBF part of
  a database container and must have validation rules defined in the .DBC file.

4. Drag one or more fields from the data environment window to the form.

5. Set the Form.BufferMode property to 2 for Optimistic Buffering. This will set
  optimistic table buffering for any grids bound to data and optimistic row
  buffering for all other controls bound to a data source.

6. Add a command group to the form. Set the ButtonCount property to 2. Set the
  caption of the first button to "Save" and the caption of the second button to
  "Cancel."

7. To allow users to save changes to the table, add the following code to the
  command1.click method:

     lUpdated = TABLEUPDATE()
     IF !lUpdated
        =MESSAGEBOX("Update failed", 64)
     ENDIF
     THISFORM.REFRESH

8. To allow users to cancel changes to the table, add the following code to the
  command2.click button:

     iRecords = TABLEREVERT()
     =MESSAGEBOX("Changes to " + STR(iRecords, 2) + " were discarded", 64)
     THISFORM.REFRESH

9. Save and run the form.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

You probably will want to add the following additional features to your form:

- Navigation buttons to allow movement between records.

- An on error handling routine to handle error 109, "Record in use by another."

- An expansion of step 7 to allow for common scenarios that would cause the
  tableupdate() function to fail. Possible reasons for failure include an
  inability to lock the record and the possibility that another user modified
  the record while the current user was editing it.

You do not need to write individual field-level validation routines for any table
that is part of a database container (DBC). The form automatically accesses any
validation rules or triggers contained in the DBC. The user won't be able to
move the pointer (cursor) off of an offending field until a valid value is
placed in the field.

You do not need to write code to save the initial values of each field. The
CURVAL(), OLDVAL(), and GETFLDSTATE() functions can be useful in handling
situations where a different user has modified the current record.
