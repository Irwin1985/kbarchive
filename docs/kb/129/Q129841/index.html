The following topics are covered:

- Various Locations: Author Comments and Corrections

- Pages 58-59: TypeDef Blocks Don't Use "Dim" Prefix

- Book Idea: Add SolverReset to Appendix H

- Page 644: Eighth Argument Changed from Search to SearchOption

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Various Locations: Author Comments and Corrections
--------------------------------------------------

- Inside front cover:

  In the object model diagrams on the inside front cover and on page 18, there
  is an object listed as "online"; this object should actually be "OutLine."

- Pages 600 and 601:

  The Windows API calls listed on pages 600 and 601 don't work under Microsoft
  Windows NT. A disclaimer should be added where necessary to state this fact.

  Information on the appropriate 32-bit calls will be addressed in the next
  edition.

Pages 58-59: TypeDef Blocks Don't Use "Dim" Prefix
--------------------------------------------------

The code in CHAP02.XLS in module Chap02d runs flawlessly and contains the
following TypeDef block:

     Type PersonalData
        PName as String
        PAge as Integer
        PBirthDate as Date
     End Type

However, the same block, as written on pages 58 and 59, will produce syntax
errors if typed in as written. The TypeDef block as written on these pages is as
follows:

     Type PersonalData
        Dim PName as String
        Dim PAge as Integer
        Dim PBirthDate as Date
     End Type

NOTE: This TypeDef block is the same on both pages 58 and 59.

Correction:

Remove the "Dim" prefix from the TypeDef blocks on pages 58 and 59.

Page 456: Functions Are not Volatile By Default
-----------------------------------------------

The FYI on page 456 states that functions are volatile by default. This is
incorrect; functions are nonvolatile by default.

Add SolverReset to Appendix H
-----------------------------

Information on the SolverReset function will be added to the "Programming with
Solver" appendix in the next edition of this book.

Page 644: Eighth Argument Changed from Search to SearchOption
-------------------------------------------------------------

In Appendix H, on page 644, under "SolverOptions," the eighth argument for the
SolverOptions function is listed as "Search," when it should be listed as
"SearchOption."

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
