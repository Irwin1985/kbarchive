SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the S3-based video drivers, as outlined in the Microsoft Wine
Guide 1.0 README.TXT file, the Wine Guide Introduction screen is not displayed
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Although the Windows Setup screen indicates that the newer S3 video drivers
(version 2.41) are installed, the actual S3 driver file S3FLAT.DRV did not get
copied to the &lt;drive&gt;:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory (where &lt;drive&gt; is
the letter of the hard disk drive that contains the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
subdirectory).

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either of the following methods to rename the S3FLAT.DRV file located in the
&lt;drive&gt;:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory (where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of
the hard disk drive that contains the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory).

Method 1
--------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, switch to the WINDOWS subdirectory on your hard
  disk drive, and type "setup" (without the quotation marks).

2. From the Display field, select the S3 2.41 video driver with a resolution of
  at least 256 colors.

3. Press the ENTER key twice.

4. The next screen indicates that you already have the S3 2.41 video driver
  installed on the system. Press the ESC key to replace the current driver.

5. Enter the Microsoft Wine Guide 1.0 path where the S3 video drivers were
  copied to the hard disk and press the ENTER key. For example, if a
  subdirectory called C:\VIDEO was created and used for the location of the S3
  video driver, then the path would be as follows:

  C:\VIDEO

Method 2
--------

1. Double-click the Windows Setup icon located in the Main group.

2. From the Options menu, choose Change System Settings.

3. Click the Display box arrow and from the list of video drivers select "Other
  Display (Requires Disk From OEM)" and choose OK.

4. Type the path to which you copied the video drivers from the Microsoft Wine
  Guide 1.0 disk. For example, if a subdirectory called C:\VIDEO was created
  and used for the location of the S3 video driver, then the path would be as
  follows:

  C:\VIDEO

5. When the display box indicates that you already have the driver on your
  system, choose the New button (not the Current button).

6. Choose Restart Windows.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online Help.

researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
