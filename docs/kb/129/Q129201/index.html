The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the OS/2 version 1.3 system software (included with the Mail
Multitasking version 3.2), and you encounter an error, the most likely cause is
a system or hardware problem.

Below are three examples of the most common errors, along with their causes and
solutions.

1. SYS1733 error

  This error message may be displayed during installation. A SYS1733 occurs
  because the country information file A:\COUNTRY.SYS is incorrect; the system
  has stopped.

  This error explanation is likely misleading as it rarely explains the cause.

  See the Cause section below for likely reasons for this error.

2. Fdisk Unsuccessful or Cannot Locate Fixed Disk Drive errors

  One or both of these errors occur when the hard drive and/or adapter require a
  .BID file not included on the Installation disks A and B.

3. Looping on reboot after installation

  After you install OS/2 and reboot your system, the computer reboots in an
  infinite loop until you insert a bootable floppy.

CAUSE
=====

1. SYS1733 error

  The error stems from a hardware configuration problem. Known causes are:

   - Misconfigured CMOS for the floppy disk drives.

   - Missing one of two floppy disk drives, but CMOS states both exist.

   - Incorrect SCSI configurations.

2. Fdisk Unsuccessful or Cannot Locate Fixed Disk

  The installation requires a special .BID file not included with the OS/2
  installation disks A and B. A BID file is a Layered Device Driver
  Architecture (LADDR) driver for hard drives and adapters. Some PC computer
  hardware manufacturers require a proprietary .BID file.

3. Looping on reboot after installation

  The most likely cause is selecting the wrong mouse driver during the
  installation process.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. SYS1733 error

  To see if your CMOS is configured incorrectly, check your computer's BIOS
  setup parameters and verify they match the drives physically installed. To
  see if you have a misconfigured SCSI adapter card check the card's settings
  against the documented settings in the adapter's installation manual.

2. Fdisk Unsuccessful or Cannot Locate Fixed Disk errors

  To resolve the error and complete installation, try the following steps:

   - If you used Installation Disk A to boot the PC, try Installation Disk B
     and vice versa. This will insure that all .BID files have been tried and
     tested.

   - Contact the disk adapter manufacturer and request a .BID file for the
     adapter model. Once the .BID file is obtained you must:

     a. Make a copy of your Installation disk A

     b. Delete all the .BID files on the disk A copy

     c. Copy the new .BID file to the disk A copy

     d. Rename the new file to BOOTBID.BID.

   - Reboot the computer with the newly modified Installation disk and proceed
     with installing OS/2.

3. Looping on reboot after installation

  Reboot OS/2 using the Installation disk and select the appropriate mouse
  driver for your configuration. If the problem persists, edit the CONFIG.SYS
  and remark out the suspect mouse driver as shown:

  rem DEVICE=C:\OS2\MOUSE.SYS TYPE MSSER$

  Reboot the OS/2 computer.
