SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the following code to set a Form variable to nothing, the form does
not unload:

     Set Form1 = Nothing

CAUSE
=====

Setting a form to nothing releases the handle or reference that Visual Basic has
to the form, but it does not cause the underlying form to be unloaded. In fact,
if you set a form to nothing, this invalidates the form variable as a reference
to the form so that later calls such as this fail:

     Unload Form1

Then you have to reference the form via the Forms collection.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Unload statement to explicitly unload your forms.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following syntax is perfectly valid for OLE Automation servers and objects
that are created in Visual Basic:

     Dim Obj As Object
     Set Obj = Nothing

OLE Automation servers automatically clean up and unload when their last instance
is set to Nothing. This is not true for forms.

Rules for Instantiating, Loading, Unloading, and Uninstantiating Forms
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The rules for instantiating, loading, unloading, and uninstantiating are as
follows:

A form is instantiated when one of the following occurs:

- It is used in a Set New statement such as Set x = New Form1. However, note
  that Dim As New does not cause instantiation.

- Any member of the form is referenced.

- It is passed as an argument.

A form is loaded when one of the following occurs:

- The Load statement is used on it.

- One of the built-in (not user-defined) properties or methods is referenced.

- A property or method of a control or a control array on the form is
  referenced.

- A control that is a member of a control array is referenced.

- It is the MDI form, and a child form is loaded (this causes a show of the MDI
  form too).

A form is unloaded when:

- The Unload statement is used on it.

A form is uninstantiated when:

- All references to it or any controls or control arrays on it are released,
  AND it is unloaded.

The Forms collection contains all loaded forms, but not forms that are
instantiated yet unloaded.

The Initialize event occurs when a form is instantiated. The Load event occurs
when it is loaded. The Unload event occurs when it is unloaded, and the
Terminate event occurs when it is uninstantiated.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a Module (Module1.BAS) to your Project.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Module1.Bas:

     Global FormVar As Form

     Sub Main()
        Set FormVar = New Form1
        Form1.Show
        Load FormVar
     End Sub

4. Choose Options from the Tools menu. Choose the Project tab on the dialog and
  change the Startup Form to Sub Main.

5. Add three Command buttons (Command1, Command2, and Command3) to Form1.

6. Add the following code to the appropriate procedures:

     Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Set Form1 = Nothing
        Set FormVar = Nothing
        Unload Form1
        ' Unload FormVar
        ' The above line generates an Error if executed.
           ' Error 91 is now:
           ' "Object variable or With block variable not set."
        Msgbox Forms.Count &amp; " forms are still loaded!"
     End Sub

     Sub Command2_Click ()
        For I = Forms.Count-1 to 0 Step -1
           Unload Forms(I)
        Next
     End Sub

     Sub Command3_Click ()
        Unload Form1
        Set Form1 = Nothing
        Unload FormVar
        Set FormVar = Nothing
        Msgbox Forms.Count &amp; " forms are still loaded!"
     End Sub

7. Start the program by choosing Start from the Run menu or by pressing the F5
  key.

8. Click the Command1 button. Note that although Form1 has been set to Nothing
  and explicitly unloaded on the next line, the form does not unload.

9. Click the Command2 button to unload Form1 via the Forms collection.

The Command3_Click procedure shows the correct sequence to use to avoid this
problem. Stop the program and re-run it. Then click only the Command3 button.
Both forms unload properly.
