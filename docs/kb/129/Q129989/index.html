The information in this article applies to:

- MSPRESS Windows NT Resource Guide, (Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit volume 1) ISBN 1-55615-653-7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Windows NT Resource Guide," Windows NT 3.5
Resource Kit volume 1.

The following topics are covered:

- Installation: Remote Command Server Not Installed Properly

- Page 521: Unclear Reference to "NT Remote Access Service Administrator's
  Guide"

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Installation: Remote Command Server Not Installed Properly
----------------------------------------------------------

The "Tools for Windows NT" help file for the "Remote Command Installation"
incorrectly states the following:

  After the installation of the resource kit, the necessary files should be
  copied to the system directory.

  In Program Manager, Control Panel, Network, Add Software, select "Remote
  Command Server."

However, there is no "Remote Command Server" option present.

Comments:

This is a mistake in the documentation. To install the Remote Command Server, you
must first copy the following files from your RESKIT directory to your SYSTEM32
directory:

  RCMD.EXE
  RCMDSVC.EXE
  OEMNSVRC.INF

After you copy these files to your SYSTEM32 directory, the Remote Command Server
will work properly.

From this point, you can follow the installation instructions as written.

Page 521: Unclear Reference to "NT Remote Access Service Administrator's Guide"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reference to the "Windows NT Remote Access Service Administrator's Guide" on
page 521 in paragraph 3 is unclear as to where the cited documentation can be
found.

The appendix title in the same paragraph is also incorrect.

Correction:

Change

  "Windows NT Remote Access Service Administrator's Guide"

to

  "Windows NT Remote Access Service" book, which comes as part of the Windows
  NT Server product documentation. This book is also included in the "Books
  Online" part of Windows NT Server.

The appendix title in the same paragraph should be:

  Appendix B, "Migrating from Earlier Versions of the Remote Access Service"

Comments:

The "Windows NT Remote Access Service" book comes with Windows NT Server as part
of the documentation. This book is also included in the "Books Online" part of
Windows NT Server.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
