SUMMARY
=======

CompuServe offers direct dialup PPP support for accessing the Internet.
CompuServe provides an Internet Dialer program that requires an updated 16- bit
WINSOCK.DLL file that does not function under Windows NT. However, it is
possible to use the Remote Access Service included with Windows NT to connect to
the CompuServe PPP server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To connect to CompuServe PPP server using Windows NT 4.0:

1. Install Remote Access Service (RAS) in the Windows NT Network Control Panel.
  Make sure that "Dial-out only" or "Dial-out and Receive calls" is selected
  for the RAS device, and TCP/IP is one of your installed protocols.

2. Open My Computer and select Dial-Up Networking.

3. Select New, and on the Basic page, enter the entry name, phone number, and
  modem.

4. On the Server page, clear the IPX/SPX Compatible and NetBEUI protocol check
  boxes, and make sure that TCP/IP is selected.

5. On the Script page, select Run this Script and select
  C:\&lt;systemroot&gt;\system32\ras\cis.scp.

6. Click OK to save the new entry.

7. The first time you dial, you will be prompted for a username, password, and
  domain.

  - For username, enter your Compuserve user ID, which is normally something
  like 12345,6789.

  - For password, enter your Compuserve logon password.

  - Leave the domain field blank.

NOTE: Your TCP/IP settings should be automatically established when the
connection is made. You can view your current TCP/IP settings by using the
ipconfig /all command, after the connection is made.

To connect to CompuServe PPP server using Windows NT 3.5x:

1. Install Remote Access Service (RAS) in Windows NT Network Control Panel. Make
  sure that "Dial-out only" or "Dial-out and Receive calls" is selected for the
  RAS device.

2. To make the PPP connection easier, add the following to the
  %SystemRoot%\System32\Ras\Switch.inf file:

  [CIS-Internet]
  COMMAND=&lt;cr&gt;


  OK=&lt;match&gt;":"
  COMMAND=CIS&lt;cr&gt;
  OK=&lt;match&gt;":"
  COMMAND=userid/GO:PPPCONNECT&lt;cr&gt;
  OK=&lt;match&gt;":"
  COMMAND=password&lt;cr&gt;
  OK=&lt;ignore&gt;

  where userid and password equal your actual CompuServe user ID and password.

  NOTE: Anyone who has access to read your Switch.inf file can see your user ID
  and password. If you do not want to use Switch.inf, you can choose terminal
  instead of CIS-Internet in the Security dialog and enter the commands
  manually (click done after entering your password).

  If you perform this manual connection, the strings presented by CompuServe may
  be unreadable but everything will still work. CompuServe uses 7 data bits and
  even parity, and RAS uses 8 data bits and no parity. You can press the PLUS
  SIGN (+) and then ENTER to view the prompts using 8 data bits, but they may
  be garbled again after you enter your user ID. You may need to use GO
  TERMINAL to change your terminal settings on CompuServe. For more information
  contact CompuServe Customer Support.

1. From the Remote Access Service group, start Remote Access, or run RASPHONE.

2. Create a new RAS Phone Book entry.

  a. Click Add to create a new entry in the RAS Phone Book.

  b. Type Entry Name, Phone Number (same local dialup number normally used to
     access CompuServe), and Description.

  c. Click Advanced if you are not already viewing the advanced options.

3. Configure your new Phone Book entry.

  a. Click Network.

  b. Select PPP and make sure the TCP/IP protocol is selected (you can disable
     NetBEUI and IPX).

  c. Select TCP/IP Settings. Select "Server assigned IP address."

  d. Select "Use specific name server addresses" and enter 149.174.211.5
     149.174.213.5 (backup) for the DNS server.

     NOTE: Use 149.174.64.42 as a backup DNS address. These DNS addresses may
     change. If you have problems with DNS resolution, you may need to call
     CompuServe for correct DNS addresses.

  e. Make sure you select the "Use default gateway on remote network" check
     box.

  f. Accept these setting by clicking OK, and then click OK again.

4. Click Security. Change the After dialing Script to CIS- Internet if you
  modified the Switch.inf. Otherwise choose terminal.

You should now be able to connect to the CompuServe PPP dialup service and use
FTP, Telnet, WWW, and other TCP/IP services.

NOTE: In some cases, although you can connect to the CompuServe PPP dialup
service, you may have trouble connecting to Internet hosts. In this case, for
