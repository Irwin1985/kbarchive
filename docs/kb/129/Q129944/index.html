SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic does not provide the capability to return rich error information
from a DLL.

MkTypLib doesn't support '[retval]' on members of a DLL. This means that you
can't define 'Functions' in a DLL that also raises an exception. This is a
restriction in Visual Basic version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic version 3.0 allowed DLLs to specify the error string (but not the
help file or context) via the VBSetErrorMessage call. This call is also
supported for Visual Basic version 4.0 16-bit DLLs.

Visual Basic version 4.0 supports calling DLL members that return HResults. If an
error HResult is returned, Visual Basic version 4.0 maps the HResult to an EB
error if possible and raises an exception with the given EBerr or HResult. If it
is not possible, Visual Basic uses the HResult as is. The restrictions on this
solution are:

- mktyplib doesn't support '[retval]' on members of a DLL. This means that
  users can't define 'Functions' in a DLL that also raises an exception.

- This functionality can only be defined using a TypeLib. It is not possible to
  define this entry point using a Declare statement. If a programmer were to do
  it, they would define the return type as being a long, and Visual Basic would
  not do the appropriate return-type checking to raise an exception for an
  error.

- No rich error information is provided. The only thing that can be returned is
  an error number. Visual Basic attempts to map this error number to a known
  Visual Basic error. If possible, it fills in the description string
  appropriately. Otherwise, it leaves the error alone, and displays 'OLE
  Automation Error' as the error string.

NOTE: In the Visual Basic version 3.0 API, 'VBRuntimeError' also allows the DLL
to specify an error number with Visual Basic version 3.0 providing the error
string. The difference is that because Visual Basic version 4.0 is built on
separate components, Visual Basic for Applications in Visual Basic version 4.0
doesn't know all of the errors that Visual Basic version 3.0 did. That is,
Visual Basic for Applications doesn't know any of the form-specific errors;
however, it is not likely that these are used much by DLL writers.

You can provide DLL-like functionality and be able to return exceptions including
rich-error information by:

- Implementing an OLE object whose members are the exposed functions.

- Tagging the object as an 'AppObject' in the ODL. This tag causes Visual Basic
  for Applications to promote the object's members to be global functions that
  look and behave like standard DLL runtime functions.

Because the implementation is an OLE object, exceptions can be returned in the
same way that exceptions can be returned from any OLE object. The problem with
this solution is that it costly for the DLL developer because the DLL developer
has to implement a full-blown OLE Object for this to work.
