The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro version 3.0 introduces two new features that at first glance
appear to provide almost identical functionality - table buffering and
transaction processing. This article describes the differences and interactions
between buffering and transactions, and it describes scenarios where each or
both would be appropriate.

NOTE: Transactions are limited to tables that are part of a database container
(.DBC file) and cannot be used with a free table.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Overview of Buffering
---------------------

Buffering provides protection against user errors during data input, and it
controls when records are locked. It allows access to the validation rules and
triggers stored in the database container (.DBC file) for fields within tables.

Although you are working directly with a record instead of with memory variables,
the data is not written to the table until it has been verified as acceptable.

Buffering can be optimistic (lock records at the time a write is attempted) or
pessimistic (lock records at the time you begin editing the record). In addition
to specifying whether you are using optimistic or pessimistic buffering, you
specify whether you are using row (write edits as soon as you move the record
pointer) or table buffering (save all edits in a buffer until the programmer
issues a table update command).

When you implement buffering, your edits are stored in a memory buffer. They are
applied when you issue a TABLEUPDATE() function, or when you move the record
pointer if row buffering is being used. If you change your mind and want to
discard changes, a TABLEREVERT function is used to restore the record to its
original state.

Buffering can be substituted for both the READ NOLOCK and SCATTER/GATHER
techniques used in FoxPro versions 2.x.

Overview of Transactions
------------------------

Transactions are used to wrap sets of related updates that should be made as a
unit, or not at all. Transactions protect against system failure or problems
that may occur while you are writing groups of records to a table, such as an
inability to lock a single record involved in a group update.

When all updates have been written to the table successfully, an END TRANSACTION
command is used to commit the updates. If one or more updates fail, a ROLLBACK
command is used to restore the table(s) involved to the original state before
the transaction.

Because the transaction locks all records involved, as well as the index for the
tables involved, other users cannot update the table at all while a transaction
is in progress.

Choosing Between Buffering and Transactions
-------------------------------------------

Use buffering whenever you want to enforce validation rules or triggers that are
contained within a .DBC file. Choose buffering as well when you want to avoid
contentions for locks as users move through a table. You can often use buffering
without transaction processing.

Use transactions whenever you want to protect groups of related updates and
ensure that all or none of the updates take place. Transaction processing should
never be used without buffering.

Using Buffering and Transaction Processing Simultaneously
---------------------------------------------------------

Typically, a table update will be nested within a transaction as follows:

     BEGIN TRANSACTION
        llUpdateSuccessful = TABLEUPDATE()
        IF llUpdateSuccessful
           END TRANSACTION
        ELSE
           ROLLBACK
        ENDIF

If a transaction has been declared, the TABLEUPDATE function writes its changes
into the transaction buffer, not the actual table. Disposition of the contents
of the transaction buffer is then effected by the ROLLBACK or END TRANSACTION
commands.

Usually, you would not issue a TABLEREVERT() before the ROLLBACK command. The
cause of the failure to update would be identified (such as failure to obtain a
lock), and the transaction would be attempted again. If you issued a TABLEREVERT
function within the transaction, all edits in the buffer would be discarded and
the user would have to rekey all of the changes before another update attempt
occurred.

If a system crash occurs while a transaction is active, the data will be "rolled
back" implicitly. Visual FoxPro does not maintain a physical transaction log,
hence all the changes are lost in case of a power failure or other crash.
