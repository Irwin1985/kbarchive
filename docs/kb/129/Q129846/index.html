-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Earlier versions of FoxPro relied on FOXDOC.APP to document applications. Visual
FoxPro no longer includes FOXDOC.APP; is has Documenting wizard that you can use
to document applications. This article describes the Documenting wizard and how
to use it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Documenting Wizard
------------------

The Documenting wizard documents projects and program files. The wizard can also
create an analysis of your code and clean up the formatting in your files. The
Documenting Wizard is included only with the Professional Edition of Visual
FoxPro.

By default, the wizard does not modify your existing files. However, you can
choose to do this in the final step. The wizard prompts you as you go through
these steps:

1. Source File: Enter the name of a project file or a specific program file.

2. Capitalization: Keywords are all the reserved words in the Visual FoxPro
  programming language. Symbols are the variables and names that you define in
  your code.

3. Indentation: Select the desired options to enforce conformity in the
  indentation of your code.

4. Headings: Headings are comments about the code that are relevant to the code
  they precede. They can be placed at the beginning of files, procedures, class
  definitions, and methods to make your formatted code easier to read.

5. Reports: The reports that the wizard creates are actually text files. The
  wizard creates the following types of reports:

     Report Type       File Name    Remarks
     ------------------------------------------------------------
     Action Diagram    project.ACT  Shows the hierarchical
                                    relations within your code. If
                                    you are not working with ASCII
                                    code page 1250 and ANSI code
                                    page 1252, see the directive
                                    "*# document ACTIONCHARS" in
                                    Customizing the Documenting
                                    Wizard.

     Cross-Reference   XREF.LST     Lists all the user-defined
                                    symbols.

     File Listing      FILES.LST    Lists all the files in the
                                    project.

     Source Code       project.LST  Puts all formatted code in a
                                    single Listing file.

     Tree Diagram      TREE.LST     Shows the procedure calling
                                    tree.

  The wizard also automatically creates the following files:

     File Name    Description
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     FILES.DBF    Table with a record for each file in the project.

     FDXREF.DBF   Table with a record for each instance of user
                  symbols in the code.

  The FDXREF.DBF file contains a field named Flag for identifying the
  keywords. The identifiers are as follows:

     Flag  Description
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     B     Base class
     C     Class name
     D     Defined PROC or FUNC (not method)
     F     Function call: myproc( ) or DO myproc
     K     Keyword
     M     Method definition
     N     Name of file
     O     Object
     P     Property of an object
     R     User symbol reference
     V     User symbols (variable) definition (PARA, PRIV, PUBL, DIME)

6. Finish.

By default, the wizard does not overwrite your existing files. Select the
Overwrite Existing Files option to overwrite your existing code files with the
new ones that the wizard saves.

If you select the Place Files In A Single Directory option and then click Finish,
the wizard prompts you to choose a single directory where it will save all the
files it creates.

If you select the Place Files In A New Directory Tree and then click Finish, the
wizard prompts you to choose a directory where it will create a copy of the
project's source tree. It then saves the new, formatted program files in the
appropriate directories of the new tree.

If you select the Cross-Reference Keywords option, the wizard adds records to
FDXREF.DBF for each instance of Visual FoxPro keywords in your code. Depending
on the size of your code, this option may enlarge FDXREF.DBF by a large number
of records. When this option is selected, the wizard matches keywords in your
code with the first field, named Token, in the file FDKEYWRD.DBF. The second
column, Code, in FDKEYWRD.DBF contains an identifier that tells the wizard how
to treat the keyword when analyzing your code.

The following table describes the identifier codes:

 Code   Description
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 I      Indent
 U      Undent (Remove indent)
 R      Reset indentation to 0 (or 1 if InDefineClass)
 F      Proc or function
 D      While or Case: DO clause
 O      Object (Spinner,CommandButton)
 P      Property (Scalemode,DecimalPoints)
 M      Method (Init,KeyPress)
 C      ClauseUsed only as a Clause: can't start a statement

Customizing the Documenting Wizard
----------------------------------

In addition to the options that you choose when running the Documenting Wizard,
you can customize additional options outside the wizard.

Indentation in CASE Structures
------------------------------

By default, the wizard looks for the following indentation in a CASE structure:

     DO CASE
     CASE case1=1
         case2=2
     CASE case3=3
         case4=4
     ENDCASE

Some developers prefer to indent the lines between DO CASE and ENDCASE an
additional level as shown here:

     DO CASE
         CASE case1=1
              case2=2
         CASE case3=3
              case4=4
     ENDCASE

If you indent your CASE structures to look like the second example, specify this
in FDKEYWRD.DBF. To specify this coding style in FDKEYWRD.DBF, change the value
of the Code field to "UU" in the ENDCASE record.

Documenting Wizard Directives
-----------------------------

You can place special directives in your code files to instruct the Documenting
wizard to perform specific tasks when analyzing the code. These directives can
go in two places. Place them in:

- Your project's main program file to instruct the wizard how to analyze all
  code files in the project.

- Individual code files to instruct the wizard how to analyze specific files.

Each directive begins with an asterisk, so Visual FoxPro treats them as comments
and ignores them when compiling programs. The directives are not
case-sensitive.

The syntax of the directives is:

  *# document directive

It is a good idea to place the directives near the beginning of the main program
file so that the Documenting wizard encounters the instruction when it begins
analyzing. The remaining sections in this article explain these directives.

*# document ACTIONCHARS "abcdef"
--------------------------------

By default, when the Documenting Wizard creates an Action Diagram or a Tree
Diagram, the wizard uses six characters that appear as lines and square corners
when viewed under ASCII code page 1250 or under ANSI code page 1252 in FoxFont.
Not all the characters map to line characters when viewed under other code
pages.

The six default characters and their corresponding FoxFont characters are listed
below as a, b, c, d, e, and f.

          Default        As viewed
 abcdef   Chr( ) Value   in FoxFont
 ----------------------------------------------------
 a        32             (space)
 b        196             -
 c        179             |
 d        218             Upper left corner bracket
 e        192             Lower left corner bracket
 f        195             Sideways "T" (similar to "|-")

NOTE: The FoxFont characters needed for this table were not displayable in this
font, so a description of the characters was used instead.

When using other code pages, insert the following code in your main program file
to ensure that the lines in your diagrams map to line-like characters:

     *# document ACTIONCHARS " -|+++"

NOTE: Tthe first character of the string enclosed in quotation marks is a space.
For a list of supported code pages, please see the "Code Pages Supported by
Visual FoxPro" topic in the Visual FoxPro Help file.

*# document XREF cMode
----------------------

This directive tells Visual FoxPro whether to enable cross-referencing of
variables. The default is ON.

  cMode     Description
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ON        enables cross referencing of variables
  OFF       disables cross-referencing of variables
  SUSPEND   Disables cross-referencing of variables in the current file
            until the Documenting wizard encounters the next instance
            of: *# document XREF ON

*# document EXPANDKEYWORDS cMode
--------------------------------

This directive tells Visual FoxPro whether to enable the expansion of keywords.
For example, "DEFINE WIND" could be expanded to "DEFINE WINDOW." The default is
OFF.

WARNING: Not all keywords in Visual FoxPro begin with a unique string of four
characters. For example, "REPL" could be short for "REPLACE" or "REPLICATE." Be
careful if you include this directive, which will overwrite existing files.

  cMode     Description
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ON        Enables keyword expansion
  OFF       Disables keyword expansion
  SUSPEND   Disables keyword expansion in the current file until the next
            instance of: *# document EXPANDKEYWORDS ON

*# document XREFKEYWORDS cMode
------------------------------

This directive corresponds to the Cross Reference Keywords option on "Step 6 -
Finish" in the Documenting wizard. The default is OFF.

 cMode     Description
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ON        Enables cross referencing of keywords
 OFF       Disables cross-referencing of keywords
 SUSPEND   Disables cross-referencing of keywords in the current file
           until the next instance of: *# document XREFKEYWORDS ON

*# document ARRAYBRACKETS cMode
-------------------------------

The default is OFF.

 cMode     Description
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 ON        The Documenting Wizard assumes that square brackets are used
           for arrays and that parentheses are used for functions and
           methods.
 OFF       The Documenting Wizard treats both square brackets and
           parentheses as arrays.

*# document ACTIONINDENTLENGTH nSpace
-------------------------------------

In this directive, nSpace is the number of character spaces that you want the
Documenting Wizard to use for indentation. The minimum value allowed is 2.
