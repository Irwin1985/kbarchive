SUMMARY
=======

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE
------------------------------

The following year 2000 (Y2K) test considerations should be viewed as high-level
testing recommendations that organizations can use to scope and implement their
Y2K efforts. Each solution being assessed is unique, and deserves tailored
testing to completely assess its end-to-end Y2K readiness. Consequently, any
solution or product tests that do not go beyond these minimum recommendations
may be insufficient to determine readiness. Please ensure you assess the entire
solution.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you are performing Y2K tests in an Exchange Server messaging environment,
you may want to advance the system time clock to the appropriate time testing
period.

IMPORTANT: Only advance and roll back system time in a test environment, not in a
production environment. Performing such an operation in a production environment
may cause the loss of all pending mail in the system, replication problems, and
may require that the Microsoft Exchange services be restarted.

A few important things should be considered when you are modifying the system
time for the purpose of testing:

- All Y2K test scenarios must be valid and realistic. Invalid test scenarios
  produce invalid and meaningless results.

- Rolling the system time back after it has been advanced does not constitute a
  valid test scenario because it is not realistic. Unpredictable results are to
  be expected if the time is rolled back while messages are pending in the
  system.

- Consider setting up a test environment that simulates part of your Exchange
  Server topology. When this is set up, change the system time on all servers
  to December 31, 1999. Then start sending messages, and let the date roll over
  to January 1, 2000.

Example:

All pending messages in the Exchange Server e-mail system will be rendered
undeliverable if the system clock is advanced beyond the default messaging time
outs. The diagnostic code for the non-delivery report (NDR) will indicate that
the maximum time has expired on the messages. The result, in this case, is
normal and to be expected because all maximum timer values on these messages
have already elapsed.

To test the system behavior in a specific time period, you may advance the system
time to or just before the time period you want to test. Start your testing by
observing the proper transition to the specific date. After you have concluded
the tests, you may then roll back system time to the current time and restart
services.

Microsoft understands the critical nature of the Y2K issue for organizations.
Information technology professionals who are responsible for the Y2K health of
Microsoft products used in their environments need to understand how Microsoft
has tested its products. The numbered list below represents the framework used
by Microsoft to test the Y2K date handling capabilities of Microsoft products.

1. The product stores and calculates dates consistent with a four-digit format
  throughout its operational range. If the product allows the user to enter a
  two-digit short cut for the year, the product recognizes the year consistent
  with a four-digit format.

2. The product correctly executes leap year calculations. The product does not
  use special values for dates within its operational range for data.

3. The product functions into the 21st century, through the end of year 2035.

Microsoft continues to test for Y2K issues as new versions of products or service
packs are produced.

NOTE: All references to "dates" refer to using either four digits or two digits
for the YEAR portion of the date. This testing criteria does not constitute a
warranty or certification expressed or implied, of any kind.
