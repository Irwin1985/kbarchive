-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enter a world in Microsoft Asheron's Call, a character that you created
at a previous time may not be listed in one of the five character slots.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if one of the following conditions is true:

- You enter a world that is different from the world in which you created the
  character.

- You delete the character.

- The character was removed for having an offensive name.

- Someone else has gained access to your account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method.

You Enter a World that Is Different From the World in Which You Created the Character:

There are 8 Asheron's Call worlds. Each world is seperate from the others. If a
character is created on one world it will not be visible on the others. To
locate a missing character please connect to each of the worlds listed on the
appropriate Web pages below until the character is found:

You Delete the Character:

When you delete a character, it no longer exists after one hour. You need to
create a new character after this time.

servers.

To prevent your character from being removed do not create one with an offensive
name.
