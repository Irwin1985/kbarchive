-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, you may receive the following error message:

  Windows NT could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:

  \%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\SystemHardware Profile/Last Known Good menu

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are too many printers installed. Based on the
number and types of drivers involved, the problem may start at around 900
printers. This issue can occur for local printers as well as for network
printers, or for a combination of both that exceeds around 900 printers.

Before you install the fix mentioned in the "Resolution" section, the information
for local printers is saved to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers

The information for network printers is saved to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanManPrintServices

Because of this, the System subkey of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive in the registry
may become too large to fit into the allocated memory space and may preventing
the system from booting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

NOTE: To activate this fix, you must add the following registry value:

  Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

  Value Name : UseSoftwareKey
  Value Type : REG_DWORD
  Data : 1



Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation
-------------------------------------

There is a separate hotfix that addresses this issue for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q239907 Too Many Printers Can Cause Unsuccessful Boot

WORKAROUND
==========

For possible workarounds, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q102721 Err Msg: Windows NT Could Not Start Because the Following...

STATUS
======

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix moves the local printer keys from:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers

to:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Print\Printers

It moves the network printer keys from:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanManPrintServices

to:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Print\Providers\LanManPrintServices

The printer information in:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Print\Printers

may not be evident until you open the printer properties for a connection, add a
printer, or reboot.

You will still see registry keys and entries created in:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers

for every printer, although only a small subset of the normal information is
added. This is necessary to support applications that query the registry
directly for printer information.
