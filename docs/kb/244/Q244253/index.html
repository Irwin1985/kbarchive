-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

There is no mail flow from Novell GroupWise to Microsoft Exchange Server.
Although messages are not successfully sent from GroupWise, directory
synchronization between Exchange Server and GroupWise works. The following error
appears in the Exchange Server computer's application event log:

  Event ID: 6087
  Source: MSExchangeGWRtr
  Description:
  Error: No message type can be found in the header file.

On the GroupWise server, the corresponding error is in the GroupWise API
gateway's log:

  10-15-99 09:57:27 Processing outbound message...
  10-15-99 09:57:28 Error getting information from the GroupWise message
  10-15-99 09:57:28 Info - No active recipients

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a damaged Foreign domain document for Exchange Server
in the GroupWise post office.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, in the GroupWise Administrator program:

1. In the Link Configuration utility, unlink the existing External Foreign
  domain for Exchange Server.

2. Delete the existing External Foreign domain for Exchange Server.

3. Recreate a new External Foreign domain for Exchange Server.

4. Run the Link Configuration utility, and link the External Foreign domain for
  Exchange Server to the API gateway.

5. Run directory synchronization between Exchange Server and GroupWise again.

NOTE: For more information about creating External Foreign domains and
configuring the link tables, refer to the documentation included with the
Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise.
