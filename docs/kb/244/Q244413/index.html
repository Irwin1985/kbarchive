SYMPTOMS
========

If a Verimation MEMO user sends e-mail to an Exchange Server user, the mail
appears in the Exchange Server user?s Inbox. The Exchange Server user can read
the e-mail but might not be able to reply to this e-mail because the originator
address had been changed to MEMOGWY(SNADS) or MEMOGWY.SNADS. This behavior
appears only if the MEMO user has an address with a hyphen (-) in the
distribution group name (DGN), for example, GROUP-ONE(XYZ123). There are no
problems sending e-mail from Exchange Server to the Verimation MEMO user. If the
Exchange Server user sends e-mail to the MEMO user, the MEMO user can reply to
the e-mail, and the message reaches the Exchange Server user. But the Exchange
Server user still cannot reply.

This problem doesn?t appear if the MEMO user address has no hyphen in it.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is based on the configuration of the connector at the SNADS side.
It?s related to the fact that the DGN.DEN has invalid characters for SNADS, such
as a hyphen. The connector or gateway at SNADS exchanges the invalid DGN.DEN
with an syntactical correct expression, "MEMOGWY.SNADS" or "MEMOGWY(SNADS)",
although the recipient can no longer reply to this address.

There are three options to resolve this issue:

- At MEMO, use only a DGN.DEN with correct syntax, which is allowed from SNADS.
  This is the preferred solution.

- Accept this behavior, so that MEMO users still can send to Exchange Server,
  but Exchange Server users cannot use the reply functionality of their e-mail
  client software. They must choose the reply address from the global address
  list or type the one-off address manually to send e-mail to the MEMO user.

- At SNADS, configure the settings at Exit GWYZXR01 in such a way that these
  invalid addresses are already refused at the SNADS side. This causes a
  non-delivery report (NDR) for all DGN.DEN with invalid characters. MEMO users
  who have this kind of DGN.DEN cannot deliver mail to the Exchange Server
  system.
