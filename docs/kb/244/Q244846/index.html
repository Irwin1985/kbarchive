IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install French Terminal Server Service Pack 4 (SP4) and the Client for
NetWare, the MAP command in the NetWare login script may not work. If you remove
SP4, the MAP command works correctly again.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been encountered with the French edition of Terminal Server
SP4, but may also occur with any language.

In the French version of Terminal Server SP4, the name of the 
network provider for NetWare contains an accented "e" as the 
second  letter in the name "Reseau Netware ou compatible." 
In SP3, it is "Reseau NetWare ou compatible" with no accented 
letter. The ASCII code for the accented "e" in SP4 is above 127, 
and therefore the OEM code (MS-DOS) and the ANSI code (Windows) 
are not the same. 

During initialization, Nwscript.exe reads the name of the provider in the
registry and converts the extended characters using the OEM code page instead of
the ANSI code page. It then tries to map a drive, which is expecting an ANSI
string and not an OEM string. This call does not succeed and generates a "The
specified network provider name is invalid" (ERROR_BAD_PROVIDER) error message.


WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, replace all registry entries for the network
provider to make sure extended characters (ASCII code above 127) are not used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
