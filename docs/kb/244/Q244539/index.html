SYMPTOMS
========

When a user has defined manual host routes using the Route.exe tool, certain
routes to remote hosts may be removed from the route table after 10-15 minutes
after usage.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when an ICMP Destination Unreachable Packet is sent with
the DF Flag set. When this occurs, it sends along the Next Hop MTU, and this
causes the Host route to be overwritten by the ICMP source route. ICMP host
routes are subject to deletion if their MTU changes.

Windows NT uses a Path MTU detection algorithm that sets the DoNotFragment bit on
TCP packets. This behavior will cause intermediate routers with a smaller MTU
than the packet's size to reject the packet and send an ICMP Destination
Unreachable:Fragmentation Needed. When Windows NT receives this packet, it
updates the internal routing table with the new MTU. This update would also
overwrite the route's source field to ICMP. This could cause a user-entered host
route to disappear when Windows NT periodically removes aged ICMP host routes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 2000
------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack


Windows NT 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date        Time    Size     File name  Platform
  ------------------------------------------------
  02/25/2000  07:47p  174,448  Tcpip.sys  x86
  02/25/2000  07:46p  310,704  Tcpip.sys  Alpha



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

- Adjust the MTU on the router.

- You can disable PMTU Discovery which will limit the MTU to 576 bytes for all
  non-local destination addresses. You can do this by setting this registry
  entry to a value of zero: Value name: EnablePMTUDiscovery
  Value type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
  Valid range: 0,1 (False, True)
  Default: 1 (True)

  Location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
