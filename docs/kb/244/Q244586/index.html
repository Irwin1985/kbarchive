-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Exchange Server Mailbox Manager add-in utility included in
Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3, you can configure up to five logging
levels. Each level is unique and gives you different information.

This article describes the different logging levels and the uses for each level.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The logging level, which is set on the Advanced tab, determines what information
is captured by the trace log files and the application event log. The logging
level has no effect on the information in the administrator's report.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Logging Level | Event Log                                 | Trace Log                                                       | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1             | Critical Errors                           | None                                                            | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2             | Start, Stop, Critical Errors, and Summary | None                                                            | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3             | Start, Stop, Critical Errors, and Summary | Mailbox level statistics                                        | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4             | Start, Stop, Critical Errors, and Summary | Mailbox and folder level statistics                             | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5             | Start, Stop, Critical Errors, and Summary | Mailbox and folder level statistics with full trace information | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The summary message that is sent to the application event log is in the same
format as the message that is sent to the administrator. Mailbox and folder
level statistics, as well as full trace information, are captured in the trace
log.

Entries in the Application Event Log
------------------------------------

If you set the logging level to 2 or higher, a summary message is logged in the
application event log that is similar to the following:

  Event ID: 728
  Source: MSExchangeMCA
  Type: Information
  Category: None
  Description:
  The Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager has completed processing
  mailboxes
  Started at: Start-Time
  Stopped at: : End-Time
  Mailboxes processed: Processed-Mailbox-Total
  Messages moved: Moved-Messages-Total
  Size of moved messages: Moved-Messages-Size-Total
  Deleted messages: Deleted-Messages-Total
  Size of deleted messages: Deleted-Messages-Size-Total

If the run is unsuccessful, the following message is logged:

  Event ID: 721
  Source: MSExchangeMCA
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description:
  Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager was interrupted before processing
  was complete - error no = c00002d1. The Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox
  Manager has completed processing mailboxes
  Started at: Start-Time
  Stopped at: End-Time
  Mailboxes processed: Processed-Mailbox-Total
  Messages moved: Moved-Messages-Total
  Size of moved messages: Moved-Messages-Size-Total
  Deleted messages: Deleted-Messages-Total
  Size of deleted messages: Deleted-Messages-Size-Total

Trace Log
---------

The trace log captures information such as: the object that was affected by the
Mailbox Manager utility, the number of messages that were deleted, the type of
event that took place, and the time of a given deletion. Trace log titles are in
a MCAyyyymmdd.log format, where yyyy is the year, mm the month, and dd the day.
They can be found in the same folder that the Mailbox Manager utility is
installed in (the C:\Mbxman folder by default). Trace logs are in CSV format and
can be opened in any spreadsheet application, for example, Microsoft Excel.
Trace log files can be very large; delete unwanted log files periodically to
recover disk space.

NOTE: If you set the logging level to either 3, 4, or 5, the location where the
MCAyyyymmdd.log files are written may fill up and cause the Exchange Server
services to stop. For additional information, click the article numbers below to
