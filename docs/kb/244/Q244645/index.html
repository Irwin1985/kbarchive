SYMPTOMS
========

When configuring the Microsoft FTP Server, an FTP administrator has the option
to create a FTP Directory using a network share name or UNC name. This allows
the FTP Site to maintain FTP content on a remote system and doing so makes the
actual physical location transparent to the end FTP User.

When setting up the FTP Virtual Directory to use UNC names, the FTP administrator
must specify a User Name and Password that is valid on the network and on the
remote host. The FTP administrator will then setup the appropriate permissions
on the remote host for this Virtual FTP User. This means that any FTP User that
connects to the FTP Server wants to access content on the remote FTP Virtual
directory will only be able to exercise the permissions set up for the Virtual
FTP User.

When the Microsoft FTP Server is configured this way there is a possibility that
when the FTP User is using the FTP command prompt to connect to a Microsoft FTP
Server, and the FTP User uses the GET command as the initial command that the
logged in Users credentials will be passed to the remote system not those
specified when the FTP Virtual Directory was initially configured.
