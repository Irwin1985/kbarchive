SYMPTOMS
========

After installing a Windows NT 4.0 service pack, data files may be reset or
deleted, including personal mail folder files (*.pst).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you install a Windows NT 4.0 service pack on a computer
running Microsoft Outlook and Computer Associates Inoculan virus drivers dated
prior to February 11, 1999.

During Inoculan's file checking, it is possible that Inoculan's scanning action
is misinterpreted and causes the system to incorrectly notify Microsoft Outlook
or other applications that the file does not exist. The behavior of some
applications is to issue a DELETE and then a CREATE of the file. The result is
that an existing file can be deleted and a new one created in its place.


RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, install the latest Computer Associates Inoculan drivers
from the following Web site:

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem was found during Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 testing and may
occur on previous service packs when running Inoculan drivers dated prior to
February 11, 1999.
