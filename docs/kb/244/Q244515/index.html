  lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:

  [SOUND]
  Channels=1
  SamplesPerSec=11025

7. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Flight
  Simulator 2000 is installed.

9. Quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your computer. To do this,
  use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows
  Millennium Edition (Me):

  a. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

  b. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or
     Systray (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End

     your computer.

Microsoft Windows 2000:

  1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Windows Task Manager.

  2. On the Applications tab, click any program, and then click End Task.

Obtain and Install Updated Device Drivers
-----------------------------------------

If you are using version 1.0 of the SideWinder Game Device Software, download and
install the latest version of the SideWinder Game Controller software from the
following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/sidewinder

To determine the version of the SideWinder Game Device or SideWinder Game
Controller software installed in your computer:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders."

2. In the Named box, type "sw3dpro.vxd" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, right-click the Sw3dpro.vxd file, and then click
  Properties.

  NOTE: If the Sw3dpro.vxd file is not in the list of found files, the
  SideWinder software is not installed.

5. On the Version tab, note the value on the File Version line, and then click
  OK.

6. Close the Find: Files Named Sw3dpro.vxd window.

In addition, if your game controller is connected to the game port in your sound
card, contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain
and install the latest version of the sound driver for your sound card.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Configure the Sound Card to Use Only One DMA Channel
----------------------------------------------------

If your game controller is connected to the game port in your sound card, your
game controller may perform better if you configure the sound card to use only
one DMA channel.

NOTE: Some programs are unable to run with only one DMA channel. If you
experience this issue, restore your original sound card settings.

To configure a legacy sound card driver on a Microsoft Windows 95/98-based
computer or a native sound card driver on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based
computer to use single-mode DMA:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. On the Devices or Advanced tab, click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to Audio Devices
  to expand the branch.

4. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

5. Click Settings.

6. To configure the sound card to use single-mode DMA, see your sound card
  documentation, or use one of the following procedures:

   - Click to select the Use Single-Mode DMA check box, click OK until you
     return to Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

   - In the DMA Channel (16-bit) box, click Disable, click OK until you return
     to Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

   - In the High DMA box, click Use DMA, click OK until you return to Control
     Panel, and then restart the computer.

  If you cannot use the sound card driver to configure single-mode DMA, click
  Cancel until you return to Control Panel, and then proceed to the "Disable
  Force-Feedback Effects" method in this article.

To configure a native sound card driver on a Windows 95/98-based computer to use
single-mode DMA:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to "Sound, video and game controllers" to expand
  the branch.

5. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

6. Click the Resources tab.

7. Under Resource Type, locate the Direct Memory Access (DMA) lines. If you see
  more than one Direct Memory Access (DMA) line, configure the sound card for
  single-mode DMA. To do this:

  a. Click to clear the Use Automatic Settings check box.

  b. In the Settings Based On box, click a Basic Configuration that uses only
     one DMA channel setting.

     If you see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box, repeat
     this step to select another basic configuration that uses only one DMA
     channel and does not conflict with any other devices.

     If you do not see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box,
     click OK, and then click Yes.

  c. Click Close, and then restart the computer.

  If you see only one Direct Memory Access (DMA) line, or if you cannot find a
  basic configuration that uses only one DMA channel, click Cancel, click
  Cancel again, and then proceed to the next method.

Disable Force-Feedback Effects
------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder Force Feedback Pro joystick or SideWinder Force Feedback
Wheel, disable the force-feedback effects. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Click to select Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro or Microsoft
  SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel.

4. Click Properties.

5. On the Settings tab, drag the Force Feedback slider to the Off position.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.
