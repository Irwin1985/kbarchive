-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a server that is running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6), you can add
extended Microsoft Windows 2000 file permissions by using the Security
Configuration Manager tool from the Service Pack 4 (SP4) CD-ROM.

This procedure illustrates the problem:

1. You are running Windows Explorer and viewing a folder's security properties.

2. You add a test user to the list of permissions.

3. For this user, you set a deny flag for writing.

4. In a subfolder under that folder, you add the same user and set the Allow
  Write flag.

5. You select the Allow Inherited Permissions check box for the folder.

6. You click OK.

7. You try to open the Security dialog box again.

8. You see this error message:

  Unable to display security information

On a Windows 2000-based server, the typical security screen is display as you
expect for the same configuration. You can verify this by using Cacls.exe to
view the access permissions from a command prompt.

The Deny Access setting takes precedence over any other flags, so the Write
Access flag has no effect. Any user with the conflicting flags set for the
folder will cause the screen not to be displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Windows checks to determine if both the allow and deny flags are set for the
object being checked. If they are, error 1336 ("ERROR_INVALID_ACL") is generated
and is returned from the function that sums the flags for an access
determination. Any error from this function causes the screen not to be
displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time    Size     File name    Platform
  ------------------------------------------------
  04/20/01  04:12p   84,240  Ntmarta.dll  Intel
  04/20/01  04:08p  140,048  Ntmarta.dll  Alpha

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a.



WORKAROUND
==========

Using Cacls.exe, clear the Allow Write flag on the folder. Avoid using deny
flags if possible. This symptom also occurs if you set read deny for the
Everyone group because Supervisor is part of the group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
