SYMPTOMS
========

When you advertise programs to Microsoft Windows 95-based or Microsoft Windows
98-based client computers that must be restarted, you may receive a "no success"
or a "failure status" message in the Status Message Viewer. When you examine the
Smsapm32.log file on the client, you may observe that the following log is
displayed after the client has been restarted:

  SCHED DATA : A program status .mif has not been found.
  SCHED DATA : Changing job status to success but not reporting any program
  status.
  SCHED DATA : There will be no further program status .mif checking for this
  job upon restart.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients when the
After Running option is set to Program restarts Computer in the Properties
section of the advertised program, and if the program requests that the client
must be restarted. This problem only occurs when the program does not report a
status .mif file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rewrite or modify, if possible, the advertised
program to report a status .mif file after the program has completed its tasks.
If the custom-made program cannot be modified to accomplish this task, you can
use the repackaging feature of the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
Installer tool to repackage your custom-made program where support for .mif
status reports can be added.

For additional information about the repackaging process and status .mif
reporting in the SMS Installer tool, refer to the SMS Installer Help file. If
you choose to follow this workaround, you should be aware of the following
problem documented in the related knowledgebase article:

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q292030 SMS: The Install Status May Be Missing for Advertised Programs That
  Generate Status .mif Files

Another workaround method is to rewrite or to modify the advertised program to
suppress the restart process in the program's install process, and then to
change the After Running option to SMS Restarts Computer in the Properties
section of the advertised program .

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.
