- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT workstation or server (in the member-server role), the following
error appears when you log on:

  A domain controller for your domain could not be located. You have been
  logged on using cached information. Changes to your profile since you last
  logged on may not be available.

If you check the System Event Log, you find the following event:

Event ID:    5513
Source:      Netlogon
Description: The computer name &lt;computer name&gt; connected to server &lt;name&gt;
            using the trust relationship to the &lt;name&gt; domain. However,
            the computer doesn't properly know the security identifier
            (SID) for the domain. Reestablish the trust relationship.

If you find this event, check basic networking functionality and then follow the
procedure indicated below.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages indicate the Windows NT workstation or server computer
account information does not match that held by the authenticating domain
controller. The computer account information is held in the registry on the
Windows NT workstation or server and on all domain controllers. There are a
number of things that can cause the computer account database on the domain
controller to have different information than the computer itself, for example,
if systems account manager (SAM) and Security were restored to a different
version (either by emergency repair or from a tape restore). The trust
relationship a computer has with the domain it is a member of is similar to the
trust relationship a domain can have with another domain with respect to the
account that is created.

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow these steps:

1. On the primary domain controller (PDC), open Server Manager and locate the
  Windows NT workstation or Windows NT server (member-server) that is getting
  the errors.

2. Select that computer account, select Computer on the menu bar and then select
  Remove From Domain. This will delete the entry for that computer (The entry
  you see will not disappear immediately; this is nothing to be concerned
  about.)

3. Immediately, select Computer in the menu bar and then select Add To Domain.
  Click Windows NT Workstation or Server, then supply the computer name as
  defined in Control Panel&gt;Network for the affected computer. Click OK.

4. On the Windows NT workstation or Windows NT server with the error message,
  log on with a local administrative account. Open the Network tool in Control
  Panel. Press the Change button that is next to the Domain or Workgroup name.
  Make sure to select Workgroup and type a fictitious Workgroup name. Click OK.

5. A dialog welcoming the computer to the new workgroup appears. Click OK. Close
  Control Panel and choose Yes when prompted to restart the computer.

6. On the same Windows NT workstation or Windows NT server, log on again with a
  local administrative account. Open the Network tool in Control Panel. Press
  the Change button that is next to the Domain or Workgroup name. This time,
  make sure to select Domain and type your Windows NT domain name and click OK.


7. A dialog welcoming the system to the domain appears; click OK. Close Control
  Panel and choose Yes when prompted to restart the computer.

8. After this restart, on the FROM line in the logon dialog box, click the arrow
  to display a list of domain entries. Log on to the domain with a valid domain
  account.

This procedure should eliminate Event ID: 5513.
