SYMPTOMS
========

The Remote Access Service (RAS) queries for the following name every two minutes
by default:

  JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR

If you have a RAS server configured to use Microsoft Windows Internet Naming
Service or Domain Name Server (DNS) resolution, the queries may be sent across
routers or dial-up lines.

As A result, the following event may be written to the system log throughout the
initial startup of your RAS set up to receive Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) dial-in clients:

  Event ID: 20026
  Source: RemoteAccess
  Type: Error
  Description: Remote Access Server Security Failure. A network error has
  occurred when trying to establish a session with the security agent on
  LANA x. The error code is the data.

NOTE: x is the LANA number of your network card.

In some cases the Remote Access Server service fails to start.

If you have Routing and Remote Access Serivce (RRAS) installed, the following
event may be written to the system log during the initial startup if RRAS is set
up to receive TCP/IP dial-in clients:

Event ID: 20024
Source: RemoteAccess
Type: Error
Description: Remote Access Server Security Failure. A network error has   occurred when trying to establish a session with the security agent on   LANA x. The error code is the data.

NOTE: x is the LANA number of your network card.
In some cases the RRAS service fails to start and will log the following event in
the system log:

Event ID: 7024
Source: RemoteAccess
Type: Error
escription: The Routing And Remote Access Service service terminated with service-specific error 1058

CAUSE
=====

The name JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR is announced regularly and is a normal occurrence from
a Windows NT Server or Workstation computer running the Windows NT Remote Access
Service (RAS).

WORKAROUND
==========

In some cases, a Windows Internet Naming Service or DNS server may be across a
dial-up router on the network. This behavior may cause unnecessary traffic
across these interfaces. A trace from Network Monitor may show queries for the
name JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR.

Use one of the following methods to prevent this name query from being
broadcast:

- Create an LMHOSTS file with the following entry:

  x.x.x.x JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR #PRE

  where x.x.x.x is an IP address associated with the RAS server's network
  interface card.

  -or-

- If you are using DNS, create an A record for JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR in the domain
  for which the DNS server is authoritative.

  NOTE: The client (resolver) must have the domain name field in
  TCPIP/DNS/Domain name populated with the domain name that the A record is
  created in on the DNS server. If there are entries listed in the domain
  suffix search order of the client, this must be the first domain listed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Small Business Server version 4.5 creates an LMHosts file with the IP address of
your server associated with the name JSPNRMPTGSBSSDIR. If you change the IP
address of the server, then you must change the IP address in the LMHosts file
as well.

The following article describes how to change the default IP address of Small
Business Server:
