SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT server is running the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) and
is participating in WINS database replication on the network, special
consideration must be taken configuring where the WINS server points to for it's
own name resolution (this parameter is set in the Network section of Control
Panel, in the Configuration section of TCPIP Protocol).

It is highly recommended that a WINS server point to itself as Primary and
Secondary WINS in the TCP/IP configuration. If another configuration is used,
you may experience random instability in making certain network connections.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is recommended that a WINS server point to itself as Primary WINS and as
Secondary WINS. This will avoid split registrations and other problems.

For additional information on some of these other problems, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q135405 Repairing a Corrupted WINS Database w/ Starting Version Count

Q168712 How to Manually Recreate a WINS Database

Q150520 Server Sporadically Loses Name Resolution

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When any WINS enabled computer is booted it must register a variety of services
with WINS. Commonly a computer has a Primary and Secondary WINS address
configured in the TCP/IP setup. If the Primary WINS does not respond to the
registrations, the computer tries the Secondary WINS.

For additional information on the services that can be registered, please see the
following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q119495List of Names Registered with WINS Service

Generally, most clients and servers should be configured with a Primary and
Secondary WINS address, however caution must be taken with how a WINS server is
itself configured. A WINS server eventually registers its services in its own
local WINS database, regardless of whether it points to itself or not (either
Primary, Secondary, or none). Registering with itself and another WINS server
can cause problems when it comes to replication and renewal of these entries.

For example, if you have a WINS server ("Srv1") that points to itself as Primary
and points to another WINS as Secondary ("Wins2"). When Srv1 is booted, it
usually tries to register its services before its own WINS Service is started.
Since those registrations fail, it tries to register them at Wins2. If Wins2 is
available, it accepts the registration requests. However, not all the services
are registered at Wins2, because as these registration requests are made, Srv1
continues to check its local WINS service. Once the service is running, it
switches back to it and continues registering locally.

After replication has occurred between Srv1 and Wins2, both databases show this
ownership:

  Srv1: Owns his Srv1&lt;20&gt;, and Domain&lt;1c&gt; (if it is a domain
  controller)
  Wins2: Owns all other Srv1 registrations, and also owns Domain&lt;1c&gt; from
  Srv1

This potentially problematic condition is referred to as "split registration."

At this point, Srv1 has reverted to re-registering locally, however it takes a
while before you can see it. Meanwhile, Srv1 and Wins2 are replicating the split
registration mappings to other WINS servers. Eventually these replicas should be
reconciled at the remote WINS (that is, the Wins2 replicas are replaced by the
newer Srv1 replicas). However, before reconciliation is finished, client
connection problems may have occurred, including the inability to connect to a
WINS server that split its registration (in this example, Srv1), or the
inability to resolve the domain&lt;1c&gt; name that Srv1 registered.

The exact conditions that lead to failure are varied. If your WINS servers are
running Windows NT version 3.51 with Service Pack 4 (or greater), these
conditions should only be temporary. However, the problem may be more severe
depending on your replication scheme or if you are running pre- Service Pack 4
WINS servers.


Another faulty configuration is setting a remote IP address (in this example,
Wins2) as Primary while setting the local WINS (Srv1) as Secondary. In this
case, Srv1 will eventually stop refreshing its NetBIOS lease at Wins2, and will
begin registering locally. Depending on your WINS replication scheme, this may
cause connection problems.
