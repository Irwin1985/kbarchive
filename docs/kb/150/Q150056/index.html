Last Modified: 19-DEC-2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reinstall Windows 95 or when you use the Add/Remove Programs tool in
Control Panel to add a component, you may receive the following error message:

  A file being copied is older than the file currently on your computer. It is
  recommended that you keep your existing file.

  File name: &lt;filename.ext&gt;
  Description: &lt;description of file&gt;
  Your version: &lt;version number&gt;

  Do you want to keep this file?

You have the option to choose Yes (to keep the existing file) or No (to overwrite
the file).

CAUSE
=====

You may receive the error message in any of the following scenarios:

Scenario 1
----------

You have the Windows 95 retail upgrade pre-installed on your computer, but the
source (compact disc or floppy disks) you are using to reinstall Windows 95 or
install a component is the Windows 95 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
Service Release 1.

Scenario 2
----------

You have the Windows 95 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Service Release 1
pre-installed on your computer, but the source (compact disc or floppy disks)
you are using to reinstall Windows 95 or install a component is the Windows 95
retail upgrade.

Scenario 3
----------

A third-party application or component that you have previously installed has
overwritten one or more Windows 95 files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Scenario 1
----------

Contact the OEM vendor for assistance in properly resolving this issue.

NOTE: Using the OEM Service Release 1 compact disc to upgrade Windows 95 is not
supported by Microsoft.

Scenario 2
----------

Contact the OEM vendor so that the vendor can provide you with the correct source
files for the version of Windows 95 installed on your computer.

Scenario 3
----------

Choose "No" to the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section so that
Windows 95 overwrites the files on your system with the original Windows 95
files. This may cause one or more of your third-party programs to stop working
properly. If this occurs, you may need to reinstall any affected programs.

NOTE: When you reinstall your third-party program(s) (as discussed earlier), the
third-party programs may overwrite some Windows files. Therefore, you may find
that some Windows components no longer work properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some OEMs may ship computers with a mismatch between their pre-installed version
of Windows 95 (OEM Service Release 1) and the Windows 95 compact disc or floppy
disks (retail Windows 95 upgrade) included with the computer. The Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 1 includes several updates that are not included in the retail
Windows 95 upgrade. The following is a partial list of files that may be
displayed in the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section:

  Nwnp32.dll
  Lpt.vxd
  Mapi32.dll
  Cdvsd.vxd
  Voltrack.vxd
  Umdm16.dll
  Umdm32.dll
  Unimdm.tsp

  Esdi_506.pdr
  Scsihlp.vxd
