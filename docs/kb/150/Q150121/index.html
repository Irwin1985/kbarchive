SYMPTOMS
========

The wrong resource is loaded when CBitmap::LoadBitmap, CMenu::LoadMenu,
CString::LoadString or any other MFC resource-loading function is called in an
MFC extension DLL (AFXDLL). In some cases, a resource in the application is
loaded instead of the appropriate resource in the extension DLL.

CAUSE
=====

When a resource in the application or another extension DLL gets loaded instead
of a resource in the current extension DLL, the cause is usually improper
resource management. An MFC application and all of its extension DLLs are one
global chain of resources. If there are multiple resources with the same ID
value in any of the modules in the chain, MFC uses the first resource it finds
with the desired ID value. The first resource is often found in the application,
which is searched before any of the extension DLLs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the ID values of any resources that conflict so they are unique in both
the application and any extension DLL that the application uses. These values
are stored in the Resource.h file for each project and can be modified in the
Resource Editor or AppStudio with the Resource Symbols command.

To ensure that modules do not use conflicting symbol values, reserve different
ranges of ID values for each module in the 1 through 0x6FFFF range. Set the
_APS_NEXT_RESOURCE_VALUE definition in the Resource.h file for each module to
the low end of that module's range before creating any resources. The Resource
Editor uses this symbol to determine the ID value of the next resource created.

This technique is documented in MFC Technical Note 35 and in the DLLHUSK sample
included with Visual C++.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In .exe or .dll files that link to MFC dynamically, MFC resource-loading
functions call AfxFindResourceHandle() to obtain the handle of the module where
a resource is located. AfxFindResourceHandle() searches for resources by type
and symbol value in:

- The module returned by AfxGetResourceHandle(). This is usually the
  application.

- The extension DLLs through the chain of CDynLinkLibrary objects.

- Any language-specific resource DLLs.

- Any attached MFC system DLLs (MFCxx.dll, for example).

NOTE: Some 16-bit MFC resource loading functions do not call
AfxFindResourceHandle(), but instead use the value returned from
AfxCurrentResourceHandle().

Each extension DLL creates, initializes, and then passes a CDynLinkLibrary object
to AfxInitExtensionModule() that places the DLL in the resource chain.
AfxTermExtensionModule() removes the DLL from the chain when the DLL is detached
from the application.

A benefit of this design is that MFC automatically locates a resource for an
application or extension DLL, even if that resource is located in a distant
extension DLL or the application itself. All resources in the process are
chained, so ID values are passed between DLLs and the application and the proper
resources are loaded. A disadvantage is that there are no duplicate ID values
between any of the extension DLLs or the application that uses them.

To set the default location where AfxFindResourceHandle() first checks for a
resource, use AfxSetResourceHandle(). Because AfxFindResourceHandle() first
checks the handle set by AfxSetResourceHandle(), it can be used to circumvent
the chain and load a resource from one particular DLL or application. The
resource handle is restored to its original value immediately after loading the
resources. The current default resource handle is found with
AfxGetResourceHandle().

The DLLHUSK sample included with Visual C++ also illustrates this technique. In
Testdll2.cpp, CListOutputFrame::Create() sets the resource handle to the module
handle stored in the AFX_EXTENSION_MODULE structure extension DLL. This
structure is initialized with the module handle when it is passed to the
CDynLinkLibrary constructor in InitTestDLL2().
