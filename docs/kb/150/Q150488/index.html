SUMMARY
=======

You can record sounds within 3D Movie Maker and use them in your 3D Movie Maker
movies. The sounds are saved in a proprietary format that can only be read by 3D
Movie Maker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To record sounds from within 3D Movie Maker, use the following steps:

1. Make sure you are in the Studio.

2. Click the Sounds tool (so you can see the Sound Effects, Speech, and Music
  buttons -- the horn, lips, and treble clef, respectively).

3. To record a sound effect, click the Sound Effects button (this button looks
  like a horn).

  -or-

  To record speech, click the Speech button (this button looks like a pair of
  lips).

4. Click the Record Your Own button in the lower left corner. (This button looks
  like a microphone).

5. Follow the online Help that appears after you click the Record Your Own
  button.

  NOTE: The Sound Effects/Speech list for your current movie appears after you
  are finished recording your sound, and your newly recorded sound is added to
  the end of the list.

6. In the Sound Effect/Speech dialog box, click the sound effect/ dialog item
  you want to use and then press OK.

7. To apply the sound to an actor, prop, 3D word, or background, click the
  appropriate object.

NOTE: You also have the option to record your sounds using the utilities supplied
with your sound card or with Windows 95 (that is, Sound Recorder). You can
import sounds saved as .wav files into any movie and save them as part of that
movie. In 3D Movie Maker, .wav files are used for speech and sound effects. You
also can use these .wav files in other applications that support files saved in
.wav format.
