TROUBLESHOOTING SETUP
=====================

***Microsoft Windows 3.1***

Not enough disk space
---------------------
Setup requires approximately 6 MB of free space on your hard
drive to install the program. If you have less than 6 MB of free
space, you will get this error message. You will need to free up
space on your hard drive and reinstall the program. To find out
how much free space you have on your hard drive, type the
following at the MS-DOS prompt:

  chkdsk

The number of "bytes available on disk" should be equal to at
least 6,291,456 bytes.

Setup hangs
-----------
Because "The Magic School Bus Explores The Oceans" (sic) installs
system files that maybe shared with other applications, it is
best to shut down other applications before running Setup. Do not
remove the Magic School Bus CD during Setup or it will fail.
If you have closed all other open applications, and you encounter
problems during Setup check the system requirements and make sure
you have the minimum requirements necessary to install "The Magic
School Bus Explores The Oceans" (sic).

Need 256-color video

This program requires that your video driver support a screen
resolution of at least 640x480 (although the program will support

that your video driver is able to display 256 colors.

To install the required video driver follow the instructions in
your Microsoft Windows User's Guide under Display driver -
updating.

Error message about sound
-------------------------
An error message about sound may indicate that your sound driver
is either not installed, not installed correctly, not configured
correctly, or is in use.

Display problems with S3 chipset based video display card
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you notice problems with your display and you are using a
video display card based on the S3 chipset, you may need to
update your Windows 3.1 video driver.

You can obtain the most recent update driver from your video
display card manufacturer. Check in your video display card
documentation for the best method to contact the manufacturer for
these drivers.

To install the updated video driver follow the instructions
provided from the manufacturer, or the instructions in your
Microsoft Windows User's Guide under Display driver - updating.
