-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Only five users can connect to the resources of a Windows NT Server.

CAUSE
=====

You may be using the MSDN version of Windows NT Server, which is designed for
software developers who want to design and test software products that operate
on the BackOffice platform. By design, the MSDN version of Windows NT Server
allows only five simultaneous connections by an unlimited number of users to any
of the services provided by the Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use one the following methods to determine whether your currently installed
version of Windows NT Server is the MSDN version:

- Check the label. MSDN has a different product identification. The compact
  disc envelope is labeled "BackOffice Test Platform" [ASCII 133]

- Read the licensing configuration, displayed during Setup. It includes the
  following notice:

  This is a special version of Windows NT Server for the BackOffice Test
  Platform. This version supports up to 5 concurrent users for testing and
  development purposes.

  The connection limits cannot be changed; if this limit does not meet your
  needs, you should consider purchasing the retail version of Windows NT Server
  with the appropriate number of client licenses.

Once Windows NT Server is running, you can use the following method to determine
if you are using the MSDN version:

- Double-click on the License icon in Control Panel. The following message
  appears:

  Not available in MSDN Edition of BackOffice


The five-user limitation is explained in the following sections of the MSDN
License agreement:

2.  GRANT OF LICENSE:
---------------------

(b) Use-Server Software:
You may use the Server Software for the sole purposes of designing, developing,
and testing your software product(s) that are designed to operate in conjunction
with Microsoft BackOffice. The server Software may not be used to support the
designing, development and testing of software product(s) (e.g., as a repository
for source code). The components of the Server Software may only be used on one
and the same Server. A maximum of five (5) simultaneous connections by an
unlimited number of users may be made to access and use the services provided by
the Server.

In other words, the software is provided so that customers can adequately test
their software on the BackOffice platform, but it is not to be used as their
development platform. They have to buy retail software to use software as their
development base for tools.

10.  DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS:
-------------------------------------------------

No Production Use: The SOFTWARE PRODUCT may only be used for development purposes
as described in Section 1. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be used in a production
environment.

(a) No Commercial Use: You may not use the Server Software as part of or as the
basis for a commercial public access data network that consists of two or more
servers and that carries end-to-end electronic information traffic, such as
messaging, data replication, fax, EDI, or telex, unless you obtain a separate
commercial use license from Microsoft.
