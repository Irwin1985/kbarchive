SUMMARY
=======

In TCP/IP-based networks involving routers and multiple segments, it is
generally recommended that you implement WINS for name resolution and browsing
support. However, as an alternative to WINS, it is possible to have full domain
browsing by using only LMHOSTS files on all computers, although there are some
limitations that will be discussed in this article.

In either case, it is important to note that a client only participates in domain
browsing when the client is using a workgroup name that is equivalent to the
domain name (WorkgroupName = DomainName). Windows NT computers can also "join"
the domain to gain this functionality, instead of being in a workgroup.

This functionality of LMHOSTS-based domain browsing (over routers) has not been
formally documented or tested by Microsoft, and may not be available in future
versions of the client and server operating systems. Use this information with
discretion.

MORE INFORMATION
================

"Browsing" in a Microsoft network should be considered a distributed service
provided by one or more computers. Each computer can fall into several browser
roles; however, this article focuses on the two most important ones:

- Segment master browser (SegMB): This can be any Windows NT Server,
  Workstation, or domain controller. It can also be a Windows 95 or Windows for
  Workgroups 3.11 computer. It is responsible for maintaining a browse list of
  the computers on its local segment, forwarding that list to the domain master
  browser, and requesting the domain browse list from the domain master
  browser. The SegMB merges the domain list with its local list, and make that
  list available to any local client that requests it.

- Domain master browser (DomMB): This is the Windows NT primary domain
  controller (PDC). It is responsible for maintaining the browse list on its
  local segment (like a SegMB), as well as collecting browse lists from other
  (remote) segment master browsers with the same domain name (or WorkgroupName
  = DomainName). The DomMB merges the lists it collects, along with its local
  list, then redistribute the combined list back to all the remote SegMBs. Thus
  it is the central hub for maintaining the domain-wide browse list.

NOTE: The Windows for Workgroups browser requires updated files.

For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q102878 Information on Browser Operation


In order for this distributed browse service to work, the SegMBs need a way to
determine exactly who the DomMB is. They can determine this by locating the
computer that has registered the NetBIOS name "Domain&lt;1b&gt;", because that
is only registered by the PDC (which also is the DomMB, as noted above).

For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q119495 List of Names Registered with WINS Service

Domain Browsing with WINS
-------------------------

In a WINS environment, a SegMB would query WINS to determine who registered
Domain&lt;1b&gt;. In this case WINS acts as a convenient central resource for
this information. There is one more benefit in having WINS to assist browsing:
multi-domain browsing.

Multi-Domain Browsing with WINS
-------------------------------

A PDC that is set up to query WINS periodically requests the list of all domains
that are registered in the database. (A domain is identified by a
"Domain&lt;1b&gt;" registration in the database, and the associated IP address
of the PDC that registered it.) The PDC combines this with its own domain browse
list, and thus has a complete list of computers in its domain, as well as a list
of other domains, all across the WAN. When the PDC then interacts with its
SegMB's, it gives them this complete list. You then see the effect of this when
you browse the network using File Manager or Network Neighborhood.

NOTE: That is the extent of WINS involvement with browsing. It is not involved in
the browser election process, nor with helping a client determine who its local
segment master browser is, nor with helping the DomMB determine who the SegMBs
are; that is done in the process when the SegMB first contacts the DomMB.

In certain networks it may not be valuable to use WINS; this can only be
determined on a case-by-case basis. You can then use either LMHOSTS or DNS to
resolve computer names; however, LMHOSTS are required for domain browsing, as
well as other domain management issues such as database replication and domain
secure channels.

Domain Browsing with LMHOSTS
----------------------------

Without WINS, you need special LMHOSTS entries that designate who all the domain
controllers are. This is done in the following convention:

  

  199.199.199.1  ComputerName   #PRE  #DOM:DomainName

When a computer is booted, it reads these entries and store them permanently in
the NetBIOS name cache until the computer is powered down. (Because of this, it
is best that these entries are last in the LMHOSTS file, for subsequent LMHOSTS
parsing efficiency.) All computers in the domain needs one of these entries for
each domain controller (in the local domain), as well as one for the PDC. Also
note the exact order of #PRE #DOM, and that they are capitalized. The other
names are not case sensitive.

Windows NT Segment Master Browsers
----------------------------------

Having the above entries is sufficient for a Windows NT computer: Upon becoming a
Segment Master Browser, a Windows NT computer determines who the PDC is by
sending a query (using the NetGetDcName API) to all LMHOSTS entries with the
#DOM:&lt;localdomain&gt; designation. Only the PDC responds. The Windows NT
computer then contacts the PDC, informs the PDC that it is a master browser,
then continues the process of getting the domain browse list. The PDC then
contacts the Windows NT computer to get its local segment browse list. This
process repeats every 12 to 15 minutes.


Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups Segment Master Browsers
-------------------------------------------------------------

These do not perform the NetGetDcName API, so they need entries in the LMHOSTS
file that indicate who the PDC is. Assuming the example above is the PDC of the
domain, you would have two entries for a Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups
client:

  

  199.199.199.1  controller1   #PRE  #DOM:domainname&lt;BR/&gt;
  199.199.199.1  "domainname,,,,,\0x1b"  #PRE

The first entry allows the PDC to act as a logon domain controller for the
client, the second entry allows the client browser service to explicitly find
the PDC. Remember you will probably have multiple lines similar to the first
line (for multiple domain controllers), but only one line with the \0x1b
directive (to designate the PDC). Note that the domain name must be in quotes,
and padded with spaces for a total of 15 characters before the \0x1b portion.
(The example above shows commas for visual placeholders, however in a real
LMHOSTS file these commas would be replaced with spaces). Also be aware that
moving the PDC role to another Windows NT Server (via promotion) will cause your
\0x1b entry to be invalid. Options to fix this:

- Switch IP addresses on the controllers, so effectively the PDC always has the
  same address. You would not need to change anything in the LMHOSTS file.

- Change the \0x1b IP address in all the LMHOSTS files on the clients, or on
  the centrally distributed LMHOSTS file (if you are implementing that).

Note About NetBIOS Names
------------------------

Every NetBIOS name is a full 16 characters in length; the first 15 are user
definable (or padded with spaces), and the 16th character is reserved to
identify the network service that registered the name. The most familiar example
of a NetBIOS name is the ComputerName on any Microsoft networking client. When
the client is booted, various client network services will register the
ComputerName along with their unique extension, such as ComputerName&lt;00&gt;
(workstation service), and ComputerName&lt;20&gt; (server service). In this
case, the only difference between these two names is the 16th character - and
that does make them individually identifiable. A client can register all of its
names by broadcast, and by direct datagram to WINS, depending on the client node
type. Other companies may also register NetBIOS extensions that are not reserved
by Microsoft.

For more information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q119493 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Resolution and WINS

  Q119495 List of Names Registered with WINS Service

LMHOSTS Example
---------------

Your domain name is "Globe", your PDC NetBIOS name is "Mongo", and you have other
various backup domain controllers. Your LMHOSTS file would look like this:

  

  199.199.199.1   "globe       \0x1b"  #PRE&lt;BR/&gt;
  199.199.199.1   mongo      #PRE  #DOM:globe&lt;BR/&gt;
  199.199.199.2   otherdc1   #PRE  #DOM:globe&lt;BR/&gt;
  199.199.199.3   otherdc2   #PRE  #DOM:globe

To verify that you've entered these correctly, open a command window (DOS prompt)
and look at your NetBIOS cache:

  c:\&gt; nbtstat -c

NetBIOS Remote Cache Name Table

    Name              Type       Host Address    Life [sec]
------------------------------------------------------------
globe          &lt;1B&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.1       -1
MONGO          &lt;03&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.1       -1
MONGO          &lt;00&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.1       -1
MONGO          &lt;20&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.1       -1
OTHERDC1       &lt;03&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.2       -1
OTHERDC1       &lt;00&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.2       -1
OTHERDC1       &lt;20&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.2       -1
OTHERDC2       &lt;03&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.3       -1
OTHERDC2       &lt;00&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.3       -1
OTHERDC2       &lt;20&gt;  UNIQUE      199.199.199.3       -1

TIP: the &lt;1B&gt; entry will not show up if you do not have exactly 15
characters in the name, or if you do not use quotes, or if you enter the forward
slash "/0x1b" (as opposed to "\0x1b").

Multi-Domain Browsing with LMHOSTS
----------------------------------

It is important to note that the main drawback to LMHOSTS browsing is that it
does not provide the automatic ability of multi-domain browsing. As previously
mentioned, the PDC will query WINS for a list of remote domains and include that
information in its browse list. However, the PDC will not parse the LMHOSTS file
for the same information, nor will it include other \0x1b entries with the #PRE
(cache) directive. Effectively, if your PDC does not query WINS, you will not
see other domains through File Manager or Network Neighborhood. However, you can
still browse other domains manually, (provided that you know the domain name and
that you have special entries in your LMHOSTS file), and there is still a chance
that you may browse remote domains based on broadcasts.

Manual Method: this is accomplished by including a \0x1b entry for the PDC of any
remote domain you want to browse. This technique applies to Windows NT, Windows
95, and Windows for Workgroups. It is effective because of the following
sequence of events, necessary for remote domain browsing:

1. The client determines who the PDC is of the remote domain through the
  domain&lt;1b&gt; name (for LMHOSTS this is done by having the \0x1b entry;
  for WINS it would be via query).

2. The client sends a GetBackupList API request to the remote PDC

3. The remote PDC responds with a list of up to three master browsers,
  potentially including itself.

4. The client sends a NetServerEnum API request to one of the master browsers

5. The master browser responds with his domain-wide browse list.

The "manual way" of getting this browse list is through a command window:

  For WinNT computers: c:\net view /domain:&lt;domainname&gt;
  For Win95 and WFW: c:\net view /workgroup:&lt;domainname&gt;

Broadcast Method: This works in the case of any network segment that has members
of multiple domains. There is a SegMB of each domain on the "mutual" segment,
and each SegMB announces its domain via broadcast to a special NetBIOS name
&lt;01&gt;&lt;02&gt;_MSBROWSE_&lt;02&gt;&lt;01&gt;. This broadcast packet
includes the domain name and the computer name of the SegMB that announced it.

The SegMBs of other domains (on this mutual segment) listen for this information,
and add it to their local browse list. A SegMB on this segment has now
"discovered" other domains, and send the discovered information to: the DomMB of
his domain, and to local clients (in his domain) that request a browse list.

A client requests the local domain browse list (from a local SegMB) and see the
discovered domains in File Manager and Network Neighborhood. When the client
selects the discovered domain, he actually requests a browse list directly from
the SegMB that made the announcement in the
&lt;01&gt;&lt;02&gt;_MSBROWSE_&lt;02&gt;&lt;01&gt; packet. Furthermore, since
this information was also sent to the client's DomMB, it is propagated to
SegMB's on other segments that are part of this domain.

Clients on a remote segment can now leverage this information, and browse the
remote domain even though there is no remote domain member on their segment.
However, this process is very volatile using LMHOSTS files, because you are
dependent on the "discovered remote SegMB's" still being active. In a WINS
environment, this remote browsing feature is much more stable because WINS
provides information about the remote domains to your PDC.

Things to consider:

1. For domain logon and domain browsing to work via LMHOSTS, all computers
  require an LMHOSTS file that includes entries for all domain controllers and
  proper \0x1b entries, and the PDC requires an entry for each remote segment
  master browser (if they are not already listed).

2. Most likely every WAN computer is listed. This could be done most efficiently
  by having one common LMHOSTS file that is distributed to all clients and
  servers; however, you must keep it updated with all proper IP address
  changes, and that could become an administrative burden.

3. Seeing a computer in the browse list does not imply you can connect to it. If
  it is on your local segment, you can connect through broadcast; if it is on a
  remote segment, you need an LMHOSTS entry for it.
