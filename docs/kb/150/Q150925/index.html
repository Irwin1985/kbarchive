SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to uninstall Novell's 32-bit network client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To uninstall Novell's 32-bit network client, follow these steps:

1. Remove the client in Network properties. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

  b. Click the Novell 32-bit client, and then click Remove.

  c. Click the Novell 32-bit IPX protocol, and then click Remove.

2. Add the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks. This step ensures that
  registry entries created by Novell's installation program are overwritten.
  After you install the Microsoft client and restart the computer, you can
  either remove the Microsoft client or leave it installed. To add the
  Microsoft client, follow these steps:

  a. In Network properties, click Add.

  b. Click Client, and then click Add.

  c. In the Manufacturers box, click Microsoft. In the Network Clients box,
     click "Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks", and then click OK.

  d. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click No.

3. Click the Start button, point to Find, and then click "Files or folders". In
  the Named box, type "netdef.inf" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Find Now. When the file is found, right-click the file, and then click
  Rename. Rename the file to Netdef.nw.

4. If Novell's 32-bit client has been installed only once, click the Start,
  point to Find, and then click "Files or folders". In the Named box, type
  "netdef.bnw" (without the quotation marks), and then click Find Now. When the
  file is found, right-click the file, and then click Rename. Rename the file
  to Netdef.inf. This restores the original Netdef.inf file. Shut down and
  restart your computer, and skip the remaining steps in this article. If the
  32-bit client has been installed more than once, or if you are not sure,
  continue with step 5.

5. Extract a new copy of the Netdef.inf file from your original Windows 95
  CD-ROM or disks.

  To extract the Netdef.inf file from the CD-ROM, type the following command at
  a command prompt

  "extract drive:\win95\precopy2.cab netdef.inf /L c:\windows\inf" (without the
  quotation marks)

  where drive is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive. To extract the Netdef.inf
  file from the floppy disk, type the following command

  "extract drive:\precopy2.cab netdef.inf /L c:\windows\inf" (without the
  quotation marks)

  where driveis the drive letter of the floppy disk drive. Insert disk 2 in the
  floppy disk drive before typing this command.

6. Shut down and restart your computer.
