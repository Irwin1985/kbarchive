-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a public folder from Microsoft Exchange Client, the
client appears to stop responding for a while before it accesses the public
folder.

This normally occurs if the server containing a replica of the public folder is
unavailable. In that case, the client then tries to connect to another server
that contains a replica of the public folder.

CAUSE
=====

In Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0, the client slows down as described each time
the public folder in question is accessed (for example, each time you open a
message in the public folder). This is because the client tries to connect to
the initial server, even though it has previously tried to connect to that
server and failed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur in Exchange Server 5.0. The client keeps track of
which servers it has tried to connect to and failed and will not try to connect
to any of these servers to access public folders.

For example, say Server A and Server B are two servers in a site containing
replicas of a public folder, PF1. Consider the connection modulus for the client
computer causes the Exchange client to first try to connect to Server A to
access PF1. If Server A is down the first time public folder PF1 is accessed,
the client will wait while trying to connect to Server A. After waiting for the
timeout interval, the client will then connect to Server B and be able to access
the public folder. However after the first attempt, every time the client tries
to access the same public folder, PF1, it will not try to connect to Server A
but will directly go to Server B. This information is only kept in memory and is
lost when the client is exited. Thus, the next time the client is started, it
will again try to connect to Server A.

For more information on the algorithm that is used to determine which public
folder replica is accessed when a user tries to open the contents of a public
folder, please refer to the following Knowledge Base article:
