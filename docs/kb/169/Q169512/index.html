-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Visual FoxPro control, such a text box or command button, is placed on a
page of the Microsoft ActiveX Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0, it shows on
all pages of the Tabbed Dialog Control. This is true even if the Tabbed Dialog
Control is put in edit mode before placing the Visual FoxPro control on it.

NOTE: The Tabctl32.ocx file that creates the Microsoft ActiveX Tabbed Dialog
Control is not shipped in Visual FoxPro 6.0. However, if the file aready exists
on any computer on which Visual FoxPro 6.0 is installed, the symptoms described
in this article occur in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Visual FoxPro PageFrame base class or the SSTab Object ActiveX control
that shipped with Visual FoxPro 5.0--version 4.01.0000 of Tabctl32.ocx.

If Visual FoxPro 5.0a has been installed and the ActiveX controls have been
updated to the ones that it installs, the older SSTab Object control can replace
the newer version. Before following the steps below to do this, be sure to
consider whether or not there are other applications, like Visual Basic 5.0,
that may make use of the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0.

1. Obtain version 4.01.0000 of Tabctl32.ocx. If the Visual FoxPro 5.0 CD is
  available, it can be copied directly from the CD as the files are not
  compressed.

2. Rename the 5.00.3714 version of Tabctl32.ocx as Tabctl32.50a, and then copy
  the 4.01.0000 version into either the Win95\System or WinNT\System32 folder
  depending on the operating system.

3. Start Visual FoxPro. From the Tools menu, select Options and click the
  Controls tab.

4. Ensure that the ActiveX controls option button is selected and also that the
  Controls check box is selected.

5. Locate the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0, and clear the check
  box to the left of it.

6. Click Add and navigate to the appropriate Windows\System folder and select
  the Tabctl32.ocx file.

7. In the list of Controls, find the SSTab Object and select the check box to
  the left of it.

8. Click Set As Default and then OK to exit the Options dialog box.

9. To verify that the 4.01.0000 version of the .ocx file is being used, follow
  the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section below, substituting the SSTab Object
  control in place of the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When adding a control to a Visual FoxPro PageFrame or the Tabbed Dialog Control,
a common mistake is to not put the PageFrame or tabbed dialog into edit mode by
right-clicking it and selecting Edit from the Shortcut menu. Controls placed on
the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0, show on all pages of the
control even if it was placed in edit mode before adding the control to the
page. This does not happen with the SSTab Object ActiveX control that shipped
with Visual FoxPro 5.0 or the Visual FoxPro PageFrame base class. Controls
placed on the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0, in Visual Basic 5.0
show only on the page they are placed on.

As it was mentioned above, version 5.0 and 5.0a of Visual FoxPro install
different versions of the tabbed dialog ActiveX control. Both .ocx files are
named Tabctl32.ocx. Visual FoxPro 5.0 installs version 4.01.0000 of Tabctl32.ocx
file and Visual FoxPro 5.0a installs version 5.00.3714. To check the version,
find and select the Tabctl32.ocx in the WinNT\System32 or Win95\System folder
and select Properties from the File menu, shortcut menu (if right-clicked) or
press ALT+Enter with the file selected. You can also check the ActiveX controls
loaded in the Controls tab in the Tools, Options dialog box. Version 4.01.0000
of Tabctl32.ocx will show up as SSTab Object in the list of controls. Version
5.00.3714 will show as Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0.

ActiveX controls are normally placed on Visual FoxPro forms using the OLE
Container Control.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Determine which version of the Tabctl32.ocx file is being used by Visual
  FoxPro. See above for instructions on how to do this. Visual FoxPro 5.0a and
  the ActiveX controls that shipped with it will normally need to be installed
  to reproduce the problem.

2. In Visual FoxPro 5.0a, create a new form.

3. Add an OLE Container Control to the form. From the Insert menu, select
  Object, and select the Insert Control option button to show the ActiveX
  controls. Click the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control, version 5.0 from the
  list.

4. Right-click on the Tabbed Dialog control and select Edit from the Shortcut
  menu that appears.

5. Add a Visual FoxPro control such as a text box or command button to one of
  the pages of the tabbed dialog. If the drop-down list at the top of the
  Properties sheet is clicked, the objects added to the tabbed dialog should
  show as indented underneath Olecontrol1--the default name given to the Tabbed
  Dialog control when it was placed on the form.

6. Click on the tabs of the Tabbed Dialog control. The objects should show on
  all the pages. Save and run the form and the behavior should be the same.
