-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

A directory in which files are repeatedly created and deleted eventually becomes
corrupt. Subsequent attempts to access files in the directory or to create or
delete files in the directory yield pop-up window indicating that the directory
is corrupt and instructing the user to run CHKDSK.

When CHKDSK is run, it generates output like the following (although the specific
file record segments affected will vary):

  Deleting corrupt attribute record (16, "")
  from file record segment 286.
  Deleting corrupt attribute record (32, "")
  from file record segment 286.
  Deleting corrupt attribute record (48, "")
  from file record segment 286.
  Deleting corrupt attribute record (80, "")
  from file record segment 286.
  Deleting corrupt attribute record (144, $I30)
  from file record segment 286.
  Deleting corrupt file record segment 286.
  Deleting orphan file record segment 8628.
  Deleting index entry DirectoryName in index $I30 of file 244.
  CHKDSK is recovering lost files.


CAUSE
=====

Multiple attributes associated with a given file have the same attribute
instance tag value. This is only likely to happen in directories where many
files are repeatedly added and deleted in an "unbalanced" way.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you can do one of the following:

- Run CHKDSK /f. By running CHKDSK /f, all files contained in a directory that
  is corrupted in this way should be recovered. CHKDSK is also capable of
  detecting when instance counts are exceptionally large and will proactively
  renumber attribute instance values. Specifically, if an attribute instance
  tag is larger than 0xF000, CHKDSK will send the following message (file
  number will vary):

     Adjusting instance tags to prevent rollover on file 252.

  Thus, by periodically running read-only CHKDSK, it is possible to detect
  problem directories before they become corrupt. If the above message is
  encountered while running CHKDSK in read-only mode, you should schedule a
  full CHKDSK to correct the problem.

- To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
  Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
  please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Attribute entries within an NTFS File Record Segment (FRS) are labeled with an
"instance tag" that must be unique for the attributes in a given FRS. The value
for an attribute instance tag is generated when an attribute is created. Thus,
typical instance tag values range from 0 to about 10 on most files.

If an attribute is deleted and recreated, it receives a new instance tag. Each
time a new instance tag is needed, NTFS increments a counter associated with the
FRS in question and uses the next previously unused value. Thus, instance tags
can grow without bound if attributes are repeatedly destroyed and recreated.

For the vast majority of files and directories, the scheme described above does
not result in any problems because, once created, FRS attributes tend not to be
deleted and recreated. There is one scenario that is known to be an exception.
If many files are repeatedly added to a directory and then deleted from the
directory in such a way that the "binary tree" that indexes the directory
becomes unbalanced, the "index root" attribute for the directory is repeatedly
destroyed and re-created. Because instance tags are only 16 bits in size, this
means that instance tags can be duplicated after a directory index has been
rebalanced 65,535 times. Note that even if instance tags are duplicated, the
directory will not be considered corrupt unless, at some point, it contained a
sufficiently large enough number of files. Therefore this problem may be
difficult to reproduce except in directories containing large numbers of files.
