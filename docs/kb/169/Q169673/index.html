-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Administrator program is generating the Offline Address Book (OAB), the
Administrator program displays the following message:

  The Remote Procedure call failed.

In addition, MAD stops running on the server on which the Administrator program
is running when generating the OAB. As a result, you are not able to generate an
OAB on the global address list (GAL) or specific containers.

CAUSE
=====

The directory of the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 or
earlier has exceeded the limit of different Distinguished Names (DNs) in one
container that can be added to an Offline Address Book (OAB).

An array holding parent DNs and used within the OAB generation process, was
limited to a fixed size (1,000 entries). If the container from which the OAB was
being generated held more than 1,000 unique parent DNs, the OAB generation
process would assert, causing the above symptoms and OAB generation failure.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Offline Address Book can be generated on a container that contains a smaller
number of unique DNs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 will generate an event ID 5004 containing
the following text:

  Generation of the Offline Address Book is complete. Results: The MAPI
  call failed.
  80004005.

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 will generate an event ID 5012 containing
the following text:

  Failed to generate offline address book for container: /. Results: An
  unexpected, unknown error occurred. 8004010b.

After the initial failure in version 5.0, you will receive a message box with the
message:

  There are no more endpoints available from the endpoint mapper.

This occurs when the Administrator program attempts to contact the System
Attendant and it is no longer available.
