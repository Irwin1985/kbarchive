The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following registry parameters can be modified to change the behavior of
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for Internet Protocol (IP) included in
Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows NT Server version
3.51 Service Pack 2 and above.

NOTE: These parameters are not valid for the version of RIP included in the
Routing and Remote Access Service Update. The Routing and Remote Access Service
Update is available for download from www.microsoft.com and ftp.microsoft.com.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To make changes using Registry Editor:

- Start the Registry Editor by running the Regedt32.exe.

  -or-

  At the command prompt, type Regedt32, and then press ENTER. When the Registry
  Editor window appears, you can press F1 to get Help on how to make changes in
  Registry Editor.

- In Registry Editor, click the window titled HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE On Local
  Machine, and then click the icons for the SYSTEM subtree until you reach the
  appropriate subkey, as described later in this section.

The Registry parameters for IP RIP are specified under the following key:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IpRip\Parameters

AcceptDefaultRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0

If set to 1, default routes in received RIP announcements are accepted. By
default, they are ignored.

AcceptHostRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0

If set to 1, host routes in received RIP announcements are accepted. By default,
they are ignored.

AnnounceDefaultRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0

If set to 1, default routes are included in RIP announcements.

AnnounceHostRoutes
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0

If set to 1, host routes are included in RIP announcements.

EnablePoisonedReverse
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 1

By default, if a RIP announcement contains a route that was previously advertised
by that route, then that route is announced on the network with a metric of 16.

EnableSplitHorizon
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 1

By default, routes learned on a network are suppressed in updates sent on that
network. If the parameter is set to 0, routes learned on a network are announced
on the same network, as well.

EnableTriggeredUpdates
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 1

By default, new routes and metric changes trigger an immediate update that
includes only the changes. The time between updates depends on the value of
MaxTriggeredUpdateFrequency.

GarbageTimeout
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 15 seconds - 259200 seconds (72 hours)
Default = 120 seconds

The number of seconds to wait before removing a route marked for garbage
collection.

LoggingLevel
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 - 3
Default = 1

The minimum level of information for entries being made to the system log; 0 = no
logging, 1 = errors, 2 = warnings, 3 = information.

MaxTriggeredUpdateFrequency
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 1 second - 884400 seconds (24 hours)
Default = 5 seconds

The minimum number of seconds that must elapse between triggered updates.

RouteTimeout
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 15 seconds - 259200 seconds (72 hours)
Default = 180 seconds

The number of seconds to wait before marking a route for garbage collection.

SilentRip
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 0 or 1
Default = 0

If set to 1, suppresses periodic RIP announcements.

UpdateFrequency
Data type = REG_DWORD
Range = 15 seconds - 884400 seconds (24 hours)
Default = 30 seconds

The number of seconds between periodic updates that contain the entire routing
table. This entry also determines the period at which the route table is updated
from received RIP updates.
