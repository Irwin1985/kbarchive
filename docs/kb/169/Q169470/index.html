SUMMARY
=======

This article covers some of the most frequently asked questions about ODBC
connection pooling.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is ODBC connection pooling?

  A. Connection pooling is one the new features introduced in ODBC 3.0.
  Connection pooling enables an ODBC application to reuse a connection from a
  pool of connections. Once a connection has been created and placed in the
  pool, an ODBC application can reuse the same driver and the connection within
  the same shared environment (henv) without performing the complete connection
  process. However, a connection can never be reused between different henv or
  different drivers.

2. Q. Can I use connection pooling with 2.x ODBC drivers?

  A. Connection pooling is implemented in the ODBC driver manager version 3.0 or
  later. The driver version does not matter.

3. Q. Can I enable connection pooling with the Microsoft Access driver because
  the connection pooling is implemented in the driver manager?

  A. You can enable connection pooling for Microsoft Access driver. Microsoft
  Access uses Jet, and Jet is thread safe starting from Jet 4.0. From MDAC 2.1
  and later, you can have connection pooling for Access ODBC driver.

4. Q. How do I enable connection pooling in an ODBC application?

  A. An ODBC application can call SQLSetEnvAttr with the
  SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING attribute to enable connection pooling. For more
  information about how to enable connection pooling in an ODBC application,
  please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q164221 How to Enable Connection Pooling in an ODBC Application

5. Q. How do I enable connection pooling if the application is written in Visual
  Basic?

  A. A Visual Basic or ODBC application can call the SQLSetEnvAttr function to
  enable connection pooling. Connection pooling is a process-level attribute,
  so any subsequent connection made through the ODBC driver manager in the
  Visual Basic application will use connection pooling. A Visual Basic
  application can use the function declaration and code to enable connection
  pooling.

        Declare Function SQLSetEnvAttr Lib "odbc32.dll" (ByVal henv As Long,
        ByVal Attribute As Long, ByVal Value As Long, ByVal StringLength As
        Long) As Integer

        ' env attribute
        Public Const SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING = 201
        Public Const SQL_ATTR_CP_MATCH = 202

        ' values for SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING
        Public Const SQL_CP_ONE_PER_DRIVER = 1
        Public Const SQL_IS_UINTEGER = -5

        nstatus = SQLSetEnvAttr(0, SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_POOLING,
        SQL_CP_ONE_PER_DRIVER, SQL_IS_UINTEGER)
        SQLAllocEnv...
        SQLAllocConnect...
        SQLConnect...
        SQLDisConnect...
        SQLFreeConnect...
        SQLFreeEnv...

6. Q. How do I enable connection pooling in an OLE DB application?

  A. An OLE DB application can call SQLSetEnvAttr to enable connection pooling.

  For more information about how to enable connection pooling in an OLE DB
  application, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q166083 How to Enable Connection Pooling in an OLE DB Application

7. Q. How do I enable connection pooling for Active Server Pages (ASP) or
  ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)?

  A. Microsoft Internet Information server (IIS) version 3.0 with Active Server
  Pages takes advantage of connection pooling. You can enable connection
  pooling for IIS users by changing the value of StartConnectionPool to 1. The
  StartConnectionPool is located under
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\ASP \Parameters.

For additional information on how to enable connection pooling for IIS 4.0, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q189410 HOWTO: Enable or Disable Connection Pooling in IIS 4.0

8. Q. How do I limit the number of connections in the pool?

  A. The number of connections in the pool is controlled by the ODBC driver
  manager. ODBC applications cannot control it.

9. Q. How do I monitor how many connections are in the pool?

  A. You can monitor the connections in the connection pool.

  Q238442 ODBC Connection Pooling Object Disappears from PerfMon

  Q245543 INFO: ODBC Connection Pooling Counters in Performance Monitor

10. Q. How do I clear out the connections in the pool?

  A. How long a connection remains in the pool depends on the CPTimeout
  property of the ODBC driver. When the timeout expires, the connection will
  be closed and removed from the pool. The ODBC application can use
  SQLConfigDriver to change the value of CPTimeout, and this value applies to
  all the ODBC applications that are using the specified ODBC driver. The
  default value for the CPTimeout is 60 seconds.


11. Q. Do I have to explicitly enable connection pooling if my application is
  running in Microsoft Transaction Server?

  A. If you are going through an ODBC driver to an ODBC data source, Microsoft
  Transaction Server will enable connection pooling; you do not have to
  explicitly enable connection pooling.

12. Q. What if a connection in the pool goes bad? Will the ODBC driver manager
  be able to detect it ?

  A. ODBC 3.0 hands over a bad connection without checking whether the
  connection is bad or not. With Service Pack 1, the driver manager will
  detect a bad connection. If a connection in the pool is bad, the driver
  manager will detect it and return a good connection. If the driver manager
  is not able to create a good connection, it will return an error message.

13. Q. With ODBC 3.0 Service Pack 1, will the ODBC driver manager try to connect
  to the database server repeatedly when the server is not available?

  A. ODBC 3.0 Service Pack 1 introduced a new API, ODBCSetTryWaitValue, to
  prevent the ODBC driver manager from connecting to an unavailable server
  repeatedly. ODBCSetTryWaitValue takes a DWORD parameter and saves the
  information in the registry at the following location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Odbc\Odbcinst.ini \ODBC Connection Pooling\Retry
  Wait

  Once the diver manager detects a bad database server, it returns an error
  message and marks the connection with the time. From that point until the
  RetryWait value expires, the driver manager returns a failure without trying
  to reconnect to the database server.

  For more information about how to use the ODBCSetTryWaitValue ODBC API, see
  the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
