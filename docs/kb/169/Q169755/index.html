The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

To troubleshoot fax problems that occur when you use Microsoft Fax to send a fax
from Word, use the methods described in the "More Information" section of this
article.

NOTE: Third-party faxing software is available for use with Microsoft Word;
however, Microsoft Technical Support can only support faxing from Word when
using Microsoft Fax.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To fully test your system's ability to communicate and function correctly with
your modem and Microsoft Fax, perform the steps in the order in which they are
listed here.

Step 1: Test Windows Communications with Your Modem
---------------------------------------------------

To test whether Windows can communicate with your modem, follow these steps:

  Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Modems icon.

3. Click the Diagnostics tab, click the port at which you have your modem
  installed, and then click More Info. Windows will now attempt to communicate
  with your modem. Windows should display the following message:

  Communicating with modem. This may take a few minutes.

  Windows will send several "AT" commands to your modem. If these tests are
  successful, Windows will display the Port Information and "AT" responses for
  each command.

  Microsoft Windows 2000

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Phone and Modem Options icon.

3. Click the Modems tab, click the port at which you have your modem installed,
  and then click Properties.

4. In the Modemname dialog box, click the Diagnostics tab. Click Query Modem.
  Windows now attempts to communicate with your modem. Windows should display
  the following message:

  Communicating with modem. This may take a few minutes.

  Windows sends several "AT" commands to your modem. If these tests are
  successful, Windows displays the Port Information and "AT" responses for each
  command.

If the tests are successful, proceed to step 2.

If any of the following problems occur, you may have either a modem, modem
configuration, or modem connection problem. If this is the case, refer to the
additional information articles at the end of this section.

Problems that may occur when you run the test:

- The COM port for your modem may not be listed as an available port.

  -or-

- You receive any of the following error messages:

  The modem failed to respond. Make sure it is properly connected and turned
  on. If it is an internal modem or is connected, verify that the interrupt for
  the port is properly set.

  -or-

  The COM&lt;x&gt; port is currently assigned to an MS-DOS application. Do you
  want to reassign the port to Windows?

  -or-

  Another program is using the selected Telephony device. Try again after the
  other program completes.

  -or-

  You receive a "disk full" error. The hard disk partition containing your
  temporary fax folder is low on storage space. For information on cleaning out
  this folder, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q158114 Err Msg: Another Program Is Using the Selected Telephony...


Step 2: Test the Send Functionality of Microsoft Fax
----------------------------------------------------

To check the send functionality of Microsoft Fax, use the following steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
  Fax, and then click Compose New Fax. The Compose New Fax wizard should start.

2. Click Next.

  NOTE: Click Dialing Properties to change dialing information, if needed.

3. Type in the addressee in the To line, and then type in the fax number of a
  fax machine you can send a test fax to. Click Add To List, and then click
  Next.

4. For your test, click No to the question "Do you want a cover page?" Click
  Options. Under the Time To Send section, click "As soon as Possible," click
  OK, and then click Next.

5. Type in a Subject and a short Note, and then click Next.

6. On the Files To Send dialog box, click Next.

7. In the "Your Fax is now ready. To send it, click Finish" dialog box, click
  Finish.

Microsoft Fax will send your test document. A Microsoft Fax dialog box should
appear on your screen. There will be several messages indicating the progress of
the test. The messages you should see are similar to the following:

- Processing new fax message
- Preparing email format
- Email format created
- Calling &lt;recipient&gt;

If these steps are successful, proceed to step 3.

If either of the following problems occur, see the articles at the end of this
section.

Problems that may occur when you follow the steps:

- You receive the following error message:

  The following unrecoverable error has occurred: Internal MAPI error: The
  information service cannot be added to the profile using the Inbox Setup
  Wizard. Contact your administrator.

- The Fax command is not available on the Accessories menu.

You may have either a modem, modem configuration, modem connection, fax service,
or profile problem. In order to correct this problem, repeat step 1 in this
section, remove and reinstall Microsoft Fax, add Microsoft Fax to your profile,
or reinstall Microsoft Windows 95 with Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Fax
selected.

Knowledge Base:

  Q162203 OL97: User Profiles and Information Services


For more information about how to perform this task in Windows 95, see your
Windows 95 printed documentation, online Help, or call Microsoft Windows 95
Technical Support.

Step 3: Test the Rendering System of Microsoft Fax from Word
------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Make sure that the Mail As Attachment option is turned off in Word. To turn
the Mail As Attachment option off, click to clear the Mail As Attachment check
box on the General tab. To view the General tab, click Options on the Tools
menu.

To test whether Microsoft Fax can render a Word document for faxing, follow these
steps:

1. Create a document in Word. On the File menu, point to Send, and then click
  Mail Recipient.

  NOTE: If Send is not available on the File menu, you must install Microsoft
  Exchange using Windows 95 Setup.

2. In the New Message dialog box, the Word document will appear as text and the
  insertion point should be blinking in the To line.

  NOTE: To send your Word document as an attachment to the mail message, in
  Word, click Options on the Tools menu. On the General tab, click to select
  the Mail As Attachment check box, and then click OK.

3. In the To line, type "[fax:me]" (without the quotation marks).

4. Use one of the following methods:

Method 1: With Microsoft Outlook Installed
------------------------------------------

  a. On the File menu, click Send Options.

  b. On the Fax tab, under Message Format, click to select the Not Editable
     check box, and then click OK.

Method 2: Without Microsoft Outlook Installed
---------------------------------------------

  a. On the File menu, click Properties.

  b. On the General tab, under Message Format, click to select Not Editable and
     then click OK.

  c. Click OK.

5. On the File menu, click Send.

Word will now send your document. A Microsoft Fax dialog box should appear on
your screen. There will be several messages indicating the progress of the test.
The messages you should see are:

- Processing new fax message.
- Preparing fax format.
- Scheduling fax.
- Calling:Me.

By using the [fax:me] and the Not Editable format, you force Microsoft Fax to
render and send the fax to your inbox. If these steps are successful, proceed to
step 4 (the cause of the problem is probably an address or fax modem problem).

If any of the following problems are experienced, refer to the additional
information articles at the end of this section.

Problems you may experience when you run this test include:

- You receive the following error message in Microsoft Exchange:

  The item's properties could not be displayed. No additional send options are
  available for this message.

- When you click Send Options on the File menu from the test message, nothing
  happens.
- You cannot close Microsoft Word until the Send Mail command is finished.
  Switch to the New Message first, and either send or close the message.
- You receive a message stating that no transport provider was available for
  delivery to this recipient.
- You receive an "Undeliverable" mail message stating "An unknown error has
  occurred. Try to send the fax again."
- The Fax tab is missing from the "Send Options for this Message" dialog box
  after you click Send Options on the File menu from your test message.
- You receive an "Undeliverable" mail message stating "A problem occurred
  during message processing in the message store."
- Electronic Fax is not available as a merge option.
- When you select mail merge to "Electronic Mail" you get the following error
  message:

  Microsoft Exchange does not recognize &lt;Phone Number&gt;

  Would you like to

  Create a new address for &lt;Phone Number&gt;

Step 4: Test Printing to Microsoft Fax from Word
------------------------------------------------

To test Microsoft Fax by using the Print command on the File menu, follow these
steps:

1. Create a new document or open an existing document.

2. On the File menu, click Print.

3. In the Print dialog box, under Printer, in the Name box, select Microsoft
  Fax, and then click OK.

  The Compose New Fax wizard should start.

4. Change your Dialing Properties, if necessary, and then click Next.

5. Type in the name and fax number of the fax recipient, click Add to list, and
  then click Next.

6. Click No when prompted with the question "Do you want a cover page?" Click
  Next.

7. Type in a subject and note, if desired, and then click Next.

8. Click Finish to complete sending the test fax.

If these steps are successful, Microsoft Fax should be properly installed.
However, if you continue to experience problems, you may need to call Microsoft
Windows 95 Technical Support or Microsoft Word Technical Support.
