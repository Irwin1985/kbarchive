-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are running Windows NT 4.0 on a portable computer connected to a LAN, and
your network adapter receives a TCP/IP address from a DHCP server. DHCP also
assigns a WINS and DNS server address to your network adapter.

When you remove your computer from the LAN and use RAS (Dial-Up Networking) to
connect to a remote server, you find that name resolution slows down by at least
sixfold (for example, names formerly resolved in 10 seconds now take at least 60
seconds).

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem is that the DNS server addresses remain bound to your
network adapter. The result is that your client attempts to resolve host names
through DNS servers that are not available because your computer has been
removed from the network.

Using "IPCONFIG /RELEASE" (without the quotation marks) from the command prompt
will not release the DNS server address(es) bound to your network adapter.

NOTE: If you have multiple network adapters in your system, these adapters will
also continue to use the DHCP assigned DNS server address(es).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, on the Windows NT 4.0 Dial-Up Networking client, do
one of the following:

- Configure the RAS server with a DNS address. This address will be given to
  RAS clients. RAS clients will use this DNS first and there should be no delay
  resolving names.

  -or-

- Use the Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Profiles option to create a remote hardware
  profile that eliminates the network adapter on the Windows NT 4.0 remote
  client. In the Control Panel, double-click the System icon and click the
  Hardware Profiles tab to find this option. Use the context help file for
  assistance in creating the remote profile without a network adapter. The
  Hardware Profiles option automatically creates a boot menu so you can choose
  between your local and remote profiles.

  -or-

- Use the Registry Editor to the remove reference to the legacy DNS server
  entry.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- Wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk. To remove the
  DNS server addresses from your network adapter, follow these steps:

  1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  2. Go to the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\ 
     Parameters\DhcpNameServer

  3. Double-click the DHCPNameServer entry in the right pane window, and select
     the DHCP assigned name server addresses. Now, pinging a Host name or a
     NetBIOS name over the RAS connection take the expected amount of time
     (without significant delay).

     The change is immediate, and you will not have to restart after making this
     change. After you disconnect from the Dial-Up Networking remote connection
     and reconnect to your LAN, run the IPCONFIG /RENEW command at the command
     prompt to restore the original DNS server settings.

  -or-

- Ensure that you have specified a DNS server that is valid for your remote
  network in the "Specify name server addresses" option of the PPP TCP/IP
  Settings dialog found in your Edit Phonebook Entry window for the Windows NT
  4.0 Dial-Up Networking interface.

STATUS
