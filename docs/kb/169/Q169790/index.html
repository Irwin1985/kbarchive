SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot some common network communication
problems you may experience when you use TCP/IP as your network protocol. These
problems usually fall into one of the following two categories:

- You are unable to connect to a specific IP address.

- You are unable to connect to a specific host or NetBIOS name.

If you are unable to connect to a specific IP address, the problem is related to
basic connectivity. If you are able to connect to a specific IP address, but you
are not able to connect using the host or NetBIOS name for that IP address, the
problem is related to name resolution.

NOTE: All of the troubleshooting steps below will work on the NT and 2000
platforms, but may not work on the Win9x (except Win ME) platforms. However, the
basic diagnostic and troubleshooting methods are the same for all of these
Windows operating systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine whether the problem is related to basic connectivity or name
resolution, use the following procedure to determine whether you can connect to
a specific IP address.

Connect to an IP Address
------------------------

Try to connect to another computer on your network using its IP address and the
TCP/IP program or utility of your choice. Web browsers, ftp, and Telnet are some
programs and utilities commonly used to connect to other computers with TCP/IP.

NOTE: If you do not know the IP address for your Windows NT or 2000 computer that
you are attempting to connect to, run the IPCONFIG /ALL command at a command
prompt on the other computer.

If you cannot connect to the other computer using its IP address, there is a
basic connectivity problem. Use the information in the "Unable to Connect to a
Specific IP Address" section below to resolve your issue. If you can connect to
the other computer using its IP address, but you are not able to connect using
the host or NetBIOS name of the other computuer, there is probably a name
resolution problem. Use the information in the "Unable to Connect to a Specific
Host or NetBIOS Name" section below to resolve your issue.

UNABLE TO CONNECT TO A SPECIFIC IP ADDRESS

Follow the procedures in each of the following sections in order. After you
finish each procedure, check to see if you can connect to the other computer
using its IP address.

Check Your TCP/IP Configuration
-------------------------------

When you use TCP/IP as your network protocol, an incorrect TCP/IP setting (such
as an incorrect IP address or an incorrect subnet mask) can cause communication
problems. To determine whether Windows NT or 2000 has recorded an error due to
an incorrect TCP/IP setting, examine the Event Viewer system log and look for
any entry with TCP/IP or DHCP as the source. To read an Event Viewer entry,
double-click the entry.

NOTE: If Event Viewer records a DHCP error, you should report the error to your
network administrator.

If you receive TCP/IP errors in the Event Viewer system log, resolve each error
received as indicated by the error message. For example, if you receive an error
stating that the IP address parameter is incorrect, you should verify that your
IP address is valid.

If there are no errors in the Event Viewer system log, follow these steps to make
sure that the correct TCP/IP configuration information is being used:

1. Use the IPCONFIG command to determine your computer's basic TCP/IP settings.
  To do so, type "ipconfig" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

2. Verify that the IP address and subnet mask displayed by the IPCONFIG command
  are the correct values for your computer. If you are not sure what the
  correct values are, contact your network administrator.

Ping the Loopback Address
-------------------------

Use the PING command to verify that TCP/IP is working properly. To do so, ping
the loopback address (127.0.0.1) by typing the following command at a command
prompt:

  ping 127.0.0.1

You should receive a response similar to the following:

  Pinging 127.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:

  Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=&lt;10ms TTL=128
  Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=&lt;10ms TTL=128
  Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=&lt;10ms TTL=128
  Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time=&lt;10ms TTL=128

If you receive an error message at this point, TCP/IP is not properly installed.
To remove and reinstall TCP/IP, follow these steps:

NOTE: You must be logged on as a user with Administrator rights to complete these
steps.

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Protocols tab.

2. Click TCP/IP Protocol to select it, click Remove, and then click Yes.

3. Click Close, and then click Yes to restart the computer.

4. Log on as a user with Administrator rights.

5. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Protocols tab.

6. Click Add, click TCP/IP Protocol to select it, and then click OK.

7. If you want to use DHCP, click Yes when prompted. If you do not want to use
  DHCP, click No.

8. When prompted, type the path for the Windows NT source files, click Continue,
  and then click Close.

9. If you are not using DHCP, you are prompted for your TCP/IP configuration
  information. Provide the appropriate values, and then click OK. If you are
  not sure what the appropriate values are, contact your network administrator.

10. Click No when you are prompted to restart your computer. If you have
  installed a Windows NT Service Pack, you need to reinstall the Service Pack
  before you restart your computer.

11. Restart your computer.

If you receive an error message while removing and reinstalling TCP/IP, you may
need to manually remove TCP/IP from the Windows NT registry. For information
about manually removing TCP/IP from the Windows NT registry, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q151237 Error Message When Installing TCP/IP or Adding TCP/IP Service

Ping Your Computer's IP Address
-------------------------------

If you can ping the loopback address successfully, attempt to ping your own IP
address by typing "ping &lt;IP address&gt;" (without the quotation marks) at a
command prompt, where &lt;IP address&gt; is your computer's IP address.

NOTE: If you do not know your computer's IP address, you can obtain that
information by typing "ipconfig" (without the quotation marks) at a command
prompt.

You should receive a response similar to the following:

  Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:

  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=77ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=80ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=28

Where &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; is your computer's IP address.

If you receive an error message at this point, there may be a communication
problem between Windows NT and your network adapter. To correct this problem,
remove and reinstall your network adapter driver. To do so, follow these steps:

NOTE: You must be logged on as a user with Administrator rights to complete these
steps.

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Adapters tab.

2. Click your network adapter driver to select it, click Remove, and then click
  Yes.

3. Click Close, and then click Yes to restart your computer.

4. Log on as a user with Administrator rights.

5. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Adapters tab.

6. Click Add, click your network adapter driver to select it, and then click OK.

7. Use the dialog box(es) provided to configure your network adapter, and then
  click OK.

8. When prompted, type the path for the Windows NT source files, click Continue,
  and then click Close.

9. When you are prompted for your TCP/IP configuration information, provide the
  appropriate values, and then click OK. If you are not sure what the
  appropriate values are, contact your network administrator.

10. Click No when you are prompted to restart your computer. If you have
  installed a Windows NT Service Pack, you need to reinstall the Service Pack
  before you restart your computer.

11. Restart your computer.

If you are unable to ping your computer's IP address after removing and
reinstalling your network adapter driver, contact the manufacturer of your
network adapter to verify that you are using the appropriate Windows NT driver
for your network adapter.

Clear the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Cache
-------------------------------------------------

The address resolution protocol (ARP) cache is a list of recently resolved IP
address to Media Access Control (MAC) address mappings. The MAC address is the
unique physical address embedded in each network adapter.

If an entry in the ARP cache is incorrect, IP datagrams may be sent to the wrong
computer. To display all mappings currently in the ARP cache, use the ARP
command by typing "arp -a" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt.
You should receive either a "No ARP Entries Found" message (if the ARP cache is
empty) or a response similar to the following:

  Interface: 10.1.1.3 on Interface 2
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  10.1.1.7              08-00-02-06-ed-20     dynamic
  10.1.1.254            08-00-02-0a-a3-10     dynamic

To remove any incorrect entries in the ARP cache, clear all entries using the
following command:

  arp -d &lt;IP address&gt;

Where &lt;IP address&gt; is an Internet address stored in the ARP cache. Use this
command for each entry in the ARP cache until all entries have been deleted.

For more information on the syntax, options, and usage of the ARP command, type
"arp -?" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

Verify the Default Gateway
--------------------------

Use the IPCONFIG command to determine the IP address that your computer uses to
access your default gateway. To do so, type "ipconfig" (without quotation marks)
at a command prompt. Verify that the IP address displayed for your default
gateway is correct. If you do not know the correct IP address for your default
gateway, contact your network administrator.

When you have verified that you have the correct IP address for your default
gateway, use the PING command to verify that you can ping your default gateway's
IP address. You should receive a response similar to the following:

  Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=77ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=80ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=28

Where &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; is the IP address of your default gateway.

If your default gateway is not connected to the network or not functioning
properly, you may receive a response similar to the following:

  Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.

If you cannot successfully ping your default gateway's IP address, contact your
network administrator to verify that your default gateway is connected to the
network and functioning properly.

Ping the IP Address of the Other Computer
-----------------------------------------

Try to ping the IP address of the other computer. To do so, type "ping &lt;IP
address&gt;" (without the quotation marks) where &lt;IP address&gt; is the IP
address of the other computer. You should receive a response similar to the
following:

  Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=77ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=80ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=28
  Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=28

Where &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; is the IP address of the other computer.

If there is an improperly configured router between your computer and the other
computer, or if there is a problem with the other computer, you may receive a
response similar to the following:

  Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.
  Request timed out.

If your computer is on a different subnet than the other computer, try to ping
the other computer from a computer that is on the same subnet as the other
computer. If you cannot ping the other computer from a computer on the same
subnet, ensure that the other computer is connected to the network and that you
have the correct IP address for the other computer. If you can ping the other
computer from a computer on the same subnet, contact your network administrator
to resolve any routing problems that may exist on your network.

Verify Persistent Route Table Entries
-------------------------------------

Any computer using TCP/IP as a network protocol has a route table. The route a
network packet takes from one computer using TCP/IP to another computer using
TCP/IP is determined by the route table of the computer that sent the network
packet.

Your computer's route table is automatically rebuilt each time you restart your
computer. You or your network administrator can add persistent (static) entries
to your computer's route table. Persistent entries are automatically reinserted
in your route table each time your computer's route table is rebuilt.

To view your computer's route table, use the ROUTE command. To do so, type "route
print" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt. You should receive a
response similar to the following:

  Active Routes:

  Network Address   Netmask           Gateway Address  Interface   Metric

  0.0.0.0           0.0.0.0           10.1.1.254       10.1.1.3       1
  10.1.0.0          255.255.0.0       10.1.1.3         10.1.1.3       1
  10.1.1.3          255.255.255.255   127.0.0.1        127.0.0.1      1
  10.255.255.255    255.255.255.255   10.1.1.3         10.1.1.3       1
  127.0.0.1         255.0.0.0         127.0.0.1        127.0.0.1      1
  224.0.0.0         224.0.0.0         10.1.1.3         10.1.1.3       1
  255.255.255.255   255.255.255.255   10.1.1.3         10.1.1.3       1

Verify with your network administrator that all persistent entries in your
computer's route table are valid.

For more information on routing, route tables, and the ROUTE command, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140859 TCP/IP Routing Basics for Windows NT

Use the TRACERT Command
-----------------------

The TRACERT command reports each router or gateway crossed by a TCP/IP packet on
its way to another host. To use the TRACERT command to trace the route between
your computer and the other computer, type "tracert &lt;IP address&gt;" (without
the quotation marks) at a command prompt, where &lt;IP address&gt; is the IP
address of the other computer. You should receive a response similar to the
following:

  Tracing route to &lt;IP address&gt; over a maximum of 30 hops:

    1   &lt;10 ms   &lt;10 ms   &lt;10 ms  &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;
    2    50 ms    50 ms    51 ms  &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;
    3   250 ms    80 ms    50 ms  &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;

  Trace complete.

Where each &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; is the IP address of a different router.

If there is a problem with one of the routers that the network packet tries to
cross, you may receive a response similar to the following:

  Tracing route to &lt;IP address&gt; over a maximum of 30 hops:

    1   &lt;10 ms   &lt;10 ms   &lt;10 ms  &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;
    2     *        *        *     Request timed out.
    3     *        *        *     Request timed out.
    4     *        *        *     Request timed out.

If there is a configuration error on one of the routers between your computer and
the other computer, you may receive a response similar to the following:

  Tracing route to &lt;IP address&gt; over a maximum of 30 hops:

    1   &lt;10 ms   &lt;10 ms   &lt;10 ms  &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;
    2    50 ms    50 ms    51 ms  &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;
    3  &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;  reports: Destination net unreachable.

You may also receive a response similar to the one above when there is a proxy or
a firewall between your computer and the other computer.

If you are not able to obtain a successful response using the TRACERT command to
trace the route between your computer and the other computer, contact your
network administrator to determine if there is a routing problem between your
computer and the other computer.

For more information on the TRACERT command, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q162326 Using TRACERT to Troubleshoot TCP/IP Problems in Windows NT

Verify Server Services on the Other Computer
--------------------------------------------

Verify that the appropriate server services are running on the other computer.
For example, if you are attempting to use the Telnet tool to connect to the
other computer, make sure that the other computer is configured as a Telnet
server.

To verify that the appropriate server service is running on the other computer,
attempt to connect to the other computer from another computer that is on the
same subnet as the other computer. If you cannot connect to the other computer
from a computer on the same subnet, contact the network administrator to verify
that the server service is configured and functioning properly on the other
computer. If you can connect to the other computer from a computer on the same
subnet, contact your network administrator to resolve any routing problems that
may exist on your network.

Check IP Security on the Server
-------------------------------

Port settings for services on the other computer may be different than the port
settings you are using to connect. The following chart lists some standard port
settings for various protocols:

Port:   Protocol:
-----   ---------
80      HTTP
21      FTP
23      Telnet
70      Gopher

Use the Telnet tool to verify that the other computer is configured to permit
connections on the same port you are using to connect. To do so, type the
following line at a command prompt:

  telnet &lt;IP address&gt; &lt;port&gt;

Where &lt;IP address&gt; is the IP address of the other computer and &lt;port&gt;
is the port you are attempting to make a connection on. For example, if you are
attempting to make an ftp connection to the other computer on port 21, type
"telnet &lt;IP address&gt; 21" (without the quotation marks).

If you do not receive an error message, the other computer is configured to
permit connections on that port. You should be able to make a connection using
the appropriate service on that port.

If you receive an error message, the other computer may not be configured to
permit connections on that port. Contact the network administrator to obtain a
valid port number for the service on the other computer.

Unable to Connect to a Specific Host or NETBios Name
----------------------------------------------------

If you are able to connect to the other computer using its IP address, but you
are not able to connect to the other computer using its host or NetBIOS name,
there may be a name resolution problem. There are many methods that can be used
to accomplish name resolution on a network including the following:

- HOSTS files

- Domain Name Service (DNS)

- LMHOSTS files

- Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)

If you are uncertain which methods are used to accomplish name resolution on your
network, contact your network administrator. Follow the procedures in each of
the following sections in order. After you finish each procedure, check to see
if you can connect to the other computer using its host name or NetBIOS name.

Check the HOSTS File
--------------------

The HOSTS file is a text file that you can edit with any text editor (such as
Notepad). If your network uses HOSTS files for host name resolution and you
cannot connect to the other computer using its host name, there may be an
invalid entry in your HOSTS file. Search your HOSTS file for the host name of
the other computer, verify that there is only one entry per host name, and then
verify that the entry for the host name of the other computer is valid.

For more information on the HOSTS file, see the sample HOSTS file in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc folder.

Check Your Domain Name Service (DNS) Configuration
--------------------------------------------------

A Domain Name Service (DNS) server provides host name resolution. If your network
uses DNS for host name resolution and you cannot connect to the other computer
using its host name, there may be a problem with your computer's DNS
configuration or with the DNS server on your network.

To determine if there is a problem with your computer's DNS configuration, follow
these steps:

1. Type "ipconfig /all" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt to
  display the IP address of your DNS server. If the IP address for your DNS
  server is not displayed, contact your network administrator to obtain the IP
  address for your DNS server.

2. Verify that you can communicate with your DNS server by pinging your DNS
  server's IP address. You should see a reply similar to the following:

     Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:

     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=77ms TTL=28
     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=80ms TTL=28
     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=28
     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=28

  Where &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; is the IP address of the DNS server.

If you cannot ping the IP address of your DNS server successfully, contact your
network administrator to verify that you have the correct IP address for your
DNS server and that your DNS server is connected to the network and functioning
properly.

If you can ping the IP address of your DNS server, but cannot resolve the host
name of the other computer, your DNS server may not be resolving host names
properly. If more than one DNS server is available on your network, configure
your computer to use a different DNS server. If another DNS server resolves the
host name of the other computer properly or if there is no other DNS server to
use, contact your network administrator to correct the problem with the original
DNS server.

When you have verified the correct IP address for your DNS server, update your
computer's TCP/IP settings. If you are using a dial-up connection to connect to
your network, you need to change only the TCP/IP settings in your Dial-Up
Networking phone book entry with the correct IP address for your DNS server.

To change or add a valid IP address for your DNS server in your computer's TCP/IP
settings, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Protocols tab.

2. Click TCP/IP Protocol to select it, click Properties, and then click the DNS
  tab.

3. If you are adding a DNS server, click Add. If you are editing an existing
  server, click the IP address for the appropriate DNS server, and then click
  Edit.

4. Type the correct IP address for the DNS server, and then click OK.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again. You may need to restart your computer
  after this step.

To change or add a valid IP address for your DNS server for a Dial-Up Networking
phonebook entry, follow these steps:

1. In Dial-Up Networking, click the appropriate entry in the Phonebook Entry To
  Dial box.

2. Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.

3. Click the Server tab, and then click the TCP/IP Settings button.

4. Click Specify Name Server Addresses, and then type the correct IP address in
  the Primary DNS box.

Check the LMHOSTS File
----------------------

The LMHOSTS file is a text file that you can edit with any text editor (such as
Notepad). If your network uses LMHOSTS files for NetBIOS name resolution and you
cannot connect to the other computer using its NetBIOS name, there may be an
invalid entry in your LMHOSTS file. Search your LMHOSTS file for the NetBIOS
name of the other computer, verify that there is only one entry per NetBIOS
name, and then verify that the entry for the NetBIOS name of the other computer
is correct.

If there are any #INCLUDE entries or any #BEGIN_ALTERNATE to #END_ALTERNATE
blocks of lines in your LMHOSTS file, temporarily disable all such lines or
blocks of lines by placing the pound (#) character and one space at the
beginning of each line to be disabled.

If disabling these lines or blocks of lines resolves the problem, re- enable the
lines or blocks of lines one at a time until the problem reoccurs. When you have
determined that a specific line or block of lines causes a problem, check the
LMHOSTS files that the lines point to.

For more information on the LMHOSTS file, see the Lmhosts.sam sample file located
in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc folder.

Check Your Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------

A Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server provides NetBIOS name resolution.
If your network uses WINS for NetBIOS name resolution and you cannot connect to
the other computer using its NetBIOS name, there may be a problem with your
computer's WINS configuration or with the WINS server on your network.

To determine if there is a problem with your computer's WINS configuration,
follow these steps:

1. Type "ipconfig /all" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt to
  display the IP address of your WINS server. If the IP address for your WINS
  server is not displayed, contact your network administrator to obtain the IP
  address for your WINS server.

2. Verify that you can communicate with your WINS server by pinging your WINS
  server's IP address. You should see a reply similar to the following:

     Pinging &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; with 32 bytes of data:

     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=77ms TTL=28
     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=80ms TTL=28
     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=78ms TTL=28
     Reply from &lt;###.###.###.###&gt;: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=28

  Where &lt;###.###.###.###&gt; is the IP address of the WINS server.

If you cannot ping the IP address of your WINS server, contact your network
administrator to verify that you have the correct IP address for your WINS
server and that your WINS server is connected to the network and functioning
properly.

If you can ping the IP address of your WINS server, but cannot resolve the
NetBIOS name of the other computer, your WINS server may not be resolving
NetBIOS names properly. If more than one WINS server is available on your
network, configure your computer to use a different WINS server. If another WINS
server resolves the NetBIOS name of the other computer properly or if there is
no other WINS server to use, contact your network administrator to correct the
problem with the original WINS server.

When you have verified the correct IP address for your WINS server, update your
computer's TCP/IP settings. If you are using a dial-up connection to connect to
your network, you need to change only the TCP/IP settings in your Dial-Up
Networking phone book entry with the correct IP address for your WINS server.

To change or add a valid IP address for your WINS server in your computer's
TCP/IP settings, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then click the Protocols tab.

2. Click TCP/IP Protocol to select it, click Properties, and then click the WINS
  Address tab.

3. Type the correct WINS server IP address in the Primary WINS Server box, and
  then click OK.

4. Click Close, and then click Yes to restart your computer.

To change or add a valid IP address for your WINS server for a Dial-Up Networking
phonebook entry, follow these steps:

1. In Dial-Up Networking, click the appropriate entry in the Phonebook Entry To
  Dial box.

2. Click More, and then click Edit Entry And Modem Properties.

3. Click the Server tab, and then click the TCP/IP Settings button.

4. Click Specify Name Server Addresses, and then type the correct IP address in
  the Primary WINS box.
