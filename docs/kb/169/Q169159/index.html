SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a checklist that is intended as an aide in configuring a
Microsoft Exchange Server X.400 Connector to a foreign X.400 Message Handling
System (MHS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is not intended to replace observations on previously operational
connections that may point to the actual problem, but rather as a guide to
succesful configuration of between dissimilar message transfer agents (MTAs).
The term 'host' refers to a computer that supports an MTA.

1. Can each host ping the IP address of the other?

   - No - Resolve network issue.

   - Yes - If you want to use the host name instead of the IP address, continue
     to step 2. Otherwise, continue to step 3.

2. If the host name will be used instead of the IP address of the target MTA,
  ping the host name. NOTE: DNS supports host name resolution, or a 'hosts'
  file may be used. The hosts file for computers running Windows NT Server is
  located in the &lt;winntdir&gt;\System32\Drivers\Etc folder. The format is IP
  address, a tab, and then the host name. Did the host name return an IP
  address?

   - No - There is a problem with name resolution.

   - Yes - Continue to step 3.

3. Configure the Exchange Server MTA to support a 2K TPDU. Start the Windows NT
  Registry Editor, change to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

  Find the Supports 2K TPDU registry value, set the type to DWORD, and then
  change the value to 0x1 (1 hexadecimal).

4. Have the administrator who wants to configure a given MTA record the
  following information for the MTA that they want to connect to:

   - Remote Host name. This entry is is case sensitive and cannot exceed 32
     characters in length. It is used to specifiy the Remote MTA name on the
     General tab of the Exchange Server X.400 Connector.

   - Remote MTA password. This entry is case sensitive and cannot exceed a
     length of 64 characters. It is used to specifiy the Remote MTA password on
     the General tab of the Exchange Server X.400 Connector.

   - T selector. This value cannot exceed 32 text characters (64 hexadecimal
     characters). This value is critical and must be an exact match with the
     corresponding value specified in the configuration for the MTA on the
     other host. This value is used for the T selector that is specified on the
     Stack tab of the Exchange Server X.400 Connector. If the remote
     administrator wants to specify a S selector and/or a P Selector, this
     should be done after successful messaging has been established. The
     selector supported in the X.400 link options depends on the mode of the
     MTA. 1988 mode supports T, S, and P selector. 1984 modes support a T
     selector only.

5. Use the Overide tab to specify the local MTA and password. The Exchange
  Server MTA uses the name of the computer that is running Windows NT Server on
  which Exchange Server is installed for the MTA name. If no incoming password
  is necessary, using the Override tab is unnecessary. Using a password is
  redundant because the T selector provides adequate security.

6. The administrator of the foreign MTA provides the X.400 address associated
  with the foreign MTA or requests that you specify a 'wildcard' for the
  Country code in the address space configured on the Address tab of the
  Exchange Server X.400 Connector. Using a 'wildcard' character, the '*', in
  the address space results in a match for all X.400 recipients not local to
  the Exchange Server computer.

7. The information on the Advanced tab of the Exchange Server X.400 Connector
  should be configured to match the mode of the foreign MTA. The X.400 link
  option to allow MS Exchange Content should always be disabled when connecting
  to a foreign MTA (click Help on the Advanced tab). The typical foreign MTA
  requires that the Two Way Alternate option be disabled. Allow BP-15 (in
  addition to BP-14) is available when sending to a 1984 X.410 or a 1988 mode
  foreign MTA.

8. Make a custom recipient on both hosts or send to a user on the foreign host
  using a 1-off address in the To line. The following is an example of a 1-off
  address:

  

     [x400:c=us;a=attmail;p=organization;o=locale;s=lastname;g=firstname]

9. If the above test fails in either direction, select the Server object in the
  Exchange Server Admininistrator program, and then click Properties the File
  menu. Click the Diagnostics Logging tab and increase the MSExchangeMTA X.400
  Interoperablility and APDU logging to Maxium. This results in logging to the
  Bf0.log, Ev0.log, and Ap0.log files in the Mtadata folder.

10. Repeat the send mail test and contact Microsoft Product Support and Services
  (PSS).
