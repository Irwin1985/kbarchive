-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing a workstation or server from one domain to another in the Network tool
in Control Panel and then waiting more than 10 minutes to reboot can cause the
following error message when you log in to the new domain:

  The system cannot log you on to this domain because the system's computer
  account in its primary domain is missing or the password on that account is
  incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The Netlogon service runs a scavenger thread every 10 minutes. One of the
functions of this thread is to reset the machine account password if the thread
discovers that it is the default password. When this occurs, Netlogon changes
the password on the domain controller with which it currently has the secure
channel. Because the computer has not been rebooted yet, the password is changed
through the initial domain. When the computer is finally rebooted, it attempts
to use the password that it established with the initial domain. This does not
succeed because this password is not accepted by the new domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, reboot the computer as soon as possible.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is only an issue when you switch from one domain to another. Switching from
a workgroup to a domain does not cause this behavior because the Netlogon
service does not run while a computer is a member of a workgroup.

The password is reset as soon as possible to prevent another computer from using
an account that has a well-known password.
