SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information about using the Account Joiner utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Account Joiner is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) client you can
use to help manage and control the join process. Account Joiner is used to
process those connector space entries that could not be joined through the
standard join rules of the Management Agent (MA). Account Joiner enables you
to:

- View all the MAs on your server and any disconnected entries in each MA.

- Build ad-hoc queries to propose joins to the metaverse.

- Manually join problem entries that will not join using the inclusion rules
  specified.

- Disconnect accounts that have been joined in error.

NOTE: Account Joiner is installed automatically when you install Microsoft VIA
Compass. Also, you are prompted to log on with the Zoomit Metadirectory Login
prompt before loading Account Joiner.

Normally you would use Account Joiner after an automated join operation by the
Management Agent was complete, and there are some entries that remain
disconnected.

The Account Joiner utility permits you to select entries under a particular MA
and join them to the metaverse object. However, if there are several entries
listed in the metadirectory results, and you find there is a 1 to 1 mapping
between the connector space and metadirectory results using the full name query,
you should modify your join criteria to reduce the number of results requiring
specific attention.

The following examples are based on the default values associated with a
predefined MA. Each MA will be unique and can be customized through the Account
Joiner utility. For additional information about using Account Joiner, click the

  Q251297 How to customize the Account Joiner Utility for a Particular MA

Using Account Joiner to Join Disconnected Objects on a Windows NT 4.0 Domain MA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) server using Compass.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Zoomit Directory Service V2.

3. Click Account Joiner, and then click the appropriate MA tab.

4. Click the appropriate entry, and then click Full Name.

5. Under Metadirectory Results, click Join.

NOTE: When you join a connector space object to the metaverse, the object icon
changes from green to red. A red icon indicates the connector space object is
assigned to the metaverse, and there is no need to join this object. A green
icon indicates you need to do something with this metaverse object.

Disconnect an Account that Has Been Joined in Error
---------------------------------------------------

1. Log on to Compass

2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Zoomit Directory Service V2.

3. Click Account Joiner, and then click the appropriate MA tab.

4. In the Search Content box, click First And Last, and then type the name of
  the user that you would like to disconnect.

5. Click Search.

6. Right-click the user name, click Connectors, click the appropriate entry in
  the Connected Objects box, and then click Disconnect.

7. Click Close.
