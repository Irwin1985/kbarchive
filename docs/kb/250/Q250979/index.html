Release Notes
-----------------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS)
5.0. Please refer to these notes to obtain the most recent information about
installation, documentation, and other known issues.

- Known Problems and Limitations

   - Security

- Performance and Logging

- Getting Help and Providing Feedback

Known Problems and Limitations
------------------------------

Security
--------

- "Inherit all security settings" in the Permissions Wizard If you run the
  Permissions Wizard for a Web site, and choose to inherit all security
  settings, customers might be denied access to the Web site. To correct this,
  open the Home Directory property sheet for the Web site and select Read and
  Scripts only permissions. When prompted, have all virtual directories and
  files inherit these settings.

- Requiring 128-Bit Encryption on a 56-Bit Server If you select the Require
  128-bit encryption check box on a server that is only capable of 56-bit
  encryption, users will not be able to access resources for which this
  requirement is selected. Even though the 128-bit encryption check box is
  enabled, only 56-bit encryption can be used. To enable users to view these
  resources, clear the check box.

- Server Certificate Cannot Be Removed and Reassigned After Upgrade If you
  cannot remove and reassign your server certificate after an upgrade to
  Microsoft&lt;AE&gt; Windows 2000&lt;AE&gt;, this is due to changes in the way that IIS 5.0 uses
  server certificates. To fix this problem, use the Visual Basic script below
  to change metabase settings and to remove the certificate. You can then use
  the Web Site Certificate Wizard in IIS to reassign the certificate.

  'Set Machinename to the name of the machine or localhost
  Set PathObj = GetObject("IIS://" &amp; MachineName &amp; "/w3svc")
  PathObj.PutEx 1, "SSLCertHash", ""
  PathObj.PutEx 1, "SSLStoreName", ""
  PathObj.Setinfo

- Domain Name Restrictions not Functioning Properly If you are using DNS
  restrictions in IIS 5.0, and some users are experiencing difficulty accessing
  server resources, you can correct this problem by using the
  "*.domainname.com" syntax rather than the "domainname.com" syntax.

Performance and Logging
-----------------------

- Application Server vs. File Server

  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and IIS 5.0 are built so that you can get the
  most from your server. You can run your server as either an application
  server or a file serve. These two types of servers have different memory
  needs, and the setting you choose can influence the performance of the
  server.

  By default, Windows 2000 Server installs as a file server. It is recommended
  that you configure your server as an application server, if you are using it
  primarily as a Web server.

  To configure your server as an application server:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click "Network and Dial-up
     Connections".

  2. Select Local Area Connection, and then open its properties.

  3. Select "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks", and then open
     its properties.

  4. On the Server Optimization tab, select "Maximize data throughput for
     network applications".

- Socket Pooling, Performance, and Security Issues

  You might want to disable socket pooling if any of the following are true:

  You are not hosting a large number of sites.

  -or-

  You have special security concerns.

  Socket pooling will cause IIS 5.0 to listen to all IP addresses, which might
  present a possible security risk for secure domains with multiple networks.
  In addition, both bandwidth throttling and performance adjustments will apply
  to all Web sites configured for the same port, for example port 80. If you
  intend to use bandwidth throttling or do performance tuning on a per-site
  basis, you will need to disable socket pooling.

  To disable socket pooling, type the following at the command prompt:

  "c:\inetpub\adminscripts\cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc/disablesocketpooling
  true" (without the quotation marks)

  The command prompt will reply:

  "disablesocketpooling : (BOOLEAN) True" (without the quotation marks)

- Stopping Internet Services

  The Reliable Restart feature of the Windows 2000 Service Control Manager will
  automatically restart Internet services if the Inetinfo.exe process
  terminates abnormally, or if you use Windows Task Manager or Kill.exe to stop
  Internet services. If you want to stop Internet services, you must disable
  Reliable Restart.

  To disable Reliable Restart:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click
     Administrative Tools, and then double-click Computer Management.

  2. Under the System Tools node, click Services.

  3. Open the properties for IIS Admin Service.

  4. On the Recovery tab, select Take No Action in each of the drop-down menus.

  You can also disable Reliable Restart by typing "Iisreset.exe /disable"
  (without the quotation marks) at the command line.

- ASP Buffering and Performance After Upgrade

  In IIS 4.0, the Buffer property of the ASP Response object was set to FALSE by
  default. In a new installation of IIS 5.0, the Buffer property is set to TRUE
  by default. During an upgrade to IIS 5.0, the Buffer property will not be
  changed from its previous setting.

  Setting the Buffer property to TRUE can significantly improve the performance
  of large ASP applications in which users primarily connect to the application
  by means of a modem. You can enable buffering for your applications from the
  IIS snap-in or by adding the &lt;% Response.Buffer = True %&gt; statement to
  selected pages. You can also change the property for entire applications by
  using the IIS snap-in. For more information, see the IIS 5.0 documentation.

Multiple Sites and Clustering
-----------------------------

- Remove All IIS 5.0 Resources from a Cluster Before Uninstalling Microsoft
  Cluster Service

  All IIS resources, including NNTP and SMTP resources, must be removed from a
  cluster before Microsoft&lt;AE&gt; Clustering is uninstalled. If they are not removed,
  you will not be able to stop or start the previously clustered IIS sites.

  To fix this, type the following at the command prompt for all previously
  clustered IIS resources:

  "Inetpub\AdminScripts\adsutil.vbs set &lt;service name&gt;/&lt;instance
  id&gt;/ClusterEnabled 0" (without the quotation marks)

- FrontPage Server Extensions Not Supported in Microsoft Clustering

  Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions are not supported for resources in
  Microsoft Clustering.

- Stopping Internet Services in Microsoft Clustering

  When using the new Restart IIS option in the IIS snap-in, or when using
  Iisreset.exe (the command-line version of this feature), to stop IIS 5.0,
  Microsoft Clustering will attempt to automatically restart IIS.

  To keep Microsoft Clustering from automatically restarting IIS:
  1. Open a connection to the cluster where IIS 5.0 cluster resources are
     located, and then take all IIS cluster resources off line.

  2. In the IIS snap-in, right-click the Web service, and then click Restart
     IIS.

- ASP and FTP Sessions Will Not Fail Over

  ASP and FTP sessions do not fail over to other nodes in Microsoft Clustering.
  ASP session information is not lost if the affected computer fails back
  before the session times out, and if the original failure wasn't due to IIS
  stopping unexpectedly. However, FTP sessions are lost and must be restarted.
  In both cases, clients will need to reestablish the connection if a failover
  occurs on the server.

- Clustered NNTP and SMTP Resources

  Must be Stopped by Using Cluster Administrator User Interface NNTP and SMTP
  resources that are part of Microsoft Clustering must be stopped using the
  Cluster Administration user interface. Using the IIS snap-in will not stop
  them.

- Using Clustered Host Header Sites

  If you are using clustered Web sites that use host headers, you must set the
  ServerAutoStart metabase property to TRUE for these sites.

  To set this property type the following at the command prompt:

  "%SystemDrive%\inetpub\adminscripts\adsutil.vbs set w3svc/&lt;instance
  id&gt;/ServerAutoStart True" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;instance id&gt; is the instance ID of the virtual host sites that
  are part of the cluster.

- Deleting Clustered Resources

  If you are deleting clustered IIS 5.0 resources, you need to use a two-step
  process:

  1. In the Cluster Administration user interface, remove the resources from
     the cluster.

  2. In the IIS snap-in, delete the resources.

Miscellaneous
-------------

- Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 Will Not Function After Upgrade

  If you are installing Windows 2000 Beta 2 or later on a computer with
  Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0, you must install an update to Proxy Server 2.0.
  Refer to http://www.microsoft.com/proxy for details. Without the update,
  Proxy Server will not function and IIS will be unable to start.

- FrontPage Webs Not Accessible After Upgrade from Windows 98

  If you were using Microsoft FrontPage 98 Server Extensions, or earlier
  versions, with Microsoft Windows 98 and Personal Web Server, then the
  FrontPage Server Extensions will no longer work after upgrading to Windows
  2000. This is because Microsoft FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions are required
  for IIS 5.0.

  To upgrade to the FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions from the Default Web Site:

  1. Open Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.

  2. Click "Add/Remove Windows Components" to bring up the Windows Components
     Wizard.

  3. Click Next.

  4. Select "Internet Information Services (IIS)", and then click Details.

  5. Select "FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions", and then click OK.

  6. Click Next to complete the Wizard and to install the FrontPage 2000 Server
     Extensions.

  To upgrade to the FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions on other virtual Web
  sites:

  7. At the command prompt, navigate to the \Program Files\Common
     Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\40\bin directory.

  8. In this directory, type the following at the command prompt:

  "fpsrvadm -o upgrade -p all" (without the quotation marks)

- Problems Starting Out-of-Process Applications After Changing Account
  Information

  This is due to the user account's username and password information not being
  synchronized after the change. You might receive Event Log errors telling you
  that your IWAM_computername account could not be logged on. If you encounter
  this problem, run the synciwam script to synchronize the passwords.

  To run the script, at the command prompt type "cscript synciwam.vbs [-v|-h]
  -v" (without the quotation marks) uses verbose mode and prints a log of the
  script's activity. -h prints the script Help information.

- Using the MyInfo, PageCounter, and Counters Objects After an Upgrade

  To use your current data for these objects after an upgrade to IIS 5.0, you
  must move their data files to the %WINDIR%\inetsrv\Data directory, which is
  created by IIS during the upgrade. Move the MyInfo.xml and the Counters.txt
  files from the %WINDIR%\inetsrv\ directory and the %WINDIR%HitCnt.cnt file to
  the new directory %WINDIR%\inetsrv\Data. ("%WINDIR%" is the Windows
  installation directory.) The components will then append information to your
  files.

Documentation Addenda
---------------------

- Site Server Express 2.0 Documentation

  If you've upgraded from the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack with
  Microsoft Site Server Express components to IIS 5.0, the documentation for
  Site Server Express 2.0 can now be accessed by typing
  "http://localhost/iishelp/sse/misc/default.asp" (without the quotation marks)
  in the address bar of the browser on the computer running IIS.

- Seeing the "Welcome to Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack" Page After
  Upgrading to Windows 2000

  If you are upgrading to Windows 2000 and have not changed the Default.asp file
  for the Default Web Site, visitors to your site will see the old IIS 4.0
  welcome page when they type the URL http://&lt;servername&gt;/ in their
  browser.

  To set IIS so that users see the new IIS 5.0 welcome page:

  1. Open the Properties Sheet for the Default Web Site in the IIS snap-in.

  2. On the Documents tab, select the file default.asp, and then click Remove.

  If you want visitors to your site to see a welcome page that you created,
  replace the IIS 4.0 Default.asp file with your own Default.asp file.

- Hosting Multiple Web Sites

  The IIS 5.0 documentation says that if you use multiple IP addresses to host
  multiple Web sites, you will need an additional network card for each IP
  address. In fact, it is possible to bind multiple IP addresses to a single
  network card, although this configuration is not recommended for sites with
  high volumes of Internet traffic.

  NOTE: Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional with IIS 5.0 can host one Web site
  and one FTP site on a single computer. If you would like to host multiple Web
  or FTP sites on a single computer, consider upgrading to Microsoft Windows
  2000 Server.

- Documentation Correction for DisableSocketPooling

  The IIS documentation states that sockets are shared between sites that use
  the same socket number but different IP addresses. This is incorrect. Sockets
  are shared between sites that use the same port number but different IP
  addresses.

- Adsutil.exe Not Included in Samples

  The Adsutil.exe utility is not included in the samples, as mentioned in the
  documentation.
