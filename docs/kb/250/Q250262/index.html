SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) on a Windows NT
Server 4.0-based computer, the following error message may occur:

  Error:

  Cannot detect OS type

When you click OK, the NTOP installation ends immediately.

CAUSE
=====

This error message indicates that the WINS Client service in the Network
bindings may be disabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon, and then click Bindings.

2. Select All Protocols, and make sure the WINS Client (TCP/IP) option is
  enabled.

3. Restart the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message appears if the WINS Client option is disabled, regardless of
which Windows NT Service Pack is currently installed.

If the WINS Client option is disabled on the server, Internet Explorer may not
function correctly when connecting to the Internet. At the same time, a series
of related events appear in the System Log:

  Event ID 7000, Service Control Manager
  The WINS Client(TCP/IP) service failed to start due to the following error: A
  device attached to the system is not functioning.

  Event ID 7001, Service Control Manager
  The DHCP Client service depends on the WINS Client(TCP/IP) service which
  failed to start because of the following error: A device attached to the
  system is not functioning.

  Event ID 7001, Service Control Manager
  The Computer Browser service depends on the Server service which failed to
  start because of the following error: A device attached to the system is not
  functioning.

  Event ID 7023, Service Control Manager
  The Server service terminated with the following error: A device attached to
  the system is not functioning.

  Event ID 5728, Workstation
  Could not load any transport.

  Event ID 7024, Service Control Manager
  The Workstation service terminated with service-specific error 5728.

  Event ID 7001, Service Control Manager
  The Alerter service depends on the Workstation service which failed to start
  because of the following error: The service has returned a service-specific
  error code.

  Event ID 7002, Service Control Manager
  The TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper service depends on the NetworkProvider group and no
  member of this group started.

  Event ID 7001, Service Control Manager
  The Messenger service depends on the Workstation service which failed to start
  because of the following error: The service has returned a service-specific
  error code.

The above events can be used to determine if the server has the WINS Client
service disabled.
