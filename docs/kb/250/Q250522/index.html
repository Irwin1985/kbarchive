The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Adding users to the Directory Administrators List enables you to identify
modifications made in the logs by specific administrators user names. Without
adding users to the list, any user who logs on as administrator (provided they
know the correct password) can make modifications. With this scenario there is
no way of identifying exactly who made the changes. This article describes how
to add users to the Directory Administrators List object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you add users to the Directory Administrator list or other list objects,
you should only add the user's alias, not the user object itself. The reason for
this is that if you add the alias itself, it resides only under the the list
object and nowhere else in the directory. If someone were to delete the list
object, then this child object would also be removed.

Viewing the List of Users Added to the Directory Administrators List
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Compass, and then log on with an administrator account.

2. Navigate in the Known Universe tree to the DSA object, which is your server
  name.

3. Locate the Directory Administrators list object. If you open the list object
  you will see the built-in administrator's user alias.

Adding an Alias for a User to the Directory Administrators List
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click on the Known Universe.

2. Navigate down the tree until you get to the user or users you want to make
  administrators.

3. Right-click the user, and then click Copy.

4. Right-click the Directory Administrators List object, and then click Paste.

5. Click "Create alias to this entry", and then click OK. You should see the
  user's name and user icon with an arrow next to it indicating it is an
  alias.

  NOTE: At this point, the user can log on and will have administrator access to
  the object but will not be able to view the Application node. By default this
  is the Application OU but it could be configured differently during setup.
  However, they will be able to use the search utility and find users contained
  within the Application OU and modify their properties.

Setting Security for the Directory Administrators List Members
--------------------------------------------------------------

Allowing Members of the Directory Administrators List Read Access:

Without setting the read access to the application node, the members of the
Directory Administrators List will not be able to view the directory tree.
However, by default the Directory Administrator List members will be able to
search and find objects in the directory. The directory tree will be displayed
while viewing the object found. Note that some objects will be modifiable, and
others will not.

1. Select Application Node (the Applications OU).

2. On the Actions menu, click Access Control.

3. On the entry's Read Permissions tab, click New under Permissions Granted To.

4. On the entry's Read Permissions tab, click Specific under Permissions Granted
  To.

5. Click the Select button to view the Known Universe.

6. Navigate down the tree to the Directory Administrators List object,
  right-click the object, and then click Copy.

7. Click OK to close the Select windows.

8. Right-click the Specific box (it should be empty at this point), and then
  click Paste.

9. Click OK to save the contents.

Allowing Members of the Directory Administrators List Members to Modify the Application Node:

The same basic steps can be used for other objects that have explicit Access
Controls set:

1. Select Application Node (the Applications OU).

2. On the Actions menu, click Access Control.

3. On the entry's Modify Permissions tab, click New under Permissions Granted
  To.

4. On the entry's Read Permissions tab, click Specific under Permissions Granted
  To.

5. Click Select to view the Known Universe.

6. Navigate down the tree to the Directory Administrators List object,
  right-click the object, and then click Copy.

7. Click OK to close the Select windows.

8. Right-click the Specific box (it should be empty at this point), and then
  click Paste.

9. Click OK to save the contents.
