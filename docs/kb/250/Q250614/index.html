SUMMARY
=======

Not much information has been provided for the process of sorting the items in a
ListView control, especially one wrapped by the CListCtrl MFC class. The details
are easy to implement and this article attempts to fill the gap in documentation
for this useful feature. The example code represents an MFC dialog with a list
control set to the LVS_REPORT style.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to sort the items in a ListView control, there must be an LVITEM
structure associated with the item. MFC provides this for the developer,
allowing an item to be inserted with a simple InsertItem(int nItem, LPCTSTR
lpszItem) function call that creates the structure with reasonable defaults.
Such a buffer from the underlying complexity can sometimes be misleading.
However, the LVITEM structure is an important key to manipulating ListView
items, including the sorting mechanism.

The lParam element of LVITEM provides necessary information. When the SortItems
function of the CListCtrl class is called, it must provide a function pointer to
a sort callback function, and an application-defined DWORD value. During the
sort, the callback function is repeatedly invoked as two items from the list
control are selected for comparison. The parameters it receives are the lParam
element from each item's LVITEM structure, and the DWORD value passed by the
SortItems call.

The code below represents a simple example of sorting a list of ten U.S.
Presidents in a ListView control. The presidents are initially stored in a
static multi-dimensional CString array.

  static CString strData[10][3] =
  {
  	{ _T("Washington"), _T("George"), _T("1789-1797") },
  	{ _T("Adams"), _T("John"), _T("1797-1801") },
  	{ _T("Jefferson"), _T("Thomas"), _T("1801-1809") },
  	{ _T("Madison"), _T("James"), _T("1809-1817") },
  	{ _T("Monroe"), _T("James"), _T("1817-1825") },
  	{ _T("Adams"), _T("John Quincy"), _T("1825-1829") },
  	{ _T("Jackson"), _T("Andrew"), _T("1829-1837") },
  	{ _T("Van Buren"), _T("Martin"), _T("1837-1841") },
  	{ _T("Harrison"), _T("William Henry"), _T("1841") },
  	{ _T("Tyler"), _T("John"), _T("1841-1845") }
  };

The callback sort function may be defined statically as a member of a class or,
as here, simply as a global function:

  int CALLBACK SortFunc(LPARAM lParam1, LPARAM lParam2, LPARAM lParamSort);

The lParam element can be anything from simple to highly complex. Frequently, a
structure is useful in this context, allowing multiple pieces of data to be
referenced. For this example, a structure called ITEMDATA was defined to hold
the three elements comprising a given item:

  typedef struct {
  	LPTSTR pszLastName;
  	LPTSTR pszFirstName;
  	LPTSTR pszTerm;
  } ITEMDATA, *PITEMDATA;

In this example, the structure was defined in a CDialog class's header file, and
a member variable of a pointer to an array of 10 was defined:

  	ITEMDATA* m_pData[10];

A ListView control was added to a dialog, and a member variable defined called
m_ctlListView. The items were added in OnInitDialog:

  	m_ctlListView.InsertColumn(0, _T("Last Name"), LVCFMT_LEFT, 100);
  	m_ctlListView.InsertColumn(1, _T("First Name"), LVCFMT_LEFT, 100);
  	m_ctlListView.InsertColumn(2, _T("Term"), LVCFMT_LEFT, 100);

  	for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
  	{
  		m_pData[i] = new ITEMDATA;
  		m_pData[i]-&gt;pszLastName = (LPTSTR)(LPCTSTR)strData[i][0];
  		m_pData[i]-&gt;pszFirstName = (LPTSTR)(LPCTSTR)strData[i][1];
  		m_pData[i]-&gt;pszTerm = (LPTSTR)(LPCTSTR)strData[i][2];

  		m_ctlListView.InsertItem(i, strData[i][0]);
  		m_ctlListView.SetItemText(i, 1, strData[i][1]);
  		m_ctlListView.SetItemText(i, 2, strData[i][2]);
  		m_ctlListView.SetItemData(i, (LPARAM)m_pData[i]);
  	}

Three columns were inserted for the last name, first name, and term of office.
Then, for each of the ten items, a new ITEMDATA structure is allocated and
initialized from the CString array. The item is inserted very simply, using only
the index and the last name string, then the text is set for the other two
columns of the item. Finally, the function SetItemData is called, passing the
new ITEMDATA as a parameter. This reinitializes the lParam of the item's LVITEM
structure, and prepares the way for the sort.

MFC in Visual C++ 6.0 has a problem with header notifications for the ListView
control. Although a handler can be added, in the current version it isn't
called. For instance, use Class Wizard or the WizardBar to add a Windows Message
Handler. If the ID for the ListView control is highlighted, a number of
notification messages are available for selection. To sort the items when the
header is clicked for a given column, select the notification HDN_ITEMCLICK. An
ON_NOTIFY message map entry is generated, as well as a handler function. For the
current example, the entry appears as follows:

  	ON_NOTIFY(HDN_ITEMCLICK, IDC_LIST1, OnItemclickList1)

The problem here is that the notification doesn't actually originate from the
ListView control; instead, the Header control created by the ListView sends the
notification. The message map entry listed above does not work. The fix is
simple, however, since the Header control always has an ID of 0, the macro can
be edited to work correctly:

  	ON_NOTIFY(HDN_ITEMCLICK, 0, OnItemclickList1)

Then, in the OnItemclickList1 handler, the SortItems call is made:

  void CSortListDlg::OnItemclickList1(NMHDR* pNMHDR, LRESULT* pResult) 
  {
  	NMLISTVIEW *pLV = (NMLISTVIEW *) pNMHDR;
  	
  	m_ctlListView.SortItems(SortFunc, pLV-&gt;iItem);
  	
  	*pResult = 0;
  }

The notification message header (NMHDR) is actually a ListView notification,
NMLISTVIEW, that contains the index to the column that was clicked. In this
example, this is represented by iItem. More complex lists might need to
reference the iSubItem element of this structure as well. The address of the
callback function is passed to SortItems, along with the column number which was
clicked.

The SortFunc routine is called repeatedly as pairs of the ListView's items are
passed to the function for comparison. The first two parameters are the lParam
element of the respective items' LVITEM structure, and the third parameter
(application-defined) is the column number provided in the SortItems call.

  int CALLBACK SortFunc(LPARAM lParam1, LPARAM lParam2, LPARAM lParamSort)
  {
  	int nRetVal;

  	PITEMDATA pData1 = (PITEMDATA)lParam1;
  	PITEMDATA pData2 = (PITEMDATA)lParam2;

  	switch(lParamSort)
  	{
  	case 0:	// Last Name
  		nRetVal = strcmp(pData1-&gt;pszLastName,
                                   pData2-&gt;pszLastName);
  		break;

  	case 1:	// First Name
  		nRetVal = strcmp(pData1-&gt;pszFirstName,
                                   pData2-&gt;pszFirstName);
  		break;

  	case 2: // Term
  		nRetVal = strcmp(pData1-&gt;pszTerm, pData2-&gt;pszTerm);
  		break;

  	default:
  		break;
  	}

  	return nRetVal;
  }

The column index passed in lParamSort determines which element of the ITEMDATA
objects passed in lParam1 and lParam2 should be used for comparison. The result
is returned and the process continues until all items have been sorted.

As a reminder, the ITEMDATA structures which were allocated for the list items
need to eventually be destroyed. For this example, the WM_DESTROY handler for
the dialog iterates through the member elements and deletes them.

  	for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++)
  		delete m_pData[i];
