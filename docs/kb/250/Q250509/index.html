-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a brief description of how to use the Userdump.exe utility
to capture the state of a process that is associated with Exchange Server. This
utility can be very useful when you troubleshoot servers that have stopped
responding and unresponsive processes, or when you gather thread information for
a particular process. Detailed documentation (the Userdocs.doc file) accompanies
the utility.

Although this article focuses primarily on how to dump the state of the
information store (Store.exe), it also applies to the directory (Dsamain.exe) as
well as any other user mode process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can install the Userdump.exe utility as part of the Microsoft Platform
Software Development Kit (SDK), the Microsoft Windows Debuggers, or as a
stand-alone application. You can download the Userdump.exe utility as part of
the Windows Debuggers package from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=18937

You can install the Userdump utility by using Setup.exe, or you can also extract
and manually invoke the executable file (Userdump.exe) by using the command
line. For most purposes, if you run the following command lines to capture the
process space, the utility provides sufficient data.

If you run Setup to install the Userdump utility, some additional features
(described in detail in the Userdocs.doc that accompanies the Userdump utility)
are enabled, such the following:

- Process self dumping. The Userdump utility supports a feature that allows an
  application to cause itself to be dumped, for example, in an exception
  handler block or a top-level unhandled exception filter.

- Hot-key process snapshot. You can associate a single keystroke with an image
  binary and trigger a dump that is similar to the command line noted above.

- Exception monitoring. The Userdump utility can monitor applications that are
  running for exceptions, and can automatically generate dumps when certain
  exceptions occur. You configure the rules that dictate whether an exception
  triggers a dump for each application by using a page in the Process Dump
  utility in Control Panel.

Command-Line Process Snapshot
-----------------------------

If you invoke the Userdump utility with no arguments, usage is displayed:

  

  C:\&gt;userdump
  User Mode Process Dumper (Version 1.0)
  Copyright (c) 1999 Microsoft Corp. All rights reserved.

  Usage: userdump [-p | [ProcessSpec [TargetDumpFile]]

   -p displays a list of running processes and their process IDs.

   ProcessSpec - can be a decimal or 0x-prefixed hex process ID,
      or the base name and extension (no path) of the image file used to
      create the process.

   TargetDumpFile - is any legal Win32 path specification. If not
       specified, the dump file is generated in the current directory
       using a name based on the image file name.

Displaying a Process List with the "userdump -p" Command
--------------------------------------------------------

If you specify the -p command-line parameter, as shown in the following example,
a list of processes and process IDs that are currently running is displayed. If
you specify -p is as the first argument, any other arguments are ignored.

  

  C:\&gt;userdump -p
  User Mode Process Dumper (Version 1.0)
  Copyright (c) 1999 Microsoft Corp. All rights reserved.

  0 System Idle Process
  8 System
172 smss.exe
200 csrss.exe
224 winlogon.exe
252 services.exe
264 lsass.exe
452 svchost.exe
476 spoolsv.exe
712 llssrv.exe

992 MAD.EXE
  1008 DSAMAIN.EXE
  1188 STORE.EXE
  1796 EMSMTA.EXE
  2236 userdump.exe

In Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows 2000 Server
systems, you can also display process IDs by using the Processes tab in Task
Manager, which you can activate by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ESC.

Dumping Running Processes
-------------------------

Invoke Userdump.exe at the command line with a process identifier (in decimal or
0x-prefixed hexadecimal notation) or application name and the file name of the
dump file that you want to create. The application name is the name of the
binary, including the base and extension but no path specification. If the
process argument is a valid decimal or 0x-prefixed hexadecimal number, it is
interpreted as a process ID. When you specify the process ID 1188, which is the
process ID for the information store Store.exe, as shown in the example above,
only that process is dumped:

  

  C:\&gt;userdump 1188 c:\store.dmp
  User Mode Process Dumper (Version 1.0)
  Copyright (c) 1999 Microsoft Corp. All rights reserved.

  Dumping process 1188 (STORE.EXE) to
  C:\store.dmp...
  The process was dumped successfully.

If the process argument is not a valid decimal or 0x-prefixed hexadecimal number,
it is interpreted as the name of an image binary. The image binary name should
be the base name with no path specifiers, for example:

  store.exe

If you do not specify a dump file name, the dump file is placed in the current
folder by using a name based on the image binary file name, as shown in the
following example:

  

  C:\MySample&gt;userdump 1188
  User Mode Process Dumper (Version 1.0)
  Copyright (c) 1999 Microsoft Corp. All rights reserved.
  Dumping process 1188 (STORE.EXE) to
  C:\MySample\store.dmp...
  The process was dumped successfully.

  C:\MySample&gt;userdump store.exe
  User Mode Process Dumper (Version 1.0)
  Copyright (c) 1999 Microsoft Corp. All rights reserved.

  Dumping process 1188 (STORE.EXE) to
  C:\MySample\store.dmp...
  The process was dumped successfully.

The target process is unaffected, although the process threads are frozen while
the process is read by the Userdump.exe utility, and the target process
continues to run unaltered after the dump is finished.
