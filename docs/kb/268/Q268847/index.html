-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The GetFldState() value for the record of a buffered table has changed to 2 -
(Field has been edited or deletion status has changed). This behavior occurs
when any of the data controls on the form are based on a class where an Assign
method has been added for the Value property (resulting in a Value_Assign
method), and the ControlSource property of the data control is set to a field of
a buffered table.

CAUSE
=====

Any Assign method contains the following code by default:

  LPARAMETERS vNewVal
  *To do: Modify this routine for the Assign method
  THIS.Value = m.vNewVal

This code assigns the value passed into the Assign method (vNewVal) to be that of
the Value property of the data control. Because the data control is bound to the
table through the ControlSource property, then the data in the table is
re-written even though it is the same value. This can be verified by checking
the GetFldState() return value of the bound field.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ability to create an Assign method for the property of an object is new to
Microsoft Visual FoxPro 6.0. An Assign method can be created in the following
ways:

- For intrinsic properties or existing custom properties:

  Use either the Class or Form Designer interface to add a new method that
  consists of the name of a property followed by the suffix "_Assign" (without
  the quotes).

- For non-existing custom properties:

  Use either the Class or Form Designer interface so that the developer can
  click the Assign method check box while adding a new property. This creates a
  new method that consists of the name of the newly added property followed by
  the suffix "_Assign" (without the quotes).

- Classes defined by program code:

  Use the following naming convention rule for an Assign method because it
  always applies: The Assign method starts with the name of the applicable
  property and is followed by the suffix "_Assign" (without the quotes).

Once an Assign method has been created, it is impossible to circumvent it during
run time when any attempt is made to write data to the property for which it was
established. Also note that commenting or removing the Assign method's code
results in errors. The only means by which the affects of an Assign method can
be eliminated are to rename it or delete it.

The following code displays the value of GetFldState() in the parent code when
the Value_Assign method fires. The GetFldState() value can also be checked by
clicking the Command bottom labeled "Get Field State."

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and run a new program with the following code:

  PUBLIC ox
  ox=CREATEOBJECT("frmGetFieldState")
  ox.show

  DEFINE CLASS BaseText AS TextBox
      Height = 23
      Width = 100
      Value = ""
      Name = "BaseText"

      PROCEDURE Value_Assign
          LPARAMETERS vNewVal
          *To do: Modify this routine for the Assign method
          Wait window "In parent assign" timeout 1
          THIS.Value = m.vNewVal
          WAIT WINDOW TRANSFORM(GetFldState("cust_id")) TIMEOUT 1
      ENDPROC
  ENDDEFINE

  DEFINE CLASS frmGetFieldState AS Form
      Top = 65
      Left = 194
      Height = 87
      Width = 251
      DoCreate = .T.
      Caption = "frmGetFieldState"
      Name = "Form1"

      ADD OBJECT cmdRefresh AS CommandButton WITH ;
          Top = 48, ;
          Left = 17, ;
          Height = 27, ;
          Width = 90, ;
          Caption = "Refresh", ;
          Name = "cmdRefresh"

      ADD OBJECT cmdGetFieldState AS CommandButton WITH ;
          Top = 48, ;
          Left = 149, ;
          Height = 27, ;
          Width = 90, ;
          Caption = "Get Field State", ;
          Name = "cmdGetFieldState"

      ADD OBJECT txtBaseClass AS BaseText WITH ;
          ControlSource = "customer.cust_id", ;
          Left = 75, ;
          Top = 12, ;
          Name = "txtBaseClass"

      PROCEDURE Load
          OPEN DATABASE HOME(2)+"data\testdata.dbc" SHARED
          USE customer IN 0
          SET MULTILOCKS ON
          =CURSORSETPROP("Buffering",5)
      ENDPROC

      PROCEDURE Unload
          USE IN customer
          CLOSE DATABASE 
      ENDPROC

      PROCEDURE cmdRefresh.Click
          ThisForm.Refresh()
      ENDPROC

      PROCEDURE cmdGetFieldState.Click
          WAIT WINDOW TRANSFORM(GetFldState("cust_id")) TIMEOUT 1
      ENDPROC
  ENDDEFINE

NOTE: The Assign method, Value_Assign runs when the form is initialized.

2. Click the Get Field State button to display the current value of
  GetFldState().

3. Click the Refresh button and note that the Assign method is called and that
  GetFldState() = 2.
