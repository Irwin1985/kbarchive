SUMMARY
=======

The user-mode dump heap (UMDH) utility works with the operating system to
analyze Windows heap allocations for a specific process. This utility, and the
other tools associated with it, are primarily targeted for Windows 2000.
However, a Umdh_nt4.exe application, and the Dbghelp.dll which is not available
on Windows NT, have been supplied for use under Windows NT version 4.0 Service
Pack 6 (SP6). This article discusses how you can use UMDH to help locate memory
leak problems. A self-extracting executable is included that contains the
following tools:

- Umdh.exe- This utility is used to dump the heap allocation information for a
  process.

- Umdh_nt4.exe and Dbghelp.dll - This is the Windows NT 4.0 SP6 version of the
  UMDH tool.

- Gflags.exe- This utility sets the appropriate registry entries for the
  application that will be analyzed. The operating system looks at the registry
  entries to determine if an application's heap allocations will be tracked.

- Tlist.exe - This application lists all of the processes running on a machine
  and all of their related process IDs.

- Dhcmp.exe - This tool is used to compare two UMDH dumps to determine where a
  possible memory leak is occurring.

- Dhcmpgui.zip - This tool also compares two UMDH logs but has a user interface
  to make it easier to retrieve information. The .zip file contains the
  Dhcmpgui.exe file and its source code.

Before Using UMDH
-----------------

If you think you are experiencing a memory leak, please be aware that memory
leaks may not be what they appear to be. You may discover that a memory leak is
really not a memory leak but a performance enhancement. For example, the
Microsoft Jet database engine can consume large amounts of memory (up to 128 MB
on a 256-MB computer) for its data retrieval and writing caches. The cache
allows the Jet engine to achieve fast read-ahead and write-ahead buffering.

To determine whether or not a process is experiencing memory leaks, use Windows
Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe) and monitor "Private Bytes" under the Process
category for your application. Privates Bytes is the total amount of memory the
process has allocated but is not sharing with other processes. Note that this is
different from "Virtual Bytes," which is also interesting to monitor. Virtual
Bytes is the current size in bytes of the virtual address space the process is
using. An application can leak virtual memory but not see a difference in the
amount of private bytes allocated. If you don't see memory rising when
monitoring private bytes but suspect that you are still running out of memory,
you should monitor virtual bytes to see if you are exhausting virtual memory.

Review the following MSDN article titled "Finding Leaks and Bottlenecks with a
Windows NT PerfMon COM Object" for more information about detecting memory
leaks:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/techart/perfmon.htm

To be certain your application is leaking memory, you should place the suspect
code in a loop with many iterations, and monitor private and virtual bytes for
any increases of memory. Watch to make certain that the number of private bytes
and virtual bytes doesn't eventually stay the same and stops rising. If there is
a point at which the memory stops rising, that is, it does not continue to climb
indefinitely, you are not seeing a memory leak but are probably seeing some
cache that is growing to its maximum size.

Capturing Heap Dumps with UMDH
------------------------------

UMDH (or Umdh_nt4.exe if you are using Windows NT 4.0 SP6) is a tool that dumps
information about a process's heap allocations. This information includes the
callstack for each allocation, the number of allocations made through that
callstack, and the number of bytes consumed through that callstack. For
example:

    00005320 bytes in 0x14 allocations (@ 0x00000428) by: BackTrace00053
          ntdll!RtlDebugAllocateHeap+0x000000FD
          ntdll!RtlAllocateHeapSlowly+0x0000005A
          ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap+0x00000808
          MyApp!_heap_alloc_base+0x00000069
          MyApp!_heap_alloc_dbg+0x000001A2
          MyApp!_nh_malloc_dbg+0x00000023
          MyApp!_nh_malloc+0x00000016
          MyApp!operator new+0x0000000E
          MyApp!LeakyFunc+0x0000001E
          MyApp!main+0x0000002C
          MyApp!mainCRTStartup+0x000000FC
          KERNEL32!BaseProcessStart+0x0000003D

This UMDH output shows that there were 21280 (0x5320) bytes allocated total from
the callstack. The 21280 bytes were allocated from 20 (0x14) separate
allocations of 1064 bytes (0x428). The callstack is given a identifier of
BackTrace00053.

To produce a dump of the heap allocations, you must first let the operating
system know that you would like the kernel to track the allocations. This is
done by using the Gflags.exe utility.

Let's assume that you want to dump the heap contents for Notepad.exe. By the way,
most processes have more than one heap active and the UMDH log will contain all
of them. First you need to enable stack trace acquisition for the application
you want to test. This feature is not enabled by default. The command to enable
it is:

  "gflags -i notepad.exe +ust" (without the quotation marks)

The command does not enable stack tracing for processes that are already running,
but all future executions of Notepad.exe will have it enabled. Alternatively,
you can set the flag through the GFLAGS user interface (run Gflags.exe without
any arguments to get the user interface).


Before using UMDH, you also need to install the correct debug symbols for the
components of your application as well as the operating system. Typically, the
operating system symbols are installed in the SYMBOLS folder on the WINNT
folder. UMDH attempts to find the symbol files by using the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH. The
command for setting the path from a command prompt is:

  "set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=%windir%\symbols" (without the quotation marks)

For more information about setting up symbolic debugging information, see the
"Debug Symbols" section later in this article.

With the image flags set and the symbols installed, you are ready to start
Notepad. After the program is started, you need to determine the Process ID
(PID) of the Notepad process just started. The command for this is:

  "tlist" (without the quotation marks)

You can find the PID from the output of the TLIST application. The PID
information can also be obtained from Task Manager. Let's assume the PID for the
Notepad process you just started is 124. You can use UMDH to get a heap dump by
using the following command:

  "umdh -p:124 -f:notepad124.log" (without the quotation marks)

Results: You've got a complete heap dump of the Notepad process in the
Notepad124.log file.

Using Dhcmp.exe to Compare UMDH Logs
------------------------------------

While the UMDH log file contains valuable information about the current state of
the heaps for a process, if you are concerned with finding a memory leak, it may
be more valuable to compare the outputs of two logs and find out what callstack
has seen the largest growth between the two dumps. The Dhcmp.exe utility helps
compare two UMDH logs to provide an analysis of the difference between them.
Once you have two logs captured at different intervals, you can then use the
following command:

  "DHCMP dh1.log dh2.log &gt; cmp12.txt" (without the quotation marks)

The .txt files will compare the effect on memory of running the suspect memory
hog application. The output of the file generated by DHCMP resembles the
following:

  +    5320 (  f110 -  9df0)     3a allocs	BackTrace00053
  Total increase == 5320

For each BackTrace in the UMDH log files, there is a comparison made between the
two logs files. This case shows that the last log file specified in the DHCMP
command line had F110 bytes allocated while the first log in the DHCMP command
line had 9DF0 bytes allocated for the same BackTrace (callstack). The 5320 is
the difference in the number of bytes allocated. In this case, there were 5320
more bytes allocated between the time the two logs were captured. The bytes came
from the callstack identified by BackTrace00053.

The next step is to find out what's in that backtrace. If you open the second DH
log file and search for "BackTrace00053" you might find something that resembles
the following:

  00005320 bytes in 0x14 allocations (@ 0x00000428) by: BackTrace00053
          ntdll!RtlDebugAllocateHeap+0x000000FD
          ntdll!RtlAllocateHeapSlowly+0x0000005A
          ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap+0x00000808
          MyApp!_heap_alloc_base+0x00000069
          MyApp!_heap_alloc_dbg+0x000001A2
          MyApp!_nh_malloc_dbg+0x00000023
          MyApp!_nh_malloc+0x00000016
          MyApp!operator new+0x0000000E
          MyApp!LeakyFunc+0x0000001E
          MyApp!main+0x0000002C
          MyApp!mainCRTStartup+0x000000FC
          KERNEL32!BaseProcessStart+0x0000003D

By looking at the callstack, you can see that the LeakyFunc function is
allocating memory by way of the Visual C++ run-time library. If you find that
the number of allocations grows as you took more dumps, you might be able to
conclude that memory is not being freed.

Enabling Stack Traces
---------------------

The most important information in UMDH logs is the stack traces of the heap
allocations. By analyzing them it can be understood whether a process leaks heap
memory. These stack traces are not acquired by default. The feature can be
enabled per-process or system-wide. Use the following command to enable stack
tracing system-wide:

  "gflags -r +ust" (without the quotation marks)

Restart the computer after this command.

For per-process enabling, the command is

  "gflags -i APPNAME +ust" (without the quotation marks)

Where APPNAME is the file name of the executable including the extension
(Services.exe, lsass.exe, and so on). The command will not enable stack tracing
for a process that is already running. For this reason, in the case of processes
that can't be restarted (services, lsass, winlogon), the test compute must be
restarted.

Use the following commands to verify what settings have been set system-wide or
for a specific process:

System-wide:

  "gflags -r" (without the quotation marks)

Specific process:

  "gflags -i APP-NAME" (without the quotation marks)

By default, the maximum stack trace depth is 16. If you want to see deeper
callstacks, you can increase this by running GFLAGS. Click to select System
Registry and type a new depth in the Max. Stack Trace Capture Depth edit
control. Click Apply, and then restart the computer.

IMPORTANT: If you are using Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6, you must use
Umdh_nt4.exe, rather than Umdh.exe, and you must use the above command to set
system-wide stack tracing. Be certain to reboot. Umdh_nt4 stack tracing does not
work on a per process basis on Windows NT version 4. It must be set for the
entire system.


Debug Symbols
-------------

UMDH uses the IMAGEHLP library for symbol manipulation. This is the standard tool
for such tasks and it is also used by Microsoft debuggers. One of the most
important steps to using UMDH is to ensure that you have good symbol files (.dbg
or .pdb file) to get a good stack trace. The debug symbol files can be installed
from the Windows NT CD, or in the case of Microsoft Windows 2000, from the
Windows 2000 Support Tools CD. At a minimum, you need the Kernel32.dbg and
Ntdll.dbg symbol files. You can always acquire additional debugging symbols as
needed as you find out more about which components are leaking the memory.

For additional information about how to get debug symbol files for Microsoft
components, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q311503 INFO: Use the Microsoft Symbol Server to Acquire Debug Symbol Files

For additional information about how to use the Microsoft Symbol Server and how
to obtain Windows symbol packages, please visit the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/debugging/symbols.asp

When building components with Visual C++, it is important that you not have
Program Database for Edit and Continue selected for the C++ compiler options.
Instead, select Program Database.

To set the symbol path, initialize the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable to
the path to be used. This can be done once when the test computer is set up by
using the System application in Control Panel (Advanced, Environment Variables)
or inside a command window before UMDH is run. Usually the symbols are copied to
the test machine in the %windir%\Symbols folder. In this case, use the following
command to set the variable:

  "set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=%windir%\symbols" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: Include the path to the PDBs for your application's components as well.

Invoking UMDH
-------------

The only required command-line parameter for UMDH is the -p option, which
specifies the PID of the process from which a heap dump will be obtained. The
PID can be obtained by using Task Manager or the Tlist.exe program. For a
command similar to the following, the log will be dumped to the standard
output:

  "umdh -p:PID" (without the quotation marks)

UMDH also displays various informational messages to standard error, and
therefore if not redirected it will be mixed with the real log. To gather the
UMDH informational messages in a file, use the following command:

  "umdh -p:PID 2&gt;umdh.msg" (without the quotation marks)

If you want to gather the log dumped by UMDH in a file, use one of the following
commands:

  "umdh -p:PID &gt;umdh.log" (without the quotation marks)

  -or-

  "umdh -p:PID -f:umdh.log" (without the quotation marks)

The commands are completely equivalent.

The default log obtained by UMDH contains an enumeration of heap consumers sorted
by allocation count. If, for debugging purposes, you also need a dump of all
allocated blocks with their corresponding stack traces, the -d option must be
used:

  "umdh -p:PID -d" (without the quotation marks)

If the log contains too much information, it can be limited only to big users
that have the allocation count above a certain threshold. Use the following
command:

  "umdh -p:PID -t:THRESHOLD" (without the quotation marks)

All the command-line options (-p, -f, -t, -d) can be specified simultaneously in
any order. Following is a complicated command-line example:

  "umdh -p:123 -t:1000 -f:umdh.log -d" (without the quotation marks)

This command dumps the heaps for the process with PID 123 into the Umdh.log file.
It dumps only stack traces that account for more than 1000 allocations and it
also dumps the addresses of the heap blocks allocated through each stack trace.

UMDH Output Explained
---------------------

If you redirected the log to a file ("umdh -p:PID -f:umdh.log" (without the
quotation marks)), the contents will resemble the following, which was obtained
from a running Notepad process:

          ntdll!KiUserApcDispatcher+0x00000007

The log contains a dump of every heap in the process. In this example, the log
starts with a heap at address 270000. After a few global counters for the heap,
the log contains a dump in decreasing sorted order of stack traces that are
responsible for the most allocations. By comparing the dynamics of memory used
at different moments you can deduce what happened in the process and if any heap
use looks like a leak.

Problems That Can Be Encountered When Using UMDH
------------------------------------------------

The most common errors when using UMDH are not having stack tracing enabled.
Incorrect symbols for Ntdll.dll prevent UMDH from running. For the other symbols
files, UMDH will run but the log file will contain stack traces that do not have
function names but instead have relative addresses inside modules. A distant
third error is specifying a wrong PID. The following error message results when
you attempt to run UMDH for a process that does not have stack tracing enabled:

  C:\&gt;umdh -p:1140
  UMDH: Logtime 2000-06-28 12:43 - Machine=MyMachine - PID=1140
  Connecting.....Module enumeration complete.
  SymGetSymFromName(process, ntdll!RtlpStackTraceDataBase, xxx) failed,
  LastError = 126
  UmdhGetAddrFromName couldn't find Stack Trace DB pointer
  (ntdll!RtlpStackTraceDataBase).
  ntdll.dll symbols are incorrect; we must be able to see non-import symbols.

Use the following command to double-check the settings for the process you are
investigating:

  "gflags -i APPNAME" (without the quotation marks)

Use the following command in the case where you are relying on system-wide stack
tracing:

  "gflags -r" (without the quotation marks)

These commands show the list of flags set for the application. Note that in the
case of system-wide stack tracing, the feature might appear as active but if you
did not restart the computer after running the gflags -r +ust command, it is not
actually activated. If you want to know every application that has stack tracing
enabled, you can look at the USTEnabled key under the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File
  Execution Options

If you run UMDH on a process that has stack tracing enabled but have not
restarted the application since setting the flags, you may get the following
message in your logs:

  A stack trace was not saved for this allocation (Index == 0)

If you run UMDH without setting the correct symbol path or the symbols are
incorrect, you may get an error message in the log. However, you may just get
incorrect or misleading callstacks. To verify whether you have the correct
symbols, launch the NTSD system debugger for a process, for example:

  "ntsd notepad" (without the quotation marks)

Then, from the debugger console, run the LD command to load the symbol
information for the module and the LM command to list what modules have their
symbols loaded. If the output of the LM command shows export symbols loaded, the
symbols are not good. If you have PDB symbols loaded, the symbols are good. You
may get the following error message if you specified the wrong PID:

  C:\&gt;umdh -p:1000
  UMDH: Logtime 2000-06-28 09:45 - Machine=MyMachine - PID=1000
  Connecting...
  OpenProcess failed, LastError = 0x57

Additional Tools
----------------

Using DHCMPGUI:

The Dhcmpgui.exe tool can be used to compare two UMDH logs. This tool is located
in the Dhcmpgui.zip file. It calls out to Dhcmp.exe (make certain that you have
this in your PATH). Click File 1 and File 2 to specify the two UMDH logs to
compare.

After selecting the two files to compare, you will see a list of the differences.
The columns listed are the number of bytes allocated, number of allocations, and
the BackTraceID, respectively. You can sort by any one of those columns by
clicking the appropriate button, and then clicking Sort. To see the BackTrace
(callstack) for any line, just double-click it. This provides an easy way to
compare two logs and to quickly get to the callstack for the callstack that is
leaking memory.

The source code has been provided for Dhcmpgui.exe in case you want to make any
modifications. The project requires Visual C++ version 6.0.

Calling UMDH from Visual Basic:

There may be times when it is useful to dump a number of logs over time because
the leak may not be very noticeable at first. For example, suppose you suspect
that your ASP application is leaking memory. It may be helpful to write a COM
component in Visual Basic that shells out to UMDH. You can then call that
component from your ASP page.

Following is some Visual Basic code that invokes UMDH and creates a log file
based on the current time:

     Private Declare Function GetCurrentProcessId Lib "kernel32" () As Long
     Public Function GetProcessID()
     GetProcessID = GetCurrentProcessId()
     End Function  
  .
  .
  .
     Dim strTime As String

     Dim sProcID As String
     sProcID = GetProcessID()
     strTime = "MYLOG_" &amp; Format(Now(), "hhmm")
    
     Shell ("C:\UMDH\umdh -p:" &amp; sProcID &amp; " -f:d:\logs\" &amp; strTime &amp; ".txt")
