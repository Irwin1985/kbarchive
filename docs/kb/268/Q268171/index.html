  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

A TN3270 client application may process a screen of host data twice when the
data is followed by a 3270 Write (X'F1') command and WCC (Write Control
Character) from the TN3270 server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TN3270 server has been updated in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) to
modify the Keyboard Unlock bit (Bit 6) in the WCC to correct this problem.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q175384 TN3270 Client Hangs with Keyboard Locked on Some Host Screens

The TN3270 keyboard unlock handling has also been enhanced to resolve a number of
reported bracket race conditions. The TN3270 server determines what to do with a
keyboard unlock bit for Request Units (RUs) that start with a 3270 Write,
Erase\Write, or Erase\Write Alternate command based on the settings of the End
Bracket Indicator (EBI), Change Direction Indicator (CDI) and End Chain
Indicator (ECI) flags in the Request Header (RH).

The TN3270 server first checks to determine if either the EBI flag or CDI flag is
set. If so, the keyboard restore bit is set to 1 before the data is sent to the
TN3270 application, which unlocks the keyboard.

If the EBI flag or the CDI flag is not set, then the TN3270 server checks to
determine if the ECI flag is set. If the ECI flag is set, the keyboard restore
bit is set to 0 before the data is sent to the TN3270 application, which locks
the keyboard.

When the TN3270 server receives a null RU that has the ECI flag set and either
the EBI flag set or the CDI flag set, the TN3270 server sends a 3270 Write
command with a WCC of X'C2' to the client. If this is not done, the keyboard
stays locked because it was locked from the previous screen data, based on the
keyboard unlock handling scenarios described previously. A real 3270 emulator
(non-TN3270) does not require this, because it receives the RH and unlocks the
keyboard when it receives an EB even if the WCC indicates that the keyboard
should be locked. The TN3270 or TN3270E RFCs do not allow for the passing of the
RH to a TN3270 client.

The receipt of a 3270 Write command (and WCC) with no additional data may cause
an application to process the previous screen of data that it received because
the null Write command does not change the presentation space of the screen
buffer that contains the data being received from the host. The application may
then read and process the data that it had previously received, which causes the
data to be processed twice. The following code example demonstrates this
problem:

  TN3270 Client         TN3270 Server               Host

  Data (BB CD)     -&gt;          
                        Data (BB CD)          -&gt;         
                                              &lt;-    Screen 1 (KB Unlocked)
                   &lt;-   Screen 1 (KB Locked)        
                                              &lt;-    Null RU (EB)
                   &lt;-   "Write" (KB Unlocked)
  F8 (BB CD)       -&gt;
                        F8 (BB CD)            -&gt;
                                              &lt;-    Null RU (EB)
                   &lt;-   "Write" (KB Unlocked)
                                              &lt;-    BID
                        BID + RSP             -&gt;
                                              &lt;-    Screen 2 (KB Unlocked)
                   &lt;-   Screen 2 (KB Locked)
                                              &lt;-    Null RU (EB)
                   &lt;-   "Write" (KB Unlocked)
  F8 (BB CD)       -&gt;
                        F8 (BB CD)            -&gt;
                                              &lt;-    Null RU (EB)
                   &lt;-   Null RU (KB Unlocked)       
                                              &lt;-    BID
                        BID + RSP             -&gt;
  F8               -&gt;

At this point, the TN3270 server ignores the F8 from the client because the host
has initiated a Bracket through the BID. The client cannot send data at this
point, even though the keyboard is unlocked. Shortly after this, the host sends
Screen 3:

                               &lt;-    Screen 3 (KB Unlocked)
                   &lt;-   Screen 3 (KB Locked)
                                              &lt;-    Null RU (EB)
                   &lt;-   "Write" (KB Unlocked)
  F8 (BB CD)       -&gt;
                        F8 (BB CD)            -&gt;
                                              &lt;-    Null RU (EB)
                   &lt;-   Null RU (KB Unlocked)

NOTE: F8 refers to the TN3270 application sending Program Function (PF) Key 8 to
the host application. "Write" refers to the TN3270 server sending a 3270 Write
(X'F1') command to the TN3270 application with a WCC that has the KeyBoard (KB)
unlock bit set.

In this scenario, the application processes each screen of data twice because the
TN3270 server is sending a 3270 Write (and WCC) to the application to unlock the
keyboard upon receipt of the Null RU from the host.

Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



When the following registry entry is defined, the TN3270 server is updated to
prevent the modification of the keyboard unlock bit and the sending of the null
3270 Write command (and WCC) to a TN3270 client:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TN3270\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: ModifyWCC
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  Value: NO

  NOTE: The value of NO must be entered in uppercase letters.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

If the ModifyWCC entry is not added or a value other than NO is used, the TN3270
server will modify the keyboard unlock bit and send a null Write command as
described previously.
