SUMMARY
=======

To pass ink between hedit controls, an application must capture the ink when the
hedit control's parent window receives the HN_ENDREC notification message. Then
the application does either of the following:

- Sends a WM_HEDITCTL message with wParam set to HE_SETINKMODE to begin
  collecting ink, and sends a WM_HEDITCTL message with wParam set to
  HE_STOPINKMODE to stop collecting ink.

- Specifies RCO_SAVEHPENDATA in the lRcOptions field of the RC data structure.

INK2H is a file that demonstrates capturing ink and using the WM_HEDITCTL
message.

The recognizer returns ink in the hpendata field of the RCRESULT structure.
Passing ink between hedit controls is more difficult than using a normal device
context (DC). Perform the following four steps to save the ink:

1. Perform either of the following:

  a. Specify RCO_SAVEHPENDATA in the lRcOptions field of the RC data structure.

  b. Send the WM_HEDITCTL message to the hedit control with HE_SETINKMODE in
     wParam to begin collecting ink. Send the WM_HEDITCTL message to the hedit
     control with HE_STOPINKMODE to stop collecting ink.

2. When the application receives an HN_ENDREC notification for the source hedit
  control, retrieve the handle to the memory containing the ink. (When
  recognition is complete, the recognizer sends a WM_COMMAND message with the
  HN_ENDREC notification as the high-order word of lParam and the ID of the
  hedit control in wParam.)

3. Use the SendMessage function to send a WM_HEDITCTL message with
  HE_GETINKHANDLE as the value for wParam. If the call is successful, the
  low-order word of the returned value contains a handle to the memory
  containing the ink.

4. Depending on the choice made at step 1 above, perform the corresponding
  step:

  a. If the RCO_SAVEHPENDATA flag was set in step 1, Windows will not delete
     the data after all corresponding WM_RCRESULT messages have been sent.
     Therefore, call the DestroyPenData function to delete the pen data when an
     HN_RCRESULT notification is received.

  b. If HE_SETINKMODE is used, call the DuplicatePenData function to save the
     ink into a block of memory allocated by the GlobalAlloc function.

The procedure to place the collected ink into another hedit control is very
similar. Send a WM_HEDITCTL message with wParam set to HE_SETINKMODE and the
low-order of lParam set to the handle to the memory block containing the ink.
Then send a WM_HEDITCTL message with wParam set to HE_STOPINKMODE.

The INK2H sample application demonstrates copying ink between hedit controls
using the HE_SETINKMODE and HE_STOPINKMODE values with a WM_HEDITCTL message.
