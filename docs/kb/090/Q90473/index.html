SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Comm Server is a LAN Manager server-based product that allows
connectivity (over Token Ring) to mainframes from workstations running the Comm
Server client software. The server portion of Comm Server, which resides on the
LAN Manager server, transmits Comm Server client mainframe sessions (usually
3270 emulation sessions) using named pipes. The majority of these named pipes
are asynchronous.

This article discusses the use of Comm Server with Windows for Workgroups and
Workgroup Connections redirectors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Comm Server requires the ability of the redirector to support asynchronous named
pipes. The only redirectors that currently support this are the Vredir and the
Full redirector.

The Vredir is the preferred redirector to use with Comm Server because it can
handle the multiple asynchronous named pipe requests that Comm server requires
and it frees up more resources than does the Full redirector.

The Full redirector does not have enough internal support to satisfy all the
asynchronous requests of the Comm Server. Although the Full redirector does
support asynchronous pipes, it cannot accept multiple requests at once.

NOTE: The Full redirector does not support asynchronous named pipes inside of
Windows, but it does support named pipes inside of Windows.

The Basic redirector does not have named pipe support, and therefore does not
work with Comm Server.
