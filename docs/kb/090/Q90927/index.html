The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) version 3.1 does not include the
functionality to join network segments, regardless of topology or operating
system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups includes the functionality to connect a Windows for
Workgroups workstation to one or more separate network segments through separate
network interface cards. It does not include the functionality to join these
separate segments to each other.

Example of Connecting to Two Different Topologies
-------------------------------------------------

A Windows for Workgroups machine cannot be used to join multiple network segments
of different types. However, you can connect a single workstation to two
different networks. For example, you can use one network card to connect a
Windows for Workgroups workstation to a LAN Manager Ethernet network using the
NetBEUI protocol and then use a second network card to connect to a Novell
network using the MSIPX and NetBEUI protocols. This workstation can communicate
with (and use and share resources on) both networks, but it cannot join the two
networks together.

This type of connection is sometimes referred to as internal bridging or routing.
To connect networks of different topologies or operating systems, you must use
the correct hardware device. For example, to connect an Ethernet network to a
Token Ring network, you must use a device called a gateway (which supports this
function).

Example of Connecting to Two Different Segments
-----------------------------------------------

You cannot use a Windows for Workgroups machine to join multiple network segments
of the same type. If, for example, a workstation has two network cards installed
(both of the same type, such as Ethernet), you can connect 1 to 10 workstations
on one segment (Segment 1) and 20 workstations on the other (Segment 2). The 10
workstations on Segment 1 will be able to communicate with each other, as will
the 20 workstations on Segment 2. The machine that is connected to both segments
(through the two separate network cards) can communicate with all 30
workstations, but it does not join the segments together in a way that enables
them to share and use resources on the other segment.

In other words, a Windows for Workgroups machine can connect to different
segments of a network, but it cannot replace a hardware device designed to join
network segments. To connect multiple network segments, a device that supports
this function is required, such as a multiport repeater or Multistation Access
Unit (MAU). The device is specific to the network topology and existing network.
