The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you select the Re-share At Startup option when sharing a floppy or CD-ROM
drive, and you start Windows for Workgroups without a disk in the shared drive,
the following error may be displayed.

  System Error Cannot Read from Drive X.

(where X: is the driver letter representing the shared drive)

If you choose the Cancel button, the following error message will be displayed:

  An error occurred while trying to share X. Error 5291. The path X:\ does not
  exist. Do you want to continue to share X each time you start Windows for
  Workgroups?

  -or-

  An error occurred while trying to share X. Error 5341. The path X:\ does not
  exist.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows for Workgroups File Manager allows the sharing of local disk
resources including fixed disks, floppy drives, and CD-ROM drives. You can make
these shares persistent by selecting the Re-share At Startup option. If you
select this option and the shared CD-ROM or floppy drive does not contain a disk
when Windows for Workgroups is restarted, the above errors may occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To eliminate these error messages, make sure that the shared drive contains a
disk before starting Windows for Workgroups.

There are several ways to recover from the error condition, depending on the
intended result.

- To immediately reestablish the share, insert a disk in the shared drive and
  choose Retry in the System Error Cannot Read From Drive X dialog box.

- To not reestablish the share for the current session, but attempt to
  reestablish the share in future sessions, choose Cancel at the System Error
  Cannot Read From Drive X dialog box and choose Yes at the Do You Want To
  Continue To Share X Each Time You Start Windows for Workgroups? dialog box.

- To not reestablish the share for the current or future sessions, choose
  Cancel in the System Error Cannot Read From Drive X dialog box and choose No
  at the Do You Want To Continue To Share X Each Time You Start Windows For
  Workgroups? dialog box.
