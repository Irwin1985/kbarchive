-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, version 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a machine running Workgroup Connections, Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, or
Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you receive the following error message:

  Error 6118: The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently
  available.

Under Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you may also receive the following error
message:

  The list of servers for this workgroup is not currently available.

In this case, you can see the workgroup but not the individual computers in the
workgroup. You may be able to see the computers under other workgroups. You can
connect to a server by manually typing in the path, but you cannot browse a list
of available servers.

Or, other computers are able to browse the network but not all workstations show
up on the browse list.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if you browse or run NET VIEW when connecting to network
drives and one of the following conditions exists:

- Your machine has file and print sharing disabled (Windows for Workgroups
  only).

  -or-

- There is a space character in the workgroup name.

  -or-

- There are no browse master machines on the network (Windows for Workgroups
  only).

  -or-

- You are using the Windows for Workgroups basic redirector and you have ten
  network connections established.

If there is no master or backup browser present in the workgroup, you cannot see
individual computers in a workgroup when you browse. You may see the computers
in other workgroups if there is a browser present in that workgroup. If there is
only one workgroup present on the network and there is no browser present, you
see the workgroup listed but no servers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- Enable file and/or print sharing.

  -or-

- Remove the space character from the workgroup name.

  -or-

- Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

  net view /workgroup:"work group"

  NOTE: The quotation marks are not optional.

  -or-

- Use a text editor (such as MS-DOS Editor or Windows for Workgroups Notepad)
  to edit the SYSTEM.INI file on one machine in the workgroup and add the
  following entry to the [Network] section:

  MaintainServerList=yes

  You can also set a second computer in the workgroup to Auto and the remainder
  at "no." On each computer that you edit the SYSTEM.INI file, you must quit
  and restart Windows for Workgroups.

  -or-

- Disconnect from one or more network servers.


MORE INFORMATION
================

MaintainServerList controls the ability of the computer to act as a browse
master. If this entry is set to Auto, the computer acts as a backup browser or
master browser as needed. If the entry is set to Yes, the computer acts as the
master browser. If the entry is set to No, the computer acts as neither. There
must be at least one computer acting as a browser in the workgroup in order for
you to be able to browse.
