The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Many MS-DOS-based and Windows-based applications handle files in a way that
allows data loss to occur in a peer-to-peer multitasking environment. Data loss
can occur if an application opens and closes a data file that is being edited.
This includes some network-aware applications that make no provisions for a
peer-to-peer environment, and instead assume all networks follow the
client/server model.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you open a file, Windows for Workgroups assigns ownership of that file to
you. If your application closes the file once it has loaded it into system
memory (RAM), Windows for Workgroups no longer thinks the file is owned by you
or anyone else. This allows another user to access and modify the file. The same
can be true for files and applications run on remote servers, again dependent on
the application.

Windows for Workgroups (as with other networking environments) allows other
users, locally and remotely, to access and modify files if they are not locked.
When you attempt to save changes to a data file, you may be denied access if
another user has opened the file, or, if another user has modified the file, the
changes made will be lost when you save your changes. Applications written
assuming they will only be run on a single-tasking, non-networked platform
encounter these problems occasionally.

If you are not able to save changes because another user is accessing your data
file, try to save your changes under a different filename. Depending on the
application and the data file in question, integrating the two files may be
difficult.

Manually lock your data files using a file-locking utility such as the MS-DOS
command ATTRIB. You only need to lock files that other users can access (those
that are on a shared drive.)
