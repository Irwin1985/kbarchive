SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to play the games included with Magic School Bus
Explores Inside the Earth.

GAME DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

Pan for Gold - Canyon:

Maneuver Carlos and his gold sifting pan across the face of a waterfall, where
various objects fall from dizzying heights. Gold nuggets are worth 10 points
each, and several objects labeled "junk" (a sack lunch, a bottle, an orange
tube, and a penguin) are worth 5 points. Watch out for large objects coming over
the edge - the bowling ball and the brick will both break your sifting pan.

Drill for Oil - Dig For Coal - Fault:

Help Phoebe and Ralphie be the first to locate 5 pockets of coal and 16 pockets
of oil before Liz can do the same. At the cost of one turn, you can use one of
three probes allotted to you at the beginning of the game. Click the probe and
then select a section of ground you want to send your probe through. It shows
you everything running vertically from where you click, but only for a moment.

Cave Painting - Cavern:

A sort of Earth "Paintbrush," Cave Painting allow you to draw using six different
colors and three different thumb sizes upon a rock wall by firelight. It also
gives a scrollable list of cave art to paste onto your canvas. If your rocky
canvas gets too full or you simply want to start over, click the fire in the
lower-right corner to wipe your slate clean. To hear about cave art, click the
open book next to the Help button. Your cave art prints in color on a color
printer.

Stop the Lava - Volcano:

Armed with a mouse pointer shaped like cross-hairs (your weapon is actually a
water gun), your job is to click on the moving heads of lava as they cascade
down the volcano side, stopping them from moving downwards as quickly as you
can. Each time you miss a lava head with a click, it drains some water from your
ready supply on the right side. If you run out, the faucet opens up and you have
to wait for it to fill up again - your ability to click is gone while it fills.
Through three screens, you must prevent the lava from sliding down the volcano
and reaching the beach. Each level you complete extends the time in which you
must do it, complicates the pattern of the lava, and speeds up the lava flow.

Crystal Creation - Geode:

Using five different water types (these vary by the type of geode crystal they
will eventually form), create a geode by clicking on the water types and
selecting "cook." You can also hear more information on geodes and geode
creation by selecting the book next to the Help button.

Jump the Fault - Fault:

Phoebe needs to get across the fault, and it's up to you to get her there. By
holding down the mouse button and letting go, you can help her jump onto moving
fault platforms. The longer you hold down the mouse button, the further she
jumps when you let go, so you need to time your jumps carefully. If you miss the
platform, a gust of air blows her back to the platform she is jumping from, and
you lose one of your counters (Phoebe silhouettes in the upper-left corner). For
each two platforms you successfully land on, you get another counter.

The Pangaea Puzzle - Undersea:

Given a view of Pangaea, your job is to put the puzzle back together again when
it all comes apart. Once you complete the puzzle, it is replaced with a view of
the world 150 million years later, and the map must once again be reconstructed.
You will eventually come to a contemporary map of the world, and once you
complete that one, it plays a complete animation of Pangaea transforming to a
contemporary map. Click the book next to the Help button to hear facts about the
current map. You can also select whether you want to play the easy or hard
level.

The Batty Cave Race - Cavern:

Here is your opportunity to race blindly through darkened caves and eat a bunch
of bugs. The Batty Cave Race is a race in a cave between bats. You control one
of the bats, dodging stalagmites and stalactites, eating bugs, and avoiding
dripping water which slows you down. Occasionally, if you are way ahead of your
winged rodent opponent, your opponent catches up to you, just to keep it
sporting.

Volcano Formation - Volcano:

Here you can make different kinds of volcanoes by changing the conditions under
which they are made with the gas and heat controls. After you make your volcano,
you can destroy it and make a new one with new settings. You can also get
information about volcano formation by clicking the book button next to the Help
button.

The Fossil Animator - Canyon:

With the Fossil Animator, you can catch glimpses of prehistoric plant and animal
life by completing the fossil puzzle that precedes each of them. There are three
different puzzles. Each gives you a cool picture when completed, and there are
two different levels of puzzle solving: easy and hard.
