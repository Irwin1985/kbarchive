-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server administrators may find that newly created objects
(for example, recipients) on one server have not replicated to other servers
(within a site or between sites), even though a reasonable period of time has
passed for replication to have occurred.

The total recipients count (in the lower left corner of the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program window) may remain consistently less than that of
other servers in the site. Also, users may find that an address is not available
in the Global Address List.

CAUSE
=====

The "Reps-From" update sequence number (USN) count on the server not taking
replicas from the replicating server has been incorrectly advanced to a value
higher than the current USN issued by the target server's directory service.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. The first step in troubleshooting these symptoms is to positively diagnose
  whether the server's tardy replication is caused by either the problem
  described in this article or the one in the article Q152942, "XADM: Slow
  Intra-site Directory Replication Between Servers." These conditions are rare.


2. If you are sure that a server maintains a higher "Reps- From" USN than the
  highest USN assigned by the that server, do one of the following:

  a. If the high "Reps-From" count is between two replication bridgehead
     servers in a multi-site Microsoft Exchange Server organization:

  Redefine one of the other servers in the site lacking replicas as the
  replication bridgehead for the site.

     If the server is a single-server site:

  Delete the replication connector and the other site object(s) associated with
  this replication connector (in both sites). Allow the delete to complete, and
  then reconfigure the directory replication connector.

  b. If the high "Reps-From" count is between two servers within a site,
     Re-install the server harboring the high "Reps-From" count into the site,
     following the steps documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article
     Q162353, "XADM: Restoring an Exchange Directory."

STATUS
======

version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
