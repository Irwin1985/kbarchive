SUMMARY
=======

The Windows API provides the ability to perform a copy, move, rename, or delete
operation on a file system object using the SHFileOperation API function
exported by Shell32.dll. This article shows how to copy a list of files into a
named folder while displaying a dialog box with a copy animation and an animated
scroll bar displayed to show the progress of the copy operation. The article
also shows how to create a sample project that demonstrates how the use of this
API function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SHFileOperation function provides the ability to move, rename, or delete
file system objects based on the flags passed to the function. The function
requires the address of the SHFILEOPSSTRUCT structure. This structure contains
the following members:

- hwnd - Window handle to the dialog box to display information about the
  status of the file operation.

- wFunc - the operation to perform, as defined by one of the following values:

   - FO_COPY - Copies the files specified in the pFrom member to the location
     specified in the pTo member.

   - FO_DELETE - Deletes the files specified in pFrom. (pTo is ignored.)

   - FO_MOVE - Moves the files specified in pFrom to the location specified in
     pTo.

   - FO_RENAME - Renames the files specified in pFrom.

- pFrom - Address of a buffer to specify one or more source file names.
  Multiple names must be null-separated. The list of names must be double
  null-terminated.

- pTo - Address of a buffer to contain the name of the destination file or
  directory. The buffer can contain multiple destination file names if the
  fFlags member specifies FOF_MULTIDESTFILES. Multiple names must be
  null-separated. The list of names must be double null-terminated.

- fFlags - Flags that control the file operation. This member can be a
  combination of the following flags:

   - FOF_ALLOWUNDO - Preserve Undo information, if possible.

   - FOF_CONFIRMMOUSE - Not currently implemented.

   - FOF_FILESONLY - Perform the operation on files only if a wildcard file
     name (*.*) is specified.

   - FOF_MULTIDESTFILES - The pTo member specifies multiple destination files
     (one for each source file) rather than one directory where all source
     files are to be deposited.

   - FOF_NOCONFIRMATION - Respond with Yes to All for any dialog box that is
     displayed.

   - FOF_NOCONFIRMMKDIR - Does not confirm the creation of a new directory if
     the operation requires one to be created.

   - FOF_NOERRORUI - No user interface will be displayed if an error occurs.

   - FOF_RENAMEONCOLLISION - Give the file being operated on a new name in a
     move, copy, or rename operation if a file with the target name already
     exists.

   - FOF_SILENT - Does not display a progress dialog box.

   - FOF_SIMPLEPROGRESS - Displays a progress dialog box but does not show the
     file names.

   - FOF_WANTMAPPINGHANDLE - If FOF_RENAMEONCOLLISION is specified, the
     hNameMappings member will be filled in if any files were renamed.

- fAnyOperationsAborted - Value that receives TRUE if the user aborted any file
  operations before they were completed, or FALSE otherwise.

- hNameMappings - Handle to a file name mapping object that contains an array
  of SHNAMEMAPPING structures. Each structure contains the old and new path
  names for each file that was moved, copied, or renamed. This member is used
  only if the fFlags member includes the FOF_WANTMAPPINGHANDLE flag. The handle
  must be freed by using the SHFreeNameMappings function.

- lpszProgressTitle - Address of a string to use as the title of a progress
  dialog box. This member is used only if fFlags includes the
  FOF_SIMPLEPROGRESS flag.

NOTE: The 32-bit version of Visual Basic aligns structures at double-word
boundaries, but some API functions, such as the SHFileOperation, expect the data
to arrive as byte-aligned. If you pass the SHFILEOPSTRUCT structure without
taking this double-word boundary into consideration, the fAnyOperationsAborted,
hNameMappings, and the lpszProgressTitle members of the structure will not be
passed correctly. If you want the copy dialog box to contain a custom message
string as defined by the lpszProgressTitle member, use a byte array to work
around this limitation. The use of a byte array is demonstrated in the sample
project.

The next section shows you how to create a sample project that demonstrates how
to use the SHFileOperation function to copy the Visual Basic executable file and
a Help file to a test folder. The sample project also shows you how to display a
custom message string in the dialog box that displays the progress information.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add the two check boxes and one CommandButton to the Form1 form.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

     Option Explicit

4. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. Click
  Copy Files to start the copy process. To copy all the files in the Visual
  Basic program directory, check Copy All Files in VB Directory. To show where
  a custom message will display in the dialog box that shows the copy progress,
  check Display Custom Message.

  NOTE: On faster machines the dialog may not be displayed because the copy
  Operation completes before the dialog is shown. Select the Copy All Files
  option to guarantee that the dialog will be displayed.
