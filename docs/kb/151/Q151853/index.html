-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To use the Pivot Table Wizard in Visual FoxPro for Macintosh successfully,
Microsoft Excel 5.0 and Microsoft Query must be properly installed. Since Excel
uses the FoxPro ODBC driver when creating the pivot table, the Q+E ODBC FoxPro
Driver must be installed and a data source for FoxPro files must be setup in the
ODBC Setup control panel. Excel and Microsoft Office install Microsoft Query and
the ODBC files necessary to access FoxPro files using Excel and Microsoft Query.
If you are doing a less-than-complete install of Excel or Office, choose the
Data Access options to install Microsoft Query and the ODBC files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following three messages may be received in Visual FoxPro if a required file
is missing, damaged, or is the wrong version. Under each message is information
on what files may be missing or how to fix the condition that is causing the
Pivot Table Wizard not to complete. The information on files is based on
Microsoft Office version 4.2. Future releases of Office may cause some of this
information to change.

Error Message 1
---------------

  Microsoft Query has not been installed properly and is needed in order to
  create an Excel pivot table.

To fix this condition, make sure Microsoft Query is installed in the Microsoft
folder on the Macintosh. It should be version 1.0. Reinstall Microsoft Query
from the Excel or Office source disk.

Error Message 2
---------------

  Failed to get Excel OLE object.

One or more of the following files may be missing or damaged. In all cases below,
the Pivot Table Wizard will not even be able to load Excel. Note that Excel
needs the Microsoft OLE Automation and Microsoft OLE Library just to load on its
own:

1. fxOLE30b.cfm - This file installs with Visual FoxPro and resides in the
  System:Extensions folder. It should be 163,604 bytes in size. No version. The
  Pivot Table Wizard will not make use of fxOLE30b.slm if the cfm is not
  available.

2. Microsoft OLE Automation - This file installs with Visual FoxPro and is also
  located in the System:Extensions folder. It is version 2.06 and is 537,822
  bytes in size. It is one of three OLE files installed by Visual FoxPro.

3. Microsoft OLE Library - Another of the three OLE extensions that Visual
  FoxPro installs. This is also version 2.06 and is 964,784 bytes in size. The
  remaining OLE extension that Visual FoxPro installs, Microsoft OLE Extension,
  is not used by the Pivot Table Wizard and will not cause the above message if
  it is missing. Make sure that it is installed, however. It is version 2.07
  and is 949,173 bytes in size.

4. PPC Registration Database - This file is located in the System:Preferences
  folder. The number of installed applications will determine this file's size.
  If this file has been deleted since Excel was installed or was last run, it
  will cause the above message and the Pivot Table Wizard will fail. To correct
  this condition, start Excel to re-register it. The Pivot Table Wizard will
  complete if this was the only problem.

Error Message 3
---------------

  An OLE automation error occurred. Your Excel pivot table may not be complete.

This message indicates that one of the ODBC components is missing or damaged. The
key files to check for are listed below. Note that the ODBC files with "PPC" on
the ends of their names are installed by Visual FoxPro and will not work with
Excel 5.0 and the Q+E ODBC FoxPro Driver. In all cases below, Excel will start,
but the pivot table will not be created. Switching back to Visual FoxPro will
reveal the above message.

1. ODBC Configuration Manager - Located in the System:Extensions folder, this
  should be version 1.0. It is 29,835 bytes in size. Although this file is
  installed by Excel or Office, it is supplied by Apple Computer, Inc.

2. ODBC Driver Manager - Also in the System:Extensions folder. It is version 1.0
  and is 51,175 bytes. An Apple Computer, Inc. file.

3. Q+E ODBC FoxPro Driver - Located in the System:Extensions folder. This file
  has an Intersolv, Inc. copyright. It is version 1.2.0 and is 772,536 bytes in
  size. If this file is missing, the Data Source For Connection dialog will
  appear in Excel but there will not be an option for an ODBC driver to access
  FoxPro files. Choosing Cancel in the dialog will produce the above message in
  Visual FoxPro.

  Even if the Q+E ODBC FoxPro Driver file is installed, if no data source has
  been set up to use it, the Data Source For Connection dialog will not have an
  appropriate ODBC driver for the Pivot Table Wizard to use. Set up a data
  source to use the Q+E FoxPro Driver by using the ODBC Setup control panel.
  The ODBC setup control panel is also installed by Excel and/or Office. It is
  an Apple Computer, Inc. file. It is version 1.0 and is 5,888 bytes in size.
  The data sources that are set up in it are stored in the ODBC Preferences
  file found in the System:Preferences folder.

  To setup a data source for FoxPro files:

  a. Open the ODBC Setup control panel, and choose the Setup Data Sources...
     button.

  b. Once in the ODBC Data Sources dialog, choose the Add... button.

  c. Select the Q+E/Microsoft FoxPro Driver as the driver, and choose the OK
     button.

  d. Type in a Data Source Name. The other settings can be left as they appear.
     Choose OK.

Visual FoxPro for Macintosh has the ability to distribute run-time applications
to 68K (non-PowerPC) Macintoshes. One of the options in Step 2 of the Setup
Wizard is to include support for the SQL Server ODBC Driver. If a Visual FoxPro
run-time application for a 68K Macintosh is installed on a PowerPC that has
Excel or Office and Visual FoxPro on it, the ODBC files referred to above will
be replaced with newer versions supplied by Visigenic Software, Inc. The Q+E
FoxPro ODBC Driver installed by Excel or Office is a 68K driver and will work
with these newer ODBC files. The relevant files, their version and size are
listed below. These are the versions from Visigenic:

  File Name                      Version             Size
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

  ODBC Setup control panel        2.1.1               94,891 bytes
  ODBC Configuration Manager      2.1.1              146,675 bytes
  ODBC Driver Manager             2.1.1               66,631 bytes

NOTE: As of Dec-09-1998, Visigenic was acquired by INPRISE, Inc.
