-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
- Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows for Workgroups 3.11 DHCP client running TCP/IP-32 does not release and
unbind its IP address from the Network Interface Card (NIC) even after the lease
has expired until the user acknowledges the pop-up message that is displayed on
the screen indicating that the lease has expired.

CAUSE
=====

This particular situation can arise when a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) server is not available on the network to renew the client lease at the
time of expiration. The client, after repeated attempts to renew the current
lease, will try to obtain a new lease thereafter. If it fails to get a new lease
as well, it should relinquish the current lease and release the IP address it is
currently using.

This can also create duplicate addresses on the network, when the DHCP server
reuses the address and leases it to another client because the earlier lease had
expired.

RESOLUTION
==========

The module Vdhcp.386 was changed to release the IP address before displaying the
dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in TCP/IP32. A fix to this problem
is in development, but has not been regression tested and may be destabilizing
in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend implementing this fix
at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on
the availability of this fix.
