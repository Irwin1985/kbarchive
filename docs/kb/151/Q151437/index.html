-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh, a default Command
button, by which the Click method is called when the user presses the
&lt;RETURN&gt; key), is denoted by a double outline surrounding the Command
button.

A problem occurs when using the Form Wizard. The Command buttons generated are
not separated far enough to take into consideration the double outline
surrounding the button with focus. This is most evident when the Visual FoxPro
system variable (KEYCOMP) is set to Windows.

CAUSE
=====

When KEYCOMP is set to Windows, the user is allowed to tab through the Command
buttons. While doing so, the focus changes from Command button to Command button
and the double, black outline surrounding the active Command button is not
entirely visible.

The Form Wizard for Visual FoxPro for Power Macintosh is designed to create
Command buttons that are used on a Macintosh. The interface standard for the
Macintosh stipulates that the user must click the mouse pointer on a Command
button and cannot tab from Command button to Command button. When KEYCOMP is set
to Mac, Visual FoxPro adheres to this standard and the user does not see any
problem with the Command buttons created by the Form Wizard. When KEYCOMP is set
to Windows, the problem appears.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two ways to work around this problem. Set KEYCOMP to Mac and the
problem disappears because Visual FoxPro supports the Macintosh user interface.
This option may not be viable for developers wanting to produce a seamless
interface from Windows to the Macintosh. These developers should set KEYCOMP to
Windows.

In the cases where KEYCOMP must be set to Windows, developers need to modify
manually the form created by the Form Wizard. This involves spreading out the
Command buttons so there is enough room between them to display the double,
black outline.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Set KEYCOMP to Windows.

2. Start Form Wizard from the menu.

3. Select a Form Wizard.

4. Select a table to use, and put one field on the form.

5. Finish the form and run it.

6. Tab through the buttons.

Note that only part of the black outline that should surround each command button
as it receives focus is visible.
