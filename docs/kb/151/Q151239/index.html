-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

An autostarted Invokable Transaction Program (TP) written as a Microsoft Windows
NT application can be configured to run as a Windows NT service using the
Windows NT Resource Kit utility Srvany.exe. This TP can then be configured to be
autostarted by SNA Server when invoked by the remote system. When you configure
an application to run as a service, the application can be automatically started
without a user being logged onto Windows NT. Also, the user context under which
the application is run can be configured in the Services Control Panel.

NOTE: Some applications may assume that there is a logged on user in order to run
properly. See the documentation for SRVANY included in the Windows NT Resource
Kit for details. Some applications may not operate properly when run in this
mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a program to run as a service, the program must include a service control
handler to communicate with the Windows NT Service Control Manager, so that it
can respond to startup and shutdown requests.

Programs written specifically as a Windows NT service have these call in their
code, whereas an application does not. The utility SRVANY acts as an
intermediary between the application and Service Control Manager to allow an
application to be run as a service.

Installation Instructions (adapted from Resource Kit Help file)
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy SRVANY.EXE to your system and install it as a Windows NT service, for
  example, INSTSRV MyService c:\tools\srvany.exe

  INSTSRV.EXE can be found in the Resource Kit. The service name "MyService"
  should be the TPName.

2. Configure the service (for example, "MyService") using the Services applet of
  the Control Panel as manual or automatic. If you wish SNA Server to
  automatically start the TP when an attach request is received, configure the
  service for manual startup.

3. Set via the Services applet of the Control Panel the account for the service.
  If you need access to the screen and keyboard, you must choose the
  LocalSystem account and click the Allow Service to Interact with Desktop,
  otherwise choose any account and specify the correct logon password.

  NOTE: The LocalSystem account does not have network access. Make sure that the
  account specified has rights to logon as a service.

Specify the Application to Start and its Parameters
---------------------------------------------------

Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe):

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MyService: create
  a Parameters key.

2. Under the above key, create an Application value of type REG_SZ and specify
  there the full path of your app executable (including the extension). For
  example, Application: REG_SZ: D:\Tools\Vi.exe

3. OPTIONAL: under the above key, create an AppParameters value of type REG_SZ
  and specify the parameters for your app. For example, AppParameters: REG_SZ:
  C:\Tmp\Temp

4. OPTIONAL: under the above key, create an AppDirectory value of type REG_SZ
  and specify the current directory to use for the application. For example,
  AppDirectory: REG_SZ: C:\Tmp

Add Registry Values to Have the Service Act as an Autostarted TP
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MyService: create
  a Linkage key

2. Under the above key, create an OtherDependencies value of type REG_MULTI_SZ
  and specify SnaBase. For example, OtherDependencies: REG_MULTI_SZ: SnaBase

3. Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MyService
  \Parameters, create the following values:

     AlreadyVerified:REG_SZ:no
     ConversationSecurity:REG_SZ:no
     LocalLU:REG_SZ:'LUAlias'  (optional)
     Parameters:REG_SZ:
     SNAServiceType:REG_DWORD:0x5   (type 5 is autostarted)
     Timeout:REG_DWORD:0xffffffff  (infinite timeout)

  NOTE: The above Invokable TP parameters are described in Chapter 2 of the SNA
  Server APPC and CPIC "Programmer's Guides."

These settings correspond to the fields in TPSETUP, the utility included with SNA
Server for installing Invokable TPs. The SnaBase service must be stopped and
started to recognize the new transaction program.
