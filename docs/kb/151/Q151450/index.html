The information in this article applies to:

- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores Inside the Earth for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth (MSB Earth), you may
receive the following error message:

  MSB Earth

  The system is unable to play CD Audio. You can continue running this program
  but some background audio will not play.

CAUSE
=====

The error message occurs if the appropriate CD Audio device driver is not
installed, or if the audio driver is damaged. This error message can also occur
if the CD Audio device is disabled.

After you receive this error message, the program starts and runs, but the CD
Audio driver must be installed correctly in order for you to hear all of the
audio features in MSB Earth.

RESOLUTION
==========

  Devices.

  of the device is disabled, click the Use This Media Control Device option to
  enable the device.

6. Click OK.

7. If you enabled the device using the steps above, click OK when you receive
  the following message:

  These changes may not take effect until you restart Windows.

8. Click OK to close the Multimedia Properties dialog box.

9. Click Start, click Shut Down, click "Restart the Computer", and then click
  Yes.

If you are using Windows 3.x, use one of the methods described below to install
the MCI CD Audio driver.

Method 1
--------

Install the CD Audio driver from your Windows disks.

Method 2
--------

Install the MCI CD Audio driver from the Magic School Bus Explores Inside the
Earth compact disc:

1. In Program Manager, go to the Main group and click Control Panel.
  Double-click Drivers.

2. Click Add.

3. In the List Of Drivers, click Unlisted Or Updated Driver and click OK.

4. In the dialog box where it says, "Insert the disk with the unlisted, updated,
  or vendor-provided driver in:", type

  The computer should respond with:

  Redbook CD Audio Configuration:
  One CDROM drive was detected. Installation was complete.

6. Click OK.

After you follow the instructions above, you should be able to run Magic School
Bus Explores Inside the Earth and hear all of the background music.

Method 3

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139659 MSB Ocean: ErrMsg: CD Audio MCI Driver Not Installed

Method 4
--------

Download the MCI CD Audio driver. For instructions on how to download the driver
from Microsoft, please see the instructions in the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q148798 Windows 3.1 [MCI] CD Audio Driver Available

MORE INFORMATION
================

Immediately underneath this error message there is a check box that reads "don't
display this message in the future" and there is a Continue button and a Cancel
button. If you click Continue, the program continues to run without any
difficulty; however, the CD Audio portion (background music) of the program does
not play. If you click Cancel, the application does not run and you are returned
to Windows.

Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs (MSB Dinosaurs) does not
utilize CD Audio the same way MSB Ocean and MSB Earth do. MSB Dinosaurs uses
wave files for sound output. As a result, MSB Dinosaurs does not generate the
error message described in this article.
