SUMMARY
=======

WHOIS is a service provided by the InterNIC that provides information on
second-level domains including contact e-mail addresses, postal addresses and
telephone numbers of those who have registered with the InterNIC. WHOIS can also
help determine whether a domain name is already in use which can be helpful for
new site administrators.

WHOIS can be accessed through WHOIS clients, interactive telnet sessions, e-
mail, and the World Wide Web. The InterNIC database provides information about
COM, .EDU, .NET, .ORG, and .GOV domains.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This WHOIS service involves an online database that contains information about
networks, networking organizations, domains, sites, and the contacts associated
with them. This database is known as the InterNIC database.

The names of the administrative and technical contacts for registered domains are
entered into the database when domain or IP number applications are processed by
the InterNIC.

The information contained in the InterNIC database can be especially valuable if
there is a problem with internetworking between two domains. For example, WHOIS
can help determine who to contact if there is a problem with Internet mail that
cannot be resolved through e-mail. WHOIS can show the Exchange Server
administrator the name and phone number of the administrator at a destination
host.

ACCESSING WHOIS:

WHOIS Client:

The WHOIS client program accesses the InterNIC database directly and is usually
included with UNIX systems. There are also clients available for other platforms
including Windows and Windows NT.

If you have shell account access to the Internet that includes the WHOIS client,
type the following:

  whois domain.com

Where "domain.com" is the name of the Internet domain of the host that you are
interested in. Note that the InterNIC registers secondary domain names only. For
best results DO NOT include Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on the query.
FQDNs include the higher level domains associated with an Internet site. Only
secondary domain names will return contact information.

Example:

Wrong: www.microsoft.com
Correct: microsoft.com

Direct Telnet Session:

All systems that have access to the Internet should have the ability to use a
standard telnet client to connect to the InterNIC to run the WHOIS client from
their system. Networks that restrict access to the Internet through use of a
firewall will not be able to use this method if tcp port 23 (standard telnet
port) access is blocked.

Exchange Server administrators may run the Windows NT Telnet client from the
computer that is running the IMC. Any telnet client from any host connected to
the Internet should work.

In telnet, connect to "internic.net". Once connected you may run WHOIS commands
as listed in the client instructions above.


World Wide Web:

The Web Interface to WHOIS is a searchable database through a web page. To access
with any World Wide Web (WWW) client, connect to:

  http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois

Electronic Mail:

If you are unable to access the methods above but have access to Internet mail,
you can send your query to:

  mailserv@internic.net

Enter your command in the subject line or as the first line of the body of the
message. All other text is ignored. You must prefix your command with the word
"WHOIS" just like the client examples above. Requests through electronic mail
are processed automatically once per day.

OTHER TOP LEVEL DOMAINS:

The InterNIC provides registration information for COM, .EDU, .NET, .ORG, and
.GOV domains only. However, the WHOIS client works with other top level domains.
Top level domains that do not provide compatibility with WHOIS may provide other
tools to research domains.

Other Registries:

.US Domain Registry - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA):
http://www.isi.edu:80/in-notes/usdnr/

.CA Domain - CA*net Canadian IP Address Registry and the Canadian Domain Name
Registry.: http://www.canet.ca/canet/index.html

NIC-Mexico - Mexico Registration Mexico: http://www.nic.mx/

RIPE NCC Europe Registration: http://www.ripe.net/

APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Center): http://www.apnic.net/

Modernization of the Internet Registration Service"
