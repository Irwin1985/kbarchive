-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Symptoms include any JET database operation that results in an -1018
(JET_errReadVerifyFailure) and/or any Windows NT Event Viewer application log
error reported that included the error code -1018 in its description, such as
the following:

  Event ID: 23
  Source: EDB
  Type: Error
  Category: Database Page Cache
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((455)) Direct read found corrupted page error -1018
  ((1:251563) (0-2295758), 251563 379225672 381322824). Please restore the
  database from a previous backup.

CAUSE
=====

When you perform a transaction with the Jet database, the information store or
the directory store writes the transaction to a transaction log file (Edb*.log
in Mdbdata or Dsadata). The transaction is then committed to the Jet database.
During this process, the Jet engine calculates the page's checksum value to be
written, records it in the page header, and then requests that the file system
writes the 4-KB page of data to the database on disk. In brief, the file system
takes this call and uses Windows NT system services to forward this request to
the corresponding hardware device driver to actually perform the write. The
hardware device driver returns this information to the file system, which then
returns it to the Jet engine. If the call is successful, Jet continues.

Faulty hardware or hardware device drivers may return SUCCESS to calls made to
them before they actually perform the physical operation. When the actual
physical operation takes place, however, an error occurs and the data is not
written successfully as expected.

In certain database operations such as but not limited to Online Backup, the
backup routine makes a call to the operating system to read a 4-KB page of data
from the database on disk and write it to tape. Before committing the data
returned from the operating system call to the tape, the online backup process
compares the checksum value in the page header (recorded when this page was
written to disk) to that being returned from the READ call. If the checksum
values do not match, the JET database engine detects this and returns -1018
(JET_errReadVerifyFailure).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, use one of the following methods.

Restore from a Backup
---------------------

When you encounter the error, the recommended and most reliable way to recover
the database is to restore from the last known good backup.

NOTES:

Even after you restore from a known good backup, however, the -1018 errors may
appear again unless the root causes of the physical data write problems are
resolved.

The Windows NT system log should be reviewed for errors reported by the hard
disks and hard disk controllers as well at the NT Fault Tolerant disk subsystem
(FTDISK). In particular, hardware-related errors such as SCSI time-out errors,
memory errors, or drive corruption errors may appear. These errors should be
dealt with and resolved before the database is restored to this server.

Even if no hardware-related errors appear in the Windows NT system log, a
hardware problem may exist on your computer.

Microsoft strongly recommendeds that you contact your hardware vendor for further
updates regarding your hardware.

Use Edbutil.exe or Eseutil.exe
------------------------------

An alternate way to repair the bad page of data is to use Edbutil.exe for
Exchange Server 4.0 and 5.0, or Eseutil.exe for Exchange Server 5.5.

IMPORTANT: Make a full offline file backup of the database and log files before
running this process. This includes file-level backups of the Exchsrvr\Dsadata
and Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folders. This ensures that there is a way to go back if
Edbutil/eseutil fails.

Edbutil.exe (and Eseutil.exe) is a low-level Jet database utility that
defragments and checks the consistency of the database. There is also a repair
option (Edbutil /d /r &lt;dbname&gt;, Eseutil /p &lt;dbname&gt;) that attempts
to repair bad pages and remove them if the repair is unsuccessful. If a page is
removed using the repair option, data loss will occur. A page in a database can
contain messages, folders, tables, master indexes, and so forth. There is no way
to tell what Edbutil or Eseutil has removed because Jet sees it as raw data.
After repair has finished on the Jet database, run Isinteg.exe in fix mode on
the same database that Edbutil or Eseutil was run on. Isinteg cleans up any
inconsistencies between the pointers from the information store to the actual
data in the Jet database. If Isinteg is not run immediately following repair,
corruption may occur in user mailboxes. Users will have messages that cannot be
opened, incorrect read/unread counts, and so forth. After running Edbutil or
Eseutil, make a FULL backup of the database that was repaired.

Refer to the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide for more details on
the use of Edbutil.exe and Isinteg.exe.

Troubleshoot the Problem
------------------------

If you are unable to resolve the problem by restoring from a backup or using
Edbutil.exe or Eseutil.exe, use the following steps to troubleshoot the problem.
After performing each step, check to see if the problem is resolved.

1. Restart the computer. If you do not want to restart the computer at this
  time, stop and restart the information store and directory services instead.
  To do so:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  b. Click Microsoft Exchange Directory, and then click Stop. If a dialog box
     appears stating that additional services will be stopped, note the
     services that will be stopped, and then click OK. The information store
     service should be included in the list of services that will be stopped.

  c. Click Microsoft Exchange Directory, and then click Start.

  d. Start any additional services that were stopped in step b, including the
     information store service.

2. Use the Chkdsk.exe utility to verify the integrity of your hard drives.

3. If the Exchsrvr folder is located on a compressed NTFS file system drive,
  uncompress the drive.

4. If write-back caching is enabled on a SCSI hard disk controller installed in
  your computer, verify that the cache is not volatile. Non-volatile caches are
  protected by a battery, Flash RAM, or some other method.

5. Disable any programs that keep files open for an extended period of time,
  such as anti-virus programs, file and disk management utilities, or backup
  programs. If disabling a program prevents the problem from occurring, verify
  that the program is completely compatible with Exchange Server before you
  enable it again.

6. Run Performance Optimizer (Perfwiz.exe) on the server.

7. Verify that the virtual memory settings in Windows NT Server are correct. To
  view the virtual memory settings, in Control Panel, double-click System,
  click the Performance tab, and then click Change.

8. If you are running any hard disk utilities obtained from your original
  equipment manufacturer (OEM), verify that you are running the most recent
  version of the programs.

9. Use the Performance Monitor counters associated with the following objects to
  detect potential problems:

   - Cache
   - Database
   - LogicalDisk
   - Memory
   - MSExchangeIS
   - Paging File
   - PhysicalDisk
   - Process
   - Server Work Queues
   - Server
   - System
   - Thread
