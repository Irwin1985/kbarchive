4. Running Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here

Here are some tips for trouble-free operation.

Microsoft Windows 95
If you did a Custom installation of Windows 95 be sure you installed
the following components: Paint, WordPad, Media Player, Desktop
Wallpaper.

Microsoft Plus!
If you have installed Microsoft Plus! some of the custom icons and mouse
pointers used in the Desktop Themes may not match some of the examples
shown in Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here which uses the standard icons
and mouse pointers of Windows 95.

Microsoft Access 2.0
Don't run Microsoft Access 2.0 while taking the course. If you run
Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here while Microsoft Access is running,
you may notice that the mouse moves sluggishly during demonstrations.
You may also notice a change in the display if your computer is set to
256 colors.

Microsoft WordPad
If WordPad is on your Start Menu or in the StartUp folder before you
start the course, Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here will remove it if you
go through "Customizing the Start Menu" in Unit 3 of the course.

Step By Step Topics that use WordPad
If you accidentally click outside the WordPad window when you are
supposed to be selecting text inside the window, you may not be able
to complete the topic. If this happens, click the Contents button to
return to the Contents screen, then press the GO BACK button.

WordPad Closes Automatically When You Start the Course
If you are editing a WordPad document when you start the course,
Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here will close WordPad and will not
save your document.

5. Shortcuts
Getting Help
If you're not sure what something on the screen is used for, try
right-clicking that item to display a popup menu and choose What's This.

How to Find Out Where You Are
If you're watching a movie, or are in the middle of a step by step
example, and you're not sure where you are within the course, click the
right mouse button and choose Topics Browser from the popup menu. The
Topics Browser dialog box will appear, and the topic you are working
with will be highlighted.

Interrupting Demos and Do-Its
You can stop a demo or Do-it by pressing Ctrl + Esc.

Don't Press Alt + Tab During Demos or Step by Steps
Pressing Alt + Tab during demos or step by step exercises may cause the
system to lock up. Pressing the Esc key will usually unlock your system,
but in some cases you may need to restart your computer.
