SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Rock Transformer in Magic School Bus
Explores the Earth (MSB Earth).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Rock Transformer is located in the back of the bus. It is on the wall to the
right of Arnold's rock collection and above the globe. Click the Rock
Transformer to activate it. Keesha helps you use the Rock Transformer. Click on
her at any time for help.

When you click the Rock transformer, the Rock Box appears on the floor next to
Keesha. Choose different items in the box by clicking the left and right arrows
in the lid. To transform something, click it and drag it above the Rock
Transformer. Click once again to drop it into the Transformer. If the rock or
object contains something that can be changed into other substances, the
Transformer displays it, and Keesha tells you what it is.

If it cannot be changed, Keesha lets you know. Only some rocks can be
transformed; there are many rocks that are not transformable.

Once a rock or object is transformed, you can drop it into your rock box, or you
can transform it back by dropping it back into the Rock Transformer.

Use the Retriever Arm to pick up rocks or other objects, then use the Transformer
to see what they're made of. (See the "How to Use the Retriever Arm" section.)

A good example of this is in the Schoolyard. Use the Retriever Arm to pick up
junk in the yard. If the arm picks up a pencil, take it to the bus, and drop it
into the Rock Transformer. The Rock Transformer transforms the pencil into one
of its constituent parts: graphite.

NOTE: The rocks that are available in the box are selected randomly each time you
play MSB Earth. Not all rocks are available at all times.

How to Use the Retriever Arm
----------------------------

The Retriever Arm is activated by clicking the red handle located in the front of
the bus between the gear shift and the steering levers. When the Retriever Arm
is activated, you will see it begin to dig immediately in front of the bus. Once
the Retriever Arm is finished digging, you will see a piece of dirt with an item
in it appear in the box immediately to the right of the gear shift. At this
point you can click either the Garbage Can icon or the Rock Box icon immediately
underneath the item. Clicking the Garbage Can icon discards the item. Clicking
the Rock Box icon places the item in the Rock Box in the back of the bus. Some
items can't be placed in the Rock Box and must be thrown away.
