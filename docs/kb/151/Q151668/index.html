-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to create a New Dirsync Requestor object on an Exchange Server,
the administrator receives the following error:

  "An error occurred while processing an e-mail address. To view details of the
  error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer on the
  Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID No: c1030b35"

This error indicates that more information can be found in the Event Viewer;
however, the application log in Event Viewer reveals no information related to
this error.

CAUSE
=====

There is already a Hidden Recipient, $SYSTEM, in the Directory that corresponds
to the Dirsync Server that has been selected. For instance, when a New Dirsync
Requestor object is created, the administrator is asked to specify the Dirsync
Server (must choose "Non MSMail Dirsync Server" or the correct MS Mail PO from a
list). If the administrator chooses the MS Mail PO called "NETWORK1/PO1" from
the list, completes the configuration, accepts the default for Dirsync Address
on the General tab, and clicks "OK", then the error above will occur if there is
already a Hidden Recipient with a Directory Name of MS:Network1/PO1/$System in
the Directory on that Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

These Hidden Recipients may be viewed by selecting the Recipients container and
then clicking on View-Hidden Recipients. The Hidden Recipient can be deleted,
and the error should no longer occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are a couple of scenarios where this error is known to occur:

- If a Dirsync Requestor object pointing to the same Dirsync Server had already
  been added and then deleted on this Exchange Server, or

- If the PO that has been specified as the Dirsync Server has already been
  specified as a Requestor in the organization. In other words, if a Remote
  Requestor object has already been created on an Exchange Server that has a
  DXA Server object, then a $SYSTEM Hidden Recipient would already exist. Note:
  This is not a valid configuration, since there should only be a single
  Exchange Server in the Organization with either a DXA Server or Dirsync
  Requestor object.
