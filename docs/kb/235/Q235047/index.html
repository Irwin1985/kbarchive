LOC Page: Name And Address For Online Press Has Changed

Please replace the text in green on the LOC page with the following text:

"A Quick Course Education/Training Edition for this title is published by Online
Training Solutions, Inc. (OTSI). For information about supplementary workbooks,
contact OTSI at 15422 Bel-Red Road, Redmond, WA 98052, USA. 1-800-854-3344.

Page 28: Graphic And Procedure Are Incorrect
--------------------------------------------

Due to software changes, the graphic and the procedure on page 28 are inaccurate.
The graphic of the Warning Dialog Box, on the bottom of the page should be
deleted and steps 3 and 4 in the procedure should be changed to the following:

3. Next type What_We_Provide.htm as the new name and then press Enter.

4. If FrontPage displays a dialog box to prevent you from accidentally breaking
the links, click Yes to have FrontPage update all links that point to New_Page_2
so that they now point to What_We_Provide.


Page 30: Graphic Is Incorrect
-----------------------------

Due to a change in the software after the first printing of this book, the
graphic on page 30 is no longer accurate. This graphic may not match your
computer screen.


Page 83: Step 2 Is Incorrect
----------------------------

Please change step 2 to read:

"Click an icon for a frame type..."


Page 104: Graphic Has Changed
-----------------------------

Due to a change in the software after the first printing of this book, the
graphic on page 104 is no longer accurate. This graphic may not match your
computer screen.


Page 105: Procedure Has Changed
-------------------------------

In the first sentence of step 6, change:

"...click OK and then click Cancel to close the Options dialog box."

To:
"...click Yes and then click Cancel to close the Options dialog box."


Page 139: Procedure Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

Change the last sentence of step 2 to read:

"...and an active instance that displays a new, empty page of the Tour
Descriptions Page web."


Page 148: Procedure Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

Change step 7 to read:

"Insert the GeneratedBy variable from the drop-down list of the Substitution
Properties dialog box. This variable displays how the page was created."


Page 151: Procedure Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

Change step 4, at the bottom of the page, to read:

"If necessary, turn on the left navigation bar by choosing Shaded Borders from
the Format menu, clicking the Selected Page option, clicking the Left check box
to deselect it, and clicking OK."
