Questions and Answers
---------------------

1. Q: Where can I find technical information about VBCE?

A: There are a number of places to look for documentation on VBCE. In addition to
the Windows CE Toolkit online help available from the Visual Basic Help menu,
you can also check the following resources:

   - The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains many articles discussing topics
     related to VBCE. To search for them, navigate to the following Microsoft
     Web site, enter the search phrase "VBCE" (without the quotation marks) and
     include Knowledge Base in the selected scope:

  MSDN Online

   - The VBCE Release Notes contain lots of information on known issues. Many
     commonly-asked questions about specific behavior can be found in this
     document. In addition to the file installed with VBCE, the release notes
     can be found in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q217375 INFO: Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 Release Notes

   - The MSDN Online Library now has a number of areas with technical articles,
     presentations, downloads and online special interest groups related to
     VBCE:

  MSDN Library Online

See:
    \Windows CE Documentation
       \Visual Development Environment
          \Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0

  Microsoft Windows CE Toolkits Home Page

   - Scott Lewis' VBCE.COM is also a very good source for information. Scott
     also has a mailing list set up for peer-to-peer support available from
     this site. NOTE: VBCE.COM is not affiliated with Microsoft other than it
     refers to a Microsoft product:

  VBCE.COM

   - Larry Roof's "Visual Basic Windows CE Programming" by Wrox Press, although
     written for the first version of VBCE, is still a great resource.
     Additionally, I believe that Larry Roof and Scott Lewis will be teaming up
     for some technical content as outlined on VBCE.COM.

2. Q: What other products do I need in order to use VBCE 6.0?

A: In order to use VBCE 6.0, you'll need the following:

   - Microsoft Windows 95 or later or Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or
     later.
   - Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Professional or Enterprise Edition.

Note that Windows NT or Windows 2000 is required for emulation.

3. Q: Does VBCE provide database programmability?

A: VBCE is able to provide database programmability via the ActiveX Data Objects
control for the Microsoft Windows CE operating system (ADOCE), which provides a
subset of ADO for Windows CE. The setup program for ADOCE is included on the
VBCE 6.0 CD in the ADOCE directory.

Here are some important notes regarding the two current versions of ADOCE:

   - ADOCE 2.0 only works on an H/PC 2.0 device that runs Windows CE 2.0.
   - ADOCE 2.0 does not support automatic Database Table Synchronization
     between the database tables on the desktop and the device.
   - ADOCE 2.1 only works on H/PC Pro 3.0 devices (running Windows CE 2.11),
     Palm-size PC 1.2 devices (running Windows CE 2.11 and with the Palm-size
     PC 1.2 SDK installed), and the H/PC devices with ROM upgrades (that is,
     running Windows CE 2.11).
   - ADOCE 2.1 supports automatic Database Table Synchronization.

4. Q: Where can I find technical information about ADOCE?

A: There are a number of places to look for documentation on ADOCE. In addition
to the Windows CE Toolkit online help available from the Visual Basic Help menu,
you can also check the following resources:

   - The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains many articles discussing topics
     related to ADOCE. To search for them, navigate to the following Microsoft
     Web site, enter the search phrase "ADOCE " (without the quotation
     marks)and include Knowledge Base in the selected scope:

  MSDN Online

   - The MSDN Online Library now has a number of areas with technical articles,
     presentations, downloads, and online special interest groups related to
     ADOCE:

  MSDN Library Online

See:
    \Windows CE Documentation
       \Visual Development Environment
          \ADO for Windows CE

  Microsoft Windows CE Toolkits Home Page

   - Scott Lewis' VBCE.COM is also a very good source for information. Scott
     has also got a mailing list set up for peer-to-peer support available from
     this site. NOTE: VBCE.COM is not affiliated with Microsoft other than it
     refers to a Microsoft product:

  VBCE.COM

5. Q: Does ADOCE work in the emulation environment?

ADOCE does work in the emulation environment. You'll need to ensure that you
install the emulation components as a part of the ADOCE SDK installation from
the VBCE 6.0 CD-ROM. You'll also need to ensure that you have copied your
database tables to the emulation environment by using the EmpFile utility. For
an illustration of how to do this, please see the EmulDB sample that ships with
the ADOCE SDK. This sample is located, by default, in the following location:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\ADOCE\Samples\VB

For additional information about the EmpFile utility, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q212884 INFO: VBCE: How to Use the EmpFile Utility

6. Q: Can I develop VBCE applications for Palm-size PCs?

A: Palm-size PCs can be targeted with VBCE 6.0. The target Palm-size PCs must be
running at least the Windows CE operating system version 2.11. Please note that
the implementation of the Windows CE operating system on the Palm-size PC
devices running the Windows CE operating system version 2.0 does not include
sufficient COM support for VBCE applications.

In order to target Palm-size PCs, the associated Windows CE Palm-size PC Platform
SDK is required:

  Palm-size PC 1.2 SDK Download (English)

For additional information about the Palm-size PC's support for VBCE
applications, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191478 INFO: Palm-size PC Does Not Support VBCE Applications

7. Q: For which Windows CE platforms can I develop VBCE applications?

A: VBCE 6.0 can currently target the following Windows CE platforms using the
Platform SDKs provided by Microsoft:

   - Handheld PC version 2.0 (H/PC)

   - Handheld PC version 3.0 (H/PC Pro)

   - Palm-size PC version 1.2 (PsPC)

For additional information, please see the following Microsoft Web site:

  Hardware Devices, Software Development Kits (SDKs)

Also, please note that VBCE 5.0 applications can only be created for H/PC
devices.

8. Q: Are ActiveX controls supported in VBCE? Where can I get them?

A: Yes. ActiveX is supported in Windows CE and you can use ActiveX controls in
your VBCE applications. Currently, however, you cannot develop ActiveX controls
using VBCE. Instead, you must use the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ (VCCE)
for ActiveX control development.

Additionally, there are a growing number of third-party companies that are either
developing or looking into developing ActiveX controls for use in VBCE. See one
of Microsoft's Windows CE Web sites for the most current information:

  Microsoft Windows CE Home Page

  Microsoft Windows CE Toolkits

9. Q: Are the same Visual Basic controls supported in VBCE?

A: Most Visual Basic intrinsic controls (such as CheckBoxes, TextBoxes,
CommandButtons) are supported in VBCE. There are some differences in control
appearance and behavior corresponding to differences in the Windows CE user
interface model, however, and there are also differences in the Visual Basic
built-in functions corresponding to differences in operating system features.
For the most part, you will find that creating VBCE applications is very similar
to creating Visual Basic applications on Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT.

10. Q: Can I use Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me to develop VBCE
  applications?

Yes. The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 can be installed on Windows 95,
Windows 98, or Windows Me to develop Windows CE applications. The emulation
environment, however, is available only under Windows NT or Windows 2000.
Additionally, it is important to note that Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic
5.0 cannot be installed on a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me machine.

11. Q: Can existing Visual Basic applications be ported to VBCE?

A: You cannot directly port an existing Visual Basic application into VBCE due to
some limitations and unsupported features in VBCE. The amount of work required
to "port" an existing Visual Basic desktop application to VBCE will depend on
many factors, including the complexity of the application and whether it uses
features not supported in VBCE. It may be significantly easier to create a VBCE
application from scratch than to port an existing Visual Basic application.

  Q189478 INFO: What Does VBCE Have That Visual Basic 5 Doesn't Have?

  Q192459 INFO: Unsupported Controls, Properties, Methods and Events

12. Q: How do I debug VBCE applications?

A: There are two methods of debugging available for VBCE users. The first is to
use the emulation environment to debug your application right on your Windows NT
development workstation. The second is to use the remote debugging tools
provided with the Toolkit. These tools let you execute your VBCE application
remotely on your Windows CE device, while at the same time monitoring and
controlling its execution from your Windows NT or Windows 2000 development
workstation.

  Q192998 INFO: VBCE: Differences Between Emulation and the Remote Device

13. Q: How do I distribute my VBCE application?

A: Distribution of VBCE applications can be accomplished using the Application
Install Wizard supplied with VBCE.

article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194837 HOWTO: Distribute a Visual Basic Windows CE Application

14. Q: Can I access Pocket Outlook contacts, tasks, and so forth from VBCE?

A: Using the new Pocket Outlook Object Model (POOM) you can now read, create, and
modify items used by the Pocket Outlook's Calendar, Tasks, and Contacts, as well
as accessing and creating cities used by the World Clock.

In order to access Pocket Outlook objects, the Pocket Outlook Object Model (POOM)
SDK is required:

  Pocket Outlook Object Model (POOM) SDK

For additional information about using the POOM from VBCE, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q208568 HOWTO: Access Pocket Outlook Objects from VBCE

15. Q: Can I call APIs in VBCE applications?

A: The current version of VBCE allows you to call many Windows CE API functions
directly. You can use the existing Visual Basic API Text Viewer to view the API
information from the winceapi.txt file. In certain circumstances, because VBCE
does not support structure data type, you may still need to use the Windows CE
Toolkit for Visual C++ (VCCE) to create an ActiveX control to wrap the
appropriate API calls and then host the control in VBCE.

Please note that API calls could not be made from VBCE 5.0 applications.

16. Q: Do I need a Windows CE device to run VBCE?

A: You do not need a device to begin developing VBCE applications. You can create
and debug Windows CE-based applications from your desktop. Built-in emulation
technology provides the look and function of a device, right on your PC.

It should be noted that in order to install ADOCE, Windows CE Services is
required. Windows CE Services only ships with the devices. So although ADOCE
will work in the emulation environment, currently it cannot be installed without
the presence of Windows CE Services.

17. I'm confused. Which devices and platforms will VBCE 6.0 and ADOCE run on?

A: The following table lists what is supported and what is not:
