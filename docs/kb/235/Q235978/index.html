The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides general information about applying service packs for
Microsoft Exchange Server. This information can help you avoid problems that may
arise during the installation process and help make the installation process as
smooth as possible. The following topics are discussed:

- Before applying a service pack
- Applying a service pack

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before Applying a Service Pack
------------------------------

Before you apply a service pack for Exchange Server:

- Stop all Exchange Server services. To stop a service:

  1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  2. Click the service you want to stop, and then click Stop. If a dialog box
     appears stating that additional services will be stopped, click OK.
     Otherwise, click Yes.

  NOTE: The Exchange Server services are normally stopped automatically while
  the service pack is being applied. However, in some cases, the Update program
  is unable to stop one or more services. Stopping the services before you
  apply the service pack may prevent this problem from occurring.

- Verify that the server is not being monitored using Performance Monitor. The
  server may be monitored by an instance of Performance Monitor running on the
  same server, or on a different server on the network. If the server is being
  monitored, quit Performance Monitor.

- Verify that the server is not being monitored using a server monitor. If the
  server is being monitored, stop the server monitor.

- End any other connections to the server, such as Simple Network Management
  Protocol (SNMP) connections or connections made by e-mail clients,
  uninterruptible power supply (UPS) programs, or the Windows NT User Manager.

Applying a Service Pack
-----------------------

While you are applying a service pack, you may be prompted to overwrite an
existing file on your hard disk. When this occurs, you should only overwrite the
existing file if the new file is a later version. If the new file is not a later
version, you should not overwrite the existing file.

In addition, a message may be displayed indicating that the Update program could
not copy a file to your hard disk because an existing file is already open. When
this occurs, you may be able to work around the problem by renaming the existing
file on your hard disk, and then clicking Retry.


For information about problems that may occur if the server is being monitored
using a server monitor while you are applying a service pack, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
