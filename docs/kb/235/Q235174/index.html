SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Protocol (IP) security in Microsoft Windows 2000 can cause some
connection issues when you try to establish a remote control session. If IP
security is enabled on a server, client, or both, you may experience an initial
timeout when you try to connect to a client through remote control. It may
appear as though the remote control session is unable to establish a connection.
Multiple attempts are made, resulting in a connection failure, with the user
prompted to retry or cancel. This issue is somewhat random, and its frequency
can vary depending on how IP security is configured on the server or client.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue and establish a remote control session, follow these
steps:

1. Ping server-to-client or client-to-server with the command prompt ping
  utility to allow IP security to establish a connection.

2. When the remote control session fails to establish a connection, retry
  several times to allow IP security to establish a connection.

3. Use the "nbtstat -a &lt;client name&gt;" command to view information about
  the computer.

  This command fails until an IP security connection is established, after
  which, information about the computer is displayed.

NOTE: After a connection is successfully established between a server and client,
it should not be necessary to repeat these steps every time a remote control
session is attempted between the two computers, because the IP Sec information
is cached until shortly after the connection is dropped.
