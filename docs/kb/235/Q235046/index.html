SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Microsoft Publisher 2000 Step by Step, ISBN
1-57231-987-9.

The following topics are covered:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 193: Orphan And Widow Definitions Not Entirely Accurate
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 193 the definition of Widow and Orphan are not entirely accurate. The
Computer Dictionary contains the more accurate definitions below.

Widow: A last line of a paragraph, shorter than a full line, appearing at the top
of a page.

Orphan: The first line of a paragraph printed alone at the bottom of a page or
column of text, or the last line of a paragraph printed alone at the top of a
page or column.

The definition of Orphan can be changed to reflect this additional information.

Change:
"The first line of a paragraph appears on its own at the bottom of a column or
page. Can be corrected by adjusting character, line, or paragraph spacing."

To:
"The first line of a paragraph appears on its own at the bottom of a column or
page, or the last line of a paragraph appears alone at the top of a page or
column. Can be corrected by adjusting character, line, or paragraph spacing."


Last Page: Software Not Included With Book
------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Publisher 2000 software is not included with the title "Microsoft
Publisher 2000 Step by Step."

Please change the first paragraph on the last page to read:

"The enclosed CD-ROM contains ready-to-use practice files that complement the
lessons in this book. To use the CD, you'll need either the Windows 95, Windows
98, or the Windows NT version 4 operating system. You will also need to be
running Microsoft Publisher 2000."


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
