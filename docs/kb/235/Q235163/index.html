- Page 67: "Property Let" Should Be "Property Set"

- Page 71: "m_FileType" Should Be "FileType"

- Page 148: Incorrect Statement Regarding ADO

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 53: First "KeyPress" Should Be "KeyDown"
---------------------------------------------

On page 53, under "using Events for Field-Level Validation", change:

"As with the form-level validation, you can use a control's KeyPress, KeyUp, and
KeyPress events."

To:

"As with the form-level validation, you can use a control's KeyDown, KeyUp, and
KeyPress events."


Page 67: "Property Let" Should Be "Property Set"
------------------------------------------------

On page 67, in the code sample under the Property Set section,

Change:
"Public Property Let ClipArt(EmbeddedBitmap As Object)"

To:
"Public Property Set ClipArt(EmbeddedBitmap As Object)"


Page 71: "m_FileType" Should Be "FileType"
------------------------------------------

On page 71, in the second code sample paragraph,

Change:
"m_FileType = ft"

To:
"FileType = ft"


Page 148: Incorrect Statement Regarding ADO
-------------------------------------------

Change:
"ADO combines the best of RDO and ADO and will eventually replace them."

To:
"ADO combines the best of RDO and DAO and will eventually replace them."


Page 212: Correction To "Read Uncommitted Isolation Level" Section
------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 212, under "Read Uncommitted Isolation Level", the read committed
isolation level is incorrectly identified as the least restrictive isolation
level.

Change:
"The read committed isolation level is the SQL Server default, and is the least
restrictive of the four isolation levels. Using the read committed isolation
level makes it possible to read uncommitted or dirty data."

To:
"The read uncommitted isolation level is the least restrictive of the four
isolation levels. Using the read uncommitted isolation level makes it possible
to read uncommitted or dirty data."

The phrase "The read committed isolation level is the SQL Server default." should
become the first sentence in the second paragraph under "Read Committed
Isolation Level" on page 211.


Page 217: Keyset-Driven Client-Side Cursors Not Supported
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 217, in the second paragraph under "Client-Side Cursors", the words
"keyset-driven" need to be removed from the first sentence, as keyset-driven
client-side cursors are not supported by SQL Server.

Change: "If a large number of rows (or records) are returned, static and
keyset-driven client-side cursors place a significant load on a workstation."

To: "If a large number of rows (or records) are returned, static client-side
cursors place a significant load on a workstation."


Page 245: Incorrect Information About SQL Debugging Server Location
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 245, in the third bulleted item,

Change:
"Installed the SQL Debugging Server from the Supplemental Course Material CD-ROM
that accompanies this book."

To:
"Installed the SQL Debugging Server from the Visual Basic Enterprise Setup
CD-ROMs."


Page 260: Error In The Code
---------------------------

On page 260, in the code at the top of the page, change the Where clause as
follows.

Change:
"WHERE @pubname = p.pub_name"

To:
"WHERE p.pub_name = @pubname"


Page 262: Information In Note Is Incorrect
------------------------------------------

The note on page 262 should read:

"You must run the Microsoft SQL Debugging Server Setup on your server computer
prior to debugging a stored procedure using the T-SQL debugger. The SQL
Debugging Server Setup file is located in the \SQDBG_SS folder on the Visual
Basic Enterprise Setup CD-ROMs."


Page 301: Correction To Code Sample
-----------------------------------

On page 301, the sample always returns a value of 1. Please replace the existing
code with the following:

  CREATE PROCEDURE SetRoomStatus
  (
  	@RoomNumber varchar(20) = '0',
  	@RetCode int OUTPUT
  )
  AS
  If Exists (SELECT Available
  	FROM Rooms
  	WHERE RoomID = @RoomNumber
  	AND Available = 1)
  BEGIN
  	UPDATE Rooms
  	SET Available = 0
  	WHERE RoomID = @RoomNumber
  	SET @RetCode = 1
  END
  ELSE
  BEGIN
  	SET @RetCode = 0
  END
  RETURN @RetCode
