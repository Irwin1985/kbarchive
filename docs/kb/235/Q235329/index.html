SUMMARY
=======

In some cases you may need to change many custom recipients of one type, for
example Microsoft Mail (MS Mail), to another type of custom recipient, like
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). This article outlines the steps to change
a group of MS Mail custom recipients to SMTP custom recipients.

To change a group of MS Mail custom recipients to SMTP custom recipients:

1. Export the MS Mail custom recipients to a .csv file that contains all of the
  pertinent headers. You can find a copy of a .csv file that is designed to
  export custom recipients on the Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 CD in
  the Support\Samples\Csvs\Custom\Custom.csv folder.

2. Use Microsoft Excel to open the .csv file that you created in step 1.

3. Select the entire file, and sort it by the E-mail Address header.

4. If you only want to change a subset of these custom recipients, delete all of
  the rows except the rows that you want from this file.

5. Delete the E-mail Addresses column.

6. Under the E-mail Address column, delete all of the existing e-mail addresses.
  The addresses are in the following MS Mail format:

  MS:&lt;network&gt;/&lt;postoffice&gt;/&lt;user&gt;

7. Type the primary SMTP addresses in the E-mail Address column in the following
  format:

  SMTP:&lt;alias&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;.com

8. Delete the Imported-From, Obj-Container, and Obj-Dist-Name columns, if they
  exist.

9. Save this .csv file to a different name.

10. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program and on the Tools menu, click
  Directory Import to import the .csv file that you saved in step 9 to the
  target Recipients container.

If you do not have the Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 CD, the sample .csv
files are available in a file that you can download. The following file is
available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
