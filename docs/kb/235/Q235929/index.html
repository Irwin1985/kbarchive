The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 3.0SP4, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An APPC application configured to use SNA Server's Single Sign-On (SSO)
Privileged Proxy feature may fail to connect to the host if the primary domain
controller (PDC) where the primary Host Account Cache (HAC) is running becomes
unavailable. The APPC application will receive an error message indicating an
invalid User ID or Password was used when the problem occurs. For example, an
ALLOCATE issued by an APPC application may fail with an error code of 080F6051
(AP_SECURITY_NOT_VALID).

NOTE: Applications using the standard SSO (not Privileged Proxy) feature may
experience a similar problem if the fix described in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article is not applied:

  Q235381 SNA Server Access Violation While Determining Proxy Privilege

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Host Security DLL (Snasii.dll) was originally designed to issue a
GetDCName() call to locate a Windows NT Domain Controller so that it can
determine what Windows NT groups the User ID specified by the application
belongs to so that it can verify if the application's user context is authorized
to make the request. The GetDCName() call always returns the name of the Windows
NT PDC. The update discussed in article Q235381 includes a change such that the
host security DLL calls GetAnyDCName() to do this same function. The
GetAnyDCname() call returns the names of backup domain controllers (BDCs) as
well as the PDC. The problem is that this call fails if the PDC is not
available.

If the PDC is not available, the GetAnyDCName() fails, so the host security DLL
is not able to verify if the application's user context is authorized to make
the request that was received. The result is the invalid User ID or Password
error being returned to the application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure the PDC for the Windows NT domain is available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2. This problem was
first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Host Security DLL is updated to call NetServerEnum() if the GetAnyDCName()
fails. The NetServerEnum&lt;A0&gt;() call does successfully return if the PDC is not
available.


The Host Security DLL is also updated to allow it to reconnect to a backup HAC if
the primary HAC it is communicating with fails for some reason. With this update
applied, the Host Security DLL can switch from the primary HAC to a backup HAC
if the primary goes down. It can also locate a backup HAC at startup, even if
the primary HAC is not running. This "hot backup" feature has the following
requirements:

- The backup HAC databases must be running on BDCs. The Host Security DLL only
  looks for DCs. It does not look for Windows NT member servers.
- A backup HAC database is useful only if it has been able to contact the
  primary HAC database to read its initial copy of the account database. All
  backup HAC services delete their copy of the HAC database when they are
  stopped.
