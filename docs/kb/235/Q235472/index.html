-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you choose not to install the Host Account Synchronization Service during the
SNA Server Setup process, but later decide to add it by running the Setup
program again, this service will default into the Local System Account.

If you choose to install the Host Account Synchronization Service during the
initial SNA Server Setup process, this service gets installed in the same
Windows NT User Account as all the other SNA Services (such as SNABase,
SnaServer, and so on).

Because all Host Security Services (Host Account Cache, Windows NT Account
Synchronization, and Host Account Synchronization) must be installed in the same
Windows NT User Account for authentication purposes, failures may occur when
password changes are initiated from either Windows NT or host systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

In Control Panel, double-click Services, and select the SNA Host Account
Synchronization Service. Change the account information to match that of the
other two Host Security Services, (SNA Windows NT Account Synchronization and
SNA Host Account Synchronization).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1
and 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For authentication purposes, all host security services in all communicating
Windows NT domains must run in the same Windows NT account. This applies also to
the Host Account Cache and Windows NT Account Synchronization Service, which are
installed from the host security Setup program, and also the Host Account
Synchronization service, which is installed from the SNA Server Setup program.
The account name must be unique in all Windows NT domains. For example, the
account name "Administrator" is already used in each Windows NT domain, and is
not unique.

The SNA Server Setup program includes a Service Account dialog box when
installing the Host Account Synchronization Service if selected after SNA Server
has already been installed.
