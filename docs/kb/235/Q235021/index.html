MORE INFORMATION
================

LOC page: Name And Address Of Online Press Has Changed
------------------------------------------------------

Online Press has merged with another company and now has a new name and address.
Please replace the text in green on the LOC page with the following text:

"A Quick Course Education/Training Edition for this title is published by Online
Training Solutions, Inc. (OTSI). For information about supplementary workbooks,
contact OTSI at 15422 Bel-Red Road, Redmond, WA 98052, USA. 1-800-854-3344.
E-mail: quickcourse@otsiweb.com."


Page 44: Step 3 Is Incomplete
-----------------------------

On page 44, step 3 in the first procedure is incomplete. Change it to read:

"Click the Italic button. (You may need to use the move handles to display it.)
The headings are now shown in both bold and italic."


Page 53: Step 2 Is Incorrect
----------------------------

On page 53, change the last part of step 2, in the first procedure to:

"...and then click the Format Painter button on the Standard toolbar."


Page 76: Procedure In Step 4 Is Incomplete
------------------------------------------

On page 76, reword step 4 in the second procedure to say:

"Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 to create Total names for the four sheets."


Page 84: Step 1 Is Incomplete
-----------------------------

On page 84, change step 1 to:

"Save the workbook, press Ctrl+Home, and then choose Save As Web Page from the
File menu to display this dialog box:"


Page 85: Step 5 Is Uunclear
---------------------------

On page 85, change the first sentence in step 5 to:

"Finally, check that the path in the file Name edit box reflects the location
where you want to store the HTML file, click the Open Published Web Page in
Browser check box to select it."


Page 104: Procedure Is Uunclear
-------------------------------

An important action is missing from step 1 on this page. Change the second
sentence in step 1 to:

"Then choose Chart Options from the shortcut menu and click the Titles tab to
display this dialog box:"


Page 128: Third Step 2 Contains Error
-------------------------------------

The third step 2, at the bottom of this page is inconsistent with the interface.
In the first sentence, change:
"four dialog boxes"

To:
"three dialog boxes."


Page 138: Procedure And Graphic Are Incorrect
---------------------------------------------

On page 138, in step 5, change the last sentence to:

"...the amounts in columns C, D, and F."

In the graphic below this, some of the amounts in column F are incorrect: F6=$15,
F9=$33, F11=$26, F13=$54 and F14=$16. Therefore, the graphic on this page will
not match your screen.

comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
