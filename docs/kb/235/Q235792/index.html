-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing a long filename file on a computer running Microsoft Windows 95
using the Install File script item with version checking, the file name is
truncated to the 8.3 format when installed. Note that it is not converted to a
legal short file name or alias, but rather truncated at the eighth position in
the file name.

For example, if the source file name is "FolioCacheCleaner.DLL", the file at
destination becomes "Foliocac.dll", even though %MAINDIR%\FolioCacheCleaner.DLL
was specified for the destination in the Install File script item dialog box.

Also note that if the file is self-registering, the long file name is referenced
in the Install.log and you receive an error message stating that the file was
unable to self-register because a file of that name does not exist at the
destination.

The following is a sample Install.log file that shows this:

  ***  Installation Started 5/21/99 4:45:18  ***				
  Title: Untitled Installation				
  Source: C:\WINDOWS\DESKTOP\UNTITLED.EXE				
  File Copy: C:\TEST\ThisIsALongFileName.txt				
  File Copy: C:\TEST\FolioCacheCleaner.dll				
  Could not Self-Register: C:\TEST\FolioCacheCleaner.dll				

Using the example above after the installation is completed, C:\TEST contains the
following files:

- Install.log

- ThisIsALongFileName.txt (correctly copied, because it contains no version
  information)

- foliocac.dll (the DLL was not self-registered)

Note that this problem does not occur if version checking is not taking place, or
the long filename file does not have version information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not use version checking if installing files
with version information that has long file names. Instead, specify Always in
the replacement options drop-down list for the Install File script item
installing the long file name file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0.64 to create a new
  script.

2. Add an Install File script item. For the source, specify a file that has a
  long file name (no spaces) and has version information (such as a DLL).

3. Select the Self Register check box if this file is self-registering. NOTE:
  This is not necessary for reproducing the problem, but illustrates the
  additional effect of problem.

4. Under Replacement Options, choose If version number same or older.

5. Compile and run the script. View the Install.log and destination file names.
