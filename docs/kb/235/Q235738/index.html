The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the released version of Microsoft's Systems Management Server version 2.0,
when Smsapm32 (Systems Management Server Advertised Program Manager) attempts to
restart a computer where the logged on user does not have rights, Smsapm32 fails
to restart the computer.

If the local user is logged on as Domain1\UserA and they do not have the right
Shut Down the System granted to them, then when APM attempts to restart the
computer, it will fail. The administrator may see the following in the
Smsmon32.log or LO_ file.

  "IPC PIPE : Return code = 0x552; A required privilege is not held by the
  client.~~; Reboot request"

This is likely to occur whether the program is scheduled to run with or without a
user logged in. If the program is scheduled to run without the users
credentials, the program will run using the Smsclitoken&amp; account. The
problem is caused by the Smsmon32 (Systems Management Server Advertised Programs
Monitor) which is dependent on the user's credentials. Therefore, if the user
doesn't have rights to shut down the system, then neither will Smsmon32.

Smsapm32 now has the ability to restart when the program requires it even though
the currently logged on user may not have the appropriate rights. Security has
been placed on the shutdown event so that only administrators can invoke it.

Smsapm32 will make an attempt to restart a client workstation once it receives
the notification from Smsmon32 that the user has been logged off. Smsmon32 is
responsible for logging off the user if the user does not have the rights to
shut down the workstation. Smsapm32 will try every 10 seconds for up to 5
minutes to restart the system. If the retries never find the system in a logged
out state after 5 minutes, Smsapm32 will terminate. The client service on the
client will restart Smsapm32 later.
