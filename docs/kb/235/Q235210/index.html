  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot successfully remove or reinstall a Client Access Point (CAP) and the
CAP server eventually reports critical system status. You view messages for the
SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service in the Component Status folder, and see
messages similar to the following:

  SMS Site Component Manager failed to deinstall all SMS server components from
  site system "\\servername".

  SMS Site Component Manager failed to reinstall this component on this site
  system.

If logging is enabled for the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service, entries similar
to the following are found in the Sms\Logs\Sitecomp.Log file:

  Starting service SMS_SERVER_BOOTSTRAP_RIVIERA with command-line arguments
  "RE0 E:\SMS /deinstall \\LUXOR\E$\SMS\bin\i386\smsexecd.exe"...
  Execution of "\\LUXOR\E$\SMS\bin\i386\smsexecd.exe /deinstall
  /siteserver:RIVIERA" on server LUXOR failed: The file
  "\\LUXOR\E$\SMS\bin\i386\smsexecd.exe" does not exist.
  Bootstrap operation failed.
  Deinstalled service SMS_SERVER_BOOTSTRAP_RIVIERA.
  Bootstrap operations aborted.
  Deinstallation failed and will be retried in the next polling cycle.

  Could not start service SMS_SERVER_BOOTSTRAP_LUXOR. The operating system
  reported error 997: Overlapped I/O operation is in progress.
  Bootstrap operation failed.

If you attempt to reinstall the CAP at this point, the sitecomp.log may show
errors similar to the following:

  Installed service SMS_SERVER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERNAME.
  Starting service SMS_SERVER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERNAME with command-line arguments
  "TOP E:\SMS /deinstall \\SERVERNAME\E$\SMS\bin\i386\smsexecd.exe"...
  Execution of "\\SERVERNAME\E$\SMS\bin\i386\smsexecd.exe /deinstall
  /siteserver:SERVERNAME" on server SERVERNAME failed: Win32 GetShortPathName()
  failed for path "\\SERVERNAME\E$\SMS\bin\i386\smsexecd.exe". Win32
  GetLastError() returned error 2.
  Bootstrap operation failed.
  Deinstalled service SMS_SERVER_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERNAME.
  Bootstrap operations aborted.
  Deinstallation failed and will be retried in the next polling cycle.

CAUSE
=====

If the SMS folder (or any of its subfolders or files) has been removed from the
CAP server, the SMS site component manager may be unable to deinstall (remove)
or reinstall the CAP properly.

Specifically, Site Component Manager cannot find the Smsexecd.exe file on the CAP
server. The Smsexecd.exe is used by the SMS Server Bootstrap to reinstall or
remove the SMS Executive service on the CAP. If this file is not found on the
CAP, the bootstrap service is unable to complete removal or installation of the
CAP.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, follow these steps.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. If a recent backup of the SMS directory exists, restore the SMS folder to the
  CAP. Stop and restart the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service on the Site
  Server to force a Site Component Manager update cycle.

  In some cases the Site Component Manager will still be unable to remove
  (deinstall) or reinstall the CAP. In this situation, remove the CAP role from
  the server (if reinstallation is being attempted). The Site Component Manager
  will attempt to remove the CAP role from the CAP server for 1440 minutes (24
  hours), and then it will time out. After the Site Component Manager has timed
  out, the errors will cease and you can attempt reinstallation can be
  attempted if you want to. If a 24-hour wait is not feasible, proceed to step
  2.

2. If a 24-hour wait is not feasible, the removal timeout process can be
  accelerated by modifying an SMS registry key.

  To accelerate the CAP removal timeout, modify the following registry value:

  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER\Component
  Servers\SERVERNAME\Deinstallation Start Time

  Change the value of Deinstallation Start Time to 1. Stop and restart the
  SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service on the Site Server to force a Site
  Component Manager update cycle.

The Site Component Manager log should indicate the deinstallation process has
timed out as follows:

  Bootstrap operation failed.
  Deinstalled service SMS_SERVER_BOOTSTRAP_NETLKWI02.
  Bootstrap operations aborted.
  Deinstallation failed. Deinstall retry interval of 1440 minutes exceeded.
  Component assumed to be deinstalled; deinstallation will not be retried.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
