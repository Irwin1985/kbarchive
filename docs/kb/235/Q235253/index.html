The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 2000 Developer 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the recommended procedures for organizing files and
Visual SourceSafe (VSS) projects for use with the Office 2000 VBA Source Code
Control Add-in in a multiuser environment. This article assumes that you are
already familiar with the VBA SourceCode Control Add-in menu, and that you know
how to perform basic SourceSafe operations in the VSS Explorer.

Note that this article applies to Visual Basic Editor (VBE) Source Code Control
integration with Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. Access uses a different
integration model, so some of the procedures are different and outside the scope
of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following conventions are used in this article:

- "Documents" are .xls, .doc, .ppt, or .vba files.

- VBA "objects" are modules, class modules, or forms that make up a VBA
  project.

- All VSS operations on the documents are performed in the VSS Explorer.

- VSS operations on the objects are performed in the Visual Basic Editor (VBE)
  by using the VBA Source Code Control option on the Add-ins menu.

Step 1: Organizing the Documents
--------------------------------

One user creates the initial folder structure and files for a Source Code Control
project, which can be modified by any user later on. It is important to keep the
files that make up an Office application in a logical, self-contained folder
structure.

In the example for this article, the application is named Sales and has three
levels: general information, history, and forecasts. The files that relate to
general information are in a folder called Sales, and there are subfolders for
history and forecasts. There is another subfolder for VBA projects that are
independent of any specific document. With this example, the folder and file
organization on each user's hard disk would look as follows:

  \Sales\Sales.doc
  \Sales\Sales.ppt
  \Sales\Sales.xls

  \Sales\History\History.doc
  \Sales\History\History.ppt
  \Sales\History\History.xls

  \Sales\Forecasts\Forecasts.doc
  \Sales\Forecasts\Forecasts.ppt
  \Sales\Forecasts\Forecasts.xls

  \Sales\VBA Projects\Utilities.vba
  \Sales\VBA Projects\Calculations.vba

Documents can be organized in many different ways, but they should always be
within the same folder hierarchy. In a multiuser environment, each user has
local copies of all the files that make up the application. The path to the
Sales folder can differ from one user to another, but from that folder downward,
the structure must be identical for each user.

Although some file types, notably Access, are outside the scope of this article,
all other files that make up the Office application should be organized
following the same guidelines.

IMPORTANT: Documents that are under VSS control for the purpose of managing the
VBA source code must be sample files used only for testing while developing the
application. After the application is ready, the VBA objects can be exported for
use in the actual documents.


Step 2: Adding the Documents to VSS
-----------------------------------

The user who creates the initial VSS folders and files adds the documents to VSS.
The easiest way to do this is to use drag the documents from Windows Explorer
into the VSS Explorer.

In this example, you could create the parent project in VSS (for example $/office
apps), and drag the Sales folder from Windows Explorer to the $/office apps
project in VSS. Click to select the Recursive check box in the Add Folder dialog
box, and then click Yes to set &lt;path&gt;\Sales as your personal working
folder for $/office apps/Sales.

Regardless of the method that you use to add documents, it is important to set
the working folder for $/office apps/Sales to &lt;path&gt;\Sales. By default,
the working folders for the VSS subprojects under Sales will be the
corresponding subfolders on each user's hard disk.

Step 3: Adding the VBA Projects to VSS
--------------------------------------

In each document that contains a VBA project that you want to add to Source Code
Control, run the Visual Basic Editor, and add each VBA project to VSS. When you
add a VBA project to VSS through the Source Code Control Add-in, you are
required to create a new VSS project using the "Add to SourceSafe Project"
dialog box. Do not use the VSS Explorer to create the subprojects that will
contain the VBA objects.

Although you can add a VBA project to any location in the VSS project tree, it
make sense to follow a hierarchy similar to the one used in organizing the
files.

Using the previous example, the VSS project structure would look as follows:

  $/office apps
     /Sales
        sales.doc
        sales.ppt
        sales.xls
        
        /sales_doc (subproject for VBA objects in sales.doc)
        /sales_ppt (subproject for VBA objects in sales.ppt)
        /sales_xls (subproject for VBA objects in sales.xls)
       
        /History (subproject of Sales)
           history.doc
           history.ppt
           history.xls

           /history_doc (subproject for VBA objects in history.doc)                                              
           /history_ppt (subproject for VBA objects in history.ppt)
           /history_xls (subproject for VBA objects in history.xls)

You can use a different project organization, but be sure to maintain a clear and
consistent mapping from where the document itself is stored in VSS to the
subproject that stores the VBA objects contained in that document.
