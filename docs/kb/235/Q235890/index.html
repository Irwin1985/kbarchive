-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Enterprise Edition Installer program (Nhloader.exe) on a
computer that has Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later installed, you may receive the
following error message:

  Install Service Pack 3
  You must install Service Pack 3 to complete the installation of Windows NT
  Enterprise Edition. Press 'Start Installation' to finish the setup.

If the computer is running SP4, the problem persists even if you reinstall the
service pack.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when a service pack later than Service Pack 3 (SP3) is
installed in Windows NT Server, and you then upgrade the computer to Windows NT
Enterprise Edition by using the Winntup.exe utility. The SP3 version of the
Nhloader.exe file is placed on the computer. The SP3 version of Nhloader.exe
checks specifically for SP3 to be installed on the computer. If you have a later
service pack installed, it requests SP3.

The SP4 Update.exe program does not replace the Nhloader.exe file, even though
the updated file is part of the service pack. Service Pack 5 (SP5) and later
does replace the Nhloader.exe file if you reinstall the service pack after
upgrading the computer to Enterprise Edition.

WARNING: Do not to install SP3 on an installation of Windows NT that has already
had a later service pack installed. Doing so may cause file version mismatches
that may cause Windows to be unstable or unbootable.

RESOLUTION
==========

The version of Nhloader.exe in SP4 and later has been updated to recognize the
presence of service packs later than SP3.

If you are prompted to install SP3, quit without installing SP3. Then, copy the
Nhloader.exe file from the same service pack version that is installed on the
computer to the System32 folder in your installation, and run the new version of
Nhloader.exe.

If SP5 or later is installed, reinstalling the service pack should replace the
Nhloader.exe file with the updated version.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version 4.0.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Windows NT
Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
