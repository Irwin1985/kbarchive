MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 46: Options Dialog Box Does Not Include A Proxies Tab
----------------------------------------------------------

Page 46, Figure 3-13 shows the Options dialog box containing a Proxies tab. This
tab is no longer part of the Options dialog box.


Pages 107 - 109: Proxy Server Text Corrections
----------------------------------------------

Replace the text in the Proxy Servers subheading, starting on page 107, with the
following text:

A proxy server, also called a firewall, protects a network from uninvited outside
access. For example, communication can be inbound-communicating from the outside
through the proxy server to your internal server-or it can be
outbound-communicating from your server through a proxy to another server on the
outside. Communication related to the Web site is permitted only through the
proxy, so uninvited guests are barred from your system.

If your local network uses a proxy server, you must specify that server in order
to communicate with it. To specify a proxy server for your machine or to specify
any server that can be used without going through the firewall, follow this
procedure:

1. Choose Options from the Tools menu and then click the General tab in the
  Options dialog box.

2. Click the Proxy Settings button. This brings up the Internet Properties
  dialog box with the Connections tab selected.

3. Click the LAN Settings button. This brings up the Local Area Network (LAN)
  Settings dialog box.

4. Select the Use A Proxy Server check box in the Local Area Network dialog box,
  and then click the Advanced button to bring up the Proxy Settings dialog box.

5. In the HTTP Proxy text box, enter the name of the proxy server and the port,
  for example, itgproxy:1000. You can get the name and port from your network
  administrator.

  You can also create proxy settings for Secure, FTP, Gopher, and Socks
  protocols. If you want to use the same proxy server for all protocols, select
  the Use The Same Proxy Server For All Protocols check box. If you want to
  list exceptions to the proxy settings, add them in the Exceptions section of
  the Proxy Settings dialog box.

6. After you update the information in the Proxy Settings dialog box, click OK.

The proxy server information is saved and used for all future connections, so you
don't have to enter the information repeatedly. Whenever you request a
connection to a server (for example, when you are following a link), FrontPage
checks to see if your organization has servers that are inside the firewall. If
the server is available internally, FrontPage makes the connection directly. If
not, FrontPage first connects to the proxy server and then has the proxy server
connect to the server you want to use. This means that after you supply that
information for the proxy server, FrontPage automatically handles all proxy
communication, and you don't even have to be aware that a proxy server is in
use.


Page 161: Correction For Accessing Frames Page Properties
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 161, Frames Page Properties bullet:

Change the first paragraph of this bullet to:
"You can make changes to the frameset by selecting a page in the frameset and
choosing Frame Properties from the Frame menu. This brings up the Frame
Properties dialog box; click the Frames Page button. This brings up the Page
Properties dialog box. Select the Frames tab. You have two options here:"

size, and its horizontal and vertical alignment."
