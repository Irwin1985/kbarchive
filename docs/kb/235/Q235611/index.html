-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 may stop responding to client requests,
making it necessary to stop and restart the IIS 3.0 services.

CAUSE
=====

When IIS 3.0 attempts to close a socket it first shuts down the connection,
notifying the client that it is closing its side of the connection. While in
this state, it is still possible for the client to continue to send data.
Currently, there is no time-out, creating the possibility for a misbehaving
client program to keep the connection's Web services open indefinitely. If this
occurs while IIS 3.0 is cleaning up the connection, all other client requests
are queued up. This eventually causes IIS 3.0 to stop responding to any client
request.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
