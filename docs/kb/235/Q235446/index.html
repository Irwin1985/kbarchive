MORE INFORMATION
================

Services Do Not Failover on Primary Node in Clustered Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If Mailbox Manager is running on the primary node in a clustered environment, the
Exchange Server services may not failover until the Mailbox Manager service is
stopped manually. To work around this problem, manually add Mailbox Manager to
the Exchange resource group. To do so:

1. Install Mailbox Manager on all nodes.

2. On the primary node, start the Cluster Administrator program, right-click the
  group that contains the Exchange Server services, point to New, and then
  click Resource.

3. Type a name and a description for the resource in the Name and Description
  boxes, and then click Generic Service in the Resource Type box. Verify that
  the Exchange group is selected in the Group box, and then click Next.

4. Select the servers you want in the list of possible owners, and then click
  Next. To select a server, click it, and then click Add.

5. Select the following service dependencies in the list of resource
  dependencies, and then click Next:

   - Add-ins
   - Microsoft Exchange Directory
   - Microsoft Exchange Information Store
   - Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent
   - Microsoft Exchange System Attendant
   - Shared hard disk on which Exchange Server is installed

  To select a service dependency, click it, and then click Add.

6. Type "msexchangemca" (without the quotation marks) in the "Service name" box,
  and then click Next.

7. Click Add, type "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMCA" (without
  the quotation marks) in the "Root registry key" box, and then click OK.

8. Click Add, type
  "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application\MSExchangeMCA"
  (without the quotation marks) in the "Root registry key" box, and then click
  OK.

9. Click Finish.


Cannot Start Mailbox Manager Service on Remote Server in Different Domain
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mailbox Manager cannot start the Mailbox Manager service on a remote server if
the remote server is located in a different domain. If you connect to the remote
server using the Exchange Server Administrator program, view the properties for
the Mailbox Manager object, click the Schedule tab, and then click Clean Now,
the following error message is displayed:

  Unable to communicate with the Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager
  service. Cannot determine success of cleanup request.

This behavior occurs even if a trust relationship has been established between
the two domains. To run Mailbox Manager on a remote server that is located in a
different domain, you must start the Mailbox Manager service on the remote
server manually.


User With View Only Admin Role Can Start Mailbox Manager
--------------------------------------------------------

If you log on to an Exchange Server computer with a user account that has been
assigned the View Only Admin role on the site container, you are able to start
Mailbox Manager. If you start the Exchange Server Administrator program, view
the properties for the Mailbox Manager object, and then click the Schedule tab,
the Clean Now button is available. You are unable to modify any of the
configuration settings, but if you click Clean Now, Mailbox Manager runs using
the existing settings.


LDAP Must Be Enabled
--------------------

If the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is disabled at the site
level, you may be unable to select a server on the Server Selection tab in the
properties for the Mailbox Manager object. The following message may be
displayed at the bottom of the dialog box:

  LDAP: Server Down

To prevent this problem from occurring, enable LDAP at the site level. To do so:

1. In the left pane of the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, click the
  Protocols object under the appropriate site. Note that the Protocols object
  appears under the Configuration object.

2. In the right pane, click the LDAP object, and then on the File menu, click
  Properties.

3. Click the "Enable protocol" check box to select it, and then click OK.

Excluded Mailbox List Is Not Reset During Reinstall
---------------------------------------------------

When you reinstall the Mailbox Cleanup Agent (MBClean), the list of excluded
mailboxes is not reset, even though a message appears during installation
indicating that all configurations will be lost.
