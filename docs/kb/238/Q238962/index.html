SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up Proxy Server 2.0 and Winsock Proxy clients
to run Microsoft Services for UNIX (SFU) more efficiently.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Running SFU on a WinSock Proxy Client
-------------------------------------

After installing SFU on a client computer that already has the Winsock Proxy
client installed, SFU should run normally with no additional configuration
required on the client or the Proxy server. The user must have appropriate
access if Access Control is enabled.

Running SFU on the Proxy Server
-------------------------------

After you install SFU on the Proxy server, additional configuration is required
to ensure connectivity to external UNIX hosts. Internal UNIX host connectivity
should not be affected if the local address table (LAT) is configured correctly.
The following two methods describe how to configure SFU to run on a Proxy
server:

Method 1: Create a Custom Filter to Distinguish by Host Address:

1. Right-click any Proxy service (Socks, Web, or Winsock Proxy), and then click
  Properties.

2. On the Services tab, click Security.

3. On the Packet Filters tab, click to select the "Enable Packet filtering on
  the External Interface" and "Enable dynamic packet filtering of Microsoft
  Proxy Server packets" check boxes.

4. Click Add to configure a custom filter.

5. Create a custom Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram
  Protocol (UDP) filter with the following settings:

   - Protocol ID: (TCP or UDP depending on which one you are configuring)

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Port: Any

   - Remote Port: Any

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Single Host (IP address of remote UNIX host)

6. Click OK, click OK, and then click Apply.

At this point, all TCP and UDP traffic is enabled between the Proxy server and
the UNIX host specified in the custom filter. You should create a custom filter
for each UNIX host to which Windows needs to connect using SFU.

Method 2: Custom Filters to Support UNIX Services:

The primary UNIX services that need to be considered include (note that a Solaris
2.6 NIS server is used in this example): Rpcbind, Ypserv, Network File System
(NFS), and Mountd. To determine on which ports these services are running, type
"rpcinfo -p localhost" (without the quotation marks) on the UNIX host. As an
example, the following custom filters support the required services to connect
to a Solaris 2.6 NIS server.

1. Filter to support Rpcbind (TCP/UDP port 111)

   - Protocol ID: TCP/UDP

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Host: any

   - Remote Port: Fixed Port: 111

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Any host

2. Filter to support Ypserv (TCP/UDP ports 715/716)

   - Protocol ID: TCP/UDP

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Host: any

   - Remote Port: Fixed port: 715/716 (one for each)

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Any host

   - Protocol ID: UDP

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Host: any

   - Remote Port: Fixed port: 32771

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Any host

3. Filter to support NFS (UDP port 2049)

   - Protocol ID: UDP

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Host: any

   - Remote port: Fixed port: 2049

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Any host

4. Filter to support Lockd (TCP/UDP port 4045)

   - Protocol ID: TCP/UDP

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Host: any

   - Remote Port: Fixed Port: 4045

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Any host

5. Filter to Support Mountd (TCP port 32839 and UDP port 32821)

   - Protocol ID: TCP

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Host: any

   - Remote Port: Fixed Port: 32839

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Any host

   - Protocol ID: UDP

   - Direction: Both

   - Local Host: any

   - Remote Port: Fixed Port: 32821

   - Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

   - Remote Host: Any host

You may also require a custom filter to support Telnet from the Proxy server
itself. To accomplish this, add a custom filter as follows to support Telnet on
port 23:

- Protocol ID: TCP/UDP

- Direction: Both

- Local Host: any

- Remote port: Fixed port: 23

- Local Host: Default Proxy external IP address

- Remote Host: Any host

Once you have added the appropriate custom filters to the Proxy server, normal
functionality within SFU should be present. If not, the best method for
troubleshooting connectivity issues is to disable packet filtering on the Proxy
server external interface and take a trace using the Network Monitor tool to
determine which ports are being requested on the client and UNIX server side.

Notes
-----

- Ports opened by the NFS and NIS services may vary with the type of UNIX being
  used. You must verify the actual ports opened to support NFS and NIS using
  the procedure outlined in method 2, and then you can design the custom
  filters.

- Method 2 is more secure than method 1 but may require detailed analysis using
  tools such as Network Monitor and Rpcinfo to determine exact port usage.

- WebNFS is a product and proposed standard protocol from Sun Microsystems that
  extends its NFS. SFU does not support WebNFS. However, if a browser is used
  to connect to a WebNFS server through a Proxy server using an address such as
  "nfs://&lt;computer.site.com&gt;/&lt;filedirectory&gt;/&lt;file&gt;," a
  custom filter supporting NFS and using TCP port 2049 is required on the Proxy
  server.
