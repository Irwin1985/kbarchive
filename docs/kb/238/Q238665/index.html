The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create or modify an Internet Information Server (IIS) application,
directory, virtual directory, or site, one or more of the following symptoms may
occur:

Note: The symptoms listed below are not all-inclusive; the symptoms that occur
may vary due to the differences on your system and configuration.

- In the Event Viewer, one of the following events may occur (please note that
  the application path listed in the description will vary depending on the
  path to your application):

  Source: w3svc
  Event ID: 36
  Description: The server failed to load the application "/lm/w3svc/1/root" The
  error was 8007053D.

  -or-

  Source: Service Control Manager
  Event ID: 7011
  Description: "Timeout (120000 milliseconds) waiting for transaction response".

- IIS does not start.

- The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) stops responding when you attempt to
  open it or view the properties of an item in the scope pane.

- When you attempt to browse the Web site, one of the following error messages
  may occur:

  HTTP Error 403 - Forbidden

  -or-

  HTTP Error 500 - Internal Server Error

  -or-

  Server Application Error.
  The server has encountered an error while loading an application during the
  processing of your request. Please refer to the event log for more detailed
  information. Please contact the server administrator for assistance.

CAUSE
=====

The changes made to the application, directory, virtual directory, or site are
interrupted while they are being written to the metabase, which corrupted the
metabase.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because the metabase has a hierarchical structure, you can attempt to remove,
and then re-create only the section that contains the corruption to create valid
information in the metabase. To restore IIS functionality, try the following:

Remove and Re-Create the Application, Directory, or Site
--------------------------------------------------------

If the MMC is working properly, remove, and then re-create the application,
directory, virtual directory, or site that was being created when the corruption
originally occurred.

Restore from MMC Backup
-----------------------

If the MMC is working properly, and a backup of the metabase was created using
the Backup action in the MMC, perform the following steps:

1. In the MMC, open the Internet Information Server snap-in, right-click the
  computer name, and then click Backup/Restore Configuration.

2. Select the most recent, valid backup, and then click Restore.

3. Manually re-create any changes or settings to IIS that were made between the
  time of the backup and just before the corruption occurred.

4. Re-create the application, directory, virtual directory, or site that
  inadvertently caused the corruption.

If the MMC Cannot be Used
-------------------------

If the MMC cannot be started, which therefore prevents you from attempting to
remove and re-create the application, directory, virtual directory, or site,
perform the following steps:

1. Manually restore the metabase from a backup file. For information on how to
  do this, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q234429 How to Manually Restore the Metabase When No Proper Backup Exists or
  MMC Won't Start

2. Manually re-create any changes or settings to IIS that were made between the
  time of the backup and just before the corruption occurred.

3. Re-create the application, directory, virtual directory, or site that
  inadvertently caused the corruption.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note: You should back up the metabase regularly using the Restore action in the
MMC.

For information on how to back up and restore the metabase by using the MMC, see
the IIS Readme file, located at
http://localhost/iishelp/iis/htm/core/iisread.htm#general (assuming that the
product documentation is installed on the local computer).
