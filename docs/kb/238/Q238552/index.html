  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When you receive a hotfix from Microsoft Quick Fix Engineering (QFE), you have
three different options to implement this fix.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method 1
--------

Run the Hotfix.exe program, which is always included in the fix package you
receive from Microsoft. Hotfix.exe checks the version of the service pack you
are currently using, and then installs the hotfix automatically if the service
pack version is older than the provided hotfix and the language is the same. If
your service pack version is newer than the hotfix, the installation does not
work, and the following error message may be displayed:

  Hotfix Setup has detected that the Service Pack version of the system
  installed is newer than the update you are applying to it.

The Setup program is always interrupted if the language version of the installed
fix does not match the system's language. If there is no version conflict,
Hotfix.exe installs the fixed file(s) without any user intervention. Hotfix.exe
always reads out the Hotfix.ini file and registers the fix under the
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix registry key.

The registry entries differ from version to version of the Hotfix.ini file,
because there is no common rule about what entries must be stated in the
registry key, as these are just for information. The Installed key is the only
key that is always included under the hotfix entries, which is set to 1 when the
fix is installed on your computer. The Hofix.ini file should never be edited.

Method 2
--------

Hfx.exe may be the most comfortable way of managing hotfixes on your system. When
you start the Hfx.exe program, a pop-up menu is displayed, which enables you to
administer all fixes that are installed on your computer. This pop-up menu is
only displayed if you have previously installed all your fixes with the Hfx.exe
or the Hotfix.exe program. If you are installing a new hotfix, you must prompt
the path of the Hotfix.ini file, and then click OK. The hotfix is then installed
on your computer.

With Hfx.exe you can install new hotfixes, delete old ones, or just view the
hotfixes installed on your computer. Running this program helps a great deal if
Microsoft Product Support needs information about the fixes currently installed
on your computer. Some fixes installed with older versions of Hotfix.exe or
Hfx.exe could possibly not be seen when you run Hfx.exe. If you are unsure about
which fixes are installed on your system, you can check the registry under
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix and look at the
Installed key.

NOTE: Microsoft strongly recommends that you use the Hfx.exe or the Hotfix.exe
program as it is the best way for administrators to perform hotfix management.
Using these programs also allows Microsoft Support Professionals the full range
of options available to retrieve important information about your currently
installed fixes when troubleshooting problems.

Method 3 (Use only when advised by your Support Professional) 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Search the path in %Systemroot% where the fixed file(s) are located. Save or
rename the old file(s), and then copy the new, fixed version in the same
location in the folder. When files are in use on the computer, write access to
these files is denied. In this case, you can use a tool from the Windows NT 4.0
Server Resource Kit called Mv.exe. For Windows NT, please use the Mv.exe
utility, which is located in the NTReskit folder, and not the NTReskit\Posix
folder.

When you type Mv.exe /? at an MS-DOS command prompt, a list of all possible
parameters is displayed. Mv.exe exchanges system files when your computer is
restarted. For more information about replacing system files in use, please see
the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q184408 How to Replace In-Use Windows NT System Files

This method is not recommended. After you implement the hotfix in the manner
described above, there is no registry information available and no way to track
or perform maintenance on your currently installed hotfixes.

NOTE: Remember to reinstall all hotfixes or service packs after you add or change
any Windows NT system components. For example, you need to reapply a service
pack if you have added or changed services, drivers, and so forth. To avoid
conflicts with old drivers, always check the version of the drivers you are
using (Microsoft or third-party) to ensure they are the latest version and are
compatible with the operating system.

After you install hotfixes, possible registry changes are made as described in
the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
