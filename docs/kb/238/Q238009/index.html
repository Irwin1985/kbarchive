The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) and one node loses its connection
with another node, subsequent attempts to re-establish the connection may not be
successful until the second node is restarted. Note that the second node can be
either a cluster node or a sponsor node.

This behavior may also occur when you install a cluster node to join a sponsor
node and you cannot establish the connection on the first attempt. When the
initial join does not complete, all subsequent attempts to join the sponsor node
are also unsuccessful until you restart the sponsor mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

- http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/ServicePacks/

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The primary issue of this behavior is the join (connection) on the second node.
Although the occurrence of this behavior is rare, it can occur potentially every
time a connection between nodes is unsuccessful or stops, and an attempt is made
to re-establish the connection.

The operating system on the first node is not critical in this situation, you can
use any operating system that supports Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition.
However, you must apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 or later on the operating
system of the second node.

Enterprise Edition, please visit the following Microsoft Web site:
