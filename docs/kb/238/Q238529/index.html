SYMPTOMS
========

If a PUT request is sent to port 80 or 443 and the response is "HTTP/1.1 201
Created," an HTML page is attached at the end of the response. For example:

  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  Server: Microsoft-IIS/4.0
  Date: Thu, 19 Jul 2007 20:06:03.GMT
  Location: http://episode1/uploads/Upload46.M64
  Content-Type: text/html
  Content-Length: 69
  Allow: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE

  &lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;/uploads/Upload46.M64 was created
  successfully.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;

However, if the same PUT request is sent to port other than 80 or 443, (such as
port 8080), the HTML page is not attached at the end of the response. For
example:

  HTTP/1.1.201 Created
  Server: Microsoft-IIS/4.0
  Date: Thu, 19 Jul 2007 18:38:08.GMT
  Location: http://episode1:8080/uploads/Upload52.M64

The incomplete response (compared to the response from port 80) may cause some
programs that require the HTML page to stop responding (hang).
