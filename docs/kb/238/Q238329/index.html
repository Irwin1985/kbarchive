The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98 receives a fragmented Internet
Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packet, the computer's performance may degrade
or the computer may stop responding (hang) and require a reboot to restore
functionality.
Computers running Windows NT 4.0 are also affected by this issue, but other
system components prevent any performance degradation.

CAUSE
=====

A fragmented IGMP packet may cause the TCP/IP stack to improperly gain access to
invalid segments of the computer's memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

This patch is now available on the Windows Update Web site.

NOTE: If Dial-Up Networking Update version 1.3 for Windows 95 is not installed,
you will not be able to view this fix.
