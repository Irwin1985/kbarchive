The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0 SP2, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Microsoft Exchange Server InterOrg
Replicator utility to share free and busy and public folder information. The
InterOrg Replicator utility consists of two programs, the Microsoft Exchange
Server Replication Configuration utility (Exscfg.exe), and the Microsoft
Exchange Server Replication Service (Exssrv.exe). Using these programs, you can
coordinate meetings, appointments, and contact information between members of
two different Exchange Server organizations. Additionally, message types can
automatically be converted to posts and added to public folders, which can then
be replicated.

Using a configuration file created by the Replication Configuration utility, the
Replication Service continuously updates information from one server (designated
as the publisher) to one or more Exchange Server computers (designated as
subscribers). Schedule+ free and busy information is replicated from publisher
to subscriber only. For this reason, you must have two free and busy sessions to
bi-directionally update free and busy information. Public folders can be
replicated from publisher to subscriber or bi-directionally. You can configure
the replication frequency as well as message and folder replication logging, and
how much processing power you want devoted to the replication process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are a number of steps you can take if you encounter problems with the
InterOrg Replicator tool.

1. Enable logging on the Public Folders or Free/Busy Session Configuration tabs.

2. Check the Ex00yymmdd.log and Ex01yymmdd.log log files for any errors.

3. Use the application Event Viewer to make sure there are no errors. Configure
  the Event Viewer with a 2-MB size, and configure it to wrap as needed.

4. Verify that you have granted the appropriate permissions to root folders and
  the ExchsyncSecurity Folder. If not, you will receive the following error
  message.

  Event ID 116
  Source Exchsync
  Type Error
  Category None

  Mailbox user (username) does not have enough security to replicate to server
  [servername] on session 'Session Name'.

  WARNING: Create subfolder access is not available to '[SERVERNAME]\Foldername,
  skipping.
  WARNING: Write access is not available to '[SERVERNAME]\ Foldername,
  skipping.
  WARNING: Write access is not available to '[SERVERNAME]\ Foldername \
  Foldername,skipping.
  WARNING: Read access is not available to '[SERVERNAME]\ Foldername, skipping.
  WARNING: Read access is not available to '[SERVERNAME]\ Foldername \
  Foldername, skipping.

5. Verify that for each mailbox on the publisher server that you want to
  replicate free and busy information to, a corresponding custom recipient
  exists on the subscriber server. If none exists, create one. The SMTP address
  of the mailbox is the unique key that is used to match mailboxes to custom
  recipients. If a corresponding custom recipient does not exist, no free and
  busy information will be published.

6. If no free and busy information is displayed after you verify that the custom
  recipients do exist, quit, and restart your client. This forces your free and
  busy information to be written to the server. The next replication cycle will
  then publish your free and busy information.
