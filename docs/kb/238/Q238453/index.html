The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 to your computer, you then attempt
to disable TCP/IP source routing following the instructions in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

  Q217336 TCP/IP Source Routing Feature Cannot Be Disabled

However, even if you disable source routing using the registry change referenced
in the article above, it is possible to bypass this feature by including
specific, incorrect information within the route pointer field in the data
packet.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date       Time     Size      File name   Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  09/17/99   04:04p   150,832   Tcpip.sys   x86
  09/17/99   04:03p   274,096   Tcpip.sys   Alpha



Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: The patch listed above also includes added functionality and increased
control over source routing so you can disable TCP/IP source routing on
single-homed computers and on multihomed (more than one network interface)
computers that are not used as routers.

If you use a multihomed Windows NT-based computer to perform routing and you need
to disable source routing, you should apply the patch to ensure proper operation
of the anti-source routing features. If you have computers running Windows NT
that are not configured as routers but are situated in vulnerable locations (for
example, single-homed computers outside of a firewall or multihomed computers
joining two subnets), you can install the patch to disable source routing in
these cases as well.

Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98 SE
-----------------------------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

NOTE: Computers with any version of Windows 95 installed must have the Microsoft
Dial Up Networking 1.3 Performance and Security Update installed before
installing this update. You can find Windows 95 download information at:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under normal conditions, the sender of a TCP/IP data packet exercises no control
over how a packet arrives at its destination. The sender simply sends the packet
and relies on intermediate routers to dynamically select the best route, as
determined by network traffic, router availability, and other factors. It is
entirely possible that every packet going between two endpoints may take a
different route.

You can use source routing to specify the route that a packet must take to a
destination. If the selected route is not available for any reason, the packet
cannot be delivered. If the recipient replied to the packets, the response
follows the same route.

The route pointer is one of the fields in a TCP/IP data packet. It keeps track of
the hops in the route list that the packet has already visited. A malicious user
can bypass the anti-source routing controls in Windows NT 4.0 by manipulating
this information and providing incorrect information to the router.

Source routing is a legitimate activity in some cases. For example, you can use
source routing to discover the TCP/IP addresses of routers within a network.
However, a malicious user can use source routing to learn more about a network
that he or she is targeting for attack. A data packet contains information about
where the packet has traveled and which computers the packet has transited. A
malicious user could send data into a network to collect information about the
network's topology. If a user can perform source routing, he or she can probe
the network more effectively by forcing packets into specific parts of the
network.

The original operating system functionality allows administrators to prevent
source routing attacks through Windows NT-based computers that are used as
routers. If you disable source routing, a multihomed computer that acts as a
router does not forward any packets that request source routing. The additional
functionality extends this protection to non-routing computers, whether they are
single-homed or multihomed. Source routing attacks can be mounted against these
computers as well, and you can use the new functionality to defeat such
attacks.
