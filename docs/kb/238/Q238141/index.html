-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a Systems Management Server (SMS) client installation, the
";C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WBEM" path is added to the end of each path statement,
regardless of whether or not the path statement already contains the path. If
the Autoexec.bat file contains multiple path statements when you perform the SMS
client installation, SMS adds the ";C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WBEM" path to the end of
each path statement.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date        Version    Size        File name     Platform
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  08/23/1999                    67   Compver.ini   Alpha
  09/03/1999  1380.1017  7,200,879   Wbemsdk.exe   Alpha
  08/23/1999                    67   Compver.ini   Intel
  09/03/1999  1380.1017  3,822,227   Wbemsdk.exe   Intel



NOTE: The hotfix for this issue is the same hotfix that is referenced in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article (you should refer to this article
when requesting this hotfix):

  Q238144 Client Installation Corrupts Path Statement in Autoexec.bat

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. Edit the Autoexec.bat file and consolidate all path statements without adding
  the ";C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WBEM" path to the path statement.

3. Save the file, and then quit Sysedit.

4. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Systems Management.

5. On the Components tab, click Windows Management, and then click Repair.

SMS reinstalls the Windows Management portion of the SMS client installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is confirmed to occur only with Microsoft Windows 95/98 clients at
this time.
