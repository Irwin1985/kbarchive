SYMPTOMS
========

The following symptoms may occur on a domain with very large groups containing
thousands of users that are changed frequently:

- On the primary domain controller (PDC), there is a large number (up to
  several events per minute) of 5711 events for each backup domain controller
  (BDC):

  Event Id 5711 - Source: NETLOGON
  Description: The partial synchronization request from the server &lt;BDC&gt;
  completed successfully. X changes(s) has (have) been returned to the caller.

- On the BDC, there is only one 5715 event between two replications:

  Event Id 5715 - Source: NETLOGON
  The partial synchronization replication of the SAM database from the primary
  domain controller &lt;PDC&gt; completed successfully. X change(s) is (are)
  applied to the database.

- The partial replication could take a very long time.

- The amount of data that goes across the wire for a single replication to a
  given BDC may be very large, and even larger than the size of the SAM on the
  PDC. (Use the command "NBTSTAT ?S" to monitor the amount of data sent to each
  BDC.)

- The CPU on the PDC may remain at 100 percent usage during the replication.

RESOLUTION
==========

You should not make too many changes to very large groups that contain thousands
of users. If you do have to make large SAM modifications and have to modify the
members of very large groups, you can:

1. Make all the changes on the PDC.

2. Force a full replication for all BDCs (issue the NLTEST/SYNC command on each
  BDC).

MORE INFORMATION
================


On the PDC, Netlogon is notified of all SAM changes. When a group is changed,
Netlogon stores that change in the change log file (Netlogon.chg). The members
of the group are not stored in the change log file, but only a reference to the
change (that is, the SID of the group, a serial number, and so on). This is why
changing such groups many times does not fill up the change log file.

When the pulse timeout expires, the PDC notifies the BDCs with a pulse. Then,
each BDC (within the limit of the PulseConcurrency setting) asks the PDC to
perform the replication. If the Netlogon logging facility is enabled on the PDC,
the Netlogon.log file includes a line similar to:

  [SYNC] NetrDatabaseDeltas: SAM partial sync called by &lt;BDC&gt;
  SerialNumber:XX

When the PDC reads the Netlogon.chg file and finds an entry indicating that a
group has changed, it sends the contents of the group to the BDC. If the group
contains thousands of users, the amount of data that goes across the wire for
that single change can be very large (approximately 8 KB for a group with 1,000
users).

If the same group is changed hundreds of times (for example, when new users are
created and added to that group), and if in between two changes to the group
there are other changes, the same group is sent hundreds of times to each BDC.
The replication occurs as follows:

- The BDC asks the PDC to perform a partial replication (all changes are in the
  Netlogon.chg file. Remember that the Netlogon.chg file includes only
  references to the SAM objects that are modified and does not include the
  objects themselves).

- The amount of data that can be sent by the PDC to the BDC depends on the
  ReplicationGovernor parameter set on the BDC (if it is 100 percent, the
  buffer size is 128 KB, if it is 50 percent, the buffer size is 64 KB, and so
  on).

- If the amount of data to send to the BDC is larger than the buffer size
  provided by the BDC, the PDC sends, for example, only the first 128 KB with
  the status 0x105 = STATUS_MORE_ENTRIES:

  [MISC] Eventlog: 5711 (4) "BDC" "7"
  [SYNC] NetrDatabaseDeltas: SAM returning (0x105) to &lt;BDC&gt;

  The PDC logs an event 5711 indicating that the BDC has completed the partial
  replication with the PDC successfully. This does not mean that there is no
  more data to send to the BDC

- Upon reception of the STATUS_MORE_ENTRIES entry, the BDC contacts the PDC
  again to get the remaining data. The BDC logs event 5715 only at the very end
  of the replication process, when there is no more data to retrieve, whereas
  multiple 5711 events are logged on the PDC.
