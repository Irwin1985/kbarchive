SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Microsoft Windows 95-based computer, you may receive an
error message similar to the following:

  A Fatal Exception 0E has occurred at 0157:BFF9A25B

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

  -and-

- You install AOL 6 on your computer.

You may receive this error message if the RealJukebox and RealPlayer programs are
configured to start when Windows starts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, edit the registry to prevent RealJukebox and
RealPlayer from starting when Windows starts. To do this, follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click

4. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

5. In the Export Registry File dialog box, type "RunKey" (without the quotation
  marks) in the "File name" box, and then click Save.

  NOTE: The contents of the Run key are saved in the RunKey.reg file. If you
  later want to undo the following changes to the registry, double-click
  RunKey.reg. You will be prompted to add the information from Runkey.reg to
  the registry.

6. In the right pane, right-click the RealJukeboxSystray entry in the Name list,
  and then click Delete on the shortcut menu that appears.

7. Click Yes in response to the Confirm Value Delete message that appears.

8. Right-click RealTray, and then click Delete on the shortcut menu that
