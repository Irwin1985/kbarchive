- Your video driver is incompatible with DirectX 7.0 or later.

  -or-

- Your computer video card is using outdated drivers.

  -or-

- Your video card does not meet the minimum memory requirements.

For a list of video chip sets and cards that have exhibited this behavior, see
the "More Information" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that your drivers are compatible with DirectX 7.0 or later. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. Click Save All Information.

4. In the Save In box, click Desktop, and then click Save.

5. Click Exit.

6. Open the Dxdiag.txt file on your desktop.

7. In the Display Devices section, locate the DDI Version line. The version
  listed here must be at least 7 for the game to function correctly. The DDI
  version is a reference to your video drivers.

If your drivers are compatible with DirectX 7.0 or later, download and install an
updated video card driver.

For information about how to contact your video card, click the appropriate
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

To identify the manufacturer and model of your video adapter, follow these
steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Expand (click the plus sign next to) the Display Adapters folder.

5. Note the manufacturer and model of your video adapter, and then click OK.

6. Close Control Panel.

After installing the updated video drivers Train Simulator must redetect the
adaptor.

1. To open the Troubleshooter, point to Start, point to Programs, point to
  Microsoft Games, point to Train Simulator, and then click on "Train Simulator
  Troubleshooter".

2. Click "Change Video Driver".

3. Click to select the new driver from the drop down list and click OK.

4. Exit the troubleshooter and start Train Simulator normally.

Verify that your video card has at least for 4 megabytes (MB) of memory. To
determine how much video memory is installed on your video card, use the DirectX
Diagnostic Tool (Dxdiag.exe). To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. Click the Display tab.

4. In the Device section, look for the Approx. Total Memory option and note the
  total amount of memory installed on your video adapter.

5. Click Exit.

If less than 4 megabytes (MB) of video memory are installed on your video
adapter, install additional video memory on your video adapter, or install a
video adapter with more video memory.
