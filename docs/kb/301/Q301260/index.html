SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to leverage the Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic
development environment to automatically install Microsoft SQL Server CE on a
Microsoft Windows CE-based device.

Requirements
------------

The following list outlines the recommended hardware, software, network
infrastructure, and service packs that you will need:

- Microsoft Windows 2000 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0 with Service Pack 5
  (SP5) or later
- Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic
- Microsoft Windows CE-based device

How to Use eMbedded Visual Basic to Install SQL Server CE
---------------------------------------------------------

The eMbedded Visual Basic development environment automates many of the debugging
processes that you need to use to develop a new application. Part of this
process includes downloading prototype versions of the application into a
Windows CE-based device where it can be run and debugged.

The development environment uses ActiveSync on the development computer to
download the files into the Windows CE-based device. The development environment
can automatically monitor which executable files are included in the application
and which DLLs the application uses. During the download process, the
development environment downloads the latest version of all of these components
together. If you are using eMbedded Visual Basic, you can take advantage of
these capabilities during the development process.

1. Start eMbedded Visual Basic, and then either create a new Windows CE project
  or open an existing project.

2. On the Project menu, click References, and select the "Microsoft CE SQL
  Server Control 1.0" and "Microsoft CE ADO Control 3.1" check boxes. If your
  application uses the ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) extensions for data
  definition language (DDL) (or ADOX), select the Microsoft CE ADO Ext. 3.1 for
  DDL check box. Click OK.

3. On the Project menu, click Properties.

4. On the General tab, in the "Update Component Frequency" list box, click Ask.

5. Select the "Runtime Files and Project Components" check boxes.

6. On the Run menu, click Execute to invoke the eMbedded Visual Basic program.
  eMbedded Visual Basic downloads and registers all SQL Server CE, ADO, OLE DB,
  and ADOX components that you selected in step 2 of this procedure to your
  Windows CE-based device.

  NOTE: In the event that you encounter installation problems, you can force
  eMbedded Visual Basic to download components again. To do this, on the
  Project menu, and click Properties. In the "Update Component Frequency" list
  box, click Always, and then click Project Components.

Your application components are downloaded to the Windows CE-based device each
time you modify and rebuild your application to test it.

NOTE: You do not need the DLLRegister.exe file if you are using eMbedded Visual
Basic to deploy your application because the tools handle all registration
automatically.

Additional Steps
----------------

After you have completed your application, you can use the download capability of
the eMbedded Visual Basic tools to deploy the application to every Windows
CE-based device.

This simple method of deployment saves you the trouble of creating any other
setup mechanism, but it means that you must purchase a copy of the eMbedded
Visual Basic tools and SQL Server CE for every computer that you want to use for
installing your application onto Windows CE-based devices. Microsoft recommends
this method only for smaller installations where it is not a problem to connect
every Windows CE-based device to a development computer to initiate the setup.
