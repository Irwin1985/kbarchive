-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: If you download and install the fix included in this article onto a computer running IIS 3.0, the IIS 3.0 Web, FTP, and Proxy services will fail. This fix should only be applied to computers running IIS 4.0 or later. To verify your version of IIS, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Administrative Tools, and then click the Services icon.

3. In the Services list, locate the IIS Admin Service.

If the IIS Admin Service is listed, download and apply the fix included in this article.  

If the IIS Admin Service is not listed, your version of IIS is not vulnerable to the problem that is corrected by these fixes. Therefore, no action is needed. IIS 3.0 is not vulnerable and does not need this fix.

If you accidentally install this fix on IIS 3.0 it can be successfully removed via Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel to return the web site to its correct functioning.

SYMPTOMS
========

In Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 and Internet Information Server (IIS)
4.0, a buffer overrun vulnerability exists that an attacker could exploit to
gain complete control over an affected server and take any type of action on it.
This vulnerability can only be exploited by code that is running on the server.
As a result, the attacker would need to already have the ability to install
software on the server in order to exploit the vulnerability. Best practices
strongly recommend that you never allow an untrusted user to install software on
a Web server.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because the code that processes server-side include
files contains an unchecked buffer. If a server-side file that contains a
malformed server-side include directive is installed on an affected server, an
attacker could cause the buffer to overflow the next time the file is requested
by a user.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you apply this security patch to a server that is running Exchange 5.5 with
Outlook Web Access (OWA), all OWA clients receive a message that states that the
client password will expire in 0 days.

To resolve this, follow these steps after you apply the patch:

1. Locate C:\Exchsrvr\Webdata\USA.

2. Create a copy of the Root.asp file (for backup purposes only).

3. Edit Root.asp.

4. Locate the following line:

  if cint(days) &lt; 0 then days = 10000

5. Change the line to the following:

  if cint(days) &lt; 1 then days = 10000

6. Save the file.

7. Stop the browser (that is, the OWA client).

8. Log on to OWA again.
