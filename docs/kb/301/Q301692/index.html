-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 client computers that are running Microsoft
Windows NT may report Pentium III processor speeds incorrectly. For example, a
Pentium III 933-megahertz (MHz) processor may be reported as a 1-gigahertz (GHz)
processor.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the processor normalization code that determines the
processor speed does not correctly identify Pentium processors between 833 MHz
and 1 GHz.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

contains the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The value that SMS queries is located in the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\0\~MHz

For Windows NT-based clients, this hotfix adds support for Pentium III 833-MHz,
850-MHz, 866-MHz, 900-MHz, 933-MHz, 1,100-MHz, and 1,133-MHz processors, and for
Pentium 4 1.3-GHz, 1.4-GHz, 1.5-GHz, and 1.7-GHz processors. No additional
support has been added for 16-bit clients.

NOTE: You should apply this hotfix only to an SMS 1.2 Service Pack 4 (SP4) site.

To install the hotfix, follow these steps:

1. Stop the SMS Executive and SMS Inventory Agent services on the site server.

2. In the &lt;SMS_root_folder&gt;\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder on the
  site server, replace the Invwin32.exe and Invproc.dll files with the versions
  obtained from the hotfix.

3. In the &lt;SMS_root_folder&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin folder
  on the site server, replace the Inv32cli.exe and Invwin32.exe files with the
  versions obtained from the hotfix.

4. In the &lt;SMS_root_folder&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\Alpha.bin
  folder on the site server, replace the Inv32cli.exe and Invwin32.exe files
  with the versions obtained from the hotfix.

5. Restart the SMS Executive and SMS Inventory Agent services on the site
  server. Maintenance Manager will propagate the changed files to the logon
  servers.

To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client, or use the
information from the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
