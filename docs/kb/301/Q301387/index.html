SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to use the IIS Migration Wizard to
migrate from Internet Information Server version 4.0 to Internet Information
Services (IIS) version 5.0.

The IIS Migration Wizard migrates Web server configuration settings, Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type information, and content to Microsoft
Windows 2000 Server and IIS 5.0 from another Web server. It also provides the
option to migrate users and groups.

During a migration, the wizard performs the following basic tasks:

- Creates a virtual Web site in the IIS 5.0 snap-in, with a configuration that
  is matched as closely as possible to the original Web site.

- Copies content, including application files, into an appropriate directory
  structure that it creates in Windows Explorer.

- Maps the virtual Web site to the content.

- Configures Active Server Pages (ASP) applications, Internet Server
  Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions, and dynamic link
  libraries (DLLs), and sets execute permissions on the Common Gateway
  Interface (CGI) directory. You may have to take additional steps for your
  applications to run on IIS 5.0.

Requirements
------------

The following conditions must be met for the IIS Migration Wizard to run
correctly:

- The target computer must have Web access to the source computer.

- The user who is running the wizard must have local computer administrator
  rights on both the source and the target computers. This condition is
  satisfied if the user is a domain administrator.

- The target computer must be running Windows 2000 Server and IIS 5.0. It
  should also have a default configuration. During a migration, the IIS 5.0
  default Web site must be running on the target computer.

- The IIS default Web site must be running on the source computer. If the
  default Web site has been deleted or renamed, the first Web site that appears
  under the administration Web site in the IIS snap-in must be running.

- The total amount of content involved in a single migration cannot exceed 4
  gigabytes (GB). If the content exceeds this limit, you can perform separate
  migrations for virtual Web sites. If you have only one Web site, you can
  decrease the content in a single migration by creating virtual Web sites that
  each refer to a portion of the content. You can then conduct separate
  migrations for the virtual Web sites.

Important Security Information

It is strongly recommended that you uninstall IIS Migration Wizard source and
target components after you complete the migration process. Leaving these
components installed may pose a security risk. On a Windows-based computer, you
can uninstall the components by using the Add/Remove Programs utility in Control
Panel.

Download and Extract IIS Migration Wizard Files
-----------------------------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Iismigrationwizard_setup.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win2000platform/iismigwz/1.00.0.1/nt5/en-us/IISMIGrationWizard_Setup.exe)

To download and extract IIS Migration Wizard files, follow these steps:

1. Download the IIS Migration Wizard setup file from the Microsoft Download
  Center.

2. In the File Download dialog box, select Save this program to disk.

3. Select a location on your computer and then click Save.

4. In Windows Explorer, locate the Iismigrationwizard_setup.exe file that you
  just downloaded, and then double-click the file to start the file extraction
  process.

NOTE: The Iismigrationwizard_setup.exe file is a self-extracting executable
(.exe) file. By running the file, you place installation packages and
documentation on your computer. Each of these packages requires additional
installation, as described in the tool documentation.

Install the Windows Source Component
------------------------------------

The IIS Migration Wizard consists of two components: the source component, which
is run on the computer from which you are migrating, and the target component,
which is run on the computer to which you are migrating.

To install the source component, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the source computer as an administrator.

2. Browse to the location where you extracted the IIS Migration Wizard files and
  double-click IISv5MigrationUtility_x86.exe. The default location of the IIS
  Migration Wizard files is %SystemRoot%\Program Files\Resource Kit.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the component. When you are
  prompted, select Install the source component. For additional instructions,
  click Help at the bottom of the dialog box.

Install the Windows Target Component
------------------------------------

1. Log on to the target computer as an administrator.

2. Browse to the directory of the extracted IIS Migration Wizard files and
  double-click Iisv5migrationutility-targetonly_x86.exe.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the component.

Run the IIS Migration Wizard
----------------------------

After you have installed the IIS Migration Wizard source and target components,
you are ready to run the wizard and conduct a migration. To run the IIS
Migration Wizard, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the target computer as an administrator.

2. On the Start menu, point to Programs, and then click IIS Migration Wizard.

3. When you are prompted, select the server content, settings, and MIME
  information to migrate for each virtual server.

  NOTE: By default, the IIS administration Web site is not migrated, but you can
  select the option to migrate it. For help while you are using the wizard,
  click Help at the bottom of the dialog box.

4. Click Next to start the wizard. This starts the migration, which can take
  from several minutes to over an hour.

5. To save the activity log or the migration archive file, which contains
  migrated content and settings, click the appropriate link at the bottom of
  the wizard screen.

6. To close the wizard, click Finish.

Important: It is strongly recommended that you uninstall both the source and
target components after you complete the migration process. Leaving these
components installed may pose a security risk.

Complete the Migration of Content
---------------------------------

The IIS Migration Wizard copies all source Web site content to the target
computer. It also performs much of the necessary configuration for IIS 5.0 to
serve the content. However, for certain types of content, you may need to take
additional steps to complete the migration. This topic describes the directory
structure that the wizard creates for content and the additional steps you may
need to take to complete the migration.

The IIS Migration Wizard places content in the
Inetpub\&lt;source&gt;\&lt;drive&gt;\&lt;directory structure&gt; directory
structure that it creates in Windows Explorer on the target computer, where
&lt;source&gt; is the computer name or IP address of the source computer,
&lt;drive&gt; is the drive on which the content was stored on the source
computer, and &lt;directory structure&gt; is the directory structure as it
exists on the source computer.

The wizard configures IIS 5.0 properties for migrated content, with the following
results:

- Web pages are configured to be served correctly. You may need to change
  UNIX-style file names to reflect Windows conventions.

- CGI applications are placed in a directory with execute permissions enabled.
  You may need to take additional steps in order for your CGI applications
  (particularly UNIX CGI applications) to run on IIS 5.0. For more information,
  see "Migrating a Web Server to IIS 5.0" in the Microsoft Windows 2000
  Resource Kit Internet Information Services Resource Guide.

- ASP applications with relative paths are configured to run correctly.
  However, you may need to correct absolute paths in .asp files to reflect the
  new directory hierarchy.

- ISAPI extensions are configured to run correctly.

- Netscape Application Programming Interface (NSAPI) extensions are migrated,
  but are not converted to a format that runs on IIS 5.0.

- DLLs that are stored in Web content directories on the source computer are
  configured to run correctly. DLLs that are stored outside Web content
  directories are not migrated.

- COM objects that are stored in Web content directories on the source computer
  are copied to the appropriate directory. However, to complete the migration
  of COM objects, you must manually run Regsvr32.exe. COM objects that are
  stored outside Web content directories are not migrated.

- ODBC sources are not migrated. You must reconfigure them in a Windows 2000
  environment.

- Because security certificates are not migrated, you must remove any security
  certificates that you are using on the IIS 4.0 computer before you migrate,
  and then obtain new certificates for the migrated Web sites under IIS 5.0.

Restore Migrated Settings and Content
-------------------------------------

For each migration, the IIS Migration Wizard provides the option to save a .cab
file that archives migrated settings and content. If you want to undo changes
that you have made to a migrated Web site, or if your data becomes corrupted,
you can restore the original settings and content. To do this, run the wizard
again and reference the .cab archive file rather than a source Web server. You
can also use this method to replicate migrated settings and content to another
computer that is running Windows 2000 Server and IIS 5.0.

The wizard restores or replicates migrated settings and content as follows:

- If, in the IIS 5.0 snap-in, the wizard encounters a Web site that has the
  same name as the Web site for which the archive .cab file was created, it
  restores the Web site settings to the state that is recorded in the .cab
  file. The wizard also overwrites any content that is contained in
  Inetpub\&lt;Web site name&gt;\ folder with corresponding content from the
  archive .cab file. &lt;Web site name&gt; is a folder that has the same name
  as the migrated Web site. If the wizard does not find a folder that has this
  name, it creates a folder with this name and copies the content into it.

- If, in the IIS 5.0 snap-in, the wizard does not encounter a Web site with a
  name that corresponds to the name of the archived Web site, it creates and
  new Web site that has this name. It also copies all of the archived content
  to Inetpub\&lt;Web site name&gt;\, where &lt;Web site name&gt; is a folder
  that the wizard creates that has the same name as the migrated Web site.

To restore or replicate migrated settings and content, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the target computer (the one onto which you want to replicate or
  restore settings and content) as an administrator.

2. If necessary, install the target component, as described in the "Install the
  Windows Target Component" section.

3. Click Start, click Programs, and then click IIS Migration Wizard to start the
  wizard.

4. On the Welcome page, click Next.

5. In Step 2: connect to the source server, select the Archive file option, and
  then type the path and file name of the archive .cab file in the text box.
  Click Next.

6. Click Next on each subsequent screen until the migration begins. After the
  process has started, the process takes from a few minutes to over an hour,
  depending on the amount of content that is restored or replicated. When the
  migration is complete, the wizard displays a list of warnings, as well as
  additional steps that are required.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- "Page Cannot Be Displayed" Error Message When You Start the Wizard from a Web
  Page

When you attempt to start the wizard from a Web page by connecting to
http://&lt;source&gt;/iismu/welcome.htm, you may receive an error message that
states that the page cannot be displayed. If you do, the source Web server is
not running.

To correct the problem, stop the wizard, start the source Web server, and then
start the wizard again. If the source Web server is IIS, you need to start the
default Web site. If you have renamed or deleted the default Web site, start the
Web site that appears first under the administration Web site in the IIS snap-in
of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

- "Page Cannot be Displayed" Error Message After Step 2

After you complete the second step of the wizard (Step 2: connect to the source
server), you may receive an error message that states that the page cannot be
displayed. If you do, either the target component is not installed, or the
target Web server is not running. If the target component has not been
installed, go back to Step 1 of the wizard, install the target component, and
then continue with the wizard. If the target component has been installed, the
error indicates that the target Web server is not running. In this case, stop
the wizard. In the IIS snap-in, start the default Web site, and then start the
wizard again.

If you continue to receive an error message that states that the page cannot be
displayed, the most likely cause is that the target computer does not have a
default installation of Windows 2000 and IIS 5.0. The IIS Migration Wizard does
not support target platforms without a default installation. To correct the
problem, verify that the IIS default Web site responds to requests that are made
to the "localhost" address, which the wizard uses when it moves from step 2 to
step 3. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In the IIS snap-in on the target computer, make sure that the IP address
     of the default Web site is set to ALL UNASSIGNED.

  2. On the target computer, make sure that the IIS default Web site is running
     on port 80.

  3. On the target computer, make sure that the IIS default Web site is the
     only Web site that is running on port 80.

- Response.isClientConnected Error Message

When you run the wizard, you may receive the following error message:

  Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a01b6' Object doesn't support this
  property or method: 'Response.isClientConnected'

The cause of this error message may be an extra, outdated ASP DLL on your source
computer. To see if this is the case, open the \WINNT\System32\Inetsrv folder on
the source computer and look for a folder named ASP and a file named Asp.dll. If
the Inetsrv folder contains an ASP folder and an Asp.dll file, follow these
steps:

  1. In the Services program in Control Panel, stop the IIS Admin Service. This
     also stops the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol
     (HTTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) services.

  2. Back up the ASP folder and its contents to another location on your hard
     drive. If the new Asp.dll does not work properly, you can then restore the
     ASP folder to its original location.

  3. In the Inetsrv folder, delete the ASP folder.

  4. In the Services program in Control Panel, restart the IIS Admin Service.

  5. Verify that script mappings are correct at each level on which you have
     defined an application. To do this, in the IIS snap-in, open the property
     sheets for each application root folder and click the Home Directory tab.
     Under Application Settings, click Configuration, and verify that the
     script mappings reference \inetsrv\asp.dll.

  6. In the Services program in Control Panel, restart the FTP, HTTP, and SMTP
     services.

- Stalling on Netscape Source Servers

The IIS Migration Wizard may stall while it creates the migration archive on
Netscape source servers. This occurs when the connection timeout value on the
Netscape source server is too short. To correct this problem, use the Netscape
Server Administrator to increase the value of HTTP Persistent Connection Timeout
under Server Preferences/Performance Tuning.
