-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have increased the number of Systems Management Server (SMS) computers at
your site, you may have increased the number of connection accounts that the SMS
provider is using. To make the change, you would have modified the Smsprov.mof
file to increase the maximum SQL connections entry (MaxSQLConnections).

If you install SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or Service Pack 3 (SP3), this resets
the number of connections from your custom value back to the default value of
60.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, increase the connections again by using the
appropriate method, which is determined by whether or not you have Microsoft
Systems Management Server, and Microsoft SQL Server on the same computer.

SMS and SQL on the Same Computer
--------------------------------

If SMS and SQL are on the same computer, the SMS provider is located in this
computer. Modify the following entry

  MaxSQLConnections=60

in the Smsprov.mof file, which is located on SMS site server, in the
SMS\bin\i386, or SMS\bin\Alpha folder.

SMS and SQL on Different Computers
----------------------------------

1. If SMS and SQL are not on the same computer, and the SMS provider is located
  in the SQL computer, the Smsprov.mof file is located in the
  &lt;X&gt;:\SMSprov\MOFs\sitecode folder. Compile this file only, and not the
  Smsprov.mof file that is located in the SMS\Bin\I386 or SMS\Bin\Alpha folder
  on the SMS site server. If you do so, you may receive the following error
  message when you click Remote Control in Collections:

  A database could not be found with the name supplied.

2. Open the Smsprov.mof file with a text editor, and then locate the following
  lines:

  / *************************************
  // SMS_ConfigData : SMS Provider Configuration data
  // *************************************

  [singleton]
  class SMS_ConfigData
  {
  // Number of instances returned as a batch to CIMOM for query results
  [Description("Undocumented - do not change")]
  uint32 QueryInstanceBatchCount = 0;

  // Max number of SQL connections allowed at one time by the provider
  [Description("Undocumented - do not change")]
  uint32 MaxSQLConnections = 60;
  };

By default, the MaxSQLConnections setting is equal to 60. Change this to a higher
number based on the number of SMS Administrator Console users. Even if you enter
a higher number (Default connection=75) during the SMS installation, it does not
update the number in this file. You have to update this manually.

3. After you make this change, follow these steps to compile this file:

  a. Go to the Mofcomp.exe file, which is located in the
     %SystemRoot%\System32\WBEM folder.

  b. Copy the Mofcomp.exe file to the folder that contains the Smsprov.mof
     file.

  c. Run the following command:

  mofcomp smsprov.mof

The output from the command looks like this:

  Microsoft (R) 32-bit MOF Compiler Version 1.10.698.0000
  Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp. 1997. All rights reserved.
  Parsing MOF file: smsprov.mof
  MOF file has been successfully parsed
  Storing data in the repository...
  Done!

4. Update the SQL 6.5, or SQL 7.0 user connection configuration based on step
  3.

  In SQL 6.5:

  a. Start SQL Enterprise Manager, right-click your SQL server, and then click
     Configure.

  b. On the Configuration tab, locate the User Connections row, and then update
     the "Current user connections" number with a higher number.

  c. Click Apply Now, then click OK.

  d. Right-click your SQL server, and then click Stop.

  e. Right-click your SQL server, and then click Start.

In SQL 7.0:

  a. Start SQL Enterprise Manager, right-click your SQL server, and then click
     Properties.

  b. Click the Connection tab.

  c. Update the "Maximum concurrent user connections" number to a higher
     number, or 0 (0 = unlimited).

  d. Click Apply, and then click Yes to stop, and restart SQL 7.0.
