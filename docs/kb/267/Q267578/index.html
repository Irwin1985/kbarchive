  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a Dr. Watson error message in Lsass.exe on a Windows NT 4.0
based server in a Microsoft Windows 2000-based domain.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in Lsass.exe performing security ID (SID) to name lookups in
a Windows 2000-based domain which causes heap corruption. The problem occurs in
some circumstances when a deleted domain SID is the first in a list of
permissions or local groups on the Windows NT 4.0 member server and there is an
Lsa Lookup SID to Name request to the Windows 2000 Domain Controller and the SID
no longer exists in the Domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack that
contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

NOTE: If the Windows NT 4.0 Hotfix is installed on the Windows NT 4.0 member
servers, then it is not neccesary to install the Windows 2000 Hotfix on the
Windows 2000 domain controllers.

You should install the Windows 2000 hotfix only on the domain controllers. To
implement this fix, install the hotfix and add the following value in the
registry on the Windows 2000-based domain controllers.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: LsaLookupReturnSidTypeDeleted
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Hexidecimal
  Value: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor and reboot the computer.
