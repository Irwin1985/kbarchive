-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
- Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Visual InterDev, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 or Internet Information
Server (IIS) 4.0 with the FrontPage Server Extensions and with a Verisign or
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) certificate, attempting to open Web sites in the
FrontPage 98 client or Visual InterDev through HTTPS may fail. The root
certificate authority is not recognized as a trusted authority, and therefore,
the connection is not allowed. However, if the Web site is viewed in a browser,
such as Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1 or later, you can view the Web site without
problems.

CAUSE
=====

The FrontPage 98 client and Visual InterDev only support a few select
Certificate Authorities. The FrontPage 98 client and Visual InterDev only
support 40-bit encryption. Verisign has changed their original 40-bit
certificate, which causes FrontPage 98 and Visual InterDev to not recognize the
Root CA as a trusted authority.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  

  File Name    Size     Date       Time     Version     Platform
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Fp30wec.dll  413,968  12/6/2000  3:22 PM  3.0.2.4806  x86



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For another way to resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Create a new certificate request on the IIS 4.0 or 5.0 server.

2. Submit the request to Verisign, and make sure that "IBM" is selected as the
  server type, as opposed to "Microsoft" (contact Verisign for help obtaining
  this certificate).

3. Make sure that the previous certificate has been removed from the Key
  Manager, and make sure to "Commit All Changes" afterwards.

4. When the new certificate has been received from Verisign, install the
  certificate to the appropriate Web site.

5. In a browser, test HTTPS access. In FrontPage 98 or Visual InterDev, test
  HTTPS access again.

This resolution should provide access to the Web site from FrontPage 98 and
Visual InterDev through HTTPS.
