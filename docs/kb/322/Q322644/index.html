Last Modified: 22-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Windows Services for UNIX 2.0, and you use the tnadmin command
with either the -s, the -k, or the -m parameter to remotely administer a Telnet
server that is running Windows Services for UNIX 3.0, the command may not work.
Alternatively, this command may not work if you are using Windows Services for
UNIX 3.0 to administer a Telnet server that is running Windows Services for UNIX
2.0 or if you are using Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 to administer a Telnet
server that is running Windows Services for UNIX 2.0.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of changes to Telnet Server that occur if you apply
the Q301514 hotfix that is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q301514 Memory Leak in Telnet Server

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, apply the Q301514 hotfix that is described in the
preceding section to all computers that are running Windows Services for UNIX
2.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The usage requirements for the following tnadmin command parameters have
changed:

- -s: List sessions
- -k: Kill sessions
- -m: Send message

The Q301514 hotfix includes security fixes that affect how these parameters are
used. To use these parameters, you must be an administrator on the remote
computer. If you use a parameter other than the parameters that are described in
this section with the tnadmin command, you can pass credentials on the command
line; however, the parameters that are described in this section do not allow
you to pass credentials because of security limitations.

Operational Functionality
-------------------------

- If you are using Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 without the hotfix to
  administer a server that is running Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 with the
  hotfix, the tnadmin command with any of the parameters described in the
  "Summary" section of this article does not work.

- If you are using Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 without the hotfix to
  administer a server that is running Windows Services for UNIX 3.0, the
  tnadmin command with any of the parameters described in the "Summary" section
  of this article does not work.

- If you are using Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 with the hotfix to administer
  a server that is running Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 with the hotfix, the
  tnadmin command with any of the parameters described in the "Summary" section
  of this article works as expected.

- If you are using Windows Services for UNIX 2.0 with the hotfix to administer
  a server that is running Windows Services for UNIX 3.0, the tnadmin command
  with any of the parameters described in the "Summary" section of this article
  works as expected.
