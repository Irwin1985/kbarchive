Clean Boot Your Computer
------------------------

Use a clean boot to restart your computer and see if the issue persists. A clean
boot is a way to create a clean environment. When you start your computer with a
clean boot, Microsoft Windows starts and loads only basic devices and services.
For more information about how to use a clean boot, see the "Reference" section
later in this article.

To restart your computer with a clean boot, follow the steps that are appropriate
to your operating system.

Windows XP:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click
  OK.

3. Click the General tab, and then click Selective Startup.

4. Click to clear the following check boxes under Selective Startup:

  Process SYSTEM.INI file
  Process WIN.INI file
  Load Startup Items

5. Click the Services tab, click to select the "Hide All Microsoft Services"
  check box, and then click Disable All.

6. Click OK, and then click Restart to restart the computer.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click "Normal Startup -
load all device drivers and services" on the General tab in the System
Configuration Utility, click OK, and then click Restart to restart the
computer.

Windows Me:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click
  OK.

3. Click the General tab, and then click Selective Startup.

4. Click to clear all of the check boxes under Selective Startup.

5. On the Startup tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box, click OK, and
  then click Yes when you receive a prompt to restart the computer.


6. After the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without
  the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the check boxes you cleared in the General tab are
still cleared. If you see a check box that is selected but unavailable (it is
dimmed and has a check mark in it), your computer is not clean-booted, and you
may require assistance from the manufacturer of the program that is listed next
to the selected, unavailable check box.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click Normal Startup on
the General tab in the System Configuration Utility, click OK, and then restart
the computer.

Windows 98:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click System Information.

2. On the Tools menu, click System Configuration Utility.

3. Click the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:

  Process Config.sys file
  Process Autoexec.bat file
  Process Winstart.bat file (if available)
  Process Win.ini file
  Load Startup group items

4. Click OK, and then restart the computer.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click Normal Startup on
the General tab in the System Configuration Utility, click OK, and then restart
the computer.
