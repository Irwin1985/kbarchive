SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to download and use the Internet
Information Services (IIS) 5.0 Process Recycling Tool (IIS5Recycle) version 1.0,
which was released in June 2001.

Introduction
------------

IIS5Recycle version 1.0 runs as a service on a computer that is running Microsoft
Windows 2000 and IIS 5.0. The purpose of IIS5Recycle is to recycle processes,
minimizing the effects of resource-consumption problems before performance and
reliability are affected. This tool automatically recycles IIS processes based
on configurations that are stored in the Windows registry. With IIS5Recycle,
administrators can also gather information for use in troubleshooting processes
and applications.

The following example illustrates how IIS5Recycle can be used to recycle
processes and to gather information:

Minimizing consumption caused by memory leaks:

A Web administrator suspects that Web applications that are running on the
servers are leaking memory. The administrator schedules periodic recycling of
IIS processes to release resources that are consumed by the leaking Web
applications. The administrator can troubleshoot a Web application by using the
Advanced Scripting feature. The administrator gathers and logs information about
a problematic Web application before IIS is recycled. While the Web site
continues to serve the customer, a developer can analyze the logs.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install IIS5Recycle:

1. Create a directory on drive C named IIS5Recycle:

  a. On the Windows 2000 desktop, right-click My Computer, and then click
     Explore.

  b. Click to select drive C.

  c. On the File menu, click New, and then click Folder. In the right pane, a
     folder named New Folder appears and is selected.

  d. Type "IIS5Recycle" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.
     This renames the New Folder folder to IIS5Recycle.

2. Download IIS5Recycle.exe to your computer and extract the files to the
  C:\IIS5Recycle directory:

  a. Visit the following Microsoft Web site to download the IIS 5.0 Process
     Recycling Tool:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=31106

  b. Under Download Now, click Iis5Recycle.exe - 98 Kb, and then follow the
     download instructions.

  c. Run or double-click IIS5Recycle.exe to extract the tool and the Readme
     document.

3. Open a command prompt and change to the IIS5Recycle directory.

4. Type "IIS5Recycle /install" (without the quotation marks).

5. Type "IIS5Recycle /config" (without the quotation marks) to configure the
  recycling conditions. To select the IIS recycle configuration options, click
  to select the check box for the particular option that you want to use. When
  you select one or more options, you must supply a number (that is, a value)
  for each option.

For more information about the configuration options, see the "Functionality and
Configuration" section.

6. Set your recycle options, and then type "net start IIS5recycle" (without the
  quotation marks) to start the IIS5Recycle service.

NOTE: You must restart your computer for the registry keys to appear.

NOTE: You can stop the IIS5Recycle service by typing "net stop IIS5recycle"
(without the quotation marks).

Functionality and Configuration
-------------------------------

With IIS5Recycle, administrators can set criteria for the automatic recycling of
IIS processes and stop IIS when recycling fails. The default interval between
the time that the IIS5Recycle tools checks these values is either 15 minutes or
what the QueryIISMinutes key is set to in the registry.

Configure IIS5Recycle:

IIS5Recycle automatically recycles IIS processes based on the following
criteria:

- IIS up time: Recycles IIS after it has been running for a configured number
  of hours.

- Total HTTP requests served: Recycles IIS based on the total number of
  requests served, as recorded by the Get Request performance counter.

- Time of day or week: Recycles IIS based on a specific day or time.

To configure this option, click Add, click either Daily or Weekly, and then type
a time based on a 24:00 clock. If you click Weekly, you must also select a day
of the week (Monday through Sunday) and a number of weeks before IIS is recycled
on the selected day. For example, you can configure the IIS5Recycle tool to run
every two weeks on Sunday at 22:59.

To remove a date or time setting, click Remove.

To modify a date or time setting, click Edit.

- Virtual memory usage: Recycles IIS based on the total virtual memory usage
  that is recorded by Inetinfo.exe and by Dllhost.exe for out-of-process
  applications.

- ASP requests queued: Recycles IIS if the total number of Active Server Pages
  (ASP) requests that are queued is greater than the configured value after a
  determined number of retries.

  You can configure retries by adding a registry key named ASPThresholdRetries.
  For more information about how to add and set this key, see the "Registry
  Settings" section.

- Recycle IIS at the next quiet time: Recycles the IIS service at the next
  quiet time threshold. To configure this setting, add and set a registry key
  named QuietTimeRequestsNumber. The default value is 10, which means that a
  quiet time occurs whenever the GET requests per second fall to 10 or lower.

For more information about how to add and set registry keys, see the "Registry
Settings" section. Note that you must restart your computer after you install
the tool for the registry keys to appear.

Stop IIS with IIS5Recycle:

IIS5Recycle forcefully stops IIS if a recycle request is unsuccessful after a
configurable amount of time. This functionality makes sure that IIS is recycled
when a recycle threshold is met. The registry key for this feature is
IISStopTimeoutSecs.

NoRealRecycle Feature
---------------------

With the NoRealRecycle feature, you can run the IIS5Recycle tool in an audit-only
mode without interrupting the IIS service. When you use the audit-only mode, IIS
recycling events are stored in the Windows event log and can be used to assess
IIS recycling conditions that can be configured for your Web server. An
administrator can use this feature to fine-tune the recycle settings based on
application and environment specifics that are gathered during the audit-only
mode run. To turn on this feature, add the following registry value:

  Value name: NoRealRecycle
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Value data: 1

To turn off this feature, set the NoRealRecycle key to 0 in the registry.

Advanced Control/Scripting Feature
----------------------------------

With the Advanced Control/Scripting feature, administrators can specify commands
(or scripts) to run before and after each IIS5Recycle execution.

On the IIS5Recycle screen, click Advanced to open the Advanced Control window. In
the resulting window, you can add commands to run before or after IIS is
recycled, and you can also add a timeout value for these commands.

The return value of the Before Command section is verified if the Verify Return
Value check box is selected. The output of the script is redirected to a log
file under %windir%\System32\Logfiles\Iis5recycle. If the script does not return
the expected value, the current recycle is skipped.

NOTE: On a system that uses Windows Load Balancing Service (WLBS), the script is
executed after WLBS stops and before WLBS starts.

If you do not see the expected output in the log file, verify that the script
name is correct and that it is copied to the %windir%\system32 directory. If the
script must access any other executable files, make sure that all of those files
are also located in the %windir%\system32 directory.

NLB Support
-----------

IIS5Recycle removes the Web server from the cluster (Web farm) on a system that
is using Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) before it recycles the IIS
process. Each time a server is taken out of a cluster, connections to the Web
server are drained. After the connection number drops below the configured
threshold or the specified time passes, the IIS service is recycled. You can
configure the default behavior of this feature by adding and setting the
following registry keys:

- %WLBSDrainWaitSecs%

- %WLBSDrainStopConnectionNum%

- %WLBSWaterMark%

See the "Appendix: Registry Settings" section for more information about these
values.

The WaterMark feature guarantees that the number of servers in the cluster will
always be more than the value that is set for WLBSWaterMark in the registry.
There are two requirements to use the WaterMark feature:

- The remote control on each WLBS host must be turned on. If a password is
  required for remote control, each node must use the same password.

- NLB Web farms that do not use WLBS must be able to use the Advance
  Control/Scripting feature.

Recovery
--------

The Service Control Manager (SCM), which is available through the Computer
Management MMC snap-in, can be configured to take an action when a service fails
unexpectedly. The IIS5Recycle service uses this feature as a fatal error
notification and recovery method. When you configure the recovery actions for
the IIS5Recycle service, the administrator is notified if an unrecoverable event
occurs on the Web server. If any of the following failures occur, the
IIS5Recycle service terminates itself to do the SCM recovery actions:

- An IIS process stops and IIS5Recycle cannot start it after several retries.

- On a system that uses clustering, the server is removed from the cluster, and
  IIS5Recycle cannot restart WLBS.

In both cases, an event is logged in the Windows event log.

Appendix: Registry Settings
---------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
All IIS5Recycle configuration settings are stored in the registry under the
following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\IIs5Recycle

IIS5Recycle picks up all registry changes automatically.

You can configure the following entries by using the user interface in the
IIS5Recycle Tool:

   Name: RunningHours
