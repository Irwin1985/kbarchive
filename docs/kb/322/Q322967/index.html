-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 service pack or a
client-side software distribution hotfix, clients may not upgrade their software
distribution client component. The symptoms of this problem may include:

- The Software Distribution component in the SMS Control Panel tool shows a
  status of "Repair Pending."

- The client's Ccim32.log file in the %Windir%\MS\SMS\Logs folder contains the
  following entries:

  Component "Software Distribution" needs to be upgraded
  OS Version has changed since the last install of component "Software
  Distribution"
  Component "Software Distribution" install/verify/upgrade last done at 08:42:31
  November 21, 2001
  Client core file version (from cliver.exe) is 2.00.1493.4006
  Warning: Inbox manager token file found
  (\\SERVER01\CAP_SO1\clicomp.box\SWDist\inboxlck.tok), waiting 10 seconds for
  directory refresh to finish...
  Warning: Directory still in use by inbox manager; skipping operations
  Warning - could not find a site CAP with uplevel version of component Software
  Distribution

- The server's Inboxmgr.log file in the \SMS\Logs folder contains the following
  entry:

  Failed to copy X:\SMS\inboxes\clicomp.src\SWDist\i386\swdist32.exe to
  X:\CAP_SO1\clicomp.box\SWDist\i386\swdist32.exe because of sharing violation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue:

- Stop the SMS_INBOX_MANAGER component on the site server by using SMS Service
  Manager.

- Use Computer Management or Server Manager to close all open file connections
  on \CAP_&lt;xxx&gt;\Clicomp.box\SWDist. Repeat this step for all client
  access points (CAPs) that exhibit the issue.

- Start the SMS_INBOX_MANAGER component on the site server. Verify that the
  component copies the updated Swdist32.exe file. You can see this in the
  Inboxmgr.log file:

  Copying X:\SMS\inboxes\clicomp.src\SWDist\i386\swdist32.exe to
  X:\CAP_S01\clicomp.box\SWDist\i386\swdist32.exe, OK

Note that the Swdist32.exe file in the CAP_S01\Clicomp.box\SWDist\I386 folder on
the CAP should have the same date, size, and version number as the Swdist32.exe
file in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist\I386 folder on the site server.
