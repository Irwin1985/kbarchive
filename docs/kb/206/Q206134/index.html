-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, on platform(s):
   - the hardware: Intel x86 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 on a small computer system
interface (SCSI) system with an Iomega Jaz drive that can be used as a bootable
device, Windows NT Setup does not recognize the drive as a fixed disk.
Installation to the Jaz drive will not succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, set the computer's BIOS boot sequence so that SCSI is
recognized first.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. In the regular CMOS, set the boot sequence to be as follows:

  SCSI,A:,C:

  NOTE: The Jaz-Jet SCSI has a basic input/output system (BIOS) also, and you
  can press CTRL+A to get to it upon startup. You must enable support for the
  removable media under this BIOS.

2. Boot from one of the three Windows NT Setup disks.

  NOTE: If you attempt to install from the CD-ROM first, Setup does not
  recognize the Jaz drive as an installable drive. Also, disable the integrated
  device electronics (IDE) hard drive in CMOS. After Setup is complete, you are
  still able to see the IDE drive from Windows NT.

3. In Windows NT Setup, select the option for the Jaz drive to recognize mass
  storage (IDE) in order to see the CD-ROM so you can run the rest of Setup.

4. In the same folder as Setup, press S to recognize SCSI devices.

5. Insert the Windows NT disk that comes with the Jaz drive.

6. Proceed with the rest of the installation. You should be able to boot from
  the Jaz drive and also see your IDE hard drive when the computer restarts.
