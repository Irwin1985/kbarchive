-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear when you attempt to recover a deleted
Public Folder; the message appears even if you had proper permissions on the
folder before it was deleted:

  Outlook was unable to recover some or all of the items in this folder.
  Make sure you have the required permissions to recover items in this
  folder, and try again. If the problem persists, contact your
  administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the public folder involved is a subfolder and the Windows
NT account that you are currently logged in as does not have the proper
permissions on the parent folder.

You do not have the correct permissions to create objects in the parent folder.
With delete permissions on the subfolder, you can delete the folder but you must
have delete permissions on the parent folder in order to recover the deleted
folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

Either the owner of the parent folder can recover the item or they must grant
permissions to the subfolder owner.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
