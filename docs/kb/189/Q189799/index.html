SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the purpose and functionality of the Fpexedll.dll. This
file is an Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) filter that
is installed with the FrontPage Server Extensions or SharePoint Team Services on
a Web server based on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).

The following questions are answered:

  
  What is Fpexedll.dll?

  Do I need to use Fpexedll.dll?

  When should I remove IIS references to Fpexedll.dll?

  Where is Fpexedll.dll physically stored?

  How do I remove references to Fpexedll.dll from IIS 4.0 and later?

  How do I remove references to Fpexedll.dll from IIS 2.0 or IIS 3.0?

MORE INFORMATION
================

What is Fpexedll.dll?
---------------------

The Fpexedll.dll file is installed with the FrontPage Server Extensions on
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) to provide backward compatibility
with Microsoft FrontPage for Windows, version 1.1, and Microsoft FrontPage for
the Macintosh, version 1.0.

When authoring on an IIS-based Web server, FrontPage versions 1.0 and 1.1 make
requests for the older CGI-based Server Extension files (Shtml.exe, Author.exe,
and Admin.exe) rather than the newer ISAPI-based files (Shtml.dll, Author.dll,
and Admin.dll) as they are known in FrontPage 97 and later. The Fpexedll.dll
filter examines every HTTP request coming into the system and, if a request is
for one of the CGI-based executable files, the Fpexedll.dll filter converts the
URL so that the corresponding ISAPI-based dynamic-link library (.dll) file is
called.

Do I need to use Fpexedll.dll?
------------------------------

The Fpexedll.dll ISAPI filter only provides backward-compatibility with FrontPage
versions 1.0 and 1.1. If you are not using these versions of FrontPage, you do
not need to use this filter. You can safely remove any references to the filter
from your IIS configuration.

NOTE: There is no need to physically delete the DLL file from your hard disk.

When should I remove IIS references to Fpexedll.dll?
----------------------------------------------------

- If there are two references to the Fpexedll.dll file listed in your IIS
  configuration, remove one of them. The remaining reference should point to
  the correct location of Fpexedll.dll, depending on which version of the
  FrontPage Server Extensions is installed.

- If there is only one reference to Fpexedll.dll, make sure that no clients are
  authoring against the server using either FrontPage 1.0 or FrontPage 1.1. If
  there are no such clients, you can remove the reference to Fpexedll.dll. It
  serves no functional purpose and could theoretically slow requests that are
  processed by IIS.

NOTE: There is no need to physically delete the DLL file from your hard disk.

Where is Fpexedll.dll physically stored?
----------------------------------------

The physical location of Fpexedll.dll depends on the version of the FrontPage
Server Extensions that you are using:

- FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions or SharePoint Team Services from Microsoft

  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server
  Extensions\50\Bin\Fpexedll.dll

- FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions

  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server
  Extensions\40\Bin\Fpexedll.dll

- FrontPage 98 Server Extensions

  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\version3.0\Bin\Fpexedll.dll

- FrontPage 97 Server Extensions

  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\Bin\Fpexedll.dll

The location of any references to Fpexedll.dll depends on the version of IIS that
you are using:

- IIS versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.1

  In the Master WWW properties under ISAPI Filters.

  NOTE: If you are using FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions, there may be
  references in the ISAPI Filters list for each Web site that has the Server
  Extensions installed. For additional information, please see the "References"
  section later in this article.

- IIS versions 2.0 and 3.0

  In the following registry subkey:

  

  \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3svc\Parameters\Filter dlls

How do I remove references to Fpexedll.dll from IIS 4.0 and later?
------------------------------------------------------------------

To remove references for Fpexedll.dll from an server based on IIS 4.0 and later,
follow these steps:

1. Open the Internet Services Manager. To do this, follow the steps for your
  version of IIS.

   - For IIS 4.0:

     a. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, and then click "Windows
        NT 4.0 Option Pack".

     b. Click Microsoft Internet Information Server.

     c. Select Internet Service Manager.

   - For IIS 5.0:

     a. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, and then click
        Administrative Tools.

     b. Select Internet Services Manager.

   - For IIS 5.1:

     a. Open Control Panel.

     b. Double-click Administrative Tools.

     c. Double-click Internet Information Services.

2. Right-click the computer name and then click Properties on the menu that
  appears.

3. Click Edit to edit the Master Properties for the WWW Service.

4. Click the ISAPI Filters tab.

5. Select Fpexedll.dll and click Remove. There may be more than one entry;
  remove them all.

NOTE: If you are using FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions, there may be references
in the ISAPI Filters list for each Web site that has the Server Extensions
installed. In that case, repeat this procedure for each Web site that does not
need the Fpexedll.dll reference. For additional information, please see the
"References" section later in this article.

NOTE: There is no need to physically delete the DLL file from your hard drive.

How do I remove references to Fpexedll.dll from IIS 2.0 or IIS 3.0?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To remove Fpexedll.dll from a server based on IIS 2.0 or 3.0, follow these
steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "Regedt32" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

3. Locate the following registry subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/W3SVC/Parameters/Filter Dlls

4. Double-click this subkey to edit it.

5. Delete the reference to the Fpexedll.dll file and, if necessary, the
  semicolon (";") separator between it and the next filter. For example, for
  FrontPage 98 delete the following:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\version3.0\bin\Fpexedll.dll;

  Do not delete references to other DLLs that precede or follow the reference to
  the Fpexedll.dll file.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: There is no need to physically delete the DLL file from your hard disk.
