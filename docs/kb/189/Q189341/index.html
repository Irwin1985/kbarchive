-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

The Exchange Administrator program retains the memory of which Exchange servers
it was connected to, and at the start of a new session it re- connects to all
servers that were open at the end of the last session.

This convenience may become an annoyance if some of the servers are no longer
available or are located across slow links. In such cases, the startup time for
Exchange Administrator may be lengthened considerably while the slow-to-respond
or unavailable servers time out.

You can prevent Exchange Administrator from searching for servers, or you can
reset the drop-down list of servers by the methods described below.

The Connect to Server settings are saved separately for each logon to each
administrative workstation. You cannot globally reset these lists all at once
for all administrators on all computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent Exchange Administrator from trying to connect to a server at startup
of its next session, choose File.Close while the server name is displayed in the
Connect to Server drop-down box at the left edge of the toolbar. The server is
still available on the drop-down list of previously connected servers, but
Administrator will not try to connect to the server until you select it.

To clear the list of servers previously connected to, do the following:

1. Run a single local session of Exchange Administrator. If multiple
  Administrator sessions are open, this process will not work.

2. In Exchange Administrator, use File.Close to close all windows for all
  servers, leaving a blank workspace.

3. Exit Exchange Administrator.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
  require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee
  that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
  solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
  Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
  Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
  Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
  If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair
  Disk (ERD).

4. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

5. Go to:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\MSExchangeAdmin\Desktop
  

6. Highlight the Servers value and delete it to clear the entire servers list.
  This key will be re-created the next time you run Exchange Administrator.
  Alternately, you may edit the Servers value and add or remove specific server
  names.

7. Quit Registry Editor.

8. Restart Exchange Administrator, and connect to the server of your choice.
