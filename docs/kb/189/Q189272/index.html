The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A computer running Internet Information Server (IIS) may be vulnerable to attack
if the following conditions are true:

- IIS is configured to allow users to upload content using RFC 1867 methods,
  such as Posting Acceptor.

- The directory that users can upload to has both Write access and Execute
  permissions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Folders that are used for file uploading, such as folders used with Posting
Acceptor, need to be given Write access in the Internet Service Manager (ISM)
snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). If Execute permissions are
also granted in the ISM, a malicious user could upload an executable file and
run it on the computer running IIS.

When you attempt to apply both Write access and Execute permissions to a folder,
you receive the following warning message:

  WARNING - By setting both the Write and Execute permissions,
  you are potentially exposing this site to malicious attack.
  A destructive or intrusive program could be uploaded and
  then executed. Are you sure you want to do this?

If you click Yes, you potentially expose the server to attack.

To prevent malicious attack, never allow Write and Execute permissions on an NTFS
volume exposed to the Internet. As an additional level of security, set the IIS
SSIExecDisable property to True on the IIS Web server to disable Server-Side
Includes (SSI) from executing.

To disable SSI from executing on a server with Windows Script Host (WSH) enabled,
follow these steps:

1. At the command prompt, change to the IIS AdminSamples folder. By default,
  this folder is in %SystemRoot%\System32\InetSrv\AdminSamples

2. Type the following command, and then press Enter: cscript.exe adsutil.vbs set
  w3svc/SSIExecDisable True

On a server without WSH installed, the following sample code can be called from
Visual Basic or ASP:

     Dim oServer
     Set oServer = GetObject("IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC")
     oServer.SSIExecDisable = True
     oServer.SetInfo
     Set oServer = Nothing
