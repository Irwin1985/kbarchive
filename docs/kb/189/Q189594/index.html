PPTP upgrade and the RRAS upgrade.

For more information, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q189595
  TITLE : PPTP Performance &amp; Security Upgrade for WinNT 4.0 Release Notes

This release includes the features and fixes from both the Routing and Remote
Access Hotfix Update 1.0 and 2.0 releases and is packaged in an auto-install
format. Copy the Upgrade to a temporary directory, and double-click the
executable name or type the executable name "rrasfixi.exe" for x86, or
"rrasfixa.exe" for alpha at a command prompt to install.

The files can also be extracted from the Upgrade pack without installing them. To
do this, copy the Upgrade to a temporary directory, and type "rrasfixi /x" or
"rrasfixa /x" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt. After
extracting the files, the Upgrade can be installed by typing "hotfix" (without
the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

To uninstall this upgrade, extract the files to a directory using the "/x"
command as mentioned above and then type "HOTFIX -Y" (without the quotation
marks) from the same directory you copied the files to.

Output of "HOTFIX -?" :

HOTFIX [-y] [-f] [-n] [-z] [-q] [-m] [-l]

     -y Perform uninstall (only with -m or -q)
     -f Force apps closed at shutdown
     -n Do not create uninstall directory
     -z Do not reboot when update completes
     -q Quiet Mode -- no user interface
     -m Unattended mode
     -l List installed hotfixes

Security Features in this Upgrade
---------------------------------

This upgrade provides several RAS/PPTP security enhancements for the Routing and
Remote Access Upgrade for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server. This upgrade also
includes the performance improvements and other fixes that were included in
previously released hotfixes.

- A new version of MSCHAP (MSCHAP V2) has been implemented for VPN connections.
  This new protocol provides mutual authentication, stronger initial data
  encryption keys, and different encryption keys for the transmit and receive
  paths. To minimize the risk of password compromise during MSCHAP exchanges,
  MSCHAP V2 drops support for the MSCHAP password change V1, and will not
  transmit the LMHash encoding of the password.

  For VPN connection requests, a Windows NT server offers MSCHAP V2 before
  offering the legacy MSCHAP. Updated Windows clients (all platforms) accepts
  MSCHAP V2 when it is offered. This behavior affects only VPN connections;
  dial-up connections are not affected.

- A new registry key, SecureVPN, has been defined to force use of MSCHAP V2.
  When this variable is absent it has a default value of zero. When set to one
  on a Windows NT server, this registry key causes the server to drop any VPN
  connections that do not authenticate using MSCHAP V2. This prevents legacy
  VPN clients from presenting their credentials in an MSCHAP (or CHAP or PAP)
  exchange, and is a likely configuration for networks that require a more
  secure authentication method for VPN connections.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP

  DWORD: SecureVPN
  Value: 0x00000001 == force MSCHAP V2 for VPN connections
  Value: 0x00000000 == do not force secure MSCHAP V2 (default)

  When set to one on a Windows NT 4.0 client, the SecureVPN registry key forces
  the client to use MSCHAP V2 for all VPN (PPTP) connections. Dial-up
  connections are not affected by this registry setting.

  NOTE: Most users do not need to use the Secure VPN flag. This flag should be
  used with care because it affects the behavior of all VPN connections from a
  client. In general, the required use of MSCHAP V2 can be enforced more easily
  on the server.

- This release also provides a registry variable, UseLmPassword, which can be
  set to prevent clients from sending the LM response to a legacy MSCHAP
  challenge or in an MSCHAP change password exchange. When this variable is
  absent it has a default value of one, allowing use of the LM response (in
  order to maintain compatibility with legacy systems).

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\Chap

  DWORD: UseLmPassword
  Value: 0x00000001 == send LMHash of the password (default)
  Value: 0x00000000 == do not send LMHash of the password

  Setting this variable to zero on a server causes the server to drop any
  connection request which uses the LM response in an MSCHAP exchange. Setting
  this variable to zero on a client prevents the client from using LM responses
  in MSCHAP exchanges. This variable affects both dial-up and VPN connections.

  NOTE: Most users do not need to use this registry variable. The new secure
  mode MSCHAP V2 will not send the LMHash response, so this registry value is
  most useful when connecting to older access servers which use the original
  MSCHAP.

- Other fixes in this upgrade:

  Two-way authentication with Demand-Dial Interfaces has been corrected in this
  upgrade.

Fixes and Features included from Hotfix Update 2.0
--------------------------------------------------

NT Issues Performance Issues:

- This release includes an enhancement to TCP/IP that improves the performance
  of TCP-based applications over high latency and networks that experience high
  packet loss, such as the Internet.

Routing Issues:

- Added new Demand dial filters. You can now keep demand dial interfaces from
  dialing by setting filters using the Routemon.exe command with a new
  "Filtertype= Dial" option. The new syntax for this is the same for setting
  Input and Output filters using Routemon.exe, and can be seen by typing
  "routemon ip set filter /?" at a command prompt.

  The following is an example of the syntax used to prevent a demand dial
  interface from dialing:

  C:\&gt;routemon ip add filter myremoterouter dial 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
  0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 any

  C:\&gt;routemon ip set filter myremoterouter dial forward

  NOTE: The first example above is one line; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

  For more information on using the Routemon.exe command to set filters, please
  see the Routing and Remote Access Administrator's Guide.

- Added the capability to filter fragmented IP packets. Two registry keys
  control this functionality.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\IPFilterDriver\Parameters

  DWORD: EnableFragmentChecking
  Value: 0x00000001 == enables fragment checks
  Value: 0x00000000 == disables fragment checks (default)

  DWORD: DefaultForwardFragments
  Value: 0x00000001 == filterdriver forwards fragments (default)
  Value: 0x00000000 == filterdriver drops fragments if they don't match
  a previous header

- Changes were made to the Router's Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
  (RADIUS) client to resolve a duplicate Acct-Session-Id accounting problem, as
  well as an issue that caused the reversal of the Framed-IP-Address returned
  from a RADIUS server. In addition, the RADIUS client has been enhanced to now
  support the transmission of the NAS-Port-Type and Acct-Session-Time
  attributes.

- Resolved issue that used to cause an Access Violation notice when adding a
  Virtual Interface right after configuring an Area under OSPF routing.

- Adjusted the RIP Authentication type to 2 instead of 1, per RFC 1388.

  NOTE: This upgrade must be applied to all Routing and Remote Access routers if
  you are using RIP2 authentication.

- Resolved issue which could cause Mprouter to stop responding when doing an
  "ipconfig /release"

- Made an improvement that ensures that periodic RIP route updates resumes each
  time a demand-dial interface is reactivated.

Known Problems in the 2.0 Hotfix Update
---------------------------------------

- Although there is a checkbox in the Global IP Config dialog to enable/disable
  filtering, at this time the only functionality it has is to visually show you
  if any filters have been configured on your interface(s). Regardless, the
  filter driver is always enabled. In order to disable filtering on an
  interface, you must use the per interface option in the Interface IP Config
  dialog.

- Even though the "Filtertype= Dial" option has been properly configured for a
  demand dial interface using Routemon.exe, it may still be possible for that
  interface to dial. This only occurs if you are pinging from the command line
  of the Routing and RAS server in which the demand dial interface is
  configured.

Fixes and Features included from Hotfix Update 1.0
--------------------------------------------------

New Features Added in Hotfix 1.0:

- Allowing PPP clients to connect without authentication

  This can be accomplished by altering the default registry key as shown:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman\PPP

  DWORD: ForceEncryptedPassword
  Value: 0x00000003 == allows the server to accept incoming PPP clients
  without authentication.

- Using MS-CHAP with RADIUS authentication

  In order to enable MS-CHAP with RADIUS authentication, you must add a registry
  value:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman\PPP\CHAP

  DWORD: OfferMSCHAP
  Value: 0x00000001 == Once this is enabled every incoming PPP
  connection will be offered MS-CHAP, and MS-CHAP
  will be used to authenticate each PPP user
  against the RADIUS server that your RAS server
  is using.
