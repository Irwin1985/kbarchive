  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Account lockouts can be very difficult to track for several reasons. One reason
is that the bad password attempts are only recorded on the domain controller
that processed the logon attempt (this is for Microsoft Windows 95-based and
Microsoft Windows 98-based clients). Another problem is that, because Microsoft
Windows NT-based clients are capable of recording the information locally, a log
entry is not recorded on any domain controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

A relatively easy way to track bad password attempts in a domain is to install
the checked build of Netlogon.dll on the primary domain controller (PDC). This
creates a text file on the PDC that can be examined to determine which clients
are generating the bad password attempts, for both Windows NT-based and Windows
95-based clients.

The checked build of Netlogon.dll can be obtained from Microsoft Technical
Support and also in the Microsoft Driver Development Kit (DDK).


To install the checked build of Netlogon.dll on Windows NT 4.0:

1. Go to the &lt;Windir\System32&gt; folder.

2. Rename Netlogon.dll to Netlogon.fre.

3. Copy the checked version of Netlogon.dll to the &lt;System32&gt; folder.

4. Start Regedt32, and then locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon
  \Parameters\DBFlag

5. Change the DBFlag value to 0x4.

  NOTE: Setting DBFlag to 0x4 only records logon processing. Setting it to
  0x20000004 records the time stamp in addition to the logon event.

6. Quit Regedt32.

7. Restart the server.

8. Confirm that the debug directory was created under the &lt;Windir&gt; folder
  and contains a Netlogon.log file.

Examples
--------

In the examples below:

PORSCHE\example = User Account
TARGA =           BDC
928S4 =           Windows NT Workstation
928WIN95 =        Windows 95
911Turbo =        PDC

Different clients log different messages.

Windows NT Workstation:

[LOGON] SamLogon: Interactive logon of PORSCHE\example from 928S4 (via
  TARGA) Entered

[LOGON] SamLogon: Interactive logon of PORSCHE\example from 928S4 (via
  TARGA) Returns 0xC000006A

[LOGON] SamLogon: Interactive logon of PORSCHE\example from 928S4 (via
  TARGA) Entered

[LOGON] SamLogon: Interactive logon of PORSCHE\example from 928S4 (via
  TARGA) Returns 0xC0000234

In the above example, you can see where you try to log on, are unsuccessful with
a bad password, try to log on again, and then are unsuccessful with a locked out
account.

The only difference with Windows 95 and Windows 98 is the omission of the domain
name:

[LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of (null)\EXAMPLE from \\928WIN95 (via
  TARGA) Entered

[LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of (null)\EXAMPLE from \\928WIN95 (via
  TARGA) Returns 0xC000006A

[LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of (null)\EXAMPLE from \\928WIN95 (via
  TARGA) Entered

[LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of (null)\EXAMPLE from \\928WIN95 (via
  TARGA) Returns 0xC0000234

A successful account logon can resemble:

[LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of (null)\EXAMPLE from \\928WIN95 Entered

[LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of (null)\EXAMPLE from \\928WIN95 Returns
  0x0

[LOGON] NetrLogonUasLogon of EXAMPLE from 928WIN95 returns 0

The errors you most likely receive are:

  0xC0000234 User logon with Account Locked

  0xC000006A User logon with Misspelled or bad Password

  0xC0000072 User logon to account disabled by Administrator

  0xC0000193 User logon with Expired Account

  0xC0000070 User logon from unauthorized workstation

  0xC000006F User logon Outside authorized hours

  0xC0000224 User logon with "Change Password at Next Logon" flagged

  0xC0000071 User logon with Expired Password

  0xC0000064 User logon with Misspelled or Bad User Account

To track user account lockouts, only the 234 and 6A errors are important to us.

NOTE: These errors are only a partial listing. Ntstatus.h has all the 0xcxxxxxxx
listings.

After the workstation that has been sending the bad passwords has been
identified, the workstation can be configured correctly or the user can be
informed of the correct password.
