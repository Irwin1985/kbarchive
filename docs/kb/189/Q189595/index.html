Information on Installation
---------------------------

Microsoft has made improvements to the native Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
capabilities of Windows client and server that significantly improve the
performance and security PPTP-based VPN connections via the Internet for Windows
NT Server and Windows NT Workstation version 4.0.

This upgrade should be applied to both Windows NT Servers and Windows NT
Workstations version 4.0. Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0 must also be
installed before applying this update.

  Please note: Windows NT Servers running Routing and Remote Access Service
  (RRAS) must first apply this Windows NT PPTP performance upgrade followed by
  the RRAS Hotfix 3.0 to benefit from the upgrade (it is important not to
  reboot your machine in-between installations of the NT PPTP upgrade &amp; the
  Routing and Remote Access Service upgrade).

For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q189594
  TITLE : RRAS Upgrade for WinNT Server 4.0 Hotfix Pack 3.0 Release Notes

This upgrade is packaged in an auto-install format. It is recommended that you
first copy the upgrade to a temporary directory, and then double-click the
executable name or type the executable name "pptpfixi.exe" for x86 or
"pptpfixa.exe" (without the quotation marks) for alpha at a command prompt to
install.

The files can also be extracted from the Upgrade pack without installing them. To
do this, copy the Upgrade to a temporary directory, and type "pptpfixi /x" or
"pptpfixa /x" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt. After
extracting the files, the Upgrade can be installed by typing "hotfix" (without
the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

To uninstall this upgrade, extract the files to a directory using the "/x"
command as mentioned above and then type "HOTFIX -Y" (without the quotation
marks) from the same directory you copied the files to.

Output of "HOTFIX -?" :

HOTFIX [-y] [-f] [-n] [-z] [-q] [-m] [-l]

     -y Perform uninstall (only with -m or -q)
     -f Force apps closed at shutdown
     -n Do not create uninstall directory
     -z Do not reboot when update completes
     -q Quiet Mode -- no user interface
     -m Unattended mode
     -l List installed hotfixes

Security Features in this Upgrade
---------------------------------

This upgrade provides several RAS/PPTP security enhancements for Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0. This upgrade also includes the performance improvements and
other fixes that were included in previously released PPTP hotfixes for Windows
NT Service Pack 3.

- A new version of MSCHAP (MSCHAP V2) has been implemented for VPN connections.
  This new protocol provides mutual authentication, stronger initial data
  encryption keys, and different encryption keys for the transmit and receive
  paths. To minimize the risk of password compromise during MSCHAP exchanges,
  MSCHAP V2 drops support for the MSCHAP password change V1, and will not
  transmit the LMHash encoding of the password.

  For VPN connection requests, a Windows NT server will offer MSCHAP V2 before
  offering the legacy MSCHAP. Updated Windows clients (all platforms) will
  accept MSCHAP V2 when it is offered. This behavior affects only VPN
  connections; dial-up connections are not affected.

- A new registry key, SecureVPN, has been defined to force use of MSCHAP V2.
  When this variable is absent it has a default value of zero. When set to one
  on a Windows NT server, this registry key causes the server to drop any VPN
  connections that do not authenticate using MSCHAP V2. This will prevent
  legacy VPN clients from presenting their credentials in an MSCHAP (or CHAP or
  PAP) exchange, and is a likely configuration for networks that require a more
  secure authentication method for VPN connections.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP

  DWORD: SecureVPN
  Value: 0x00000001 == force MSCHAP V2 for VPN connections
  Value: 0x00000000 == do not force secure MSCHAP V2 (default)

  When set to one on a Windows NT 4.0 client, the SecureVPN registry key forces
  the client to use MSCHAP V2 for all VPN (PPTP) connections. Dial-up
  connections are not affected by this registry setting.

  Please note: Most users will not need to use the Secure VPN flag. This flag
  should be used with care because it will affect the behavior of all VPN
  connections from a client. In general, the required use of MSCHAP V2 can be
  enforced more easily on the server.

- This release also provides a registry variable, UseLmPassword, which can be
  set to prevent clients from sending the LM response to a legacy MSCHAP
  challenge or in an MSCHAP change password exchange. When this variable is
  absent it has a default value of one, allowing use of the LM response (in
  order to maintain compatibility with legacy systems).

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\Chap

  DWORD: UseLmPassword
  Value: 0x00000001 == send LMHash of the password (default)
  Value: 0x00000000 == do not send LMHash of the password

  Setting this variable to zero on a server will cause the server to drop any
  connection request which uses the LM response in an MSCHAP exchange. Setting
  this variable to zero on a client will prevent the client from using LM
  responses in MSCHAP exchanges. This variable affects BOTH dial-up and VPN
  connections.

  Please note: Most users will not need to use this registry variable. The new
  secure mode MSCHAP V2 will not send the LMHash response, so this registry
  value is most useful when connecting to older access servers which use the
  original MSCHAP.

Fixes and Features included from the 2.0 Hotfix
-----------------------------------------------

PPTP Performance Issues Addressed in this Update:

- A new historyless mode for encryption &amp; compression over PPTP connections
  has been enabled. This new mode will dramatically improve performance using
  PPTP in high latency networks, or networks that commonly experience
  significant packet loss like the Internet. This upgrade is fully compatible
  with legacy PPTP systems. However, in order to negotiate historyless mode,
  both the PPTP client and server must support the upgrade. If either client or
  server refuses the new mode, normal MPPE compression and encryption will be
  negotiated to insure communication capabilities are not lost. To experience
  the full benefit of the PPTP performance update, this update must be
  installed on both Windows NT clients and servers. A corresponding release
  Microsoft Dial-Up Networking 1.3 is available for Windows 95 clients, while
  the new release of Windows 98 already includes the appropriate client code.

  Please note: RAS Servers that terminate compulsory PPTP connections from an
  FEP (Front End Processor) must disable historyless compression/encryption in
  order for legacy Windows 95 clients to receive data properly. An FEP is a
  dial-up server which can create a PPTP tunnel on behalf of its dial-up
  clients. This feature is available from several Access Server vendors,
  including Compaq (Microcom), Ascend, and 3com.

  The value to set in the registry to enable/disable historyless
  encryption/compression is:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NdisWan\Parameters

  DWORD: Historyless
  Value: 0x00000001 == Enabled (default)
  Value: 0x00000000 == Disabled

- The default PPTP receive window size was increased to 16.

- The window between the NDISWAN driver and the PPTP driver was increased.

- The PPTP frame size has been set to default to 1400 bytes to avoid packet
  fragmentation.

  Please note: The frame size issue was also addressed in an earlier hotfix, and
  is documented at:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q162/2/30.asp

Remote Access Service and PPTP Issues:

- PPTP server responsiveness has been improved for the time period right after
  termination of multiple PPTP connections.

- A PPTP server issue of an improperly configured packet header "start session"
  has been corrected. This issue is documented at:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q179/1/07.asp

- Improved integrity of session encryption in MPPE by increasing the randomness
  of successive packet key management following an encryption or compression
  reset.

- Corrected a RAS/PPTP user interface design issue that could mislead an
  administrator regarding the actual configuration of the server. This issue is
  documented at:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q177/6/70.asp

- Updated MSCHAP to disable sending the LMHash when client set to "require"
  128-bit encryption.

Other Windows NT Issues Addressed in this Update:

- This release includes an enhancement to TCP/IP which will improve the
  performance of TCP-based applications over high latency networks, such as the
  Internet.
