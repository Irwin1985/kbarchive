SYMPTOMS
========

Using Visual Basic, you create one or more ActiveX DLLs and a Standard EXE
(client) application to use the DLLs. The client application runs as expected
within the Visual Basic (IDE) environment. However, when you compile and run the
client application as an EXE, the application produces one of the following
errors upon closing:

  &lt;project name&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module MSVBVM50.DLL at
  0137:0f059b41.

  -or-

  Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x0f059b41

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the objects you create in the DLL are not closed
properly by the client application due to a circular reference. A circular
reference occurs, for instance, in the following scenario:

  A client application instantiates an object in the ActiveX DLL: the Parent
  object. The Parent object creates another object in the DLL: the Child
  object. The Parent object sets a property in the Child object that allows the
  Child object to have a reference to the Parent object.

This creates a circular reference between the Parent and Child objects. When the
client application that created the Parent object sets its object variable to
Nothing, the Parent object does not terminate because the Child object maintains
a reference to the Parent object. The MORE INFORMATION section below describes a
specific case for this problem and provides a solution, which is to remove the
Child's reference to the Parent object before closing the Parent object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The steps below illustrate two sample ActiveX DLLs and a client application to
use the DLLs. By following these steps, you will see how an error can occur when
you close the client application. A workaround is also provided.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic and create a new ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is created by
  default.

2. Change the name of the Class1 module to GlobalMethods.

3. Choose Properties from the Project menu, and set the Project Name to
  UBGlobal.

4. Put the following code in the GlobalMethods module:

      Option Explicit

      Public Sub gMethod1()

      End Sub

      Public Function getValidList(a As Object, b() As Collection) As Integer
      End Function

5. Save the UBGlobal project and make UBGlobal.dll.

6. Close the UBGlobal project and start a new ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is
  created by default.

7. Choose References from the Project menu, and set a reference to UBGlobal.

8. Choose Properties from the Project menu, and set the Project Name to
  UBServer.

9. From the Project menu, add a new class module. Class2 is created.

10. Put the following code in the Class2 module:

        Option Explicit

        Public objGlobal As UBGlobal.GlobalMethods
        Public objParent As Class1

        Private Sub Class_Initialize()
           Set objGlobal = New UBGlobal.GlobalMethods
           objGlobal.gMethod1
        End Sub

        Private Sub Class_Terminate()
           Set objGlobal = Nothing
        End Sub

11. Put the following code in the Class1 module:

        Option Explicit

        Private objChild As Class2

        Private Sub Class_Initialize()
           Set objChild = New Class2
           Set objChild.objParent = Me
        End Sub

        Private Sub Class_Terminate()
           Set objChild.objParent = Nothing
           Set objChild = Nothing
        End Sub

        Public Sub CleanUp()
           Set objChild.objParent = Nothing
        End Sub

12. Save the UBServer project and make UBServer.dll.

13. Close the UBServer project, and start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is
  created by default.

14. Choose References from the Project menu, and set a reference to both
  UBGlobal and UBServer.

15. Choose Properties from the Project menu, and set the Project Name to Client.

16. Put a CommandButton on Form1.

17. Put the following code in the form's code window:

        Option Explicit

        Dim objGlobal As UBGlobal.GlobalMethods
        Dim objParent As UBServer.Class1

        Private Sub Form_Load()
           Set objGlobal = New UBGlobal.GlobalMethods
           objGlobal.gMethod1
           Set objParent = New UBServer.Class1
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           ' uncomment the following line for solution:
           'objParent.CleanUp
           Set objParent = Nothing
           Set objGlobal = Nothing
           Unload Me
        End Sub

18. Run the project. The form with the CommandButton appears.

19. Click the CommandButton. Note that the application ends without an error.

20. Save the Client project and compile Client.exe.

21. Close Visual Basic.

22. Run Client.exe. The form with the CommandButton appears.

23. Click the CommandButton.

Result: The client application terminates with one of the errors described
above.

Solution: Uncomment the objParent.CleanUp line in the client project. Recompile
and run Client exe. Click the CommandButton.

Result: The application shuts down properly with no error.

The purpose of the CleanUp method in Class1 is to remove the circular reference
between Class1 (parent) and Class2 (child). Until the reference to Class1 is
removed, Class1 does not terminate properly when using the ActiveX DLL from a
Visual Basic client EXE.
