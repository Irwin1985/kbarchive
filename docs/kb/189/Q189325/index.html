SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4 rev. 1
(IMAP4rev1) features and commands.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FEATURES:

1. IMAP4rev1 client allows the user to access and manipulate electronic
  messages on a server.
2. IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of remote message folders, called
  mailboxes, in a way that is functionally equivalent to local mailboxes.
3. IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to re-
  synchronize with the server (see also [IMAP-DISC]).
4. IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming
  mailboxes.
5. IMAP4rev1 checks for new messages, permanently removes messages, and
  sets and clears flags [RFC-822].
6. IMAP4rev1 does [MIME-IMB] parsing, searching, and selective fetching of
  message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.
7. Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers
  are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.

COMMANDS and RESPONSES:

  An IMAP4rev1 connection consists of the establishment of a
  client/server network connection, an initial greeting from the
  server, and client/server interactions. These client/server
  interactions consist of a client command, server data, and a server
  completion result response.

Non-Authenticated State
  In a non-authenticated state, the client MUST supply authentication
  credentials before most commands are permitted. This state is
  entered when a connection starts, unless the connection has been pre-
  authenticated.

Authenticated State
  In an authenticated state, the client is authenticated and MUST select a
  mailbox to access before commands that affect messages are permitted.
  This state is entered when a pre-authenticated connection starts, when
  acceptable authentication credentials have been provided, or after an
  error in selecting a mailbox.

CLIENT COMMANDS - ANY STATE:

CAPABILITY Command

  Arguments:  none
  Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY
  Result:     OK - capability completed
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The CAPABILITY command requests a listing of capabilities that the server
supports.

             Example:
             C: abcd CAPABILITY
             S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 AUTH=KERBEROS_V4
             S: abcd OK CAPABILITY completed

NOOP Command

  Arguments:  none
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command (but see below)
  Result:     OK - noop completed
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The NOOP command always succeeds. It does nothing.

              Example:
              C: a002 NOOP
              S: a002 OK NOOP completed . . .
              C: a047 NOOP S: * 22 EXPUNGE
              S: * 23 EXISTS S: * 3 RECENT
              S: * 14 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen \Deleted))
              S: a047 OK NOOP completed

LOGOUT Command

  Arguments:  none
  Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: BYE
  Result:     OK - logout completed
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The LOGOUT command informs the server that the client is done with the
connection.
              Example:
              C: A023 LOGOUT
              S: * BYE IMAP4rev1 Server logging out
              S: A023 OK LOGOUT completed (Server and client then close
                 the connection)

CLIENT COMMANDS - NON-AUTHENTICATED STATE:

AUTHENTICATE Command

  Arguments:  authentication mechanism name
  Responses:  continuation data can be requested
  Result:     OK - authenticate completed, now in authenticated state
              NO - authenticate failure: unsupported authentication
                   mechanism, credentials rejected
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid,
                   authentication exchange cancelled

The AUTHENTICATE command indicates an authentication mechanism to the
server.
              Example:
              S: * OK KerberosV4 IMAP4rev1 Server
              C: A001 AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4
              S: + AmFYig== C:
              S: + or//EoAADZI= C: DiAF5A4gA+oOIALuBkAAmw==
              S: A001 OK Kerberos V4 authentication successful

LOGIN Command

  Arguments:  user name
              password
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - login completed, now in authenticated state
              NO - login failure: user name or password rejected
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The LOGIN command identifies the client to the server and carries the plain
text password authenticating this user.

              Example:
              C: a001 LOGIN &lt;username &amp; password&gt;
              S: a001 OK LOGIN completed

CLIENT COMMANDS - AUTHENTICATED STATE:

SELECT Command

  Arguments:  mailbox name
  Responses:  REQUIRED untagged responses: FLAGS, EXISTS, RECENT
              OPTIONAL OK untagged responses: UNSEEN, PERMANENTFLAGS
  Result:     OK - select completed, now in selected state
              NO - select failure, now in authenticated state: no
                   such mailbox, cannot access mailbox
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The SELECT command selects a mailbox so that messages in the mailbox can be
accessed.

              Example:
              C: A142 SELECT INBOX
              S: * 172 EXISTS
              S: * 1 RECENT
              S: * OK [UNSEEN 12] Message 12 is first unseen
              S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid
              S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
              S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Deleted \Seen \*)] Limited
              S: A142 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed

EXAMINE Command

  Arguments:  mailbox name
  Responses:  REQUIRED untagged responses: FLAGS, EXISTS, RECENT
              OPTIONAL OK untagged responses: UNSEEN, PERMANENTFLAGS
  Result:     OK - examine completed, now in selected state
              NO - examine failure, now in authenticated state: no
                   such mailbox, cannot access mailbox
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The EXAMINE command is identical to SELECT and returns the same output;
however, the selected mailbox is identified as read-only. No changes to the
permanent state of the mailbox, including per-user state, are permitted.

              Example:
              C: A932 EXAMINE &lt;mailboxname&gt;
              S: * 17 EXISTS S: * 2 RECENT
              S: * OK [UNSEEN 8] Message 8 is first unseen
              S: * OK [UIDVALIDITY 3857529045] UIDs valid
              S: * FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Seen \Draft)
              S: * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS ()] No permanent flags permitted
              S: A932 OK [READ-ONLY] EXAMINE completed

CREATE Command

  Arguments:  mailbox name
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - create completed
              NO - create failure: cannot create mailbox with that name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The CREATE command creates a mailbox with the given name. An OK response is
returned only if a new mailbox with that name has been created.

              Example:
              C: A003 CREATE &lt;mailboxname&gt;
              S: A003 OK CREATE completed
              C: A004 CREATE &lt;mailboxname/mailboxname&gt;
              S: A004 OK CREATE completed

DELETE Command

  Arguments:  mailbox name
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - delete completed
              NO - delete failure: cannot delete mailbox with that name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The DELETE command permanently removes the mailbox with the given name. A
tagged OK response is returned only if the mailbox has been deleted.

Examples:
C: A682 LIST "" *                      S: A687 OK DELETE Completed
S: * LIST () "/" &lt;mailboxname&gt;        C: A82 LIST "" *
S: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" &lt;mailboxname&gt;     S: * LIST () "." &lt;mailboxname&gt;
S: * LIST () "/" &lt;mailboxname/&lt;mailboxname&gt; S: * LIST () "." &lt;mailboxname&gt;
S: A682 OK LIST completed                S: * LIST () "."
                                            &lt;mailboxname.mailboxname&gt;
C: A683 DELETE &lt;mailboxname&gt;       S: A82 OK LIST completed
S: A683 OK DELETE completed              C: A83 DELETE &lt;mailboxname&gt;
C: A684 DELETE &lt;mailboxname&gt;       S: A83 OK DELETE completed
S: A684 NO Name &lt;mailboxname&gt;      C: A84 DELETE &lt;mailboxname&gt;
C: A685 DELETE &lt;mailboxname.mailboxname&gt; S: A84 OK DELETE Completed
S: A685 OK DELETE Completed           C: A85 LIST "" *
C: A686 LIST "" *                     S: * LIST () "."
                                         &lt;mailboxname.mailboxname&gt;&gt;
S: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" &lt;mailboxname&gt;     S: A85 OK LIST completed
S: A686 OK LIST completed                C: A86 LIST "" %
C: A687 DELETE &lt;mailboxname&gt;       S: * LIST (\Noselect) "." &lt;mailboxname&gt;
                       S: A86 OK LIST completed

RENAME Command

  Arguments:  existing mailbox name
              new mailbox name
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - rename completed
              NO - rename failure: cannot rename mailbox with that name,
                   cannot rename to mailbox with that name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The RENAME command changes the name of a mailbox. A tagged OK response is
returned only if the mailbox has been renamed.

Examples:
C: A682 LIST "" *                   S: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" &lt;mailboxname&gt;
S: * LIST () "/" &lt;mailboxname&gt;      S: * LIST () "/"
                                      &lt;mailboxname/&lt;mailboxname&gt;
S: A685 OK LIST completed                    S: Z432 OK LIST completed
S: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" &lt;mailboxname&gt;      C: Z432 LIST "" *
S: * LIST () "/" &lt;mailboxname/mailboxname&gt;   S: * LIST () "." &lt;mailboxname&gt;
S: A682 OK LIST completed           S: * LIST () "."
                                      &lt;mailboxname.mailboxname&gt;
C: A683 RENAME &lt;mailboxname mailboxname&gt;  S: Z432 OK LIST completed
S: A683 OK RENAME completed         C: Z433 RENAME &lt;mailboxname old-
                                      mail&gt;
C: A684 RENAME &lt;mailboxname mailboxname&gt;  S: Z433 OK RENAME completed
S: A684 OK RENAME Completed         C: Z434 LIST "" *
C: A685 LIST "" *                   S: * LIST () "." &lt;mailboxname&gt;
S: * LIST ()                        S: * LIST () "."
                                      &lt;mailboxname.mailboxname&gt;
S: * LIST () "/" &lt;mailboxname&gt;      S: * LIST () "." old-mail
S: Z434 OK LIST completed

SUBSCRIBE Command

  Arguments:  mailbox
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - subscribe completed
              NO - subscribe failure: cannot subscribe to that name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The SUBSCRIBE command adds the specified mailbox name to the server's set
of "active" or "subscribed" mailboxes as returned by the LSUB command. This
command returns a tagged OK response only if the subscription is
successful.

              Example:
              C: A002 SUBSCRIBE #&lt;newsgroup&gt;
              S: A002 OK SUBSCRIBE completed

UNSUBSCRIBE Command

  Arguments:  mailbox name
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - unsubscribe completed
              NO - unsubscribe failure: cannot unsubscribe that name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The UNSUBSCRIBE command removes the specified mailbox name from the
server's set of "active" or "subscribed" mailboxes as returned by the LSUB
command. This command returns a tagged OK response only if the
unsubscription is successful.

             Example:
             C: A002 UNSUBSCRIBE #&lt;newsgroup&gt;
             S: A002 OK UNSUBSCRIBE completed

LIST Command

  Arguments:  reference name
              mailbox name with possible wildcards
  Responses:  untagged responses: LIST
  Result:     OK - list completed
              NO - list failure: cannot list that reference or name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The LIST command returns a subset of names from the complete set of all
names available to the client.

Examples:
C: A101 LIST "" ""                     C: A103 LIST /usr/staff/&lt;name&gt; ""
S: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" ""              C: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" / 
S: A101 OK LIST Completed              S: A103 OK LIST Completed
C: A102 LIST #&lt;newsgroup&gt; ""           C: A202 LIST ~/Mail/ %
S: * LIST (\Noselect) "." #news.       S: * LIST (\Noselect)
                                         "/"~/Mail/&lt;mailboxname&gt;
S: A102 OK LIST Completed              S: * LIST () "/" ~/Mail/meetings
                                            S: A202 OK LIST completed

LSUB Command

  Arguments:  reference name
              mailbox name with possible wildcards
  Responses:  untagged responses: LSUB
  Result:     OK - lsub completed
              NO - lsub failure: cannot list that reference or name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The LSUB command returns a subset of names from the set of names that the
user has declared as being "active" or "subscribed".

              Example:
              C: A002 LSUB "#newsgroup." "newsgroup.*"
              S: * LSUB () "." #news.comp.mail.mime
              S: * LSUB () "." #news.comp.mail.misc
              S: A002 OK LSUB completed

STATUS Command

  Arguments:  mailbox name
              status data item names
  Responses:  untagged responses: STATUS
  Result:     OK - status completed
              NO - status failure: no status for that name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The STATUS command requests the status of the indicated mailbox. It does
not change the currently selected mailbox, nor does it affect the state of
any messages in the queried mailbox (in particular, STATUS MUST NOT cause
messages to lose the \Recent flag).

              Example:
              C: A042 STATUS &lt;mailboxname&gt; (UIDNEXT MESSAGES)
              S: * STATUS &lt;mailboxname&gt; (MESSAGES 231 UIDNEXT 44292)
              S: A042 OK STATUS completed

APPEND Command

  Arguments:  mailbox name
              OPTIONAL flag parenthesized list
              OPTIONAL date/time string
              message literal
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - append completed
              NO - append error: cannot append to that mailbox, error
                   in flags or date/time or message text
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The APPEND command appends the literal argument as a new message to the end
of the specified destination mailbox. This argument SHOULD be in the format
of an [RFC-822] message.

              Example:
              C: A003 APPEND saved-messages (\Seen) {310}
              C: Date: Mon, 7 Feb 1994 21:52:25 -0800 (PST)
              C: From: User Name &lt;username@domainname.COM&gt;
              C: To: username@domainname.com
              C: Message-Id: &lt;B27397-0100000@domainname.COM&gt;
              C: MIME-Version: 1.0
              C: Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII
              C: Subject: afternoon meeting
              C: C: Hello &lt;user&gt;, do you think we can meet at 3:30
                 tomorrow?
              S: A003 OK APPEND completed

CLIENT COMMANDS - SELECTED STATE:

CHECK Command

  Arguments:  none
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - check completed
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The CHECK command requests a checkpoint of the currently selected mailbox.
A checkpoint refers to any implementation-dependent housekeeping associated
with the mailbox (for example, resolving the server's in-memory state of
the mailbox with the state on its disk) that is not normally executed as
part of each command.

              Example:
              C: FXXZ CHECK
              S: FXXZ OK CHECK Completed

CLOSE Command

  Arguments:  none
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - close completed, now in authenticated state
              NO - close failure: no mailbox selected
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The CLOSE command permanently removes from the currently selected mailbox
all messages that have the \Deleted flag set, and returns to authenticated
state from selected state.

              Example:
              C: A341 CLOSE
              S: A341 OK CLOSE completed

EXPUNGE Command

  Arguments:  none
  Responses:  untagged responses: EXPUNGE
  Result:     OK - expunge completed
              NO - expunge failure: cannot expunge (for example,
                   Permission denied)
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The EXPUNGE command permanently removes from the currently selected mailbox
all messages that have the \Deleted flag set.

              Example:
              C: A202 EXPUNGE
              S: * 3 EXPUNGE
              S: * 3 EXPUNGE
              S: * 5 EXPUNGE
              S: * 8 EXPUNGE
              S: A202 OK EXPUNGE completed

SEARCH Command

  Arguments:  OPTIONAL [CHARSET] specification
              searching criteria (one or more)
  Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: SEARCH
  Result:     OK - search completed
              NO - search error: cannot search that [CHARSET] or
                   criteria
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The SEARCH command searches the mailbox for messages that match the given
searching criteria. Searching criteria consist of one or more search keys:

     &lt;message set&gt;  Messages with message sequence numbers
                    corresponding to the specified message sequence
                    number set.

     ALL            All messages in the mailbox.

     ANSWERED       Messages with the \Answered flag set.

     BCC &lt;string&gt;   Messages that contain the specified string in the
                    envelope structure's BCC field.

     BEFORE &lt;date&gt;  Messages whose internal date is earlier than the
                    specified date.

     BODY &lt;string&gt;  Messages that contain the specified string in the
                    body of the message.

     CC &lt;string&gt;    Messages that contain the specified string in the
                    envelope structure's CC field.

     DELETED        Messages with the \Deleted flag set.

     DRAFT          Messages with the \Draft flag set.

     FLAGGED        Messages with the \Flagged flag set.

                    Messages that have a header with the specified
                    field-name (as defined in [RFC-822]) and that

                    opposed to "NOT NEW").

     ON &lt;date&gt;      Messages whose internal date is within the
                    specified date.

           S: * SEARCH 2 84 882 S: A282 OK SEARCH completed

FETCH Command

  Arguments:  message set
              message data item names
  Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH
  Result:     OK - fetch completed
              NO - fetch error: cannot fetch that data
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The FETCH command retrieves data associated with a message in the mailbox.
The currently defined data items that can be fetched are:

     ALL            Macro equivalent to: (FLAGS INTERNALDATE
                    RFC822.SIZE ENVELOPE)

     BODY           Non-extensible form of BODYSTRUCTURE.

     BODY[&lt;section&gt;]&lt;&lt;partial&gt;&gt;
                    The text of a particular body section. The section
                    specification is a set of zero or more part
                    specifiers delimited by periods. A part specifier
                    is either a part number or one of the following:
                    HEADER, HEADER.FIELDS, HEADER.FIELDS.NOT, MIME, and
                    TEXT. An empty section specification refers to the
                    entire message, including the header.

         Example:
         C: A654 FETCH 2:4 (FLAGS BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (DATE FROM)])
         S: * 2 FETCH ....
         S: * 3 FETCH ....
         S: * 4 FETCH ....
         S: A654 OK FETCH completed

STORE Command

  Arguments:  message set
              message data item name
              value for message data item
  Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH
  Result:     OK - store completed
              NO - store error: cannnot store that data
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The STORE command alters data associated with a message in the mailbox.

         Example:
         C: A003 STORE 2:4 +FLAGS (\Deleted)
         S: * 2 FETCH FLAGS (\Deleted \Seen)
         S: * 3 FETCH FLAGS (\Deleted)
         S: * 4 FETCH FLAGS (\Deleted \Flagged \Seen)
         S: A003 OK STORE completed

COPY Command

  Arguments:  message set
              mailbox name
  Responses:  no specific responses for this command
  Result:     OK - copy completed
              NO - copy error: cannot copy those messages or to that
                   name
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The COPY command copies the specified message(s) to the end of the
specified destination mailbox. The flags and internal date of the
message(s) SHOULD be preserved in the copy.

              Example:
              C: A003 COPY 2:4 MEETING
              S: A003 OK COPY completed

UID Command

  Arguments:  command name
              command arguments
  Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH, SEARCH
  Result:     OK - UID command completed
              NO - UID command error
              BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

The UID command has two forms. In the first form, it takes as its arguments
a COPY, FETCH, or STORE command with arguments appropriate for the
associated command. In the second form, the UID command takes a SEARCH
command with SEARCH command arguments.

              Example:
              C: A999 UID FETCH 4827313:4828442 FLAGS
              S: * 23 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 4827313)
              S: * 24 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 4827943)
              S: * 25 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 4828442)
              S: A999 UID FETCH completed
