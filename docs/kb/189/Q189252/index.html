SUMMARY
=======

This article contains the contents of the Network.doc file located in the root
folder of the Close Combat for Windows CD-ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Playing Microsoft Close Combat Head-to-Head
-------------------------------------------

Head-to-head play in Close Combat utilizes TCP/IP. If two players can "see" each
other via a TCP/IP connection (LAN, Internet, PPP, SLIP, etc.) then those two
players can play Head-to-Head with Close Combat.

To play a two-player game in Close Combat you must have either a modem, to play
via serial or Internet connection; or a network card to play via a network.

If you're playing over the Internet, you need to know your or your opponent's IP
address when playing in two-player mode. To find out what your IP address is,
see the section later in this document that pertains to your networking
software.

Contact your Internet Service Provider for further instructions on how to install
the appropriate TCP/IP software in order to use your modem to connect to the
Internet.

Confirming Your IP Address
--------------------------

When you start Close Combat and click on the two-player button, a screen will
appear that displays your IP Address. This is your current IP address that your
opponent can use to establish a connection with you. To exchange your IP
addresses, you need to use IRC (Internet Relay Chat) or some other Internet
communication software in order to communicate your address to another
individual.

NOTE: The IP addresses often change each time you call up and connect to the
Internet. So you need to stay connected to the Internet once you have your IP
address and want to give it to someone else. In most cases you cannot, for
example, connect, get your IP address, disconnect, call them with the IP
address, and then reconnect.

Confirming that You Can "See" the Other Player
----------------------------------------------

On the Start Menu in Windows 95 select Programs and MS-DOS Prompt. Find out the
other player's IP address, and type the following at the MS-DOS Command Prompt:

  ping &lt;address&gt;

where &lt;address&gt; is the other player's IP address. If packets are returned
from the other player's computer but you still cannot start a head-to-head game
in Close Combat, contact your Network provider.

Using Winipcfg to Review Your IP Address
----------------------------------------

Using the Winipcfg tool to review your current TCP/IP network protocol settings.
This can be useful when you are troubleshooting problems, such as problems
connecting to your Internet provider.

To view your current TCP/IP settings using Winipcfg, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type the following line in the Open box, and then click OK:

  winipcfg

Your current TCP/IP settings are displayed. To view additional information, click
More Info.

NOTE: The settings in the Winipcfg display are not updated dynamically. To view
changes, quit Winipcfg and then run it again.

If your IP address was dynamically allocated by a Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) server, you can use the Release and Renew buttons to release and
renew the IP address.

If Your IP Address Is Not Displayed:

If an IP address is not being displayed, then you do not have access to the
Internet and cannot play Close Combat in two-player mode.

To configure Dial-Up Networking to work with an Internet service provider, you
must obtain the following information from the service provider:

- User name
- Password
- Access phone number
- Required protocol
- Host and domain name
- DNS (Domain Name Server) if you are using an IP address
- Logon procedure

If the Internet service provider requires that you use a dedicated static IP
address each time you log on, you also need the following information:

- Your IP address
- Subnet mask (optional)
- IP address for the default gateway (optional)

NOTE: Not all Internet service providers require all of this information.

Setting Up the Dial-Up Adapter
------------------------------

Confirm that the TCP/IP protocol is installed for the adapter you use to connect
to the Internet. In most cases, this is the Dial-Up Networking Adapter. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. In the list of installed network components, verify that the TCP/IP protocol
  for the adapter you use to access the Internet (for example, TCP/IP -&gt;
  Dial-Up Adapter) is present.

Confirm that DNS is not enabled for the TCP/IP protocol. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Click the TCP/IP protocol in the list of installed network components, and
  then click Properties.

2. On the DNS Configuration tab, click the Disable DNS option, and then click
  OK.

  NOTE: Disabling DNS does not remove any settings that are already populated
  for this screen, it only grays them, thus stopping the TCP/IP protocol from
  using them. If another application requires the use of DNS, simply re-enable
  DNS when you are not using Close Combat.

3. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

Connecting to Your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
--------------------------------------------------

Setting Up the Service Provider:

Once you have set up the dial-up adapter, follow these steps to create a
connection for each service provider:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Dial-Up
  Networking.

2. Double-click Make New Connection.

3. Step through the Make New Connection Wizard to create the connection.

4. Right-click the new connection, and then click Properties.

5. Click Server Type. In the Allowed Network Protocols area, click the NetBEUI
  and IPX/SPX Compatible check boxes to clear them (unless they are required)
  and then click TCP/IP settings.

6. If a static IP address is required, click Specify An IP Address and type the
  address.

7. If a dynamic address is required (this is the case for most providers), click
  Server Assigned IP Address.

8. If a DNS name server is provided, click Specify Name Server Address and type
  the appropriate address.

9. Click OK until you close the Connection Properties window.

Further Information:

Windows 95 includes support for connecting to an Internet service provider using
either a PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) or SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol)
account.

SLIP support is available in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, the CD-ROM Extras
for Windows 95 upgrade, and the Internet Jumpstart Kit component of Microsoft
Plus! for Windows 95.

Getting Started:

To connect to the Internet, you need a PPP or SLIP account with an Internet
provider. You also need the following information from your Internet service
provider:

- User name
- Password
- Local access phone number
- Your host and domain name
- DNS server IP address
- Authentication technique (whether or not a terminal window is used)

Your Internet service provider may also provide you with an IP address and an IP
subnet mask. These are needed only if your provider gives you a dedicated IP
address to use every time you dial in.

How to Set Up Dial-Up Networking
--------------------------------

Before you set up your Internet connection, make sure Dial-Up Networking is
installed on your computer. To do so, double-click the My Computer icon on the
desktop and check if a Dial-Up Networking folder is present inside the My

  logon and the information that you must provide may vary for your Internet
  service provider. Please contact your provider if you have any questions
  about the logon procedure.

  NOTE: Most service providers use a message such as "Your IP address is" or
  "SLIP session from ###.###.###.### to ###.###.###.###" where the second set
  of numbers is your IP address.

5. Make a note of your IP address, and then click Continue.

6. Confirm your IP address in the SLIP Connection IP Address dialog box by
  typing the IP address you noted in step 5, and then click OK.

  If you are not sure what your IP address is, please contact your Internet
  service provider and ask how to determine your IP address for your SLIP
  account.

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------

If you experience problems connecting to the Internet:

- Make sure your server type is correct. For example, if you have a PPP
  account, make sure the server type is set to PPP, not SLIP or CSLIP.
- If you have a SLIP account, make sure you type the correct IP address when
  you are prompted to do so during the logon process.

If you experience problems after you connect to the Internet:

- If you use a SLIP account and you can successfully ping another computer but
  you cannot use Close Combat to connect to Internet resources, change the
  server type from SLIP to CSLIP (or from CSLIP to SLIP).

To make sure your Internet connection is working properly, ping a known IP
address by typing the following command at an MS-DOS prompt

  ping &lt;IP address&gt;

where &lt;IP address&gt; is a known IP address. The IP address of the Microsoft
FTP server is 207.46.133.140.

If you can ping a known IP address successfully, TCP/IP connectivity is working
properly. Next, try to ping the Microsoft FTP server using the
"ftp.microsoft.com" address instead of the IP address. To do so, type the
following command at an MS-DOS prompt:

  ping ftp.microsoft.com

If this works, your DNS settings are functioning properly.
