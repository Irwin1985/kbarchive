SYMPTOMS
========

When a customer tries to use Kerberos to delegate authentication in a
load-balanced architecture, Kerberos does not work and Internet Information
Services (IIS) drops back to Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication.
Because Windows NT Challenge/Response cannot be used for delegation, any
applications or services that require delegation do not work.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because of a limitation in the Kerberos authentication
protocol. The load-balanced cluster uses a virtual host name to identify itself,
and this is the host name that the Kerberos ticket is issued for. When the
ticket is presented to the actual server, the client that is directed to the
ticket does not match its Server Principal Name (SPN). Additionally, in a
Windows 2000 domain, the virtual host name cannot be set to Trusted For
Delegation in the Active Directory.

When the server rejects the Kerberos ticket, the client renegotiates and tries to
use Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication. Even if the client can
authenticate through this method, delegation fails because it relies on Kerberos
to function.

WORKAROUND
==========

One possible workaround requires that each computer in the load-balanced cluster
be available to answer to its own fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The
default page on each server must redirect the client directly to itself, thereby
bypassing the virtual host name and instead providing a valid host name that a
ticket can be issued for.

As a sample, the page can be something a simple as the following line:

  &lt;% response.redirect("http://my.unique.fqdn/default2.asp") %&gt;

Assuming that my.unique.fqdn is the unique FQDN of the computer and that
Default2.asp is the actual default page that the client must be directed to,
Kerberos can use this simple redirection to work in a load-balanced
architecture.

As a caveat, the client can see or record (that is, bookmark) the unique name of
the server that the client is directed to. This may seem to lead to outages if
the client bookmarks that site and tries to return when either the physical
server or the unique server name is unavailable.

following RFC Web site:
