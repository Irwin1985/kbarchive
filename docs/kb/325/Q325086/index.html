The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under Windows NT 4.0, if you make a connection to a network printer, your
roaming profile may not be saved back to the server when you log off. This
problem typically occurs when common desktop settings (such as icons) are also
used. When this problem occurs, you are prompted during a later logon attempt
with a message that indicates that the local profile is newer than the roaming
profile.

CAUSE
=====

Print Job Monitor keeps a handle to Shell32.dll open, which in turn keeps a
handle to HKEY_CURRENT_USER open. This registry handle is not released until
Csrss.exe exits during the logoff process. This can cause a problem because the
handle may be released too late in the logoff cycle, preventing the user's
profile from being unloaded.

==========
