-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a flight or fly into a specific area, you receive the
following error message:

  Scenery library object not found. This may cause some scenery, such as some
  buildings, to not display.

After you click OK, Flight Simulator continues to load, but some scenery does not
appear as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if any of the following conditions is true:

- Your installation of Flight Simulator is corrupted.

- Your flight plan includes a scenery area configuration that requires scenery
  files that are not included in the game.

- You are flying into an area whose scenery area configuration requires scenery
  files that are not included in the game.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they
are presented.

Method 1: Look for Documented Missing Scenery
---------------------------------------------

See the "More Information" section later in this article for a complete list of
scenery areas that are missing from Flight Simulator 2002 and can cause the
error message that is listed in the "Symptoms" section.

Method 2: Remove and Then Reinstall Flight Simulator
----------------------------------------------------

  Boot.ini, Ntdetect.com, and NTLDR reside. (This is generally the C:\

8. Use the arrow keys to move to the end of the ARC path that you want under
  [operating systems].

  For example, the ARC path might appear as follows:

  Professional" /fastdetect /MAXMEM=256 and so on.

10. Press ALT+F, and then press S.

11. Press ALT+F, and then press X.

12. Type "attrib +a +s +h boot.ini" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER.

13. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

14. Restart the computer.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. Click to select the "Limit memory to" check box, and then click the
  appropriate option.
