- Microsoft MechWarrior 4: Vengeance 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Inner Sphere 'Mech Pak, you may notice that none of the new
mechs are available when you play MechWarrior 4: Black Knight.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if either of the following conditions is true:

- You try to use Inner Sphere or Clan mechs in the campaign game.

- You install Black Knight after you install Inner Sphere or Clan 'Mech Pak.

The new mechs are not for the campaign games, and you can use them only in
Multiplayer and Instant Action modes.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you install Black Knight after you install Inner Sphere 'Mech Pak, the mechs
from Inner Sphere 'Mech Pak are not available in MechWarrior 4: Black Knight
during Multiplayer and Instant Action. To resolve this issue, use Method 1.

Method 1: Remove and Reinstall Mech Paks

  'Mech Pak CD-ROM into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.

6. Click Install, and then follow the instructions to install.

If Inner Sphere or Clan mechs are still not available in Instant Action or
Multiplayer in Black Knight, proceed to Method 2.

Method 2: Install Update
------------------------

1. Insert the Inner Sphere CD-ROM into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive,
  and then hold down the SHIFT key to prevent the installation program from
  starting.

  &lt;CD-ROM&gt;:\goodies\patch3\mw4xp1
