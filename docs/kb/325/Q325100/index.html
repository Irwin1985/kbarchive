  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install one of the games that is listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive an error message similar to one or more of the
following, where &lt;Game Name&gt; is the name of the game that you are trying
to install:

  &lt;Game Name&gt; Setup encountered an error while reading the file &lt;File
  Name&gt;. Make sure that the disc is properly inserted in the CD-ROM drive,
  and then click Retry.

  -or-

  &lt;Game Name&gt; Setup encountered a disk error while writing to the file
  &lt;File Name&gt;. Make sure your hard disk is not full, and that the file is
  not in use.

  -or-

  &lt;Game Name&gt; Setup cannot continue because your hard disk is full or
  write-protected. Close any applications, delete unnecessary files from this
  drive, and then try again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot and resolve this problem, use the following methods in the order
in which they are presented.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Method 1: Clean the Disc
------------------------

Clean the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. To do this, use a disc cleaning kit, or gently wipe
the silver side of the disc with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use
paper cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the
disc, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion.

If the issue continues to occur, clean the disc with a damp cloth or a commercial
CD or DVD cleaning solution. Dry the disc thoroughly before you insert it into
the drive.


Method 2: Install from a Different CD-ROM Drive or DVD-ROM Drive
----------------------------------------------------------------

Try to install the game from a different CD-ROM or DVD drive on the same computer
or a different computer. If the installation is successful in this test, the
problem may be that the original CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is not properly reading
the disc. To resolve this problem, contact your computer manufacturer or your
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive manufacturer.

Method 3: Run Scandisk and Defrag
---------------------------------

1. Restart your computer by using a Windows Startup disk.

2. At the command prompt, type "scandisk /surface" (without the quotation
  marks), and then press ENTER.

  The process starts automatically.

3. When Scandisk is complete, click Start, point to Programs, point to
  Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Disk Defragmenter.

4. Click the drive on which you want to install the game, and then click
  Defragment.

  The process starts automatically.

Method 4: Rebuild the Virtual Memory File
-----------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System, click the Performance tab, and then click Virtual
  Memory.

3. Click "Let me specify my own virtual memory settings", and then specify the
  virtual memory file location and size.

4. Click OK, and then click OK.

Method 5: Clear the Temporary Files
-----------------------------------

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Locate and open the C:\Windows\Temp folder.

3. On the Edit menu, click Select All, and then press DELETE.

4. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.

5. Close Windows Explorer.

Method 6: Install the Game on a Network Computer
------------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Install the game on a network computer, which will be referred to in this
  article as "computer B."

2. On computer B, turn on sharing for the &lt;Game Name&gt; folder.

3. On computer B, click Start, and then click Run.

4. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

5. In Registry Editor, locate and click the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MicrosoftGames\&lt;Game Name&gt;

6. On the File menu, click Export.

7. In the "File name" box, type:

  "game.reg" (without the quotation marks)

8. In the "Save in" box, locate and open the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\&lt;Game Name&gt;

9. Click Save.

10. Connect the computer that you originally used to install the game, "computer
  A," to computer B by means of your home network.

11. On computer B, copy the &lt;Game Name&gt; folder to the following folder on
  computer A:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games

12. On computer A, locate the following file:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\&lt;Game Name&gt;\game.reg

13. Double-click game.reg, and then when you are prompted to confirm the
  registry setting, click OK.

14. Right-click a blank space on the desktop, point to New, and then click
  Shortcut.

15. Use the Browse button to locate and select the game program.

16. Click OK, and then click Next.

17. Click Finish to complete the installation process.

  The game is now installed on computer A.

Method 7: Run XCopy to Check the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM Drive
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

3. Type the following, and then press ENTER, where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter
  of your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive:

  "xcopy &lt;drive&gt; :\*.* /s &gt; c:\test1" (without the quotation marks)

  If the XCopy process is not successful, your disc is damaged, so your CD-ROM
  or DVD-ROM drive cannot read it.

Method 8: Exchange or Return Game
---------------------------------

If methods 1 through 7 do not resolve this problem, contact your software vendor
to exchange or return the product.
