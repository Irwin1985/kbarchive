SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article explains how to secure a Web server by using the
Internet Information Services (IIS) Lockdown Wizard. It also includes
information about how to troubleshoot problems that occur after you run the
wizard.

Prepare to Run the IIS Lockdown Wizard
--------------------------------------

With the IIS Lockdown Wizard, you can disable several optional features of IIS to
secure your IIS server against attack. Before you run the wizard, read the Help
file to familiarize yourself with the options that the wizard presents. To
access the help file:

1. Download the IIS Lockdown Wizard. To download the wizard, visit the following
  Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft. com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=33961

2. Extract the Lockdown Wizard files from the executable file.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q315522 HOW TO: Extract the URLScan Tool and Lockdown Template Files from the
  IIS Lockdown Tool

3. Find the folder that you specified when you extracted the files, and then
  double-click the Iislockd.chm file.

Note that the Lockdown Wizard permits you to disable certain optional features of
IIS that are required for the correct operation of other applications, such as
Exchange and FrontPage. If you do not select the correct options when you run
the Lockdown Wizard, you may break the functionality of these applications. To
minimize problems, carefully review the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that
are appropriate to your system configuration before you run the Lockdown
Wizard:

Download and Install the IIS Lockdown Wizard
--------------------------------------------

1. Double-click the executable file that you downloaded in the Prepare to Run
  the IIS Lockdown Wizard section to start the wizard.

2. On the Welcome page, read the explanatory text, and then click Next.

3. On the License Agreement page, read the license agreement, click I Agree, and
  then click Next.

4. On the Select Server Template page, select the template that most closely
  matches the role of this server, and then click to select View Template
  Settings. The pages that follow this have options already selected based on
  the role of the server that you selected earlier in the previous page, so you
  can use all of the default selections.

  If the server has multiple roles (for example, a dynamic Web server that is
  also a proxy server), click to select Other (Server that does not match any
  of the listed roles), and make sure that you carefully consider all the
  options that are presented on the following pages, because the default
  selections may not be appropriate for your server. When you have selected the
  appropriate settings, click Next.

5. On the Internet Services page, select the services that you want your server
  to provide. Most servers require the Web service. If you do not want your
  server to provide File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Simple Mail Transfer
  Protocol (SMTP) services (that is, file transfer or e-mail services), you can
  click to clear these options. Note that you must leave SMTP selected if you
  are running Exchange or Small Business Server.

  The services that you select on this page are set to Disabled and cannot
  start. If you are running the Lockdown Wizard on IIS 5.0, you can also click
  to select Remove unselected services, which completely removes the services
  that you did not select from your system. When you have selected the
  appropriate settings, click Next.

6. On the Script Maps page, click to clear the check box next to any file type
  or file types that you want your server to provide. If you are not sure what
  to disable, you can search your content directories to find out if those file
  name extensions exist. Note that most servers require Active Server Pages
  (.asp), so you must click to clear that check box unless you are sure that
  your server does not serve ASP pages. Click Next.

7. On the Additional Security page, select the virtual directories that you want
  to remove from this server. By default, these virtual directories are
  installed by default with IIS, so they are well-known targets for attackers
  and you might want to remove these virtual directories or rename them on
  production computers. Removing these virtual directories from IIS does not
  remove the corresponding physical directories on the disk, so you do not lose
  any data by selecting this option.

8. Click to select Running system utilities if you want to deny rights on
  executable files in the Windows directory to the Internet guest account
  (IUSR_computername by default). This option should be selected on most
  systems.

9. Click to select Writing to content directories if you want to deny Write
  rights to the Internet guest account on the directories that contain your Web
  content. Make sure that you leave this option unselected if you are using
  FrontPage Server Extensions on this server or if this server functions as a
  proxy server.

10. Click to select Disable Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) if
  you are not using WebDAV to create and deploy Web content on this server. If
  this server runs Outlook Web Access (OWA) for Exchange 2000, make sure that
  you leave this option unselected.
  NOTE: If you select this option, the Lockdown Wizard sets the rights on the
  DLL that implements WebDAV functionality (Httpext.dll) to deny execute
  permission. This may still permit certain WebDAV requests to execute.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q307934 Locking Down WebDAV Through ACL Still Allows PUT and DELETE Requests

11. Click Next.

12. On the URLScan page, select the option to install URLScan if you want to use
  URLScan to filter out incoming requests based on a set of rules. If a client
  tries to make a request that is not valid based on the URLScan rules, IIS
  replies with a 404 File Not Found error, and logs the request in the URLScan
  log file. By default, this file is located in
  %WINDIR%\System32\Inetsrv\Urlscan\Urlscan.log.

  NOTE: If you leave WebDAV enabled on the Additional Security page but you
  decide to install URLScan, note that URLScan blocks WebDAV requests by
  default. You must modify the Urlscan.ini file if you want to use WebDAV with
  URLScan.

13. On the Ready to Apply Settings page, review the changes that will be made,
  and then click Next.

14. The Lockdown Wizard backs up your metabase and makes the selected changes.
  When this process has completed, click View Report to see a report that
  describes the changes that the wizard has made. Click Next to continue.

  NOTE: You can see the installation report by opening
  %WINDIR%\System32\Inetsrv\Oblt-rep.log in Notepad.

15. Click Finish to close the IIS Lockdown Wizard.

16. Fully test all functionality of your server. This step is very important. If
  you discover that you have accidentally disabled required functionality of
  your server, immediately roll back the changes that the Lockdown Wizard
  made, and then rerun the wizard to select the correct options.

Configure URLScan
-----------------

When you run the IIS Lockdown Wizard, you can install URLScan. URLScan is an
ISAPI filter that blocks HTTP requests based on a configurable set of rules. For
example, you can configure URLScan to block all requests for a certain file name
extension, to block certain HTTP verbs (such as GET or POST), or to block
requests that contain characters that are frequently included in attacks on Web
servers.

To configure URLScan, use a text editor such as Notepad to edit the
%WINDIR%\System32\Inetsrv\Urlscan\Urlscan.ini file. This file contains extensive
comments that explain each configuration option. When you have finished editing
the .ini file, save it and restart IIS.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q312376 HOW TO: Configure URLScan to Allow Requests with a Null Extension in
  IIS


Troubleshoot Problems After You Run the IIS Lockdown Wizard
-----------------------------------------------------------

The most common problem after you run the IIS Lockdown Wizard is receiving
unexpected 404 File Not Found error messages when you open the locked-down site.
You may receive these error messages even for files that exist. This occurs when
a client requests a file that has been blocked by the Lockdown Wizard or
URLScan. In this case, IIS says that the file does not exist for security
purposes. If a malicious user knows that a vulnerable service exists on the
server but is being blocked, the user may still find a way to get around the
block and exploit the vulnerability; however, if the user thinks that the
service is not installed, the user will not try to exploit it.

If you receive a 404 error message after you run the IIS Lockdown Wizard, follow
these steps to troubleshoot the problem:

1. Verify that the file you are requesting exists on the server.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248033 Typical Causes and Resolution of the 'HTTP 404 - File Not Found'
  Error Message

2. Examine the URLScan log file to see if URLScan is blocking the requests. This
  file is located at %WINDIR%\System32\Inetsrv\Urlscan\UrlscanMMDDYY.log (where
  MMDDYY is the date for the log). If you discover that URLScan is blocking the
  requests, see the Configure URLScan section to set up URLScan so it permits
  these requests.

3. If you are requesting a non-HTML file, such as an ASP page or a server side
  include-enabled file, verify the application mapping for the file type in the
  Internet Services Manager:

  a. Right-click your Web site, and then click Properties.

  b. On the Home Directory tab, click Configuration.

  c. Click the Apps Mappings tab.

  d. Click the line that corresponds to the extension of the file that you are
     trying to access.

  e. If Executable Path is set to %WINDIR%\System32\Inetsrv\404.dll, click
     Edit, and then set Executable Path to the default executable path for that
     file extension. If you are not sure of the default, open the
     %WINDIR%\System32\Inetsrv\oblt-log.log file, which was created when you
     ran the Lockdown Wizard. Look for a line that starts with SMAP followed by
     the file name extension. This line also contains the default executable
     path for that file type.

If you have trouble with a service that depends on IIS, such as Exchange or
SharePoint, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that are listed in the
Prepare to Run the IIS Lockdown Wizard section.

You may also find that FTP or SMTP do not work after you run the IIS Lockdown
Wizard. This occurs if you either disable or remove these services. If you
disabled the services, follow these steps to re-enable them:

1. Open Control Panel.

2. On Windows NT 4.0, open the Services applet. On Windows 2000 or Windows XP,
  open the Administrative Tools folder, and then open the Services applet.

3. Double-click FTP Publishing or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

4. For Startup type, click to select Automatic.

5. Click Start if you want the service to start right away.

If you completely removed one or both of these services by selecting Remove
unneeded services when you ran the IIS Lockdown Wizard on IIS 5.0, follow these
steps to reinstall them:

1. Open Control Panel.

2. Open the Add/Remove Programs applet, and then click Add/Remove Windows
  Components in the left pane.

3. Select Internet Information Services (IIS), and then click Details.

4. Click to select File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Service or SMTP Service.

5. Click OK, and then click Next. The selected service or services will be
  installed. You may be prompted to insert your Windows CD-ROM.

6. Make sure that you reapply the latest Windows service pack and any hotfixes
  that you have installed.

If none of these methods works, you can view the IIS Lockdown Wizard report file
to see all changes that the tool made. This can help you determine what changes
caused the problems that you are experiencing. This report file is saved at
%WINDIR\System32\Inetsrv\Oblt-rep.log.
