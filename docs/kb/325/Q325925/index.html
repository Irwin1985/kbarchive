-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a host print job through a print session that you create by using
the Host Integration Server 2000 command line configuration utility
(Snacfg.exe), you may receive an Event 25 error message similar to the following
in the Application Event Log:

  Event ID: 25
  Source: SNA Virtual Print Driver
  Description: If your print output is correct, this warning can be ignored.

  If your session has "Printer Language is Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL" selected,
  then the SNA Virtual Print Driver has not recognised your PaperSize (1) or
  Orientation (1) setting. If your job output has incorrect PaperSize or
  Orientation, use GDI printing or put the definitions in the START_JOB macro
  in your PDT file.

  If your session is not configured for HP PCL, the SNA Virtual Print Driver
  cannot automatically apply PaperSize and Orientation Admin settings. If your
  job output has incorrect PaperSize or Orientation, use GDI printing or put
  the definitions in the START_JOB macro in your PDT file.

  Print Session: &lt;Print Session Name&gt;.
  Printer: &lt;Printer Name&gt;.

This problem also occurs when a print session is created by using the Host
Integration Server 2000 Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the DEVMODE structure for the printer is not
initialized correctly when you create a print session by using Snacfg.exe. An
Event 25 occurs because the paper source in the DEVMODE structure is not
recognized by the Host Integration Server 2000 print service.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use
the Time Zone tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

  Date          Time    Version     Size      File name

  09-Aug-2002   13:44   5.0.0.900   250,128   Snacfg.exe

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.




WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this problem, create the print sessions by using SNA Manager.

To prevent the Event 25 error for those print sessions that you created by using
Snacfg.exe, follow these steps:

1. Open SNA Manager.

2. Expand Microsoft SNA Manager.

3. Expand the configured SNA Subdomain.

4. Expand the Host Integration Server 2000 server where the affected print
  sessions are defined.

5. Click to select Print Service in the left pane.

6. Double-click an affected print session in the right pane (or right-click the
  print session, and then click Properties).

7. In the Properties dialog box, click Printer.

8. In the Print Setup dialog box, click OK.

9. In the Properties dialog box, click Apply.

10. Click OK to close Properties.

11. Save the Host Integration Server 2000 configuration.

12. Repeat these steps for each print session that is logging an Event 25 error
  message.

If the print service is already started when you follow these steps, restart the
print service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the print job may print correctly, the only symptom that this problem is
occurring may be the Event 25 error message in the Application Event log. In
this case, ignore the error message.

If the Event 25 error message is logged for print sessions that you created in
SNA Manager, the SNA virtual print driver cannot recognize the paper size or
orientation that you specified in the print job or in the print session. In this
case, follow the instructions that appear in the Event 25 error message.
