-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some general steps you can use to troubleshoot
performance issues in Zoo Tycoon and the Dinosaur Digs Expansion Pack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot poor performance in Zoo Tycoon and the Dinosaur Digs Expansion
Pack, use the following steps in the order in which they appear. After you
complete each step, test to determine whether the issue is resolved.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Step 1: Start a New Game
------------------------

To determine if the problem exists in the currently saved game file, save the
current game and start a new game. If the issue does not reappear, there is a
problem with your saved game file. Delete the damaged file.

Step 2: Verify the System Requirements
--------------------------------------

Make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements to run Zoo Tycoon.

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Step 3: Download the Zoo Tycoon Update
--------------------------------------

For additional information about how to download the latest update for Zoo Tycoon

the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Step 4: Clean Boot Your Computer
--------------------------------

Use a clean boot to restart your computer and see if the issue persists. A clean
boot is a way to create a clean environment. When you start your computer with a
clean boot, Microsoft Windows starts and loads only basic devices and services.
For more information about how to use a clean boot in Microsoft Windows XP and
earlier, see the "Reference" section later in this article.

To restart your computer with a clean boot, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

  your computer.

Step 8: Update Your Video Adapter Driver and Sound Card Driver
