-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a host database through Microsoft Access or Microsoft Excel
by using the Host Integration Server ODBC Driver for DB2, and you use a data
source name (DSN) to link tables or to import tables, you may receive the
following error messages:

  "The Microsoft Jet database engine could not find the object '&lt;Table
  Name&gt;'. Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and path
  name correctly."

  -or-

  "Can't access table &lt;Table Name&gt;"

This may occur when the table name contains special characters such as an
underscore (_). For example, a table name such as "aaa_bbb" can cause this
problem.


CAUSE
=====

The jet provider that is used by Excel and Access passes the table name to the
provider as "aaa\_bbb" (for example). The Host Integration Server ODBC Driver
for DB2 incorrectly parses the backslash (\) (or escape) character.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Host Integration Server 2000 service pack
that contains this fix.

additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.
