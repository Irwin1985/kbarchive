SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can add custom groups to an existing architecture
within the Systems Management Server database using IDMIFs, as opposed to
NOIDMIFs.

NOIDMIFs are Management Information Format files (MIFs) that do not contain
identification or architecture information. These files are placed on the client
and are appended to the machine inventory when it is reported up through normal
inventory processing.

IDMIFs, on the other hand, contain identification and architecture information.
These files are placed directly in the Isvmif.box on a Systems Management Server
logon server. Therefore, IDMIFs can be generated without ever interacting with
client machines.

One scenario in which you might choose to use an IDMIF rather than a NOIDMIF to
extend inventory is when you want to add information from another data source,
such as a human resources database, to an existing Systems Management Server
architecture such as the "personal computer" architecture.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IDMIFs contain identification information and architecture information that
Systems Management Server uses to determine which architecture and which record
within that architecture to work with. The sample below uses an IDMIF to add a
new group to the personal computer architecture. (The personal computer
architecture is the standard architecture for all client computer inventory in
Systems Management Server.)

Steps to Create the IDMIF
-------------------------

1. Query the vIdentification view in the Systems Management Server database to
  obtain all the identification information to be put into the custom IDMIF. In
  this scenario, Systems Management Server uses the identification information
  to determine which computer the new group data will be added to.

2. Place the architecture group in the IDMIF to identify which architecture you
  are updating, in this case personal computer.

3. Finally, add the desired custom groups and the corresponding attributes for
  those groups to the file.

4. Now that you have a completed IDMIF, place this MIF in the Isvmif.box on any
  Systems Management Server logon server to process the information and add it
  to the Systems Management Server database. Once new groups have been added to
  the database, restart the SMS Administrator console to view new group classes
  in the personal computer properties window for the clients that have this
  group information.

NOTE: In this scenario, one IDMIF is generated for every computer to which you
want to add a group containing custom information. Once a group has been added
to the database, any MIFs that attempt to update this group must conform to the
definition that was used to create the group in the database. To remove the
group from the database, use the Systems Management Server Database Manager
utility. (See Help for instructions.)

WARNING: When you delete a group class, all the data associated with that group
class is also deleted.

For more information on the MIF format used below, see chapter 4 of the Microsoft
Systems Management Server Resource Guide, which is part of the BackOffice
Resource Kit.
