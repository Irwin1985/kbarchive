SUMMARY
=======

This article describes DNS event IDs 1 through 1657 for Windows NT Server
version 4.0 with Service Pack 4 installed. In the list below, each event ID
number is followed by its definition and description.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Startup / General Messages
--------------------------

  1 (Success) DNS_EVENT_STARTING
  Starting Microsoft DNS Server (Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, September 24,
  1998).

  2 (Success) DNS_EVENT_STARTUP_OK
  The DNS Server has started.

  3 (Success) DNS_EVENT_SHUTDOWN
  The DNS Server has shutdown.

Initialization
--------------

  110 (Error) DNS_EVENT_INITIALIZATION_FAILED
  DNS Server could not initialize its basic data structures. The data is the
  error.

  111 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_CREATE_THREAD
  DNS Server could not create thread. The data is the error.

  112 (Error) DNS_EVENT_RECURSION_INIT_FAILED
  DNS Server could not initialize recursion. The data is the error.

WINS + NBSTAT
-------------

  130 (Error) DNS_EVENT_WINS_INIT_FAILED
  DNS Server could not initialize WINS lookup.

  131 (Error) DNS_EVENT_NBSTAT_INIT_FAILED
  DNS Server failed to initialize reverse WINS lookup, through netBIOS adapter
  status lookup. This may be caused by an incorrectly configured NetBIOS over
  TCP/IP (NetBT) configuration. Try restarting the DNS server. If reverse WINS
  lookup is not required, remove WINS-R records from zone datafiles and restart
  the DNS server.

  132 (Warning) DNS_EVENT_NBSTAT_ADAPTER_FAILED
  DNS Server failed to open adapter %1, for netBIOS adapter status lookup.

RPC Initialization
------------------

  140 (Error) DNS_EVENT_RPC_SERVER_INIT_FAILED
  DNS Server could not initialize RPC. The data is the error.

Winsock / Interface Initialization
----------------------------------

  400 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_INITIALIZE_WINSOCK
  DNS Server could not initialize the socket library. The data is the error.

  403 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_CREATE_TCP_SOCKET
  DNS Server could not create a TCP socket. The data is the error.

  404 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_BIND_TCP_SOCKET
  DNS Server could not bind a TCP socket to address %1. The data is the error.
  Note that an IP address of 0.0.0.0 indicates a socket that will use all IP
  addresses available on this computer. That is a valid configuration.

  405 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_LISTEN_TCP_SOCKET
  DNS Server could not listen on TCP socket for address %1. The data is the
  error. Note that an IP address of 0.0.0.0 indicates a socket that will use
  all IP addresses available on this computer. That is a valid configuration.

  406 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_CREATE_UDP_SOCKET
  DNS Server could not create datagram socket. The data is the error.

  407 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_BIND_UDP_SOCKET
  DNS Server could not bind a datagram (UDP) socket to %1. The data is the
  error.

  408 (Error) DNS_EVENT_OPEN_SOCKET_FOR_ADDRESS
  DNS Server could not open socket for address %1. Verify that this is a valid
  IP address on this computer. If it is NOT valid, use the Interfaces dialog
  box under Server Properties in the DNS Manager to remove it from the list of
  IP interfaces. Then stop and restart the DNS server. (If this was the only IP
  interface on this computer, the DNS server may not have started as a result
  of this error. In that case, remove the DNS\Parmeters\ListenAddress value in
  the services section of the registry and restart.) If this is a valid IP
  address for this computer, make sure that no other application (for example,
  another DNS server) is running that would attempt to use the DNS port.

  409 (Warning) DNS_EVENT_UPDATE_LISTEN_ADDRESSES
  DNS Server listen address list contains IP addresses that are not IP addresses
  on the DNS Server. Use the DNS manager server properties, interfaces dialog,
  to verify and reset the IP addresses the DNS Server should listen on.

  410 (Error) DNS_EVENT_INVALID_LISTEN_ADDRESSES
  DNS Server listen address list contains no IP addresses that are valid IP
  interfaces on this computer. The DNS Server will use all IP interfaces on the
  machine. Use the DNS manager server properties, interfaces dialog, to verify
  and reset the IP addresses the DNS Server should listen on.

  411 (Error) DNS_EVENT_HOSTENT_MAX_IPS
  DNS Server did not bind to all IP addresses available on this server. Please
  use the DNS Manager server properties interfaces tab to edit the list of IP
  addresses on which DNS is running. Add any missing IP addresses to the list.
  After adding any additional IP addresses to the interfaces list, you MUST
  stop and restart the DNS service for the new interfaces to receive DNS
  service. Note that each additional IP interface does consume system resources
  and adds a small performance overhead to query reception. There is no benefit
  in DNS to additional addresses beyond those necessary to support the
  available network cards. Even if the DNS Server is handling multiple zones
  registered with the Internic, it is not necessary to have different IPs
  registered for each zone. Hence, though the individual effect if small, since
  a very large number of IP interfaces may degrade performance, you are
  encouraged to remove from the machine any IP addresses that are unnecessary.

  412 (Warning) DNS_EVENT_MANY_IP_INTERFACES
  DNS Server is bound to many IP interfaces.

NOTE: Each additional IP interface does consume system resources and adds a small
performance overhead to query reception. There is no benefit in DNS to
additional addresses beyond those necessary to support the available network
cards. Even if the DNS server is handling multiple zones registered with the
InterNIC, it is not necessary to have different IPs registered for each zone.
Therefore, although the individual effect is small, because a very large number
of IP interfaces may degrade performance, you are encouraged to remove from the
computer any IP addresses that are unnecessary.

Registry boot problems
----------------------

  500 (Error) DNS_EVENT_INVALID_REGISTRY_ZONE
  DNS Server zone %1 has invalid or corrupted registry data. Delete its registry
  data and recreate with DNS Admin.

  501 (Error) DNS_EVENT_INVALID_ZONE_TYPE
  DNS Server zone %1 has missing or corrupted zone type in registry. Fix type,
  or delete zone from registry and recreate with DNS Admin.

  502 (Error) DNS_EVENT_NO_ZONE_FILE
  DNS Server primary zone %1 has no database file in registry. Add filename, or
  delete zone from registry and recreate with DNS Admin.

  503 (Error) DNS_EVENT_SECONDARY_REQUIRES_MASTERS
  DNS Server secondary zone %1, had no master IP addresses in registry.
  Secondary zones require masters.

  504 (Error) DNS_EVENT_REG_ZONE_CREATION_FAILED
  DNS Server could not create zone %1, from registry data. Data is the error.

  505 (Error) DNS_EVENT_INVALID_REGISTRY_ZONE_DATA
  DNS Server zone %1 has invalid or corrupted registry data for %2. Delete its
  registry data and recreate with the DNS Mangager.

  506 (Error) DNS_EVENT_INVALID_REGISTRY_PARAM
  DNS Server has invalid or corrupted registry parameter %1. Delete this
  registry parameter and recreate with DNS Admin.

  507 (Error) DNS_EVENT_INVALID_REGISTRY_FORWARDERS
  DNS Server encountered invalid or corrupted forwarder registry parameter. Fix
  parameter or delete all forwarders parameters:

     Forwarders
     ForwardingTimeout
     IsSlave

  They may be re-created using the server properties dialog in the DNS manager.

General Database Load Problems
------------------------------

  700 (Error) DNS_EVENT_DOMAIN_CREATION_FAILED
  DNS Server could not create domain %1.

  701 (Error) DNS_EVENT_PRIMARY_NO_FILE
  DNS Server requires primary zones to have zone file.

  706 (Warning) DNS_EVENT_NO_ROOT_NAME_SERVER
  DNS Server does not have a cache (or database) entry for root name server. The
  cache file must have at least one NS record, indicating a root DNS Server and
  a corresponding A record for that root DNS Server. Otherwise, the DNS Server
  will be unable to contact the root DNS Server on startup and will be unable
  to answer queries for names outside of its own authoritative zones.

  707 (Error) DNS_EVENT_NO_CACHE_FILE_SPECIFIED
  DNS Server is not root authoritative and no cache file specified. A cache file
  must be specified when the DNS Server is not authoritative for the root
  domain. The cache file must contain NS record(s) for root DNS Servers and
  corresponding A record(s) for the root DNS Servers. Otherwise, the DNS Server
  will be unable to contact the root DNS Server on startup and will be unable
  to answer queries for names outside of its own authoritative zones.

  708 (Informational DNS_EVENT_CACHING_SERVER_ONLY
  The DNS server has no 'primary' or 'secondary' zones. The DNS server will run
  as a caching-only server, but will not be authoritative for any zones.
