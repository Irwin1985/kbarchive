-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange Server user delegates a meeting to a Lotus Notes user, Exchange
Server does not inform the Notes meeting chairperson of this delegation. The
delegated Notes user receives the original invitation. If the delegated Notes
user accepts the invitation and the Notes meeting chairperson later sends a
confirmation message for the invitation, the delegate receives the confirmation
message as well as a new invitation.

CAUSE
=====

Notes does not apprise the Notes meeting chairperson of this delegation. Thus,
it does not send a decline message to the chairperson or inform him or her that
the delegation has taken place.

Consequently, the Notes meeting chairperson thinks the Exchange Server user is
still part of the invitee list and leaves the user in the "No Response" field
instead of moving the user to the "Delegate" field.

In this situation, the delegated Notes user receives the original invitation by
virtue of the delegation. He or she also receives a new invitation, if he or she
accepts the invitation and the Notes meeting chairperson later sends a
confirmation message for the invitation.

The correct behavior is for the delegate to receive only the confirmation
message.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds to this problem.

- Do not delegate between users on different systems (such as Lotus Notes and
  Exchange Server).

  -or-

- If the Exchange Server user sends the decline message in the initial stage of
  the meeting request informing the Notes chairperson of the delegation, the
  Notes chairperson can move the Exchange Server user to the Delegate field,
  and a confirmation message would not be sent. The delegated Notes user then
  receives only a single confirmation message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is the side-effect of the behavior mismatch between the Notes and
Exchange Server delegation strategies. In Notes, "delegate" really means
"forward the meeting;" in Exchange Server, "delegate" means "allowing access to
someone else to accept or decline."
