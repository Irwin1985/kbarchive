SUMMARY
=======

This articles provides a guide to common LinkAge V3.2 Exchange-Notes Connector
problems.

Most common Exchange-Notes Connector problems can be easily solved if their
causes are narrowed down. In most cases, the automatically generated LinkAge
logs will contain the information needed to find the problem. Use the following
points to further investigate and possibly solve the problem:

- What versions of Windows NT, Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes (build and
  language) are you using? Make sure the LinkAge Connector is certified against
  the foreign language products, if other than English.

- The Notes Connector should be set as Admin Service Account in Exchange
  Server.

- The Connector's user ID (as created in Notes) should be the one used to
  establish a session to the Notes server. Check this user ID by quiting any
  Notes clients on the Connector computer. Use Task Manager to stop the
  Nlnotes.exe process (if it is running). Then launch the Notes client and
  verify the userid.

- Verify that you only have one NNOTES.DLL file in the \NOTES\DATA directory
  and nowhere else on the Connector box. The \NOTES\DATA directory may need to
  be added to the system path. You can modify the system path through Control
  Panel-System-Environment. The machine might need to be rebooted for the new
  path to take effect.

- The Connector's Access Control on Exchange.box and Exchange.bad databases in
Notes should be set to MANAGER with DELETE permission. The Access Control should
be set to DEPOSITOR on Mail.box. ith older version of Notes (earlier than
Release 4.5.1), setting the access control on Mail.box to MANAGER with DELETE
permissions will solve mail delivery/routing problems.

- Have you applied the latest patch- Check the patches.txt file found in the
LINKAGE directory.

- Confirm that you have the driver RPCDCE4.DLL in your system path. If not, copy
this DLL from any NT 3.51 machine or from the LINKAGE directory to the
\WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory (or any other one in the path).

- In case you see MAPI-related errors in the LinkAge log. Delete the MAPI profile
for the connector by logging into the NT account that is used to run the LinkAge
Connector, run REGEDT32 and delete the following hive:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version \Windows
  Messaging Subsystem\Profiles\&lt;servername&gt;-LME-NOTES V3.

Recycle all MAPI-based services (i.e. Exchange Server) and Connector. MAPI
profiles are not deleted on a machine until all MAPI clients are stopped. That
is, stop the LinkAge services, then stop Exchange services. Now start Exchange,
then LinkAge.
