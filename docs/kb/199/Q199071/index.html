-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

You might see event ID 5714

  The full synchronization request from the server "bdc" failed with the
  following error: &lt;error text&gt;

on the primary domain controller (PDC), or event ID 5716

  The partial synchronization replication of the SAM database from the primary
  domain controller &lt;name&gt; failed with the following error: Cannot
  perform this operation on built-in accounts

on one or more backup domain controllers (BDCs), indicating that replication of
the LSA database failed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because one of the secrets in the LSA database is corrupted.
This can happen when the registry is physically corrupted (as in a disk system
hardware failure) or when a transaction to the LSA database does not complete
and is left in a partially completed state (as in a power failure during a
transaction).

If you examine the LSA secrets in the registry, you will see at least one secret
that has only one subkey, PolMod. Normal secrets have five subkeys.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, locate and delete the corrupted secret in the registry
on the PDC.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If you examine each secret in the registry, you can locate the corrupted secret
manually and no reboot will be required.

You can also find the corrupted secret by installing a checked build of
Netlogon.dll and examining the logs that are generated. A Netlogon.log file of
this problem will have lines (wrapped for readability) that look like:

  12/08 18:11:41 [SYNC] Packing Secret Object: G$$TRUSTEDDOMAIN
  12/08 18:11:41 [CRITICAL] NlSyncLsaDatabase: returning unsuccessful
  (c0000034).
  12/08 18:11:41 [MISC] Eventlog: 5714 (2) "PDC" "%%2" c0000034
  12/08 18:11:41 [SYNC] NetrDatabaseSync: LSA returning (0xc0000034) to PDC
  Context: 0x0.

From this log, you can see that the LSA secret named G$$TRUSTEDDOMAIN is
corrupted.

For more information on obtaining, installing and configuring the checked build
of Netlogon.dll, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.


After the corrupted secret is located, delete it.

NOTE: Performing the following procedure across a slow WAN link could be
extremely time-consuming (hours). Microsoft recommends that you perform this
procedure locally on the PDC.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security

3. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

4. Change the permissions on this key and all subkeys to:

  Administrators: Full Control
  System: Full Control

  NOTE: You can safely ignore any errors while applying permissions.

5. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security\Policy\Secrets\&lt;secretname&gt;

6. On the Edit menu, click Delete.

7. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security

8. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

9. Change the permissions on this key and all subkeys to:

  Administrators: Special... (only Read Control and Write DAC)
  System: Full Control

  NOTE: You can safely ignore any errors while applying permissions.

10. Quit Registry Editor.

In this example, the corrupted key corresponds to an outgoing trust. You would
need to re-establish the trust to TRUSTEDDOMAIN using User Manager for Domains
to delete and re-create each end of the trust.

Here is a short list of secrets you might see:
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Secret Name    | Type of Information                        | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| G$$DOMAINNAME  | Trust to domain DOMAINNAME                 | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| G$&lt;other name&gt; | Other global secret                        | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| $MACHINE.ACC   | Machine account password for this computer | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| NL$xx          | Cached logon credentials                   | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| *ServiceName*  | Information stored by that service         | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
Problems of this sort occur only in global secrets because other secrets are not
replicated to BDCs by Netlogon. Thus, it is only necessary to inspect secrets
beginning with G$.


MORE INFORMATION
================

LSA secrets are stored in the registry under the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security\Policy\Secrets

Each LSA secret key will normally have five subkeys:

  CupdTime
  CurrVal
  OldVal
  OupdTime
  SecDesc

When a secret changes, the values of each of these keys must be looked up and
replicated by Netlogon as part of the normal domain accounts database
replication process.

The 5714/5716 event pair is generated when one or more of these values is
missing.

During a change to an LSA secret, there is an intermediate state where these five
subkeys have been deleted and a temporary key, PolMod, is present. If the
transaction is not completed atomically, this key could persist, resulting in a
corrupted and non-replicatable LSA secret.
