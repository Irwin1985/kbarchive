The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Assigning values to DAO recordset Field objects is slow for recordsets with many
fields. (This may be perceived as slow database edits or updates). Note that the
affected code is:

  rs.Fields(x) =&lt;value&gt;

and not:

  rs.Update, rs.Edit, or rs.AddNew

If these methods are slow, it is likely a different problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to work around this problem.

One possibility is to use DAO 3.0 rather than DAO 3.5 or DAO 3.51. This can be
done by changing the library selected in Visual Basic's References dialog. Use
the References command on the Project menu to view this dialog.

NOTE: DAO 3.0 is not distributed with Visual Basic 5.0 or Visual Basic 6.0.

You can also work around this problem by using a DDL (Data Definition Language)
query rather than DAO code to create the tables. If the application's database
already exists, DDL can be used to create a copy of the table in a new database,
and DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements, such as INSERT INTO, can be
used to move the data to the new database. For more information on creating
tables via DDL, read the "CREATE TABLE Statement" Help topic in the Visual Basic
on-line Help.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following code creates two databases with tables named according to the
number of fields in that table. That is, Table20 contains 20 fields, and so
forth. The databases are identical except that the tables in one are created via
the CreateTableDef() method, whereas the tables in the other are created via DDL
queries. For each table in each database, the table will be opened and a new
value assigned to a field. This assignment will be timed and the results written
to an output file. Note that the actual data in the database will never be
updated.

The output files are comma-delimited text files, named according to the
corresponding database. The first column contains the number of fields in the
table tested; the second column contains the approximate time, in seconds, that
was required to assign a value to a field in the corresponding recordset
object.

NOTE: All times are approximate and are intended only to illustrate the issue
involved. Times will vary greatly depending on the specifics of the environment
in which the test is run.

1. Create a new Standard Exe project in Visual Basic and add a new module to the
  project. Check Microsoft DAO 3.51 object Library under Project References.

2. In Project - Project1 Properties, change the Startup Object to Sub Main.

3. Place the following code in the General Declarations section of Module1 and
  run the project by pressing the F5 key:

     Option Explicit

     Const strWrkDir = "c:\temp\"
     Const maxfld = 200

     Dim dbfastname As String
     Dim dbslowname As String

     Sub CreateDBSlow()
         Dim db As Database
         Dim td As TableDef
         Dim fld As Field
         Dim cTbl As Integer
         Dim cFld As Integer

         Set db = DBEngine.CreateDatabase(dbslowname, dbLangGeneral)
         For cTbl = 1 To maxfld   
             Set td = db.CreateTableDef("Table" &amp; cTbl)
             For cFld = 1 To cTbl
                 Set fld = td.CreateField("Field" &amp; cFld, dbText)
                 td.Fields.Append fld
                 Set fld = Nothing
             Next cFld
             db.TableDefs.Append td
             Set td = Nothing
         Next cTbl
         db.Close

     End Sub

     Sub CreateDBFast()
         Dim db As Database
         Dim td As TableDef
         Dim fld As Field
         Dim cTbl As Integer
         Dim cFld As Integer
         Dim strSQL As String

         Set db = DBEngine.CreateDatabase(dbfastname, dbLangGeneral)
         For cTbl = 1 To maxfld
             strSQL = "CREATE TABLE Table" &amp; cTbl &amp; " ("
             For cFld = 1 To cTbl
                 strSQL = strSQL &amp; "Field" &amp; cFld &amp; " text,"
             Next cFld
             strSQL = Left(strSQL, Len(strSQL) - 1) &amp; ")"
             db.Execute strSQL
         Next cTbl
         db.Close

     End Sub

     Sub DoTest(dbName As String)
         Dim db As Database
         Dim rs As Recordset
         Dim sStart As Single
         Dim sStop As Single
         Dim cTbl As Integer

         Open dbName &amp;; ".txt" For Output As 1
         Set db = DBEngine.OpenDatabase(dbName)
         For cTbl = 1 To maxfld
             Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Select * From Table" &amp; cTbl)
             rs.AddNew
             sStart = Timer
             rs.Fields(0) = ""
             sStop = Timer
             rs.Close
             Set rs = Nothing
             Write #1, cTbl, sStop - sStart
         Next cTbl
         Close 1

     End Sub

     Sub Main()

         dbfastname = strWrkDir &amp; "fastdb.mdb"
         dbslowname = strWrkDir &amp; "slowdb.mdb"

         CreateDBSlow
         CreateDBFast
         DoTest dbslowname
         DoTest dbfastname

         MsgBox "Test Complete"

     End Sub
