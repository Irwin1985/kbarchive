SYMPTOMS
========

Outlook and Exchange clients remotely accessing the Microsoft Mail postoffice
using RAS, download an outdated global address list. The LAN clients' global
address list is current. Attempts to perform a manual Remote Regenerate may fail
to update the remote global address.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by downloading an outdated file from the postoffice. To
determine what that file is and how to resolve the problem, see the "Resolution"
section.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following to determine which event is causing the outdated file to be
downloaded.

Cause 1: The user's postoffice does not have an account designated as Remote.

  Verify: The postoffice has at least one user account defined as Remote,
  call-in only.

  Resolution: Designate at least one mailbox as a Remote account.

Cause 2: Another process is prohibiting the message transfer agent (MTA) from
performing a Remote Regenerate at 4:00 A.M. daily.

  Verify: The MTA is functioning properly at 4:00 A.M.

  Resolution: Determine what is preventing External.exe from functioning at this
  time.

Cause 3: The Rnetwork.glb file is locked or corrupted, and no longer being
regenerated.

  Verify: The Rnetwork.glb file has a date stamp of the current date, and the
  time is close to 4:00 A.M.

  Resolution:

  1. Review the log maintained by the MTA.

  2. Review the session.log from the MTA for the error "unable to access
  rnetsem.glb."

  3. Rename the Rnetsem.glb file on the postoffice, and allow External.exe to run
  at 4:00 A.M. This file will get recreated during the next cycle.

Cause 4: The user's mailbox is designated as Remote, and configured for a Custom
view rather than for the Default view.

  Verify: Review the affected user accounts for the "View" assigned to their
  Remote status.

  Resolution:

  1. If the user's view is set for a Custom view, follow item 2, or change the
  user's view to Default view.

  2. Check for existence of [hex#].glb files. These represent Remote Custom views.

  3. If these exist, they require manual updating through Admin.exe by, by
  selecting Remote, then Views, and then Modify on the menu.
