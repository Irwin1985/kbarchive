The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector may fail to start on an Exchange
Server computer that has a local replica of the Free/Busy public folder.

The following event ID messages may be logged in the application event log.

  Event Type:Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeCalCon
  Event Category:Connection
  Event ID:5005
  Date:12/11/2000
  Time:1:10:14 PM
  User:N/A
  Computer:EXCHANGE-GV
  Description: The Calendar Connector could not connect to the Public
  Information Store due to MAPI error 80004005 and is shutting down. Ensure
  that the information Store service is running and the calendar connector
  service is configured to use the Exchange Services Account and Password in
  Services Control Manager before restarting the Calendar Connector.

  Event Type:Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeCalCon
  Event Category:Connection
  Event ID:5006
  Date:12/11/2000
  Time:1:10:14 PM
  User:N/A
  Computer:EXCHANGE-GV
  Description: The Calendar Connector is shutting down due to an unrecoverable
  error.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms appear when the public information store is deleted or moved to
another Exchange Server computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although MAPI mail clients can be re-directed to a public information store
(Pub.edb), the Exchange Calendar Connector explicitly requires access to the
local Exchange Server computer's public information store to complete its
initialization routines.

The Exchange Server administrator must change a configuration setting on the
server to force the calendar connector to stay focused on the local public
information store. This can be done by following these steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Go to the current server object and expand the properties to reveal the
  Private Information Store and Public Information Store objects.

  NOTE: If you do not see the Public Information Store object, it has not yet
  been added to the Exchange Server. Ensure that this is done before you
  continue.

3. Click to select the Private Information Store, click File menu, and then
  click Properties to open its properties.

4. Click the General tab, and look for the public folder server setting near the
  bottom of the dialog box.

5. Change the server name to now point to itself rather than to a remote
  server.

  This causes all MAPI clients to access the local replica for F/B information
  rather than using another server. This also enables the Calendar Connector to
  successfully sign on to the public information store locally.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5.
