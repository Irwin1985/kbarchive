-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

There are four methods for initiating the removal of the Systems Management
Server client software from a client:

1. Run the SMSMAN wizard, and select the Remove Systems Management Components
  check box.

2. Modify the client's registry to add a removal value.

3. Change the site's boundary to exclude the Internet Protocol (IP) subnet or
  Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) network number used by a client or
  clients.

4. Run the 20clicln.bat utility from the support tools included on the SMS
  service pack cd or available by download from

  Http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/downloads/default.asp
  (Http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/downloads/default.asp)

These options are discussed further in the MORE INFORMATION section of this
article.

NOTE: Each of these options requires an administrative equivalent account on the
client computer to remove the SMS client software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the SMSMAN Wizard
-----------------------

1. Run SMSMAN from the following path:

  \\server\smslogon\x86.bin\00000409

2. Click Next.

3. Select Remove Systems Management Components and then click Next.

Setting a Registry Key
----------------------

To use the registry method, perform the steps below corresponding to the
operating system you are using.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Windows 95:

1. Use Regedit.exe to add the string value "SMS Client Deinstall" to the client
  registry under the following key and set it to TRUE:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client Properties

2. Restart the client to launch Clisvc95.exe to start a CCIM maintenance cycle.

  NOTE: A restart is not required; the CCIM polling interval is 23 hours, so if
  you do not restart the computer, the CCIM maintenance cycle will occur later.

Windows NT:

1. Use Regedit.exe to add the string value "SMS Client Deinstall" to the client
  registry under the following key and set it to TRUE:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client Properties

2. Stop and start the SMS Client Service to start a CCIM maintenance cycle.

Removing Client's Subnet or Network Number From the Site Boundary
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can remove Systems Management Server software from clients by removing the
client's subnet/network number from the site boundaries (so that the client is
no longer assigned to a Systems Management Server site). The Systems Management
Server client software is removed from that client during the next maintenance
interval, or by restarting the client.

To remove the subnet or network number from the site boundary, perform the
following steps from in the Systems Management Server Administrator console:

1. Expand the Site Database property.

2. Expand the Site Hierarchy property.

3. Right-click the site and click Properties on the shortcut menu.

4. Click the Boundaries tab.

5. Right-click the subnet/network number to remove and click Delete on the
  shortcut menu.

You can remove the client from all x86 based operating systems by using the
20clicln.bat utility provided in the support tools:

- Map a drive to the location of the 20clicln.bat file ( this location must
  include the 20clicln.bat, hammer.exe, kill.exe, and setevnt.exe files).

- Then execute the 20clicln.bat and wait for it to complete. (This could take
  15 to 20 minutes depending on degree of traffic and bandwidth in the
  network.)

Notes
-----

All of these methods of removing the SMS 2.0 client software except the
20clicln.bat assume that you still have the SMS site server working and
available on the network. Updated support tools are available as they are
released from the following Microsoft Web site:
http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt.

The 20clicln.bat utility removes almost all traces of the SMS client software
from the computer. Only the GUID (unique SMS ID) stays. This means that the next
time this computer becomes assigned to an SMS site and installs the SMS client,
all client software files will once again be downloaded across the network
before the SMS client install process can begin.
