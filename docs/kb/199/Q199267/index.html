SUMMARY
=======

This articles lists a few issues to be aware of to support Systems Management
Server 1.2 and Systems Management Server 2.0 scripts on the same logon server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. In your Systems Management Server 1.2 site, modify the logon scripts
  manually. Do not use the Automatically Configure Workstation Logon Scripts
  option. When you enable the Automatically Configure Workstation Logon Scripts
  option, Systems Management Server 1.2 periodically overwrites the script
  files with its own version of the files.

2. On your Systems Management Server 2.0 site server, go to the
  SMS\Data\NT_Logon directory.

  a. Rename NT_Logon.pcf to NT_Logon.old

  b. Copy the NT_Logon_Interop.pcf and rename the copy to NT_Logon.pcf.

  Systems Management Server reads the NT_Logon.pcf file and copies the files
  listed there to the logon points in the site. NT_Logon_Interop.pcf lists the
  files required when Systems Management Server 1.2 clients and Systems
  Management Server 2.0 clients use the same logon script. The original
  NT_Logon.pcf in the same directory lists the files required when there are no
  Systems Management Server 1.2 clients using the logon script.

3. Login scripts are the most often used ways of managing a Systems Management
  Server version 1.2 client because you can usually depend on them to reliably
  execute in the user's context, and they can be customized easily for unique
  customer needs. Because the Systems Management Server version 2.0 client
  layout had not been envisioned at the time Systems Management Server 1.2 was
  released, a retrofit included in Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4
  contains new functionality used to detect a Systems Management Server 2.0
  footprint. Several new lines of script were added to make use of the new
  Check20.exe utility program. This utility supports both an "aware" mode and
  an "interop" mode from the command line. Systems Management Server 1.2
  Service Pack 4 implements the "interop" mode and will cause the script to
  bypass a client computer that has been installed and assigned to one or more
  Systems Management Server 2.0 sites. If the computer has only been discovered
  but not yet assigned, then it will be taken into the Systems Management
  Server 1.2 site. Later, when the computer is assigned to a Systems Management
  Server 2.0 site, it will be upgraded, and the script will bypass the
  computer.

4. When a Systems Management Server 1.2 site attempts to manage a domain or a
  list of servers, it will add the SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT and
  SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT services to the server and provide the machine
  Systems Management Server client functionality to generate inventory and run
  packages. The Systems Management Server 2.0 site also delivers similar
  functionality, so there must be a way to peacefully share certain server
  resources. For this reason, Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4 has
  been changed to permit the SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER service to detect the
  presence of the Systems Management Server 2.0 client (SMS Client Service) and
  if found, Systems Management Server 1.2 will bypass the installation of the
  SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT and SMS_PACKAGE_COMMAND_MANAGER_NT. "Ownership" of the
  client functionality will be effectively passed to the Systems Management
  Server 2.0 site, although the Systems Management Server 1.2 server shares
  (SMS_SHR) and data files (such as .ins and .cfg files) will continue to be
  maintained by the Systems Management Server 1.2 site.

For more information on how to avoid contention between sites, regarding Systems
Management Server 1.2, clients visiting Systems Management Server 2.0 sites and
Systems Management Server 2.0 clients visiting Systems Management Server 1.2
sites, refer to Chapter 5 "Upgrading from SMS 1.2 to SMS 2.0" in the Systems
Management Server 2.0 Administrator's Guide.
