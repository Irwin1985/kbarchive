SUMMARY
=======

A server monitoring tool known as HealthMon is a new feature in Systems
Management Server 2.0. The HealthMon management console is a stand-alone
component that provides a centralized, graphical, and real-time status view of
your Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 and Microsoft BackOffice Server computers.
Based on color-coded severity levels, you can view operational conditions,
including both normal and exception status.

As events are received, HealthMon organizes and displays them according to
predefined monitored object groups (MMC nodes).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can set thresholds for generating exception and normal status. To do so, use
the following steps:

1. Right-click the Managed Component whose threshold you would like to change.

2. Click Properties and then click the specific monitored item.

3. Click the Threshold tab and set the threshold required for the item.

HealthMon generates an

  Unable to detect

message when the performance counter or service that a component is monitoring,
is not available.

To avoid receiving these messages, install the required service or counter as
appropriate.

- Services
  To install the Exchange Server, Internet Information Server, SQL Server, SNA
  Server, or Systems Management Server services, follow the directions in the
  product documentation for that component.
  NOTE: SQL Server does not start the Microsoft Distributed Transaction
  Coordinator (MS DTC) service until it is needed. To start it, you must change
  the Startup settings for this service (in Control Panel, double-click the
  Services icon, and change the Startup setting to Automatic).

- Physical Disk or Logical Disk
  For information about configuring physical disk and logical disk counters, at
  the command prompt, type "diskperf.exe" (without the quotation marks).

- Network Interface
  Install the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit network counters component or install
  the SNMP service, and then reinstall Service Pack 4 for Windows NT 4.0.

For further information on HealthMon installation and usage, please refer to the
Systems Management Server 2.0 Release notes, Readme.htm file, and the Systems
Management Server 2.0 online help.
