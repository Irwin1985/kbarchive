SUMMARY
=======

Many of the classes defined in the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) libraries
require the programmer to perform two steps to create an object. The CBitmap,
CDC, CDialog, and CWnd classes are examples of this class type. This article
discusses the advantages of this design decision.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This two-step process is known as two-phase construction. In the first phase, a
C++ constructor creates an object in a sound state, a state that can be
destroyed by a destructor function. The second phase, usually performed by the
Create() member function, calls into Windows and allocates resources. [For
CBitmap objects, the LoadBitmap() member function performs the second phase.]

This design has two main benefits. First, C++ constructors cannot return a value
to indicate failure. Operator new throws an exception when no memory is
available to construct an object. (An ad hoc mechanism, like an fOK Boolean
variable, is one mechanism to indicate an error in construction.)

Second, if constructors are "cheap" (that is, the constructor requires little
processor time and does not allocate many resources), an object can be
efficiently embedded into another object without a great increase in the cost of
construction.

For example, consider the process of embedding a CBitmap object into an object
derived from CWnd. If the CWnd-derived object used one-phase construction, its
construction would depend on successful construction of the CBitmap object. The
programmer would not have any flexibility to deal with any errors as they
arose.

However, in the two-phase method, the application can initialize the bitmap any
number of different ways while checking for failure. In addition, two- phase
embedded objects reduce problems allocating and de-allocating objects, tracking
object ownership, and deleting Windows objects appropriately.
