SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a list of documents available from Microsoft that discuss
TrueType fonts with reference to their use in Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1.

\ The documents are broadly classified into three categories on the basis of
their technical scope. Documents in the "End User" category have information
about using TrueType fonts for the Windows 3.1 end user. Documents in the
"Application Developer" category discuss the impact of TrueType fonts on
Windows-based applications and contain technical details that let application
developers use, and take advantage of, TrueType font technology in their
applications. Documents in the "Font/Tool/Curious Developer" category contain
information useful to developers interested in developing their own TrueType
fonts or font-development tools, or interested in knowing about the inner
workings of the TrueType font technology.

Each entry contains information to help the reader obtain a copy of the document.
Many of the following documents will be available as part of the upcoming
Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) CD. For more information about this CD, call
the Microsoft Developer Services Team at (800) 227-4679.

MORE INFORMATION
================

---------------------------

Title: "Fonts in Windows 3.1"

What to expect: This document gives a comprehensive introduction to the font
technologies (including TrueType) used in Windows 3.1.

Finding a copy: This document is available as an application note (WW0528); call
Microsoft Product Support Services at (206) 637-7098 to request this application
note. It is also available in the Microsoft Software Library as document S13367.
Similar information can also be found in Chapter 9, "Fonts," of the "Microsoft
Windows Resource Kit" manual.

Title: "Microsoft TrueType Font Pack User's Guide"

What to expect: This document contains notes on installing and using TrueType
fonts, designing documents with TrueType fonts, and a brief history of the
TryeType font technology.

Finding a copy: This document is shipped with the Microsoft TrueType Font Pack
for Windows. The font pack is an assortment of 44 TrueType fonts. Call Microsoft
Consumer Sales at (800) 426-9400 for purchasing information.

Application Developer Oriented Documents
----------------------------------------

Title: Chapter 18, "Fonts," in the "Guide to Programming"

What to expect: This document contains a gentle introduction to using fonts in
applications. It begins with a discussion of the fundamentals of fonts,
introduces the three font technologies used in Windows 3.1 (with an emphasis on
TrueType fonts), discusses TrueType font technology in the context of WYSIWYG
and document/printer/platform portability, and finally delves into the details
of using fonts (with due attention paid to TrueType) in Windows 3.1
applications.

Finding a copy: This manual is shipped with the Windows 3.1 Software Development
Kit (SDK). All the information is also available in the SDK 3.1 online
documentation (WIN31WH.HLP) under the subject headings "Font Fundamentals,"
"Fonts in Windows," "TrueType Font Technology," and "Using Fonts in
Applications."

Title: "Windows Font Mapping" Author: Ron Gery

What to expect: This document discusses the Windows 3.1 font mapper and how it
controls the realization of fonts. Attention is paid to selecting TrueType fonts
and the effect of having TrueType fonts on the fonts selected by applications
developed for Windows 3.0 (which does not have TrueType fonts).

Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD.

Title: "Using TrueType" Author: Ron Gery

What to expect: This document gives a basic introduction to using TrueType in an
application under Windows 3.1. It discusses most of the TrueType functions,
enumerating and selecting TrueType fonts, positioning TrueType characters in
documents, and page layout.

Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.

Title: "TrueType and Microsoft Windows Version 3.1" Authors: David Weise and
Dennis Adler

What to expect: This document introduces some font concepts and details the
various aspects of using TrueType fonts in applications developed for Windows
3.1.

Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.

Font/Tool/Curious Developer Oriented Documents
----------------------------------------------

Title: "Advanced TrueType: GetGlyphOutline" Author: Ron Gery

What to expect: This document presents an explanation of the GetGlyphOutline
function. It complements the definition of GetGlyphOutline found in the Windows
SDK 3.1 reference manual and extends the definition by providing explanations
for those portions of the GetGlyphOutline function that were omitted in the SDK
3.1 manual.

Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.

Title: "An Introduction to Digital Typography Using TrueType" Author: George
Moore

What to expect: This transcript of a technical talk lists the basic steps that a
typical computer system goes through in order to display characters on the
output device and details these steps for TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1.

Finding a copy: This document is available as part of the MSDN CD-ROM.

Title: "Linear vs. Nonlinear Scaling" Author: George Moore

What to expect: This transcript of a technical talk describes the importance of
being able to nonlinearly scale a font. It discusses how a TrueType font vendor
can use nonlinear scaling so that low-resolution devices can display
high-quality TrueType fonts.

Finding a copy: This document is available in the Microsoft Software Library as
document S13452.

Title: "TrueType Font Files Specification Version 1.0"

What to expect: This specification details how to construct a TrueType font from
scratch (or build a tool to do so), the TrueType programming language, and the
complete format of each subtable contained in the .ttf file. It also contains
illustrations.

Finding a copy: This document is spread over three documents (S13442, S13443,
S13444) and is available in the Microsoft Software Library.
