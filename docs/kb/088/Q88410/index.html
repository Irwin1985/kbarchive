-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you receive one of
the following error messages:

  The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) cannot be loaded. There is
  unrecognizable disk software installed on this computer.

  -or-

  The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) cannot be loaded. There is
  a conflict with another virtual device.

  -or-

  This application has tried to access the hard disk in a way that is
  incompatible with the Windows 32-bit disk access feature (WDCTRL). This may
  cause the system to become unstable.

  -or-

  The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) cannot be loaded. There is
  unrecognizable disk software installed on this computer. The address that
  MS-DOS uses to communicate with the hard disk has been changed. Some
  software, such as disk-caching software, changes this address. If you aren't
  running such software, you should run a virus-detection program to make sure
  the computer is virus free. To continue starting Windows without using the
  32-bit disk driver, press any key.

CAUSE
=====

The above error messages can be displayed when:

- The system is infected with a virus.

  -or-

- You are running the PC Cillin anti-virus program.

  -or-

- The Device=*WDCTRL entry occurs more than once in [386Enh] section of the
  SYSTEM.INI file.

  -or-

- You are using a third-party replacement for WDCTRL and you have reinstalled
  Windows.

  -or-

- You are loading a real-mode driver in the CONFIG.SYS file that alters the
  manner in which Windows monitors and controls INT 13h.

  -or-

- Using a QD6500A VLB controller that was installed in Windows 3.1 and then
  installing WFW 3.11. After the install there will be an *int13, WDCTRL, and
  QDICTRL.386 in [386Enh] section of system.ini. QDICTRL.386 alone breaks the
  IFSHLP.SYS. Remark out the QDICTRL.386 line and use the WDCTRL. Leave the
  QD6500.SYS line in the config.sys.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The System Is Infected with a Virus
-----------------------------------

During startup, if Windows detects that a particular undocumented interrupt has
been hooked by a "program" it does not recognize, Windows displays one of the
above messages. Quite often, the program it does not recognize is a virus. The
Stoned, Bloomington, and Form viruses can cause these errors.

To correct this problem, run virus-detection software to detect and remove any
viruses from the hard disk drive. The Anit-CMOSa virus will also cause this;
McAfee v2.14 will find, but not cure it.


You Are Running the PC Cillin Anti-Virus Program
------------------------------------------------

PC Cillin anti-virus software can cause these error messages. For more
information on PC Cillin and problems with Windows, query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  pc cillin and windows

You Are Using a Third-Party Replacement
for WDCTRL and You Have Reinstalled Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a Western Digital Caviar 2540 hard disk drive (or another model that
uses WDCDRV.386 as a replacement for WDCTRL) and you reinstall Windows to the
same directory, Windows puts WDCTRL in the SYSTEM.INI file but does not remove
the third-party driver. Removing the DEVICE=*WDCTRL entry from the SYSTEM.INI
file corrects this problem.


You are Loading a Real-Mode Driver in the CONFIG.SYS File That
Alters the Manner in Which Windows Monitors and Controls INT 13h
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real-mode drivers that manipulate the way in which INT13 calls are handled may
prevent the 32-bit disk access driver from loading.

The issue can also occur if the CD-ROM drivers for a new 50-speed CD-ROM drive
conflict with 32-bit disk access. Disabling 32-bit disk access in the Virtual
Memory settings in the 386 Enhanced tool in ControlPanel may allow the CD-ROM to
be accessed in Windows with no error messages.
