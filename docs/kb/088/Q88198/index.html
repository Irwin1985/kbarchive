The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The common dialog boxes library (COMMDLG.DLL) provides a standard set of dialog
boxes for applications developed for the Microsoft Windows graphical
environment. The text below lists errors in the online and printed documentation
for the common dialog boxes DLL in the Microsoft Windows Software Development
Kit (SDK).

MORE INFORMATION
================

"Programmer's Reference, Volume 1: Overview"
--------------------------------------------

On page 132, in the "Common Dialog Box Overview" topic, change the "NAME cd"
statement to list the name in uppercase letters (NAME CD).

On page 157, in the "Customizing Common Dialog Boxes" topic, change the "NAME cd"
statement to list the name in uppercase letters (NAME CD).

On page 158, a table lists the template filenames and their corresponding dialog
boxes. Add a note to state that these dialog boxes are defined in the DLGS.H
file. The only exception is the ChooseColor() dialog box, which is defined in
the COLORDLG.H file.

"Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions"
---------------------------------------------

On page 49, the list of errors that the ChooseColor() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION, CDERR_MEMALLOCFAILURE, and
CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from the list and add the CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error
to the list.

On page 51, add the following comment to the documentation for the ChooseFont()
function:

  When the user selects the Show Only TrueType Fonts In
  Applications option in the Control Panel Fonts application, the
  Font dialog box shows only TrueType fonts.

On page 52, the list of errors that the ChooseFont() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION and CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from
the list and add the CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the list.

On page 63, add the statement #include &lt;cderr.h&gt; to the documentation for
the CommDlgExtendedError() function. This topic does not mention that the
CDERR.H header file defines the error codes for this function.

On page 306, in the documentation for the FindText() function, add the following
comment to the discussion of the lpfr parameter:

  The &lt;B&gt;FINDREPLACE&lt;/B&gt; structure must be remain in memory after calling
  the &lt;B&gt;FindText&lt;/B&gt; function because the &lt;B&gt;Find Text&lt;/B&gt; dialog box is
  modeless.

On page 307, the list of errors the FindText() function can return is incorrect.
Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION, CDERR_MEMALLOCFAILURE, and CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE
errors from the error list and add the CDERR_REGISTERMSGFAIL error to the list.

On page 308, the code example that documents the FindText() function declares a
local copy of the FINDREPLACE data structure without the "static" keyword. An
application must store this structure in memory that persists after calling
FindText(). This memory can be a global variable, a static local variable, or a
dynamically allocated memory block.

On page 413, the list of errors the GetOpenFileName() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION and CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from
the error list and add the CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the list.

On page 435, the list of errors the GetSaveFileName() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION and CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from
the list and add the CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the list.

On page 752, the list of errors the PrintDlg() function can return is incorrect.
Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION error from the list and add the
CDERR_DIALOGFAILURE error to the list.

The Print dialog box appears in the online help for the PrintDlg() function. If a
check box appears in the lower-right corner without any accompanying text, that
check box is the Collate Copies box.

On page 788, in the documentation for the ReplaceText() function, add the
following comment to the discussion of the lpfr parameter:

  The &lt;B&gt;FINDREPLACE&lt;/B&gt; structure must remain in memory after calling
  the ReplaceText function since the &lt;B&gt;Replace Text&lt;/B&gt; dialog box is
  modeless.

On page 789, the list of errors the ReplaceText() function can return is
incorrect. Remove the CDERR_INITIALIZATION, CDERR_MEMALLOCFAILURE, and
CDERR_MEMLOCKFAILURE errors from the list and add CDERR_REGISTERMSGFAIL to the
list.

On page 789, the code example that documents the ReplaceText() function declares
a local copy of the FINDREPLACE data structure with the "static" keyword.
However, the online documentation omits this keyword. An application must store
this structure in memory that persists after calling the FindText function. This
memory can be a global variable, a static local variable, or a dynamically
allocated memory block.

"Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures, and Macros"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 246, add the following comment to the documentation for the CHOOSEFONT
data structure:

  When the user selects the Show Only TrueType Fonts In
  Applications option in the Control Panel Fonts application, the
  Font dialog box shows only TrueType fonts.

On page 247, add a comment to the documentation for the CF_APPLY flag to note
that a hook function is required to process a notification from this button.
When the user presses the button, the hook function receives a WM_COMMAND
message with wParam == psh3 (a constant defined in the DLGS.H header file).

On page 248, the documentation for the CF_NOFACESEL flag refers to "multiple font
selections." This flag indicates that the selected text is heterogeneous; some
text in the selection is formatted with one font, some with another font.

On page 248, the documentation for the CF_NOSIZESEL flag refers to "multiple size
selections." This flag indicates that the selected text is heterogeneous; some
text in the selection is formatted in one size, some in another size.

On page 248, the documentation for the CF_NOSTYLESEL flag refers to "multiple
style selections." This flag indicates that the selected text is heterogeneous;
some text in the selection is formatted in one style, some in another style.

On page 249, add a comment to the documentation for the CF_SCALABLEONLY flag to
indicate that the application must specify a value in the hDC member of the
CHOOSEFONT structure for the Font dialog box to display printer fonts.

On page 251, change the documentation for the nFontType member to indicate that
the high-order byte of this member contains one or more of the values in the
accompanying table. The low-order byte is reserved for use by Windows.

On page 286, the overview paragraph in the documentation for the FINDREPLACE data
structure states: "After the user chooses the OK button to close the dialog box,
the system returns information about the user's selections in this structure."
This statement is incorrect because neither the Find nor the Replace dialog box
has an OK button. Substitute Find Next for OK.

On page 287, the documentation for the FR_DOWN flag states: "After the user
chooses the OK button to close the dialog box, this flag specifies the user's
selection." This statement is incorrect because the Find dialog box does not
have an OK button. Substitute Find Next button for OK, and add a comment to
indicate that FR_DOWN flag applies only to the Find dialog box.

On page 288, in the documentation for the FR_HIDEUPDOWN and the FR_NOUPDOWN
flags, add a comment to indicate that these flags apply only to the Find dialog
box.

On page 289, in the documentation for the lpstrReplaceWith member, add a comment
to indicate that this member applies only to the Replace dialog box and that the
application-supplied buffer should be at least 80 characters long.

On page 289, in the documentation for the wReplaceWithLen member, add a comment
to indicate that this member applies only to the Replace dialog box.

On page 375, in the documentation for the lpstrCustomFilter member of the
OPENFILENAME data structure, add a comment to indicate that an application can
use the lpstrCustomFilter member to specify one additional filter. The
description of this member incorrectly states that "The system copies the
strings to the buffer when the user chooses the OK button to close the dialog
box." This statement should say that the system copies the last-selected search
filter from the List Files As Type combo box into the buffer to which this
member points. The online Help file contains additional text (not present in the
printed manual) that correctly describes this process.

On page 376, in the documentation for the lpstrFile member, add a comment to note
that this member takes precedence over the lpstrCustomFilter member. In other
words, if lpstrFile is not blank, the File Name edit control shows its
contents.

On page 376, the documentation for the lpstrInitialDir member contains the
following statement: "If the lpstrFile member contains a string that specifies a
valid path, the common dialog box procedure will use the path specified by this
string instead of the path specified by the string to which lpstrInitialDir
points." To eliminate any confusion, replace the phrase "this string" with "the
lpstrFile string."

On page 378, in the documentation for the OFN_NOCHANGEDIR flag, change its
documentation to state that this flag forces the dialog box to change to the
current directory. The common Open dialog box procedure stores the current
directory when it processes the WM_INITDIALOG message and restores the current
directory when the dialog box exits.

On page 394, in the documentation for the hDevMode and hDevNames members of the
PRINTDLG structure, add a comment to indicate that the application that calls
the PrintDlg function must call GlobalFree() to free the memory associated with
these handles.

On page 395, add a comment to the documentation for the hDC member to indicate
that the application must call the DeleteDC function in order to free the device
context specified in this member.
