SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Setup Toolkit for Windows GetCopyListCost() function can be used
to compute the cost needed to install the files in the copy list to the target.
The syntax for GetCopyListCost() is:

     Long&amp;=GetCopyListCost(szExtras$,szCosts$,szNeededs$)

szExtras$ is an input parameter to GetCopyListCost(), and szCosts$ and szNeededs$
are output parameters. All three parameters are symbols whose values are lists
of up to 26 integers. The nth integer in the list will have the information
about the nth alphabetic drive, where the drives are A-Z.

If there will be extra costs beyond the cost of copying and decompressing the
files in the copy list, these costs should be included in szExtras$. For
example, to specify an extra cost of 5000 bytes on the Windows drive, the code
might resemble the following:

     WinDrive$ = MID$(GetWindowsDir, 1, 1)
     ndrive% = ASC (ucase$(WinDrive$)) - ASC ("A")
     for i% = 1 to ndrive% step 1
         AddListItem "ExtraCosts", "0"
     next i%
     AddListItem "ExtraCosts", "5000"

     need&amp; = GetCopyListCost ("ExtraCosts", "costs", "needs")

If there are no extra costs, "" can be passed for szExtras$.

On return, the value of szCosts$ will be a list of 26 integers, which are the
total costs for drives A-Z of copying the files in the copy list and of the
costs in szExtras$. The value of szNeededs$ will be a list of 26 integers, which
are the total costs for each drive--the amount of free space on the drive. For
any drive that will not be affected by the extra costs or by copying the copy
list, szNeededs$ will report 0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In computing szCosts$ and szNeededs$, all files sizes, as well as the costs in
szExtras$, are rounded up to the nearest cluster. The integers in the lists will
always be some multiple of the cluster size for the appropriate drive. The
cluster sizes in bytes for various disks are as follows:

  Single-sided floppy disk    512
  Double-sided floppy disk   1024
  PC/AT fixed disk           2048
  PC/XT fixed disk           4096
  Other fixed disks          8192 &amp; 16384

The cost of each file on the copy list is calculated as follows. The properties
mentioned are from the file's property list in the .INF file:

  if the file does not exist at the install target
     if the source file has the REMOVE property
        file cost=0
     else
        file cost=size of source file
  else // the file does exist at the install target
  {
     if the source file has the REMOVE property
        file cost=-size of existing file at target
     else if the file has the NEVER overwrite property
        file cost=0
     else if the existing target file is read only and the source file
                 has the UNPROTECTED overwrite property
        file cost=0
     else if the file has the OLDER overwrite property and
                 the existing target file is newer
        file cost=0
     else if the file has the OLDER overwrite property and
             the existing target file is exactly the same (i.e. no copy)
        file cost=size of source file (for temporary copy used for
                                             language version check
     else // file will be copied
     {
        file cost=size of source file - size of existing target file
        if existing dest file is to be backed up (source file has
                   BACKUP property)
           file cost=file cost+size of existing target file
     }

  }

Note that GetCopyListCost() computes the copy cost incorrectly for split files
that already exist at the target. It erroneously reports that most of the space
used by the file will be freed.
