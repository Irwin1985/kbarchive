SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 WININI.WRI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WIN.INI File Settings
__________________________________________________________
Windows initialization files contain information that defines your
Windows environment. Windows for Workgroups and Windows-based
applications can use the information stored in these files to make
their configurations meet your needs and preferences.

There are two standard Windows initialization files:

&lt;B7&gt;  WIN.INI, which primarily contains settings that Windows maintains
  to customize your Windows environment according to your preferences.

&lt;B7&gt;  SYSTEM.INI, which primarily contains settings that customize
  Windows to meet your system's hardware needs.

This document describes only a few of the settings in the WIN.INI
file. You can get a more complete listing of the WIN.INI settings by
purchasing the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. The Windows for
Workgroups Resource Kit provides complete technical information about
Windows for Workgroups for the support professional. It includes a
technical reference manual and a disk containing helpful utilities,
system-resource viewers, drivers, and accessories.

To order the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit within the United
States, dial:

1-800-642-7676

To order outside of the United States, dial the phone number for your
area. You can find this number on the International Subsidiary card.

Format of the WIN.INI File

The WIN.INI file contains several sections, each of which consists of
a group of related settings. The sections and settings are listed in
the WIN.INI file in the following format:

 [section name]
 keyname=value

In this example, [section name] is the name of a section. The
enclosing brackets ([ ]) are required, and the left bracket must be
in the leftmost column on the screen.

The keyname=value statement defines the value of each setting. A
keyname is the name of a setting. It can consist of any combination
of letters and digits in uppercase or lowercase, and it must be
followed immediately by an equal sign (=). The value can be an
integer, a string, or a quoted string, depending on the setting.

You can include comments in initialization files. You must begin each
line of a comment with a semicolon (;).

How to Read the Listings in This Document

In this document, WIN.INI file settings are listed alphabetically
within each section. However, the settings do not appear
alphabetically in the WIN.INI file. To change a setting, you need to
search for it within the appropriate section of the WIN.INI file.

This document lists the syntax, default value, purpose, and
recommended method for changing each setting, using the following
format.
____________________________________________________________
SettingName=&lt;value-type&gt;

Default:     The Windows default value for this setting.
Purpose:     The function of the setting and its default value (if
applicable).
To change:     The recommended method for changing the value of this
setting.

&lt;value-type&gt; indicates whether the value should be an integer, a
letter, a range of numbers, or something else.
____________________________________________________________

Changing Settings

When the Setup program creates the WIN.INI file, it assigns default
values to the settings. Some settings that are listed in this
document may not appear in your WIN.INI file.

There are two ways to change WIN.INI settings:

- You can use Control Panel to change most settings. This is the
  safest and most recommended way because there is no need to open and
  edit the WIN.INI file, where it is easier to make mistakes. For more
  information about Control Panel, see Help for Control Panel.

- You can use a text editor, such as Notepad, to edit the WIN.INI
  file directly. (Do not use a formatting editor, such as Write; it can
  corrupt your WIN.INI file.) You must use this method to change the
  settings that you cannot change by using Control Panel. After you
  have edited the WIN.INI file, you must restart Windows for Workgroups
  for the settings to take effect. For more information about Notepad,
  see Help for Notepad.

Caution:  Always back up your WIN.INI file before you make changes,
so that you can restore the original file in case you accidentally
damage the WIN.INI file or make changes that cause problems when
running Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you do not
change any settings that are not described in this document. However,
if you need to change additional settings, refer to the Windows for
Workgroups Resource Kit. Be careful when using a text editor to edit
the WIN.INI file. Incorrect changes to the WIN.INI file can cause
unexpected results when you run Windows for Workgroups.

[windows] Section Settings

The [windows] section contains settings that affect general areas of
your Windows environment, such as which applications run when you
start Windows for Workgroups and how information appears on your
screen.

The [windows] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickHeight=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:     4
Purpose:     Specifies the height (in pixels) that the mouse
pointer can move between clicks when you double-click. If the mouse
pointer is moved further up or down, the two clicks are treated as
separate single clicks. For example, if DoubleClickHeight=10, the
mouse pointer cannot move vertically more than 5 pixels between
clicks in order for the two clicks to be recognized as a
double-click. If you use an odd number, it is rounded up to the
nearest even number. This setting is helpful if you are using a
pen-tablet pointing device.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickWidth=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:     4
Purpose:     Specifies the width (in pixels) that the mouse
pointer can move between clicks when you double-click. If the mouse
pointer is moved further right or left, the two clicks are treated as
separate single clicks. For example, if DoubleClickWidth=10, the
mouse pointer cannot move horizontally more than 5 pixels between
clicks in order for the two clicks to be recognized as a
double-click. If you use an odd number, it is rounded up to the
nearest even number. This setting is helpful if you are using a
pen-tablet pointing device.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
Load=&lt;filename(s)&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies one or more applications to run as icons
when Windows for Workgroups is started. This value is a list of one
or more filenames of applications, or documents that are associated
with an application, each separated by a space. Specify the complete
path if the application or document is not located in the Windows
directory. This setting works like the StartUp group in Program
Manager, but adding an icon to the StartUp group does not change this
setting.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
MenuDropAlignment=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     0
Purpose:     Specifies whether menus open right-aligned or
left-aligned with the menu title. If this setting is 0, menus open so
that they are left-aligned. If it is 1, menus open so that they are
right-aligned.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
MenuShowDelay=&lt;milliseconds&gt;

Default:     0 for 80386 computers; 400 for 80286 computers
Purpose:     Specifies how long Windows waits before displaying a
cascading menu.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
Programs=&lt;extensions&gt;

Default:     com exe bat pif
Purpose:     Defines which files Windows considers applications. A
filename extension is separated by a space and does not include the
preceding period.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
Run=&lt;filename(s)&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Causes Windows for Workgroups to run one or more
specified applications when it is started. The value is a list of one
or more filenames of applications, or documents associated with
applications, each separated by a space. Specify the complete path if
the application or document is not located in the Windows directory.
This setting works like the StartUp group in Program Manager, but
adding an icon to the StartUp group does not change this setting.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

[desktop] Section Settings

The [desktop] section contains optional settings that control the
appearance of the screen background (desktop) and the positioning of
windows and icons on the screen. Most of these settings (which are
not listed in this document) can be changed by using Control Panel,
except the following setting:
____________________________________________________________
IconVerticalSpacing=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:     Windows determines the default value based on the
icon title font and the display adapter you are using.
Purpose:     Specifies the number of pixels that appear vertically
between icons. Increasing this number increases the amount of
vertical space between icons.
To change:   Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

[fonts] Section Settings

The [fonts] section describes one or more font files that are loaded
when Windows for Workgroups is started.

The [fonts] section can contain one or more occurrences of the
following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;font-name&gt;=&lt;font-file&gt;

Default:
Purpose:     Specifies a font file. The &lt;font-name&gt; keyname is the
descriptive name of a font. The &lt;font-file&gt; value is the filename of
a file that contains font resources.
To change:     From Control Panel, choose the Fonts icon.
____________________________________________________________

[mci extensions] Section Settings

The [mci extensions] section contains settings that associate
different types of media files with different Media Control Interface
(MCI) device drivers. Whenever a media file is selected, Windows uses
the associated driver to play it.

The [mci extensions] section can contain one or more occurrences of
the following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;extension&gt;=&lt;mci-device-type&gt;

Purpose:     Associates files that have the specified extension
with the specified MCI device driver. Windows uses the specified
driver to play the media file associated with it.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

characteristics of a popup message.

The [WinPopup] section can include the following settings:
____________________________________________________________

Purpose:Specifies whether WinPopup displays a warning message if you
try to log on to more than one machine with the same logon name. If
this setting is 1, then when you log on to a second machine with the
same username, WinPopup displays a warning on the second machine.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

The [Windows Help] section can include the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
JumpColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Default:     0,128,0
Purpose:     Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, leads
to a new window of Help information. For example, specifying 000 000
000 as values results in black text on a white background.
