-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 NETWORKS.WRI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

2.2 More Information about Using Novell NetWare with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11

- When you set up NetWare support in Windows for Workgroups, the
  value of the lastdrive command in your CONFIG.SYS file is set to P.
  When you restart your computer, your login directory is drive Q. If
  you have any NetWare login scripts, make sure they reference the
  correct drive letter for your login directory.

  When the lastdrive command is set to P, you can use letters from A to
  P to connect to other Windows for Workgroups computers or Windows NT
  or Microsoft LAN Manager servers. Letters after P are reserved for
  connecting to Novell NetWare servers.

- Do not try to log in, log out, attach, or detach a Novell server
  from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows. You should log in before you start
  Windows for Workgroups, and attach or detach servers by using File
  Manager or Print Manager.

- When you set up NetWare support in Windows for Workgroups for
  IPXODI.COM and LSL.COM, Setup adds the odihlp command to your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It inserts it on the line following the ipxodi
  command. Do not change the order of these lines.

- If you are using a token-ring network and the driver on your Novell
  server does not support source routing (for example, IBM token-ring
  drivers earlier than version 2.4), remove the ROUTE.COM statement
  from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

- If you have problems connecting to a Novell server, make sure the
  Adapter Media Type setting in Network Setup matches your Novell
  NetWare software configuration. For more information, see Appendix C,
  "Troubleshooting," in The Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide."

- By default, NetWare allows you access to only 40 files at a time.
  When you are running applications with Windows, you can exceed this
  limit rather quickly. If you do, you might see unexpected error
  messages. To increase the file access limit, add the following line
  to the beginning of your NET.CFG file:

     file handles=60

  You should also add the following to your CONFIG.SYS file:

     files=60

- If you get unusable output (such as incorrect fonts, garbled text,
  invalid page breaks, or blank lines) when you try to print to a
  NetWare server, you may need to edit your print-job configuration.
  Try using the NetWare PRINTCON utility to set the Auto Endcap and
  Enable Timeout options to No.

- Swapping to a drive on a NetWare 286 server might make starting
  Windows for Workgroups take up to a minute. For information about
  controlling the location of your swap file, see Chapter 11, "Managing
  Memory and Performance," in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
  "User's Guide."

- A NetWare file server does not include the directory entries dot
  (.) and double dot (..) as MS-DOS does. However, the NetWare shell
  (version 3.01 or later) can emulate these entries when applications
  attempt to list the files in a directory. If you have problems
  listing files or deleting directories, turn on the Show Dots feature.
  To do this, add the following line to the beginning of your NET.CFG
  file:

     show dots=on

  Turning on Show Dots will cause problems with earlier versions of
  some 80286-based NetWare utilities, such as BINDFIX.EXE and
  MAKEUSER.EXE. Make sure you upgrade these utilities if you upgrade
  your NetWare shell. For more information, contact your Novell dealer.

- Redirected drives can look different in Windows for Workgroups than
  without Windows for Workgroups. For example, a device mapped as
  FileServerName/Volume:Directory will appear in Windows as
  FileServerName/Volume:\, showing the root of the file server's shared
  volume rather than the subdirectory. You can correct this with the
  MAP ROOT entry, as explained in the following information.

- In some cases, Windows-based applications may change the default
  directory on a drive. This might cause problems if, for example, your
  path includes the current directory on a network drive (that is, your
  path includes a drive letter without a specific directory, such as z:
  instead of z:\system).

  You can prevent this problem by using MAP.EXE and LOGIN.EXE versions
  3.0 and later to set up false roots, or by choosing the MAP ROOT
  function when you are mapping a connection in File Manager. This
  feature simulates the MS-DOS subst command, which sets the root of a
  given drive to a directory designated by the user instead of to the
  true root of the volume.

  For example, suppose you normally mapped drive F to the HOME\TERRI
  directory on the SERVER\SYS volume, and then included F: in your
  path. You would do this by including the following command in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by typing the command before you start Windows:

     map f:=server\sys:home\terri

  The default directory on drive F would then be HOME\TERRI. To prevent
  Windows from changing this, you would replace that command with the
  following:

     map root f:=server\sys:home\terri

  This command would make the directory HOME\TERRI appear to be the
  root of drive F.

- You can adjust the way Windows handles your network drive mappings
  by using the Network option in Control Panel.

  Usually, when you quit Windows for Workgroups, all of your drive
  mappings are restored to the way they were before you started Windows
  for Workgroups, and all changes you made while running Windows are
  lost. If you clear the Restore Drives option in the settings dialog
  box for NetWare, the mappings you made in Windows for Workgroups will
  remain when you quit.

  Typically, each instance of MS-DOS Prompt you start from Windows for
  Workgroups has its own set of drive mappings. Changes you make in one
  instance do not affect another. If you set the NWShareHandles option,
  drive mappings will instead be global, and changes to the mappings or
  the current drive made in one instance of MS-DOS Prompt will affect
  all other applications. If you are running a NetWare 286 server,
  setting NWShareHandles increases the number of workstations that can
  be connected to the server before the server runs out of available
  connections.

  See the Help available in the Network dialog box in Control Panel for
  more information on these options.

- If you have applications or files that use extended characters
  (ASCII characters above 128) and you have problems viewing or using
  them, try adding the following line to your NET.CFG file:

     special uppercase = on

- When you connect or disconnect network resources from File Manager,
  Print Manager, or Control Panel, pay attention to the state of the
  Permanent check box. If this option is selected when you make a
  connection, the connection is automatically made each time you
  restart Windows for Workgroups. To stop reconnecting, disconnect from
  the network resource with the Permanent check box selected. If the
  option is not selected when you disconnect, the connection is removed
  for the current Windows session but is reconnected when you restart
  Windows for Workgroups.

- If you were running Novell NetBIOS before you set up Windows for
  Workgroups, the Setup program attempts to remove it. We do not
  recommend using the Novell NetBIOS protocol. Instead, use the IPX/SPX
  protocol that is compatible with NetBIOS.

  To install the IPX/SPX protocol that is compatible with NetBIOS:

  1. In the Networks group, choose the Network Setup icon.

  2. In the Network Setup dialog box, choose the Drivers button. The
     Network Drivers dialog box appears.

  3. Choose the Add Protocol button. The Add Network Protocol dialog
     box appears.

  4. Choose "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS"  from the drop
     down list box. Then choose OK.

2.3 Changes to System Files

2.3.5 MSIPX support
Although we recommend that you upgrade from the MSIPX protocol to
either the IPXODI or IPX/SPX protocol, you can keep your MSIPX
support. This section describes the changes that are made to your
system files if you choose to keep MSIPX support when you upgrade
from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 to Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

The following lines are removed from CONFIG.SYS:

C:\WINDOWS\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\WINDOWS
C:\WINDOWS\WORKGRP.SYS
C:\WINDOWS\&lt;NDIS MAC driver&gt;.DOS
C:\WINDOWS\MSIPX.SYS

       The above lines are replaced by:

DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

The following is an example of a typical AUTOEXEC.BAT file once you
have upgraded to Windows for Workgroups 3.11

C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /X
C:\WINDOWS\net start
C:\WINDOWS\msipx
C:\WINDOWS\netx
PROMPT $p$g
PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS
SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP

The following lines in SYSTEM.INI affect running Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 with MSIPX:

[386Enh]

network=*vnetbios,*vwc,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386
transport=netbeui.386,nwlink.386,nwnblink.386

NOTE: Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup will detect MSIPX when
upgrading from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and install support for it.
If you change your network configuration after upgrading to Windows
for Workgroups 3.11, however, Setup may remove MSIPX support, and you
will not be able to reinstall support for it. If this is the case,
you will have to upgrade to either IPX.COM, or IPXODI.COM and
LSL.COM.
