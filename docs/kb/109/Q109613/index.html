SUMMARY
=======

Although the RUN command can be used to launch other programs from FoxPro on the
MS-DOS and Windows platforms, in FoxPro for Macintosh, the "Feature Not
Available" error message is generated when the RUN command is used.

To launch another application from FoxPro for Macintosh, use the RUNSCRIPT
command to execute an AppleScript that contains a scripting command to launch
the desired application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AppleScript is an extension available for Macintosh system software release 7.0x
that adds functionality to the Macintosh operating system by providing a
standard protocol for communication between applications. It is part of Apple's
Open Scripting Architecture.

Because FoxPro for Macintosh is AppleScript aware, it can run prewritten scripts
using the RUNSCRIPT command. The syntax of the RUNSCRIPT command can be found in
the FoxPro for Macintosh "Language Reference" and in the online help file.

To launch an application using AppleScript, the application must be Apple-
event-aware and support the open application ("oapp") Apple Event. An Apple
event is a high-level message that is passed from one application to another,
including the operating system. Most applications, especially those written or
updated since System 7 was released, support the basic high-level events; the
open application event is one of these.

The sample scripts below show two methods, one interactive and one
noninteractive, that can be used to launch another Macintosh application. To use
these scripts, type them into the AppleScript Editor, save them, and then run
them from Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh using the RUNSCRIPT command.

NOTE: Double hyphens represent comments to the AppleScript interpreter. Due to
the limitations of the character set used to print this article, the
command-continuation character produced by pressing OPTION+RETURN on the Apple
keyboard has been replaced by a semicolon (;). Scripting commands are broken
into multiple lines for readability only.

Interactive Sample Script
-------------------------

The following script is interactive, allowing the user to choose the application
to run from a standard Macintosh Open dialog box. Only "APPL" (application) type
files are displayed. The chosen application is stored to the variable
"appToRun." An error handler surrounds the code. If the user clicks Cancel in
the "choose file" Open dialog box, the error number -128 is returned. Otherwise,
the null string is returned. The FoxPro program that invokes the script should
handle the return value appropriately.

NOTE: This script sample uses "choose file", a scripting addition provided with
the AppleScript extension and stored in the Scripting Additions folder in the
System Folder:Extensions folder. If "choose file" is not available, this script
will produce an error.

    -- script to run another Macintosh application
    try
       set appToRun to ;
          ((choose file of type {"APPL"}) as string)
       tell application appToRun to run
       return ""
    on error errText number errNum
       return errNum
    end try

Save the script with the name RunApp. To run the script, issue the following
command in the FoxPro Command window or from within a FoxPro program:

    RUNSCRIPT "Macintosh HD:Scripts:RunApp" TO retVal

"retVal" contains the value returned from the script--either the null string or
an error number.

Noninteractive Script Sample
----------------------------

If you don't need an interactive script, you can use the following script to
launch an application by hard-coding its name into the script; in the following
sample, the application is Microsoft Excel:

    tell application "Macintosh HD:Apps:Excel 4.0:Microsoft Excel" to run

NOTE: Remember to replace the pathname to the application as necessary.
