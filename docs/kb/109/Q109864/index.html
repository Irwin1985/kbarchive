The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may find that the text in Creative Writer looks jumbled or garbled, or as if
letters and/or words are overlapping each other. In some cases, the text you
type may not appear on the screen. This problem occurs if a fax driver, such as
WinFax, has been set as the default printer driver in Windows.

This problem has been resolved with Microsoft Creative Writer version 1.1 for
Windows, which is available on CD-ROM only. The CD-ROM version of Creative
Writer is not an upgrade to version 1.0; it is a separate product, and must be
purchased separately.


RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this problem, specify a non-fax printer driver as your default
printer driver in Windows. To do this, follow these steps:

Windows 95
----------

1. Exit Creative Writer.

2. Click Start, point at Settings, and then click Printers.

3. Click the right mouse button with the pointer over the appropriate printer.
  Make sure the Set As Default box is checked.

4. Close the Printers Window, and restart Creative Writer.

Windows 3.x
-----------

1. Exit from Creative Writer.

2. In the Windows Control Panel, choose Printers.

3. Select a printer driver other than your fax driver, and choose Set As Default
  Printer.

4. Close the Printers dialog box, and restart Creative Writer.

Your text should now display correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs with the WinFax driver because this driver does not provide
GetCharWidths(). Printer drivers, by definition, must supply this function. If
GetCharWidths() fails, Creative Writer defaults to 3/4 (three-fourths) of the
average character width for all characters. This causes the appearance of
letters overlapping each other.
