SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 NETWORKS.WRI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

7.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with Beame &amp; Whiteside BW-NFS

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 works with Beame &amp; Whiteside BW-NFS version
3.0c.

Set up BW-NFS on your computer according to the directions in your BW-NFS
documentation. Make sure you can connect to a BW-NFS server from MS-DOS
before you set up Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to work with BW-NFS. For more
information on installing BW-NFS support in Windows for Workgroups, see
Chapter 9, "Using Other Networks," in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On
"User's Guide."

7.1 Changes to System Files

When You Install Support for BW-NFS Setup makes the following changes to
your SYSTEM.INI file:

[boot]
secondnet.drv=bwnet.drv

[boot description]
secondnet.drv=BW-NFS Network File System (version 3.0c)

[386Enh]
secondnet=bwdosnet.386, bwredir.386
TimerCriticalSection=1000
UniqueDOSPSP=True
PSPIncrement=5

8.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with ArcNet

If you are setting up an ArcNet network for use with Windows for
Workgroups, follow the instructions in Appendix C, "Installing Network
Hardware," in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide" for setting up
a network using Thin Ethernet, but with these exceptions:

- Instead of RG-58 cable, use RG-62U thin coaxial cable.

- You do not need to use BNC T-Connectors. You can plug RG-62U cable
  directly into ArcNet cards.

9.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with TCP/IP

You can use the TCP/IP protocol with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11. We recommend that you use the Microsoft TCP/IP for
Windows for Workgroups protocol package.

Set up Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups according to the
Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups Installation and
Configuration Guide.

9.1 Changes to System Files When You Install TCP/IP

The TCP/IP installation process adds the following lines to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

    C:\WINDOWS\NET START
    C:\WINDOWS\UMB
    C:\WINDOWS\TCPTSR
    C:\WINDOWS\TINYRFC
    C:\WINDOWS\EMSBFR.EXE
    C:\WINDOWS\NMTSR.EXE

The following lines are added to the SYSTEM.INI file.

[386ENH]
device=vsockets.386
device=vbapi.386
TimerCriticalSection=5000
UniqueDosPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=2

[Network Drivers]
devdir=C:\WINDOWS
LoadRMDrivers=Yes
netcard=&lt;network adapter&gt;
transport=ndishlp.sys,*netbeui,tcpdrv.dos,nemm.dos

The TCP/IP installation process also creates a TCPUTILS.INI file.

[tcpglobal]
username=&lt;user name&gt;
NetFiles=C:\WINDOWS
hostname=&lt;host name&gt;
drivername=GLOBAL$

[sockets]
drivername=SOCKETS$
bindings=TCPIP
numsockets=4
numthreads=32
poolsize=3200
maxsendsize=1024

[telnet]
drivername=TELNET$
bindings=TCPIP
nsessions=0
max_out_sends=0

9.2 Sample PROTOCOL.INI file

The following is a sample PROTOCOL.INI file. It is taken from a computer
where Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 is set up to use the
Microsoft NetBEUI and Microsoft TCP/IP protocols with the same network
adapter.

[network.setup]
version=0x3110
netcard=ms$ewtrbtp,1,MS$EWTRBTP,3
transport=ms$ndishlp,MS$NDISHLP
transport=ms$netbeui,NETBEUI
transport=tcpip,TCPIP
lana0=ms$ewtrbtp,1,tcpip
lana1=ms$ewtrbtp,1,ms$ndishlp
lana2=ms$ewtrbtp,1,ms$netbeui

[protman]
DriverName=PROTMAN$
PRIORITY=MS$NDISHLP

[MS$EWTRBTP]
DriverName=DEPCA$
Interrupt=15
IOAddress=0x300
RamAddress=0xD000
MaxMulticast=8
MaxTransmits=16
AdapterName=DE200

[LANCE]
Adapters=MS$EWTRBTP

[MS$NDISHLP]
DriverName=ndishlp$
BINDINGS=MS$EWTRBTP

[NETBEUI]
DriverName=netbeui$
SESSIONS=10
NCBS=12
BINDINGS=MS$EWTRBTP
LANABASE=2

[TCPIP]
DefaultGateway0=130 25 0 1
SubNetMask0=255 255 0 0
IPAddress0=130 25 8 144
NBSessions=12
NetFiles=C:\WINDOWS
DriverName=TCPIP$
BINDINGS=MS$EWTRBTP
LANABASE=0

The following parameters are optional entries in the [tcpip] section
of the PROTOCOL.INI file.

____________________________________________________________
ForcePushBit=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:        0
Purpose:Determines how frequently the push bit is set. If this
setting is set to 1, the stack sets the push bit on every outgoing
packet. If this setting is set to 0, the stack sets the push bit
only on packets as needed.

       If you are having trouble connecting to an IBM mainframe, try
setting ForcePushBit=1..

____________________________________________________________

MaxLmHosts=&lt;number&gt;

Default:        120
Purpose:Specifies the number of entries from the LMHOSTS file that
should be loaded into the cache when the workstation is booted. The
value for this setting must be a number between 0 and 120.

____________________________________________________________
TcpRetries=&lt;number&gt;

Default:        10
Purpose:Specifies the length of time your workstation will continue
attempting to send a packet. The default, 10, corresponds to
approximately 50 seconds. Higher values allow more time for repeated
attempts to send the packet, up to a maximum of about six minutes.
The value for this setting must be a number between 1 and 17.
____________________________________________________________

9.3 More Information about using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with TCP/IP

- In order to run the ping utility, you must first run NMTSR.EXE.
  NMTSR.EXE is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that is
  loaded before the Windows operating system is started. It is started
  by a line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

  If you will not run the ping utility, you can remove NMTSR.EXE. To
  do this, remove or comment out (add REM to the beginning of the line)
  the line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file that loads NMTSR.EXE. Then reboot
  your computer.

- If you need to remove the Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for
  Workgroups protocol package for troubleshooting purposes:

  1. In the Network program group, select the Network Setup icon.
     The Network Setup dialog box appears.

  2. In the Network Setup dialog box, choose the Drivers button. The
     Network Drivers dialog box appears.

  3. Select on the protocol Microsoft TCP/IP. Then choose the Remove
     button.

  You should not need to edit any files. However, if you receive errors
  when you restart your computer is booting, use a text editor to view the
  system files and make sure that all of the entries have been
  successfully removed.

10.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with Data Link Control (DLC)
    Protocol

You can use the Data Link Control (DLC) protocol with Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. We recommend that you use the
Microsoft MS-DLC for Windows for Workgroups protocol package. You can
use the MS-DLC protocol along with other protocols. However, the
MS-DLC protocol must be set as the default protocol.

Use the Network Setup icon to set up Windows for Workgroups to work
with MS-DLC. See the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide" for more
information.

NOTE:
Do not use the Setup program included with MS-DLC. If you do, you
will be unable to run Windows Setup or Network Setup. Instead, use
the Network Setup icon to set up Windows for Workgroups to work with
MS-DLC as you would in adding an Unlisted or Updated Protocol. See
the Microsoft Workgroup Add-On User's Guide for more information.

If you run the Setup program included with MS-DLC, the Setup program
creates a file called WFWSETUP.CPL and copies a new WFWSETUP.DLL file
to your C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. This prevents Network  Setup
from working. To fix this, delete the WFWSETUP.CPL file. Then copy
and expand WFWSETUP.DLL from your Windows for Workgroups 3.11 disks.
For information on how to expand files, see your Windows
documentation.

10.1 Changes to System Files When You Install MS-DLC

The MS-DLC installation process adds the following lines to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

    C:\WINDOWS\NET INITIALIZE
    C:\WINDOWS\MSDLC.EXE
    C:\WINDOWS\NET START

The MS-DLC installation process adds the following lines to the
SYSTEM.INI file:

[Network Drivers]
LoadRMDrivers=Yes

10.2 Sample PROTOCOL.INI file

The following is a sample PROTOCOL.INI file. It is taken from a
computer where Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 is set
up to use the Microsoft NetBEUI and MS-DLC protocols with the same
network adapter.

11.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with MS-Net?Compatible Networks

You can use Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with any network that is
MS-Net (Microsoft Network) Compatible instead of the Microsoft
Windows Network. These networks include:

3Com 3+Share
TCS 10-Net
Ungermann-Bass Net/One

12.0 Using an Unlisted Network Adapter with No OEMSETUP.INF File

If you have a network adapter that is not included in the list of
available network adapters in Network Setup, and if you don't have an
OEMSETUP.INF file for it, you can still use it with Windows for
Workgroups. This section tells you how to modify your PROTOCOL.INI,
SYSTEM.INI, and CONFIG.SYS files to use your network adapter.

1. Open your PROTOCOL.INI with a text editor, such as the MS-DOS EDIT
  command. Find the section that configures your network adapter
  driver. Select that section, including the header, and cut it.

2. Find the section that begins with the [ms$genndis2] header. Select
  that section, including the header, and replace it with the section
  that configures your network adapter driver, that you cut in step 1.

3. Replace all the occurrences of "ms$genndis2" with the name of your
  network adapter driver section. Then save and close the file.

4. Open your SYSTEM.INI file with a text editor. In the [Network
  Drivers] section, add the name of your network adapter driver at the
  end of the netcard= line, and remove the "genndis2.dos" entry from
  that line. Then save and close the SYSTEM.INI file.

5. Open your CONFIG.SYS with a text editor, and remove the line that
  loads the network adapter driver.
