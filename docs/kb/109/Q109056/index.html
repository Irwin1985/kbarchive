SUMMARY
=======

This article contains commonly asked questions and answers for Microsoft At Work
PC Fax.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. Why does Mail constantly poll for new messages with At Work PC Fax
  installed?

  A. This behavior occurs only if you are attached to a shared fax modem.

  To correct this problem:

  1. Open Mail.

  2. From the Fax menu, choose Mode.

  3. Select the Work Off-Line check box. (When you are ready to send a fax,
     remove the check mark and choose View New Messages from the Fax menu.)

2. Q. Sometimes when I try to open a new fax message, Mail generates a general
  protection fault. This problem seems to occur randomly. How can I correct
  this problem?

  A. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

3. Q. When I start Mail and the fax tries to go online, I receive the following
  error. How can I avoid this error?

  Fax Transport cannot go on-line. Off-Line operation will continue.

  A. This error occurs under the following circumstances:

   - You have an external fax modem, and it is turned off or not correctly
     connected to the port.

   - You are attached to a shared network fax that is on a server not running
     Microsoft Mail, or the MAPI engine has not been started.

   - The shared fax user is connecting to the wrong share. Check the
     EFAXPUMP.INI file to ensure the path to the network fax is correct.

   - The network fax is working offline. (Go to Microsoft Mail on the network
     fax machine and choose Mode from the Fax menu to ensure the fax is working
     online.)

4. Q. What causes a fax to render correctly but then appear in my Inbox?

  A. If you send a fax to the same number that was entered during At Work PC Fax
  Setup in Control Panel, At Work PC Fax recognizes that it cannot call itself;
  therefore, it renders the fax and places it in your Inbox.

5. Q. Why does my Intel CAS modem fail to render the fax every time I try to
  send one?

  A. Changing the Image Quality setting from Best Available to Fine should
  correct this problem. To do this:

  1. Go to Microsoft Mail.

  2. From the Fax menu, choose Options.

  3. Change the Image Quality from Best Available to Fine.
