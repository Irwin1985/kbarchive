The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Because the Pict To Bmp application that comes with FoxPro for Macintosh is a
"scriptable" application, you can instruct it to programmatically convert a file
of type "PICT" to a file of type "BMP" using AppleScript.

See below for instructions and a sample script.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following script can be called from within FoxPro for Macintosh or any other
application that can communicate with the AppleScript extension. The script can
be keyed into the AppleScript Script Editor supplied with the AppleScript
extension.

This script requires that Scripting Additions be installed in the Extensions
subfolder of the System Folder. The "choose file" Scripting additions is
utilized. These additions are supplied with the AppleScript extension and placed
in the Extensions folder by the Installer program.

Please note that due to the limitations of the character set used to display and
print this Microsoft Knowledge Base article, the line- continuation character
created by pressing OPTION+RETURN on the Macintosh has been replaced by a
semicolon (the FoxPro line-continuation character). When you are typing the
script in the AppleScript Script Editor, replace any line that ends with a
semicolon with the appropriate line-continuation character.

To create the script:

1. Start the AppleScript Script Editor.

2. In the Script Editor edit region where the cursor is initially blinking, type
  the following code:

        -- Pict2Bmp, a routine for converting PICTs to BMPs

        -- Get a file of type "PICT" to convert
        set theFile to choose file of type {"PICT"} ;
           with prompt "Choose PICT to convert:"
        -- Call the conversion handler
        Convert(theFile)

        -- Conversion handler
        on Convert(fToConvert)
          -- Tell Pict To Bmp to convert the file
          -- and terminate.
          tell application "Pict To Bmp"
            open fToConvert
            quit
          end tell
        end Convert

3. Save the script. If the script will not save in its compiled format, make
  sure the script was typed exactly as it appears above, with the exception of
  the line-continuation characters. The Script Editor should help you focus in
  on the source of the error by highlighting the offending command.

4. To run the script from the FoxPro for Macintosh Command window, issue the
  following command

  RUNSCRIPT &lt;pict2bmp&gt;

  where &lt;pict2bmp&gt; is the name of the file to which the script was saved.

The first time the script is run, a dialog box may appear requesting the location
of the "Pict to Bmp" application. It is located in the FoxPro:Goodies:Misc
folder. In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, the application is located in the
VFP:Tools:Tools:PictToBmp folder. To avoid this message, specify the full path
to the application in the Convert handler of the script. For example, use the
following command:

  tell application "HD:FoxPro:Goodies:Misc"

If the user chooses to cancel the script at any time during the execution of the
script, the following FoxPro error message will be displayed:

  Script error: User canceled.

To avoid the display of this message in the context of a FoxPro program or
application, use an ON ERROR handling routine to trap for error number 1917.

For more information about creating scripts with AppleScript, see the
"AppleScript Language Guide" or contact the Apple Programmer's and Developer's
Association (APDA).
