The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, 1994 edition (see below) 
- Microsoft Complete NBA Basketball for Windows, 1994-1995, 1995-1996 editions 
- Microsoft Encarta 95 The Complete Interactive Multimedia Encyclopedia 
- Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia for Windows 
- Microsoft Works, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing one of the applications listed at the top of this article, you
may receive the following error message:

  While Registering OLE Servers, Setup had a Problem with REG.DAT, SHELL.DLL or
  Disk Space

After you choose OK, the following message may also appear:

  &lt;Program Name&gt; setup was not completed successfully.

CAUSE
=====

The following conditions can cause this error:

- An invalid Path command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or an invalid windir setting
  (that is, the Path setting is \WINDOWS instead of C:\WINDOWS, or your windir
  setting is windir=\windows instead of windir=c:\windows)

  NOTE: To quickly check your Path and windir settings, type "set" (without the
  quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt.

  -or-

- A corrupt REG.DAT file


RESOLUTION
==========

1. Correct the invalid Path setting in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

2. Rename REG.DAT and re-register MSWORKS3.REG (if you are using Works 3.0 for
  Windows) and OLE2.REG.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change your Path setting in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
----------------------------------------------------

1. From the File menu in Windows Program Manager, choose Run.

2. In the Command Line box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks) and
  choose OK.

3. In the AUTOEXEC.BAT window, locate the Path command.

4. Change the Path setting so that a full reference is made to your Windows
  directory. For example, if Windows is installed in the default directory of
  C:\WINDOWS, the line should read C:\WINDOWS. For example, the following is a
  sample Path statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT:

  PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\;C:\DOS;C:\WINWORD;C:\MOUSE;C:\MSPUB

  NOTE: You may want to double-check the entire Path command. Make sure that
  every directory specified has the appropriate syntax. For more information
  about your Path command, see your MS-DOS user's guide.

5. From the File menu, choose Exit. Choose Yes to save changes.

6. Exit Windows and restart your computer.

7. Reinstall Works, Complete Baseball, Complete NBA Basketball, or Encarta.
  Because Setup was not complete the first time, you do not need to uninstall
  these applications before you reinstall.

To correct a corrupt REG.DAT file
---------------------------------

1. Check to see if there are two REG.DAT files on your hard drive. (If there are
  two files, one file is probably in the Windows directory, while the other is
  likely in the SYSTEM subdirectory of the Windows directory). Your REG.DAT
  file should only be in the Windows directory.

2. If there is only one copy of the file on your hard drive, change the filename
  to REG.OLD to create a backup.

3. Restart Windows. When Windows restarts, it will not find a REG.DAT file so it
  will re-create one with default settings.

4. Next, re-register the *.REG files on the system, as follows:

  a. Run File Manager.

  b. From the File menu, choose Search.

  c. In the Search For box, type:

  *.REG

     In the Start From box, type:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of your hard disk drive. For example, C:\
     for drive C. This will allow you to search your entire hard drive for all
     *.REG files.

  d. Choose the first found *.REG file. From the File menu, choose Associate.
     Make sure that the extension *.REG is associated with REGEDIT.EXE.

  e. After associating the *.REG files, double-click the first *.REG file the
     search results found. Windows will prompt you with a message informing you
     that the file was registered successfully in REG.DAT.

  f. Repeat step e until all *.REG files have been re-registered.

  The REG.DAT file is now re-built.

5. Reinstall the program that was giving you the error message above.

  NOTE: If you do not install Works for Window in the default directory of
  C:\MSWORKS, complete the following steps:

  a. Open the MSWORKS3.REG file in Windows Write (usually found in the
     Accessories group of the Windows Program Manager).

  b. From the Find menu, choose Replace.

  c. Replace all instances of C:\MSWORKS\MSWORKS.EXE with
     &lt;path&gt;\MSWORKS.EXE, where &lt;path&gt; represents the drive letter
     and directory where Works was installed.

  d. Save the file, making sure to specify TEXT as the format.

  e. Re-register the *.REG files on the system by following step 4 above.

This will register the necessary information for Works for Windows, Complete
Baseball, Complete NBA Basketball, and Encarta.
