The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to upgrade to MS-DOS while running AddStor's SuperStor, you may
receive the following error message:

  Error: Setup cannot install MS-DOS on you computer. The copy of the
  CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file on your compressed drive does not match the
  corresponding file on your uncompressed drive.


CAUSE
=====

SuperStor maintains two copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files: one on
the compressed drive and the other on the uncompressed drive. If the copies of
these files on both drives are not identical, you receive the above message.

RESOLUTION
==========

In most cases, the copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on the
compressed drive are more current than the ones on the uncompressed drive. To
verify this, do the following:

1. Change to the MS-DOS command prompt on the uncompressed drive (usually this
  is the drive D). For example, type "d:" (without the quotation marks) at the
  MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

2. Change to the root directory of the uncompressed drive. For example, type
  "cd\" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
  press ENTER.

3. Check the file dates of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To do this,
  type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER after each
  line:

  " dir config.sys
  dir autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

  Write down the date and time for both files.

4. Change to the MS-DOS command prompt on the compressed drive (typically drive
  C). For example, type "c:" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
  command prompt and then press ENTER.

5. Check the file dates of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To do this,
  type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER after each
  line:

  " dir config.sys
  dir autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

  Write down the date and time for both files, then follow the appropriate
  procedure below.

If the compressed drive (C) has more current versions of the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files:

1. Delete the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the uncompressed drive (D)
  by typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER after
  each line:

  " del d:\config.sys
  del d:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the compressed drive (C) to
  the uncompressed drive (D) by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
  prompt and pressing ENTER after each line:

  " copy c:\config.sys d:\config.sys
  copy c:\autoexec.bat d:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

3. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup again.

If the uncompressed drive (D) has more current versions of the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files:

1. Delete the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the compressed drive (C) by
  typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER after
  each line:

  " del c:\config.sys
  del c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the uncompressed drive (D) to
  the compressed drive (C) by typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt
  and pressing ENTER after each line:

  " copy d:\config.sys c:\config.sys
  copy d:\autoexec.bat c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

3. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup again.
