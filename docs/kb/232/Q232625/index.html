SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to use Visual Basic to create a dynamic-link
library (DLL) with an embedded localized string table in the resource file. It
also demonstrates how to call a string resource in a DLL with a specific locale
ID from a Visual Basic application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Occasionally, problems occur using a multi-language resource file. To work
around these problems, a localized string table can be created and attached to a
DLL as a resource. This DLL can be loaded and strings displayed based on the
current locale set in the Regional Settings. This technique requires that a
separate resource DLL be created for each locale where the application is
distributed.

To build the following sample, you must create two DLLs with embedded resource
files. You also need to create a Standard EXE project that displays the strings
stored as resources in the DLLs. The DLL file names contain the locale
identifier associated with the regional setting selected by the user.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

- To create the DLLs with an embedded resource string table, follow the steps
  below. The first time through the steps, a DLL containing a Canadian English
  string table is created. The second time through, a US English string table
  is created and embedded in a second DLL:

  1. Start a new Visual Basic ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is created by
     default.

  2. On the Add_Ins menu, select Add-In Manager. In the Add-In Manager dialog
     box, double-click the Visual Basic 6.0 Resource Editor. Confirm that the
     LoadBehavior column on the right-hand side of the window specifies Loaded,
     and then click OK.

  3. On the Tools menu, click the Resource Editor menu item.

  4. In the Visual Basic Resource Editor, click on the 'abc' icon to bring up
     the Edit String Tables dialog box.

  5. Double-click the language that is displayed, click the drop-down arrow,
     and then select English (Canadian) from the combobox.

  6. Double-click the text field below the language, and type in: "Canadian
     English" (without the quotation marks).

  7. Make certain that the id number associated with this string is 101.

  8. Dismiss the Edit String Table dialog box by clicking on the X in the
     upper-right-hand corner.

  9. Click on the Save icon in the Visual Basic Resource Editor dialog box, and
     then save the file as res1009 in a folder named resourcedll. This
     automatically adds the RES file to the DLL project that you have created.

  10. On the Project menu, select Project1 Properties. Change the Project Name
     field from Project1 to resdll1009. Save the resdll1009 project in the
     resourcedll folder.

  11. Compile the resdll1009 project, saving the DLL to the resourcedll folder,
     and making certain that the Filename is resdll1009. The name of the DLL
     is important because it is loaded in the code using this file name.

- Create a second DLL by repeating steps 1 - 12 with the following
  modifications:

   - In step 5, set the language to English (US).
   - In step 6, type in the text: "US English" (without the quotation marks).
   - In step 9, save the RES file in the same folder but use the name res409.
   - In step 10, name the project resdll409 instead of resdll1009.
   - In step 11, save the resdll409 project to the resourcedll folder.
   - In step 12, compile the resdll409 project, saving the DLL to the
     resourcedll folder, and making certain the file name is resdll409.

- Perform the following steps to create the Standard EXE project:

  1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
     default.

  2. Add a label (Label1) to Form1.

  3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private Declare Function GetThreadLocale Lib "kernel32" () As Long
  Private Declare Function LoadLibrary Lib "kernel32" Alias "LoadLibraryA" _
     (ByVal lpLibFileName As String) As Long
  Private Declare Function LoadString Lib "user32" Alias "LoadStringA" _
     (ByVal hInstance As Long, ByVal wID As Long, ByVal lpBuffer As String, _
      ByVal nBufferMax As Long) As Long
  Private Declare Function GetLocaleInfo Lib "kernel32" Alias "GetLocaleInfoA" _
     (ByVal Locale As Long, ByVal LCType As Long, ByVal lpLCData As String, _
      ByVal cchData As Long) As Long

  Private Const LOCALE_IDEFAULTANSICODEPAGE = &amp;H1004&amp;
  Private Const LOCALE_SENGCOUNTRY = &amp;H1002
  Private Const LOCALE_SNATIVECTRYNAME = &amp;H8
  Private Const LOCALE_SCOUNTRY = &amp;H6

  Function GetCharSet(sCdpg As String) As Integer
     Select Case sCdpg
        Case "932" ' Japanese
           GetCharSet = 128
        Case "936" ' Simplified Chinese
           GetCharSet = 134
        Case "949" ' Korean
           GetCharSet = 129
        Case "950" ' Traditional Chinese
           GetCharSet = 136
        Case "1250" ' Eastern Europe
           GetCharSet = 238
        Case "1251" ' Russian
           GetCharSet = 204
        Case "1252" ' Western European Languages
           GetCharSet = 0
        Case "1253" ' Greek
           GetCharSet = 161
        Case "1254" ' Turkish
           GetCharSet = 162
        Case "1255" ' Hebrew
           GetCharSet = 177
        Case "1256" ' Arabic
           GetCharSet = 178
        Case "1257" ' Baltic
           GetCharSet = 186
        Case Else
           GetCharSet = 0
     End Select
  End Function
  Function StripNullTerminator(sCP As String)
     Dim posNull As Long
     posNull = InStr(sCP, Chr$(0))
     StripNullTerminator = Left$(sCP, posNull - 1)
  End Function
  Private Sub Form_Load()
     Dim hInst As Long, lResult As Long, x As Long
     Dim LCID As Long, sLcid As String
     Dim resString As String * 255
     Dim sCodePage As String

     sCodePage = String$(16, " ")
     Label1.AutoSize = True
     Label1.Caption = ""

     LCID = GetThreadLocale() 'Get Current locale
     sLcid = Hex$(Trim$(CStr(LCID))) 'Convert to Hex
     ' Display decimal value of the LCID (Hex in Parentheses)
     Form1.Caption = "LCID " &amp; LCID &amp; " (" &amp; sLcid &amp; ")"
     x = GetLocaleInfo(LCID, LOCALE_IDEFAULTANSICODEPAGE, _
         sCodePage, Len(sCodePage))  'Get code page
     sCodePage = StripNullTerminator(sCodePage)
     ' Load dll with string table resource.
     ' Might need to change path for the resdll.
     hInst = LoadLibrary("resdll" &amp; sLcid &amp; ".dll")

     ' Get string with ID 101.
     lResult = LoadString(hInst, 101, resString, 255)
     With Label1.Font
        .Name = "Lucida Sans Unicode"
        .Size = 14
        .Charset = GetCharSet(sCodePage)  'Convert code page to charset
     End With
     ' Display the localized string.
     Label1.Caption = resString
  End Sub

  4. You might need to modify the path to the Resource DLL in the preceding
     code. Run the application and the localized string should appear.

  5. Compile this Standard EXE project.

- Set the Regional Settings to English (Canada), which requires a reboot on
  some operating systems. Run the compiled application. This should display the
  Canadian English string in the label.

- Close down the application and change the regional settings to English (US).
  Run the program again and the US English string should be displayed.

This sample works as a compiled EXE. It does not detect a change to the Locale ID
if it is modified while the application is running or if run in the IDE. To
update to the current Locale ID, create an ActiveX EXE that can be created in a
new, separate thread, and retrieve the Locale ID (LCID).

Make certain that your system has the appropriate code page and fonts. If you are
going between code pages, you need to use the Resource Editor Add-In that comes
with Visual Basic 6.0 on the localized platform or you need to create the RC
file from scratch by using appropriate language settings and compile with the
RC.exe resource compiler.
