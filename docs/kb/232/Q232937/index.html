IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user attempts to connect to a share that is located on another computer
by double-clicking an icon that points to that share (a shortcut), if that icon
contains a universal naming convention (UNC) path to a share on a remote
computer, and your computer gains access to that computer by using a Remote
Access Service (RAS) connection, the connection may be unsuccessful and the icon
may change to a Microsoft default icon.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the WNetGetResourceInformation() function on the
client retrieves all share names from the remote computer when the function
accesses one of the remote shares by means of the shortcut on the client. The
WNetGetResourceInformation() function has a built-in timer (NetLinkTimeout) with
a default time-out value of 7.5 seconds. To retrieve a relatively large number
of shares over a slow RAS link takes longer than 7.5 seconds, in most
situations.

A "relatively large number of shares" has been empirically determined to be about
700 shares, but this number may be larger or smaller depending upon the data
rate that is achieved over the RAS connection between the client and the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, add the following registry key:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: NetLinkTimeout
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Unit: milliseconds
  Default: N/A (hard coded to 7500)

4. Quit Registry Editor.

You need to create this value because it does not exist by default. Initially,
set the value to 9000 (9 seconds). If time-out behaviors persist, increase this
value in 500 millisecond increments until the time-out behavior stops.

The time-out value in the preceding registry key must only be modified on the
computer that connects to the shares.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
