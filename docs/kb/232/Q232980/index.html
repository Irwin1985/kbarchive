"http://mspress.microsoft.com/mspress/products/1426/"

To:
"http://mspress.microsoft.com/mspress/products/2317/"


Page xxiii: System Requirements Incorrect
-----------------------------------------

Change:
Microsoft NT version 4.0 or later.

To:
Microsoft NT 4.0 (with Service Pack 3) or later.


Page 7: Missing Two Actions In Table
------------------------------------

The table on page 7 is missing two items. The following lines should be added to
the table:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| To take this action...                  | Do this...                                                                                  | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Show the Measurements toolbar.          | Choose Toolbars on the View menu. Select the Measurements command on the sub menu.          | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Show the Text Frame Connecting toolbar. | Choose Toolbars on the View menu. Select the Text Frame Connecting command on the sub menu. | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Page 42: Tip Contains Incorrect Mouse Instructions
--------------------------------------------------

On page 42, in the tip titled "Reposition the rulers and zero points
simultaneously," there is an error in the instructions.

Change:
"...press and hold the Ctrl key and using the right mouse button, drag the
ruler..."

To:
"...press and hold the Ctrl key and using the left mouse button, drag the
ruler..."


Page 46: Incorrect Tip
----------------------

Delete the tip titled "Colors Indicate Guide Status." It is incorrect.


Page 51: First Procedure Has Several Errors
-------------------------------------------

On page 51, change the title of the first procedure to read:
"Move an Object or Group Using the Measurements Toolbar"

Insert a new step 2 (over the existing step 2). It should read:
"On the View menu, select Toolbars. On the submenu, select Measurements. The
Measurements toolbar appears."

Delete the old step 3.

Renumber existing step 4 to 3, and existing step 5 to 4.


Page 54: Several Mistakes In Margin Elements And Procedure
----------------------------------------------------------

Corrections for the Toolbar shortcut in the center of the page.

Change:
"If the floating toolbar is displayed"

To:
"If the Measurements toolbar is displayed"

In the cross reference at the bottom of the page, change all instances of "the
floating toolbar" to "the Measurements toolbar".

Corrections in the procedure titled "Resize an Object or Group Numerically" in
the callout at the bottom of the box.

Change:
"to open a floating toolbar"

To:
"to open the Measurements Toolbar".


Page 58: First Procedure Is Incorrect
-------------------------------------

The procedure title should read, "Rotate an Object Using the Measurements
Toolbar"

Change step 2 to read, "If the Measurements palette isn't open, on the View menu,
select Toolbars. On the submenu select Measurements."

Delete step 3.

Renumber step 4 to step 3.


Page 91: New Tip Needed To Address Bug In The Program
-----------------------------------------------------

This tip should be added at the bottom of the page.

[Troubleshooting Tip]
Why can't I change the hyphenation options for text in a table? In all
likelihood, you have selected the entire table or an entire column in the table.
Publisher only allows you to change the hyphenation options when you have
selected an individual cell, a range of cells, or a row of cells.


Page 100: Change All References To Formatting Toolbar
-----------------------------------------------------

At the top of the page the procedure should be titled "Change Character Spacing
Using the Measurements Toolbar".

Change step 2 to read, "On the View menu, select Toolbars. On the submenu, select
Measurements. The Measurements toolbar appears."

Delete step 3.

Renumber step 4 as step 3.


Page 103: The Third Callout Is Incorrect.
-----------------------------------------

In the third callout, beneath the numbered list, insert a period after the
phrase, "new paragraph."

Delete the rest of the sentence that reads, "because each is followed by a
carriage return." The second sentence is fine as is.


Page 124: Need Tip To Work Around Bug In The Program
----------------------------------------------------

Add this tip to the top of the page.

[Troubleshooting Tip]
Why doesn't the Ctrl-Tab key combination work?
When you have the Measurements toolbar open, pressing Ctrl-Tab toggles the
selection from the current object to the toolbar. Close the Measurements
toolbar, and the Ctrl-Tab key combination should work normally within the
table.


Page 169: Step 4 In Procedure Is Incorrect
------------------------------------------

The interface for Design Gallery Live has changed slightly.

Change step 4 from:
"Click one of the four tabs representing the clip types: Clip Art, Pictures,
Sounds, or Motion."

To:
"Click one of the three tabs representing the clip types: Pictures, Sounds, or
Motion."


Page 195: Step 6 In Procedure Is Incorrect
------------------------------------------

The Language drop-down menu has been updated:

Change:
"Choose Universal Alphabet (UTF-8)..."

To:
"Choose Unicode (UTF-8)..."


Page 203: Leaders For Graphic Are Pointing To Wrong Things
----------------------------------------------------------

The first leader (for the callout beginning "If you overlap frames...) should
point to the red boundary surrounding all of the objects.

The second leader (for the callout beginning "Any objects that fall...) should
point to the two stars at the top of the box.


Page 257: Additional Step Needed
--------------------------------

In the procedure titled "Import Design Gallery Objects From Other Publications"
insert the following step between steps eight and nine:

"In the Design Gallery dialog box, click either Insert Object or Close to return
to your document."


Page 296: Product Name Incorrect
--------------------------------

Page 296, second paragraph in the tip:

Change:
"Microsoft Draw 2000"

To:
"Microsoft Draw 98"


Page 390: Step 7 In Procedure Is Incorrect
------------------------------------------

Change:
"...the Western Alphabet."

To:
"...the Western European character set."


Page 510: Callout Line Incorrect
--------------------------------

Page 510, step 6:

The callout is pointing to a selection handle. This is incorrect. Instead, it
should point to the one of the vertices along the curve of the white arrow.


Page 513: Incorrect URL
-----------------------

Change:
"http://mspress.microsoft.com/mspress/products/1426/"

To:
"http://mspress.microsoft.com/mspress/products/2317/"
