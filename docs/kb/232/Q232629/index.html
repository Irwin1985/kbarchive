SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open an ASP application in the Web browser, the following
error message occurs:

  Server Application Error An error occurred reading or setting a configuration
  parameter. (0x80080005)

After you receive this error message, the Event Viewer will contain the following
system event:

  DCOM got error "Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password. " and was
  unable to logon DOMAINX\Administrator in order to run the server:
  {182C40F0-32E4-11D0-818B-00A0C9231C29}

If you start the Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) Explorer, which loads the MTS
snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), and attempt to open a System
package, the following error message occurs:

  An error occurred accessing components in the system package on this
  computer. Error code was 8080005. Make sure that:

  Microsoft Transaction server is installed correctly.
  If you have set a specific identity for the system package, check that the
  user account and password are correct and user is a member of the local
  Windows NT Administrators group.

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur because the MTS identity is not set to the default user.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the identity back to the default user. To do this,
perform the following steps:

1. Open the MMC, and open the system package that causes the error described in
  the "Symptoms" section.

2. Clear the error message.

3. Click Yes when prompted by the following message:

  The previous error could have been caused because the system package identity
  is configured with an invalid user account or password. Do you want to try
  resetting this identity to the default.

4. After you click Yes, you may receive the following error message:

  Error occurred accessing components in the system package on this computer.
  Make sure that Microsoft Transaction Server is installed correctly. If you
  have set a specific identity for the system package, check that the user
  account and password are correct, and user is a member of the local NT
  administrators group.

  If you receive this error message, unregister and then reregister the
  following dynamic-link library (DLL) files (located in the Winnt\System32\MTS
  folder). To do this, click Start, click Run, and then enter the following
  commands:

  " regsvr32 /u mtxclex.dll
  regsvr32 /u mtxcatex.dll
  regsvr32 /u mtxextrk.dll
  regsvr32 mtxclex.dll
  regsvr32 mtxcatex.dll
  regsvr32 mtxextrk.dll " (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about the MTS identity, see the "Identity Tab (Package)"
topic in the MTS Help.
