SYMPTOMS
========

Audit16 stops responding when attempting to audit an Iomega Corp. Zip or Jaz
drive when no media is in the drive. The following message is displayed

  Unable to read drive x: Abort, Retry, Ignore

where x is the drive letter for the removable media drive. If you insert a disk
and press the R key to retry, Audit will continue.
