SYMPTOMS
========

When a server certificate for Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0
is issued using Microsoft Certificate Services version 2.0, the CRL (Certificate
Revocation List) may be incorrect. For example, the CRL location may point to an
internal URL (such as the NetBIOS name of the Web server, not the DNS name).
Although the NetBIOS name will be acceptable for local (intranet) users,
Internet users will not be able to check for certificate revocation. This may
cause the applications that check for certificate revocation (for example
Internet Explorer 5.0 can enable this) to fail when trying to negotiate a secure
connection (https://) to your Web site.

WORKAROUND
==========

To check to see where the CRL is pointing to on your server certificate(s),
start the MMC containing the Certificates snap-in that points to Computer
certificates. If you do not already have one installed for viewing the
computer's certificates store, perform the following steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "MMC.EXE" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

3. Click Console in the new MMC you created, and then click Add/Remove Snap-in.

4. In the new window, click Add.

5. Highlight the Certificates snap-in, and then click Add.

6. Choose the Computer option and click Next.

7. Select Local Computer, and then click OK.

8. Click Close, and then click OK.

9. You have now added the Certificates snap-in, which will allow you to work
  with any certificates in your computer's certificate store. You may want to
  save this MMC for later use.

Now that you have access to the Certificates snap-in, open Personal and then
Certificates. You should see the name of your server certificate (denoted by the
common name). Double-click the certificate to bring up the properties. Click the
Details tab and then look under CRL Distribution Point. Be sure that the URL is
correct for the users you are targeting on this Web site. If it is not, it can
only be changed by requesting a new certificate that contains the correct CRL
information. Please notify the Certificate Services administrator that this
information may need to be changed.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Additional information on changing your Certificate Services CRL location can be
found in the Certificate Services documentation.
