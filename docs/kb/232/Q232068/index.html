SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article explains how to download, install, and remove MetaEdit
2.2. The MtaEdt22.exe file is a downloadable, self-extracting file that contains
the IIS MetaEdit 2.2 utility. The MetaEdit 2.2 utility is used to help to
troubleshoot issues and to modify IIS metabase values.

Warnings
--------

- Microsoft provides this utility "as-is," without the warranty either
  expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties
  of merchantability and or fitness for a particular purpose. This article
  assumes that you are familiar with the IIS metabase and the tools that are
  used to back up and to restore the metabase. Microsoft support professionals
  can only help explain the functionality of the IIS snap-in for the Microsoft
  Management Console (MMC).

- Using the MetaEdit utility incorrectly causes serious problems that require
  you to re-install IIS or your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee
  that problems that result from the incorrect use of the MetaEdit utility can
  be solved. Use MetaEdit at your own risk.

- For information about how to edit the IIS metabase, view the Help topics in
  MetaEdit.

  NOTE: Always back up the metabase by using the IIS snap-in for the MMC before
  you edit the metabase. Verify that the backup copy can be restored if a
  problem occurs. For more information, view the "Configuration Backup/Restore"
  Help topic in the MMC.

MtaEdt22.exe utility to a folder of your choice on drive C.

Install the Utility
-------------------

NOTE: Microsoft Product Support Services does not support the installation or use

  or select another directory, and then click the large setup button to
  continue.

5. Select the program group where you want to add the MetaEdit 2.2 icon or
  accept the default, and then click OK.
