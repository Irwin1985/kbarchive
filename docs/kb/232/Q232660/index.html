-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are printing a report that contains a bitmap or bitmaps using the REPORT
FORM command under Windows 95 or Windows 98. If the bitmap resolution is
256-colors or greater and the SET PALETTE setting is OFF, repeated printing of
the report results in a leak in GDI resources. If the printing continues for
enough iterations (500 to 1000), you might see one or both of the following
error messages:

  Low Resources

  Ninety percent or more of your system resources are in use. To free up system
  resources, quit any programs that you are not using. If you do not, your
  computer may stop responding.

  [OK]

- or -

  Program Error

  Printer is not ready.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, you can try the following:

- Use the SET PALETTE ON setting within your program. This is the default
  setting.

- Perform the printing on Windows NT rather than Windows 95 or Windows 98
  computers.

- Use a bitmap with a resolution of 16-color or monochrome rather than
  256-color or 24-bit.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Execute the following commands in the Command window to create a 256-color
  bitmap. The path to MSPaint is only valid for Windows 95 and Windows 98
  installations. If your install drive is something other than C:, you must
  change the drive letter in the RUN command from C: to your actual drive
  letter:

  cBmpName = '"'+HOME()+'FOX.BMP'+'"'
  RUN /n C:\PROGRA~1\ACCESS~1\MSPaint &amp;cBmpName

2. Paint opens with FOX.BMP being edited. Select File, then Save As from the
  Paint menu. Enter "Fox256.bmp" (without the quotation marks) as the file
  name.

3. Select 256-color bitmap from the Save as type drop-down box.

4. Click the Save button and then close Paint.

5. From the Start menu, start the Resource Meter by selecting the Start button,
  and then selecting Programs/Accessories/System Tools/Resource Meter. If
  Resource Meter does not appear in the System Tools menu, you can add it
  through the Control Panel item Add/Remove Programs. Click on the Windows
  Setup tab in the Add/Remove Programs dialog box, highlight Accessories in the
  Components list, and click the Details button. In the Accessories dialog box,
  scroll down in the Components list, and check the check box next to the
  System Resource Meter. Click OK to close the Accessories dialog, then click
  OK in the Add/Remove Programs dialog box. The Resource Meter is installed.
  You might be prompted for your Windows CD ROM.

6. Size and arrange the Visual FoxPro window and the Resource Meter window so
  you can see both of them at the same time.

7. Return to FoxPro and run the following code from the Command window:

  CREATE CURSOR ctemp (f1 c(5))
  INSERT INTO ctemp (f1) VALUES ('xxyy')
  CREATE REPORT testrep FROM ctemp
  MODIFY REPORT testrep

8. When the Report Designer appears, add a Picture/ActiveX Bound Control to the
  report Page Header. In the Report Picture dialog box, select the Picture from
  File option, type the value "(home()+'fox256.bmp')" (without the quotation
  marks) in the File textbox, and then click OK. Close the Report Designer, and
  select Yes to save the report.

9. Run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

  #DEFINE NUMITERATIONS 600
  SET PALETTE OFF
  SET MESSAGE TO
  IF MESSAGEBOX('Have you paused your printer yet?',4,"Tree Saver Alert") = 7
     RETURN
  ENDIF
  FOR lni  = 1 to NUMITERATIONS
     REPORT FORM testrep TO PRINTER NOCONSOLE
     IF MOD(lni,10) = 0
        SET MESSAGE TO ALLTRIM(STR(lni)) + ' Iterations'
     ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  SET MESSAGE TO

10. When the Tree Saver Alert message box appears, pause your printer to prevent
  the reports from actually printing. Do this by going to the Start menu,
  selecting Settings and then selecting Printers. Right-click on your default
  printer, and select Pause Printing. Once you have paused your printer, click
  Yes in the Tree Saver message box.

11. Monitor the GDI in Resource Meter as the program executes.

In Resource Meter, GDI resources: % free decreases in increments of one or two
percent until completely depleted. The number of iterations is displayed in the
Visual FoxPro status bar. The decrease occurs at about one or two percent per 10
iterations of the loop.

If either of the errors displayed in the SYMPTOMS section of this article occurs,
set focus to the main Visual FoxPro window and press the ESCAPE key a few times
to exit the program.

Once the test has completed, delete the print jobs. Do this by going to the Start
menu, selecting Settings and then selecting Printers. Right-click on your
default printer, and select Purge Print Documents.

Exiting Visual FoxPro results in some of the GDI resources being made available,
but the only way to restore all the resources is to restart Windows 95 or
Windows 98.
