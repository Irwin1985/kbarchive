SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the relevance and some possible uses for the information
in the Stats frame of a Network Monitor capture.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you view a capture using Network Monitor, it is helpful to have additional
statistics concerning the data that is captured. In Network Monitor, a Stats
frame is added at the end of each capture. This frame contains relevant
information concerning the capture. Although the overall contents can change
depending on topology, one section that is consistently included is the Stats
section.

The following example shows a Stats section of a Network Monitor capture:

  STATS: Number of Frames Captured = 917
  STATS: Bytes Left = 80 (0x50)
  STATS: Version = 0 (0x0)
  STATS: Elapsed Time = 4 Seconds  316 Milliseconds
  STATS: Total Frames Captured = 917 (0x395)
  STATS: Total Bytes Captured = 186342 (0x2D7E6)
  STATS: Total Frames Filtered While Capturing = 917 (0x395)
  STATS: Total Bytes Filtered While Capturing = 179006 (0x2BB3E)
  STATS: Total Frames Seen During Capture = 917 (0x395)
  STATS: Total Bytes Seen During Capture = 179006 (0x2BB3E)
  STATS: Total MultiCasts Received = 49 (0x31)
  STATS: Total BroadCasts Received = 847 (0x34F)
  STATS: Total Frames Dropped From Capture = 0 (0x0)
  STATS: Total Frames Dropped From Buffer = 0 (0x0)
  STATS: MAC Frames Received = 827
  STATS: MAC CRC Errors = 0
  STATS: MAC Bytes Received = 1662
  STATS: MAC Frames Dropped due to No Buffers = 0
  STATS: MAC Frames Dropped due to HardWare Errors = 0
  STATS: MAC MultiCasts Received = 39
  STATS: MAC BroadCasts Received = 776

Some of the more useful pieces of information include:

- Number of Frames Captured
  This value is helpful in determining if you are viewing a filtered capture. If
  this number does not match the number in the capture, the frames are
  filtered.

- Elapsed Time
  If this value is small and the Total Bytes Captured value is large, there may
  be possible throughput saturation on the network.

- Total Frames Seen During Capture and Total Bytes Seen During Capture
  If a capture filter is used, these values should indicate how much data is not
  included in the capture.
