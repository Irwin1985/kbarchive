SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server version 2.0 offers a status reporting system that
helps you to identify components, site systems, packages or advertisements that
may be problematic. By default, a variety of Status Message Queries are provided
for items such as the following:

- Clients that were unable to install Software Inventory Agent.

- Remote tools activity for a specific site.

- Security rights created, deleted or modified.

While the Status Message viewer simplifies looking at messages related to a
specific problem or area of the system, it is sometimes necessary or beneficial
to get a more complete picture of the health of the system by looking at all of
the status messages. To obtain a complete picture of the site and its child
sites, it may be useful to export all of the status messages in the system for
analysis with a tool like Microsoft Excel. This article describes how to export
these status messages to a text-delimited file for analysis with Microsoft
Excel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To export all of the status messages in the system for analysis:

1. In the Admin console System Status Node, view the Site Status and the site
  code and name of any of the sites listed.

2. Right-click the site name, and then click Show Messages\All.

3. The Status Message Viewer opens. Wait for it to load all of the status
  messages. On the toolbar, change "Original Query" to "All Status Messages".

4. The All Status Messages dialog box prompts you for the conditions of the
  query. If you are only interested in a specific date, click "Specify Date and
  Time" and provide the date or date range you want. If you want a general date
  range, click "Date and Time", and then choose the time integral you would
  like to look at. For example, "All Status Messages since 2 Weeks Ago".

5. Click OK.

6. Wait for the status messages to populate and then click Save As on the File
  menu.

7. Choose a file name with a .xls file extension.

8. In Status Viewer Options, click "All possible Columns" and "All messages".

  NOTE: The file can then be opened in Microsoft Excel and saved in Excel
  format. The first time you open the file, it starts the Text Import Wizard.
  Click the "Finish" button and Excel is able to import the file correctly.

  Once in Microsoft Excel, it is possible to sort messages by any category, such
  as component or site. This sorting lets you identify trends in failures or
  activities that may be affecting the health of your site. Using the Microsoft
  Excel "AutoFilter" feature makes it very easy to sort columns and quickly
  identify problem areas.

  To use the Microsoft Excel AutoFilter, highlight all of the rows and columns
  you have data in (including the first row). On the Data menu, point to
  Filter, and then click AutoFilter. Drop down lists appear on the column
  headings. You can then use these lists to set your filter and sorting
  criteria. While more than one sort can be set, remember that if multiple sort
  options are selected, it is possible that no messages will appear because
  there may not be a message that meets all of your sort criteria. If you want
  to save the file for later analysis, be sure to choose Save As and save it in
  Microsoft Excel format.

  System, please refer to the Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide
