-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, versions 8.0, 8.1, 8.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Exchange Client or Outlook for Macintosh, you may lose
connectivity to the global address list, the personal address book (PAB), or
personal folder files (.pst files). This may affect your ability to send e-mail
to a user who is in the global address list and your ability to remain connected
to your PAB or .pst file when you are connected to the global address list.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because resources have been depleted in the 16-bit
version of the Exchange Client or Outlook. The 16-bit client versions are
limited by their environment. Resources can be depleted by any of the following
conditions:

- More Address Book views are set up on the Exchange Server computer than the
  client can handle. This condition occurs if additional Address Book views are
  added. Connectivity to the global address list, PAB, or .pst files is lost.

- Too many objects have been added to either the PAB or .pst files. This
  condition occurs after names are added to the PAB or .pst files.

- Too many other applications are open at the same time, and are reducing the
  amount of available resources for the Exchange Client or Outlook. When this
  condition occurs, the client works when it is the only application running,
  but does not work when other applications that may compete for resources are
  running.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the three following methods:

- Update and optimize redundant Address Book view entries to allow more
  efficient Address Book view use, or eliminate certain Address Book views.

- Remove or archive old entries or items from the PAB and .pst files. You can
  check .pst files for errors or re-create them, if necessary, by using the
  Inbox Repair utility (Scanpst.exe).

- Identify other applications that are running when Outlook is running and
  adjust the memory allocation for each of these applications so that the
  necessary memory is available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The exact amount of allocated memory is a function of the names that are used in
the global address list, PAB, and .pst files, and is tied to the available
resources of the workstation and the other applications that are running at the
same time. You need to adjust and test all of the various factors to determine
the optimal environment for your 16-bit client.

The 32-bit Windows clients do not experience this problem, because of their
ability to address a larger memory address space.
