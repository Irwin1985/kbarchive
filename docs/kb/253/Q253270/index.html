-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, the collections at the local site server
are displayed with locks, and you cannot edit the collections.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs when you configure a sender address to point to the local site
server. In SMS collections are replicated to child sites. When the sender
address points to the local site server, the collection that is being replicated
is displayed with a lock when it is viewed in the SMS Administrator program
connected to the child site database. Collections at a central site or
collections that are created at the local site should not be displayed with a
lock.

RESOLUTION
==========

To determine if you are experiencing this issue, create a new collection on the
site. Wait for SMS to update the collection, or force it to update by
right-clicking the collection, clicking Tasks, and then clicking Update
Collection Membership. If the collection displays a lock after the collection is
updated, then you are experiencing this issue.

To resolve this issue, check the sender addresses to ensure that one of the
addresses indicate the local server as the destination server. To check the
sender addresses, open the following items:

- Site Database

- Site Hierarchy

- Site Code

- Site Settings

- Addresses

Examine the destination server for each address and verify that none of the
addresses point to the local server. If an address points to the local server,
change the server name to the correct destination server for that site code.

collection, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
