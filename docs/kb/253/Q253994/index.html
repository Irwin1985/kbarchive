-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Clients that have been uninstalled from a site may still be reported as existing
clients in the discovery database, preventing Windows NT Remote Client
Installation from attempting to reinstall uninstalled clients. This issue occurs
only under the following circumstances:

- Windows NT Remote Client Installation is the only enabled installation
  method.

- Network Discovery and Heartbeat Discovery are the only enabled discovery
  methods.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Network Discovery agent does not include the
"client" property in discovery data records (DDRs) that it generates.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two stored procedures to implement this fix: sp_SMSDisplayOldClient
and sp_SMSUpdateOldClient. The 60052.sql script creates both of them.

sp_SMSDisplayOldClient
----------------------

This procedure lists all systems that have not been discovered by Windows NT
Logon Discovery or Heartbeat Discovery within the specified day interval and
whose client property is currently set to "installed" (1).

Syntax: sp_SMSDisplayOldClient [&lt;dayinterval&gt;]

&lt;dayinterval&gt; is the number of days within which a client is considered
current. Set this value to something higher than the Heartbeat Discovery
interval. The range is 1 - 366.

sp_SMSUpdateOldClient
---------------------

This procedure changes the client property to "not installed" (0) on all systems
that have not been discovered by Windows NT Logon Discovery or Heartbeat
Discovery within the specified day interval and whose client property is
currently set to "installed" (1).

Syntax: sp_SMSUpdateOldClient [&lt;dayinterval&gt;]

&lt;dayinterval&gt; is the number of days within which a client is considered
current. Set this to something higher than the heartbeat discovery interval. The
range is 1 - 366.

NOTE: To provide ongoing maintenance, you can schedule sp_SMSUpdateOldClient to
run as a recurring SQL command in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console. To do so:

1. Stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.

2. Run the 60052.sql script by using SQL Query Analyzer or ISQL/W.

3. Restart the services that you stopped in step 1.

4. In the SMS Administrator console, expand the Site Hierarchy, &lt;Site
  Code&gt;, Site Settings, Database Maintenance, and SQL Commands nodes.

5. Right-click the node, point to New and then click SQL Command.

6. Type a descriptive name for the command.

7. In the SQL Command box, type the following line:

  exec sp_SMSUpdateOldClient [&lt;dayinterval&gt;]

8. Select a log path.

9. Set an appropriate schedule.

10. Click OK.
