The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released Outlook for Macintosh Exchange Server Edition 8.2.1. This
article describes the new features that are included in this version, the system
requirements for it, and how to obtain it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following issues are resolved in Outlook for Macintosh Exchange Server
Edition 8.2.1:

- Messages with a blank subject line could not be dragged from Outlook to the
  desktop. Instead, the following error message was displayed:

  The drag and drop operation could not be completed. An error occurred while
  writing to the disk. The disk might be full or write-protected.

- On a computer without security enabled, messages occasionally were not sent
  the first time, and the Send button remained depressed.

- If you copied or cut text from an e-mail message that contained a Uniform
  Resource Locator (URL) and then closed the e-mail message, a message was
  displayed that asked you if you would like to keep the large amount of text
  on the clipboard.

- If you pressed the CTRL key when you double-clicked a hyperlink in an e-mail
  mail message multiple times, Outlook would stop responding.

- Sometimes Outlook launched the Web browser to display the target of a
  hyperlink in an e-mail message, even if that hyperlink was not clicked.

- Japanese characters in e-mail messages that were received over the Internet
  were sometimes displayed incorrectly in the Japanese version of Outlook.

- If e-mail messages had multiple attachments and were forwarded from an
  Outlook Web Access (OWA) client to Outlook for Macintosh Exchange Server
  Edition 8.2, only the first attachment was displayed.

- Web forms were not rendered in Outlook Web Access, even if the Web Services
  information was correctly entered.

- Outlook was unable to use Web Services with a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
  secure (https://) Web server.

- On a 68 kilobyte (KB) Macintosh, if you dragged attachments from an e-mail
  message to an Exchange Server folder, you sometimes caused a Type 2 error.

System Requirements
-------------------

Minimum:

- Apple Macintosh with a 68030 or faster processor

- System 7.5.5 or later

- At least 16 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM)

Recommended:

- Apple Power Macintosh with Mac OS 8.0 or later

- At least 16 MB of RAM

In addition, Outlook for Macintosh Exchange Server Edition 8.2.1 runs faster if
virtual memory is enabled and set to a minimum of 1 MB above the installed
physical memory.
