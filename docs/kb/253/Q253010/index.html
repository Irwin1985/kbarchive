-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, versions 3.6, 3.7 
- Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.1, 2.1 (GA), 2.1 SP1, 2.1 SP2, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver (sqlsrv32.dll) in a manner that
permits multiple concurrent statement handles on a single connection, a busy
connection may leave cursors open in the SQL Server database with no warnings or
notifications to the user. This happens primarily under circumstances where one
or more of the statement handles are working in firehose (Forward-Only,
Read-Only cursor) mode.

This can have two rather serious side effects. The first side effect is that
cursors can be left open on the database server that consumes memory and may
leave locks open against records. The second side effect is that subsequent
attempts to execute statements on the non-firehose ODBC statement handles may
generate the following error for no apparent reason:

  SQLState: 24000 [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Invalid cursor state

This behavior occurs with the sqlsrv32.dll driver versions 3.70.0690 (Microsoft
Data Access Components [MDAC] 2.1 SP2) and earlier, and with sqlsrv32.dll driver
version 3.70.820 (MDAC 2.5/Windows 2000).


CAUSE
=====

When the SQL Server ODBC driver is busy with a firehose-mode operation, no other
activity can occur on the connection until the operation is complete. This
includes the sp_cursorclose calls the driver issues when calling SQLFreeStmt or
SQLCloseCursor.

When the driver fails to close a cursor, SQLFreeStmt and SQLCloseCursor both
return SQL_SUCCESS, no errors are posted to ODBC, and no indication of the
failure is available to the application or user. However, the cursor remains
open in SQL Server and the statement handle still has a cursor identifier
associated with it.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can use these steps to work around the behavior:

1. Execute all firehose operations on their own connection.

2. Make sure all results from firehose operations are completed before closing
  cursors.

NOTE: In a multithreaded environment, this will frequently not be possible.

3. Do not use firehose operations. Instead, set the properties of all statement
  handles so that cursors are generated. This may include setting rowset size
  to something greater than one, setting SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE to something
  other than SQL_CURSOR_FORWARD_ONLY, and/or setting SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY to
  something other than SQL_CONCUR_READ_ONLY.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.This problem was corrected in MDAC 2.6.

This problem has been corrected in U.S. Service Pack 3 for Microsoft SQL Server
version 7.0. For information about how to download and install the latest SQL
Server Service Pack, see the following Microsoft Web site at:

  http://support.microsoft.com/view/dev.asp?ID=hl&amp;pg=sql.asp

For more information, contact your primary support provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Note that this "silent failure" behavior occurs only when the application is
attempting to close a cursor at the same time the connection is busy with a
firehose operation. Operations other than sp_cursorclose generally return the
following error message:

  SQLState: HY000 [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Connection is busy with
  results for another hstmt

It is possible to call SQLFreeStmt or SQLCloseCursor again after the firehose
statement has been closed, and this permits the call to sp_cursorclose to go
through. However, doing so generally requires that the application have
knowledge of the fact that the cursor did not close in the first place, and
therefore does not constitute a good workaround.

This hotfix contains changes that permit an application to detect and trap for
this situation. SQLFreeStmt and SQLCloseCursor have been modified to return
SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO when the sp_cursorclose call failed to execute. Trapping
for this return code allows the application to retry the
SQLCloseCursor/SQLFreeStmt call until it succeeds.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Copy the following code into a console application and then compile it.
  Please note that you need to change your ODBC datasource name, user id and
  password.

  #include "stdafx.h"

  #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;sql.h&gt;
  #include &lt;sqlext.h&gt;

  int StmtError(HSTMT);
  int ConnError(HDBC);

  main()
  {
  	RETCODE rc;
  	HENV henv;
  	HDBC hdbc;
  	HSTMT hstmtCursor, hstmtFirehose;
  	

  	char * dsn = "Pubs";
  	char * uid = "sa";
  	char * pwd = "";
  	char * SQLStr1 = "select au_lname from authors";
  	char * SQLStr2 = "select au_id from titleauthor";

  //	The UPDLOCK hint below can be used instead to further verify that locks are 
  //	being held even after the statement has been closed.
  //	char * SQLStr1 = "select au_lname from authors (UPDLOCK)";

  	rc = SQLAllocEnv(&amp;henv);
  	rc = SQLAllocConnect(henv, &amp;hdbc);

  	rc = SQLConnect(hdbc, (unsigned char *)dsn,
  		SQL_NTS, (unsigned char *)uid,
  		SQL_NTS, (unsigned char *)pwd, SQL_NTS);
  	if (rc != SQL_SUCCESS &amp;&amp; rc != SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO)
  	{
  		ConnError (hdbc);
  		SQLFreeEnv(henv);
  		printf("\nDo the \"Press any key\" thing...");
  		getchar();
  		return(FALSE);
  	}

  	rc = SQLAllocStmt(hdbc, &amp;hstmtCursor);
  	rc = SQLAllocStmt(hdbc, &amp;hstmtFirehose);

  //	Set statement attributes so server-side cursor is generated
  	rc = SQLSetStmtAttr(hstmtCursor, SQL_ROWSET_SIZE, 
  		(void *) 2, SQL_NTS);
  	rc = SQLSetStmtAttr(hstmtCursor, SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE, 
  		(void *) SQL_CURSOR_KEYSET_DRIVEN, SQL_NTS);
  	rc = SQLSetStmtAttr(hstmtCursor, SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY, 
  		(void *) SQL_CONCUR_LOCK, SQL_NTS);

  //	Execute the first statement and fetch a couple of records
  	rc = SQLExecDirect(hstmtCursor, (unsigned char *)SQLStr1, SQL_NTS);
  	if (rc != SQL_SUCCESS )
  	{
  		StmtError (hstmtCursor);
  		SQLFreeStmt(hstmtCursor, SQL_CLOSE);
  		SQLFreeStmt(hstmtFirehose, SQL_CLOSE);
  		SQLDisconnect(hdbc);
  		SQLFreeConnect(hdbc);
  		SQLFreeEnv(henv);
  		printf("\nDo the \"Press any key\" thing...");
  		getchar();
  		return(FALSE);
  	}

  	rc = SQLFetch(hstmtCursor);
  	rc = SQLFetch(hstmtCursor);

  //	Prepare and execute the second statement in firehose mode (using default properties)
  	rc = SQLPrepare(hstmtFirehose, (unsigned char *) SQLStr2, SQL_NTS);
  	rc = SQLExecute(hstmtFirehose);
  	rc = SQLFetch(hstmtFirehose);
  	rc = SQLFetch(hstmtFirehose);

  //	Close the cursor on the first statement handle.
  //	This statement will not make it to the server, even though
  //	SQL_SUCCESS will be returned.
  	rc = SQLCloseCursor(hstmtCursor);
  	rc = SQLFreeStmt(hstmtCursor, SQL_CLOSE);

  //	Execute a statement on the first statement handle again.
  //	This will fail with "Invalid cursor state" errors.
  	rc = SQLExecDirect(hstmtCursor, (unsigned char *) SQLStr1, SQL_NTS);
  	if (rc != SQL_SUCCESS || rc != SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO)
  		StmtError(hstmtCursor);

  	
  	printf("\n\nDo the \"Press any key\" thing...");
  	getchar();	

  	SQLFreeStmt(hstmtCursor, SQL_CLOSE);
  	SQLFreeStmt(hstmtFirehose, SQL_CLOSE);

  //	If the UPDLOCK hint was used, use Query Analyzer to run "sp_lock" here and 
  //	verify that locks are still held, even though all statement handles are closed.
  //	The locks will be freed during SQLDisconnect.
  	SQLDisconnect(hdbc);
  	SQLFreeConnect(hdbc);
  	SQLFreeEnv(henv);
  	return(TRUE);
  };

  //=================================================================
  StmtError(HSTMT hstmt)
  {
  // variables for SQLDiagRec   
  	RETCODE rc = 0;
  	char mstate[6] = "\0";
  	long native = 0;
  	char mtext[300] = "\0";
  	short mlength = 0;
  	short i = 0;

  	while ((rc = SQLGetDiagRec(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, hstmt, ++i, (unsigned char *)&amp;mstate, 
  		&amp;native, (unsigned char *)&amp;mtext, 300, &amp;mlength)) != SQL_NO_DATA)
  	printf("\nODBC Error:\t%s\n",mtext);

  return(0);
  };

  //=================================================================

  ConnError(HDBC hdbc)
  {
  // variables for SQLDiagRec   
  	RETCODE rc = 0;
  	char mstate[6] = "\0";
  	long native = 0;
  	char mtext[300] = "\0";
  	short mlength = 0;
  	short i = 0;

  	while ((rc = SQLGetDiagRec(SQL_HANDLE_DBC, hdbc, ++i, (unsigned char *)&amp;mstate, 
  		&amp;native, (unsigned char *)&amp;mtext, 300, &amp;mlength)) != SQL_NO_DATA)
  	printf("\nODBC Error:\t%s\n",mtext);

  return(0);
  };

2. Start SQL Profiler, and then connect to the same server to which the console
  application connects. Make sure that the following events are being monitored
  in SQL Profiler:

   - CursorOpen
   - CursorClose
   - CursorPrepare
   - CursorUnprepare
   - RPC:Completed

3. Run the code and examine the output in SQL Profiler. Notice that after the
  sp_prepare and sp_execute on the second statement handle, there is no call to
  sp_cursorclose even though both SQLCloseCursor and SQLFreeStmt have been
  called for that statement handle.

4. Also notice that no CursorClose event has been triggered.

NOTE: As an additional check, the UPDLOCK hint can be added to the first
statement (the cursor-generating statement), and sp_lock can then be run in
Query Analyzer to show locks are still being held even after the call to
SQLCloseCursor and SQLFreeStmt. This must be checked before the call to
SQLDisconnect because SQLDisconnect frees the locks open on the connection.

Additional query words: odbc sp_cursorclose close cursor sqlfreestmt sqlclosecursor leave open busy connection invalid state
