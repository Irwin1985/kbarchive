-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server clients stop responding (hang) during logon when duplicate
English Organization Forms library (OFL) folders exist in the Exchange Server
organization.

CAUSE
=====

The existence of duplicate OFL folders can occur when two or more sites are
connected through directory replication connectors. If these OFL folders exist
in both sites prior to establishing directory replication, you can end up with
duplicate OFL folders after directory replication is finished between the
sites.

If public folder affinity is configured between the sites that contain the
duplicate OFL folders, clients in one or both sites may attempt to gain access
to the remote version of the OFL folder during logon. If connectivity to this
folder requires traversing a slow network link or if connectivity is not
possible because of a lack of permissions and/or an absence of remote procedure
call (RPC) connectivity, clients may hang and/or may be prompted for credentials
at logon.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. Download all forms that you want to keep from each OFL folder to a .pst file,
  using the following steps:

  a. Log on with a client in the site where you want to remove the duplicate
     OFL folders.

  b. Go to Manage Forms in the Microsoft Outlook client, and export the forms
     you want to save to a .pst file.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190994 XADM: How to Save Organizational Forms to a PST File

2. Delete the OFL folder(s) that you do not want to keep, using the following
  steps:

  a. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program against a server in the
     site where the duplicate OFL folder exists.

  b. On the Tools menu, click Forms Administrator.

  c. Click the appropriate OFL folder, and then click Remove.

NOTE: Make sure you do not delete the wrong OFL folders. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q175129 XADM: Wrong OFL Deleted in Forms Administrator

3. Restart all Exchange Server computers to delete any cached OFL folder
  information in the site.

4. Publish any missing forms to the remaining OFL by logging on with a client in
  the site containing the English OFL folder and publishing any saved custom
  forms to the OFL.

  NOTE: You can also simply create a new OFL folder with a unique name in the
  site that contained the duplicate. You can then publish forms into the newly
  created OFL folder of that site, rather than publishing the previously
  exported forms into the OFL folder of the site that contains the last copy of
  what was previously the duplicate folder (which is now the unique English OFL
  folder). For additional information, click the article number below to view
