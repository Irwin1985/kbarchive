The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) and transponder features
that are available in both Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 and in Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2000.

Some of the aircraft that are included in Flight Simulator 98 and Flight
Simulator 2000 are equipped with a transponder that communicates with an ATC,
but they are only available in certain lessons and adventures and not during a
normal flight.

If a lesson or adventure involves an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight in
controlled airspace, an ATC assigns the transponder in each aircraft a unique,
four-digit code that is called a squawk code. The ATC assigns the squawk code
verbally (screen chatter). You dial the squawk code into your transponder, and
then information regarding the location of your aircraft is broadcast back to
the ATC.

The location information can also include the altitude of your aircraft, which is
transmitted directly from the altimeter. The information that is transmitted by
your transponder allows the ATC to plot your aircraft on the control tower radar
screen.

NOTE: The functionality of the transponder is limited. You can set the four-digit
transponder squawk code, but you cannot switch the mode of the transponder or
turn the transponder off.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In controlled and uncontrolled airspace, as well as in IFR flight, use the
following standardized codes:

- Other than under certain circumstances, such as transiting Class B airspace
  or utilizing ATC Flight following contact with an Air Traffic Controller for
  assistance when lost, pilots who fly Very High Frequency (VFR) flights almost
  always use the 1200 code.

- In the case of an emergency, use the 7700 code.

- In the event of a radio failure, use the 7700 code for one minute, and then
  switch to the 7600 code.

- If your plane is being hijacked, use the 7500 code.

Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 2000 do not provide a master list of
transponder codes.

For more information about transponder codes and transponder operations, please
visit the following FAA Web site (Aeronautical Information Manual: 4-1-19.
Transponder Operation):

  http://www.faa.gov/ATPubs/AIM/P0401019.HTM

To retrieve transponder codes in Flight Simulator 2000, use one of the following
methods:

- On the Views menu, point to Instrument Panel, and then click Radio Stack.

  NOTE: You can also display the radio stack by clicking the Display/Hide Radio
  Stack button on the main instrument panel.

  The Display/Hide Radio Stack button is one of three small, square buttons that
  are located above the Rudder (Yaw) Trim &amp; Position Indicator. You can
  identify the Display/Hide Radio Stack button by its radio tower icon.

  If the plane is equipped with a transponder, you can retrieve it in this view.

- On the Aircraft menu, point to Navigation, and then click Radios. Type the
  transponder code that you want in the "Transponder code" box. Click the green
  check mark when you are finished.

NOTE: In Flight Simulator 2000, the transponder is available in the following
aircraft:

- Beech King Air 350
- Bell 206B
- Boeing 737
- Boeing 777
- Cessna 182RG
- Cessna 182S
- Cessna 182S IFR
- Concorde
- Extra 300S
- Lear 45
- Mooney Bravo
- Mooney Bravo IFR

To retrieve transponder codes in Flight Simulator 98, use one of the following
methods:

- On the Aircraft menu, click Navigation, click the Transponder/Automatic
  Direction Finder (ADF) tab, enter the transponder code, and then click OK.

- On the Views menu, point to Instrument Panel, click Bendix/King Radio Stack
  (in a Cessna), and then click the cursor on each transponder digit display to
  increase the code's value.

- On the Views menu, point to Instrument Panel, and then click Radio Stack.

  If the plane is equipped with a transponder, you can retrieve it in this view.

NOTE: On a Lear 45, the transponder is on the main instrument panel.
