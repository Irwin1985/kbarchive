SYMPTOMS
========

When you call the SetParent function to allow a standard form to become a child
form of a multiple-document interface (MDI) application, many child windowing
features do not work.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because, by design, a standard window cannot be completely
altered at run time to mimic a child window.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use a dynamic MDI application in place of the
SetParent call. ActiveX controls can be dynamically loaded onto a form. An MDI
child form can dynamically load an ActiveX control that takes over the entire
client area of the window. For more information on this approach, see the
"References" section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the SetParent function to change the ownership of a window in Visual Basic
seldom provides the desired results. Therefore, Microsoft does not recommend or
support this approach.

Use the sample code in the following steps to examine the problems that occur
when you try to use the SetParent call to change a standard form into a child
form.

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. On the Project menu, click Remove Form1.

3. On the Project menu, click Add MDI Form. MDIForm1 is added to Project1.

4. On the Project menu, click Project1 Properties, and set the Startup object to
  MDIForm1.

5. Add the following code behind MDIForm1:

  Private Sub MDIForm_Click()
      Dim x As Class1
      Set x = New Class1
      x.ShowChildForm MDIForm1.hWnd
  End Sub

6. On the File menu, click Add Project. To create a project group, add a new
  ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is created by default.

7. Add the following code to Class1:

  Private Declare Function GetWindowLong Lib "user32" _
          Alias "GetWindowLongA" _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal nIndex As Long) As Long

  Private Declare Function SetParent Lib "user32" _
          (ByVal hWndChild As Long, ByVal hWndNewParent As Long) As Long

  Private Declare Function SetWindowLong Lib "user32" _
          Alias "SetWindowLongA" _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal nIndex As Long, _
          ByVal dwNewLong As Long) As Long

  Const GWL_STYLE = (-16)
  Const WS_POPUP = &amp;H80000000

  Public Function ShowChildForm(ByVal hWndMDIForm As Long)
      Dim Ret As Long
      Dim CurrentStyle As Long
      
      Ret = SetParent(Form1.hwnd, hWndMDIForm)
      CurrentStyle = GetWindowLong(Form1.hwnd, GWL_STYLE)
      Ret = SetWindowLong(Form1.hwnd, GWL_STYLE, CurrentStyle Or WS_POPUP)
      Form1.Show
  End Function

8. On the Project menu, click Add Form. Form1 is added to Project2.

9. In the Project Explorer, click Project1 to activate the Project1.

10. On the Project menu, click References, and add a reference to Project2.

11. Press the F5 key to run the program.

12. Click the client area of MDIForm1. Notice that Form1 (from Project2) is now
  visible in the client area of the MDI form.

The following list includes some of the problems that you may encounter when the
SetParent approach is implemented:

- The title bar of the MDI parent does not show that it is the active window
  when a form from the dynamic-link library (DLL) has focus.

- A menu from a form in the DLL does not merge with a menu of the MDI parent
  form.

- When a form from the DLL is maximized, the title bar of the DLL form is still
  visible.

- When MDI child forms that are part of the MDI project receive focus, they do
  not appear on top of a form from the DLL.

- A form from the DLL can be moved over a toolbar that exists in the MDI
  project.

- When a DLL form is moved out of the visible area of the MDI form, scroll bars
  do not appear on the MDI parent.
