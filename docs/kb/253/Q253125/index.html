SUMMARY
=======

Multlang.exe is a sample that shows how a subclassed Rich Text Format (RTF)
control can be used to support languages that Microsoft Visual FoxPro does not
display correctly.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  MultLang.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of

servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

CAUTION: You must have multilanguage support enabled to run this sample form
effectively. For more information on enabling multilanguage support, please see
the "References" section.

The sample form demonstrates how a subclassed RTF control can be used to
correctly display languages that Visual FoxPro controls cannot display
correctly. For more information on languages not displayed correctly in Visual
FoxPro, see the "References" section.

To demonstrate the solution, run the form and follow these steps:

1. Set both the cKeyboardLayout control and the cDefaultLayout control to one of
  the languages that FoxPro cannot display correctly (such as Greek). To set
  the cKeyboardLayout control, left-click a language in the list box. To set
  the cDefaultLayout control, right-click a language in the list box. The list
  box on the right side of the form shows which languages are enabled by
  highlighting them in the color blue.

2. Next, type some text (such as "abc" (without the quotation marks)) in the box
  labeled VFP Textbox.

3. Type the same text in the RTF control. Note that only the RTF control
  displays the text correctly.

4. This can be confirmed by opening Microsoft Word and copying the text from the
  VFP Textbox to Word. This displays the text correctly.

The subclassed RTF has the following custom properties:

- cKeyboardLayout - Keyboard language switched on entry of the RTF control.

- cDefaultLayout - Keyboard language switched to when exiting RTF control.

- cOldLayout - (used internally) Stores Keyboard layout on entry before being
  switched to cKeyboardLayout.

- nCheckState - How often cKeyboardLayout is checked against the list of
  enabled languages (aLayoutStack):

  0 = Never check.
  1 = Check against the list created during control initialization.
  2 = Check against a list generated on entry of RTF control.

  Typically, the more control you have over what languages are installed, the
  lower you would set this number.

- aLayoutStack - Array containing the enabled languages.
