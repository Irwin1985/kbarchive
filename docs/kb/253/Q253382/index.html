-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Security Configuration Manager (SCM) on a Windows NT 4.0-based
server or workstation, you may not be able to use Windows NT Explorer on that
computer to remotely administer file permissions on other Windows NT-based
computers on the network.

This problem most commonly occurs on computers that are running localized
versions of Windows NT when you try to view permissions on computers running the
English-language version of Windows NT. The problem may also occur when both
computers are running the same language version of Windows NT.

When you try to view file permissions on a remote computer over the network after
installing SCM, you may receive the following error message:

  Unable to display security information

In the French-language version of Windows NT:

  Impossible d'afficher les informations de securite

In the German-language version of Windows NT:

  Die Sicherheitseinstellungen konnen nicht angezeigt werden

In a Network Monitor capture of network traffic from the computer with the
problem, you may see the computer trying to resolve "BUILTIN" or "NT AUTHORITY"
as NetBIOS names immediately before the error message is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

Security Configuration Manager is included with Windows NT 4.0 Service Packs
starting with Service Pack 4, and runs as a part of Explorer.exe to provide
compatibility with Microsoft Windows 2000.

The new version of SCM cannot handle information on domain BUILTIN and NT
AUTHORITY accounts returned by remote computers in the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time   Version        Size     File name     Platform

  11/28/00  21:19  4.0.1381.7086  140,048  Ntmarta.dll  alpha



WORKAROUND
==========

Base, or use File Manager for remote administration of file permissions on other
Windows NT-based computers:
