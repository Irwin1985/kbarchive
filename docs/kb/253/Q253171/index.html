SUMMARY
=======

Many applications offer a list of most recently used files (usually referred to
as an MRU list and located on the File menu). This MRU list allows for quick
selection of a file or project that was recently opened without having to select
FILE-OPEN and browse or search to locate that file. This article demonstrates
one approach to achieving this functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic does not provide any built-in mechanism for managing a list of
recently used files. However, as a developer, you can easily create this list
through the use of a menu control array. The use of a menu control array allows
you to dynamically add menu items to a Visual Basic form during program
execution. There are some prerequisites for a menu control array to work.
Primarily, the first element of the array must be created during the development
of the application. This is as simple as creating the menu item as usual and
then setting its INDEX property to the numeric value of 0, thus making this menu
item the first element, element 0, of the array. Once this is done, the LOAD
method can be used to create additional elements in that array. One important
thing to note is that, by default, the VISIBLE property of control array
elements created at run time is FALSE. Therefore, you also need to set this
property if you want the user to see the new item.

For more information on menu control arrays and control arrays in general, please
refer to Visual Basic's Online documentation by searching for "Control Array."

Following are steps to create a small fully functioning example application
featuring an MRU file list. This example demonstrates the following features:

- It is dynamic and supports a various number of MRU items.

- A maximum number of MRU entries can be defined.

- The list is always sorted from the "most recent" to "least recent."

- The MRU list is saved to the registry upon application termination and loaded
  upon application startup.

STEPS TO CREATE SAMPLE
----------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, select Components, check Microsoft Common Dialog
  control, and click OK.

3. Add a Common Dialog control to Form1.

4. From the Tools menu, select Menu Editor, and create the following menu
  structure:

   File (Name = mnuFile) 
   ---Open (Name = mnuOpen) 
   ---MRU FileList (Name = mnuMRU, Visible = False, Index = 0) 
   ---Quit (Name = mnuQuit)

5. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

  Option Explicit

  Private Const MaxMRU = 4  'Maximum number of MRUs in list (-1 for no limit)
  Private Const NotFound = -1   'Indicates a duplicate entry was not found
  Private Const NoMRUs = -1     'Indicates no MRUs are currently defined

  Private MRUCount As Long      'Maintains a count of MRUs defined

  Private Sub Form_Load()
     ' Initialize the count of MRUs
     MRUCount = NoMRUs
     
     ' Call sub to retrieve the MRU filenames
     GetMRUFileList
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
     ' Call sub to save the MRU filenames
     SaveMRUFileList
  End Sub

  Private Sub mnuMRU_Click(Index As Integer)
     ' Call sub to reorder the MRU list
     ReorderMRUList mnuMRU(Index).Caption, CLng(Index)
  End Sub

  Private Sub mnuOpen_Click()
     ' Show the file open common dialog
     Me.CommonDialog1.ShowOpen
     
     ' Call sub to add this file as an MRU
     AddMRUItem Me.CommonDialog1.FileName
  End Sub

  Private Sub AddMRUItem(NewItem As String)
     Dim result As Long
        
     ' Call sub to check for duplicates
     result = CheckForDuplicateMRU(NewItem)
     
     ' Handle case if duplicate found
     If result &lt;&gt; NotFound Then
        ' Call sub to reorder MRU list
        ReorderMRUList NewItem, result
     Else
        ' Call sub to add new item to MRU menu
        AddMenuElement NewItem
     End If
  End Sub

  Private Function CheckForDuplicateMRU(ByVal NewItem As String) As Long
     Dim i As Long
     
     ' Uppercase newitem for string comparisons
     NewItem = UCase$(NewItem)
     
     ' Check all existing MRUs for duplicate
     For i = 0 To MRUCount
        If UCase$(Me.mnuMRU(i).Caption) = NewItem Then
           ' Duplicate found, return the location of the duplicate
           CheckForDuplicateMRU = i
           
           ' Stop searching
           Exit Function
        End If
     Next i
     
     ' No duplicate found, so return -1
     CheckForDuplicateMRU = -1
  End Function

  Private Sub mnuQuit_Click()
     ' Close the program
     Unload Me
  End Sub

  Private Sub AddMenuElement(NewItem As String)
     Dim i As Long
     
     ' Check that we will not exceed maximum MRUs
     If (MRUCount &lt; (MaxMRU - 1)) Or (MaxMRU = -1) Then
        'Increment the menu count
        MRUCount = MRUCount + 1
        
        ' Check if this is the first item
        If MRUCount &lt;&gt; 0 Then
           ' Add a new element to the menu
           Load mnuMRU(MRUCount)
        End If
        
        ' Make new element visible
        mnuMRU(MRUCount).Visible = True
     End If
     
     ' Shift items to maintain most recent to least recent
     For i = (MRUCount) To 1 Step -1
        ' Set the captions
        mnuMRU(i).Caption = mnuMRU(i - 1).Caption
     Next i
     
     ' Set caption for new item
     mnuMRU(0).Caption = NewItem
  End Sub

  Private Sub ReorderMRUList(DuplicateMRU As String, DuplicateLocation As Long)
     Dim i As Long
     
     ' Move entries previously "more recent" than the
     ' duplicate down one in the MRU list
     For i = DuplicateLocation To 1 Step -1
        mnuMRU(i).Caption = mnuMRU(i - 1).Caption
     Next i
     
     ' Set caption of newitem
     mnuMRU(0).Caption = DuplicateMRU
  End Sub

  Private Sub GetMRUFileList()
     Dim i As Long           'Loop control variable
     Dim result As String    'Name of MRU from registry
     
     ' Loop through all entries
     Do
        ' Retrieve entry from registry
        result = GetSetting(App.Title, "MRUFiles", Trim$(CStr(i)), "")
        
        ' Check if a value was returned
        If result &lt;&gt; "" Then
           ' Call sub to additem to MRU list
           AddMRUItem result
        End If
        
        ' Increment counter
        i = i + 1
     Loop Until (result = "")
  End Sub

  Private Sub SaveMRUFileList()
     Dim i As Long           ' Loop control variable
     
     ' Loop through all MRU
     For i = 0 To MRUCount
        ' Write MRU to registry with key as it's position in list
        SaveSetting App.Title, "MRUFiles", Trim$(CStr(i)), mnuMRU(i).Caption
     Next i
  End Sub

6. Save and run the sample.

7. From the File menu, select Open, and choose any file. Repeat this step
  several times and you can see the Most Recently Used (MRU) File List in the
  File menu.

Each file you select appears, in order of most recently selected, as a menu item
under the File menu. If you select the same file twice, it only appears once in
the list. If you select it the second time, it should move to the top of the
list. Picking one of these items from the File menu also moves it to the top of
the MRU list.

Note that there is a constant named MaxMRU. This constant defines the maximum
number of items that appear as recent files on the File menu. In the sample code
above, this value is set to 4.
