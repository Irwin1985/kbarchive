-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to run a form contained in an application (.app) file that is
called from an executable (.exe) file, an error message is generated:

  Error instantiating class. Cannot find ...

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro cannot find the class libraries for the form even though they may
already be in memory. Because the libraries were excluded from the .app file,
the form is looking for them on disk, and they cannot be found. Visual FoxPro
does not search memory to find these missing classes.

RESOLUTION
==========

The resolution to the problem is to clear the ClassLoc field for all records in
the form.scx file and load the class libraries that are in the main .exe file.

To clear the Classloc field in the form, issue the following code.

NOTE: Ensure that you make a backup of the form or forms that are being updated.

  UPDATE MyForm.SCX SET ClassLoc = ""

Copy the following code to a program (.prg) file called "SetFormClasses" (without
the quotation marks):

  *!*	Forms in VFP6 cannot find the classlibs used in the Form Designer if they
  *!*	are excluded from the APP project but are loaded in the calling EXE.  This
  *!*	program (SetFormClass) will load necessary classlibs in an APP called
  *!*	from an EXE and is dependant upon the classlibs in the EXE because they
  *!*	are excluded in the APP.
  *!*
  *!*	One important aspect to note is that the classlib field in the SCX file
  *!*	must be cleared.  Be certain to make a copy of the form before clearing
  *!*	the classloc field, or you may not be able to open the form in the Form
  *!*	Designer.  The classlibs needed for the form will be loaded in in this
  *!*	program if they are passed as parameters.
  *!*
  *!*	Parameters:
  *!*		tcClasslib1
  *!*		tcClasslib2
  *!*		tcClasslib3
  *!*		...
  *!*		tcClasslibN
  *!*
  *!*	Syntax:
  *!*		DO SetFormClasses WITH "MyClass1", "MyClass2", "MyClass3", ... "MyClassN"
  *!*
  *!*	This program must be run from the main program in the APP.
  *!*	The variable lcCurrentAPP is assuming that this program is called
  *!*	from the main program.

  *!*	If an APP has a classlib loaded and it is unloaded here, then
  *!*	returning to that APP will cause errors.  Need to release and reload the
  *!*	classes in MAIN, but only if they are not loaded with the IN clause.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There may be situations when an application (.app) with multiple modules is
created. The modules may be updated, but the base .exe is not updated at the
same time. The functionality of the base classes in the .exe files is still
needed until the .exe is updated, but not any new functionality in the classes
in development. The only way to do this is to exclude the classes from the .app.
However, by doing so, Visual FoxPro is no longer able to find the class.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project and save it as "MAIN" (without the quotation marks).

   - Create a program (.prg) file and save it as "Main" (without the quotation
     marks). Add the following code:

  DO FORM Main
  READ EVENTS
  CLEAR EVENTS
  SET CLASSLIB TO

   - Create a new class named MyForm based on Form and store it in MyClass.
   - Add a class named MyCommandButton based on CommandButton and store it in
     MyClass.
   - Create a form based on the new class MyForm. Remove the original form and
     the form set. Place the following code in the Destroy event of the form:

  CLEAR EVENTS

     Save the form as "Main" (without the quotation marks).
   - Drag and drop two command buttons based on MyCommandButton onto the form.
   - In the click event of the first command button, add the following code.
     Give this button the caption of Module1Form.

  DO module1.APP WITH "Module1Form"

   - In the click event of the second command button, add the following code.
     Give this button the caption of Cancel.

  THISFORM.RELEASE()

   - Build an .exe file.

2. Create a second project and save it as "Module1" (without the quotation
  marks).

   - Create a .prg file and call it "Module1Main" (without the quotation
     marks). Add the following code:

  LPARAMETERS cForm
  *!* Uncomment this to see the workaround in action
  *!*DO setformclasses WITH "MyClass"
  DO FORM Module1Form

   - Add the class library MyClass to the project.
   - Create a new form based on the class MyForm and save it as Module1Form.
     Remove the original form and the form set.
   - Drag and drop one command button based on MyCommandButton from MyClass
     onto the form. Add the following code to the click event:

  THISFORM.RELEASE()

   - Build an APP.

3. Copy the .app file and the .exe file to a new folder.

4. Run the .exe and click on Module1Form. Note that the following error message
  appears:

  Error instantiating class. Cannot find ...
