SUMMARY
=======

This article defines the level of interoperability available between the
Exchange Clients for Windows and Macintosh platforms. Because several versions
of Exchange Server and its clients are available, the level of interoperability
between clients can be difficult to determine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Term Definitions
----------------

To fully understand interoperability in Exchange Server, you must first
understand the following terms:

- MAPI. MAPI refers to the Windows Messaging Application Programming Interface,
  or the common calls that a Microsoft Windows application makes to perform
  mail-related actions. MAPI clients can run information services in a profile.
  Only one of these services, the Exchange Server service, is discussed in this
  article. Also, all of the following explanations assume that the MAPI client
  has been granted the appropriate rights.

  NOTE: Although the Macintosh clients are not really MAPI clients, they still
  belong in this category, as opposed to another category of client, such as
  the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) version client. The Macintosh
  clients have some MAPI features that put them in the same category with the
  Windows MAPI clients. There is no MAPI support on the Macintosh platform, so
  an application cannot be written on the Macintosh to make MAPI calls. This
  also means that there is no support for forms, or any other Visual Basic
  support on this platform (other than the HTML forms mentioned below).

- Interoperability. Interoperability refers to the level at which clients can
  interact, and interoperability also determines what data results from this
  interaction. Exchange Server provides two levels of interoperability for its
  clients. The following two levels of interoperability, simple and full, are
  available:

   - Simple. This level of interoperability offers the most basic means of
     working with other users and information in the Exchange Server
     organization, and is available to all of the MAPI clients of an Exchange
     Server computer. Although this level of interoperability does not offer
     all of the features that are available to Exchange Server and its clients,
     it does provide the ability to interact with these other clients. The
     following are some of the features that are available with this level of
     interoperability:

      - You can send and view free and busy information.

      - You can send and receive meeting requests.

      - You can send messages on behalf of another user.

   - Full. This level of interoperability offers the most robust means of
     working with Exchange Server users and information. This level offers all
     of the features that are available to the installed Exchange Server
     computer and its clients. Not all clients can obtain this level of
     interoperability. The following are some of the features that are
     available with this level of interoperability:

      - You can open another user's server-based calendar for direct access.

      - You can assign delegates to your mailbox.

      - You can assign delegates to receive meeting requests instead of you.

Calendar Interfaces
-------------------

Two types of calendar interfaces are available to Exchange Clients: "old" and
"new," or more specifically, the earlier Schedule+ and later Outlook calendar
interfaces. Because the level of calendar interoperability is based on the
calendar interface that the client uses, you must understand the differences
between the two following interfaces:

- Schedule+ 7.0a was the first calendar product, and is included with Exchange
  Server 4.0. Exchange Server 5.0 includes the improved Schedule+ 7.5. Both of
  these programs are only available as part of the Exchange Server version that
  they were released with, and were never available for retail sale (Schedule+
  7.0 is included with Microsoft Office 95, but is not compatible with Exchange
  Server). Both of these versions are available for the Windows 16-bit, Windows
  32-bit, and Macintosh platforms. Schedule+ can use either a local file or the
  Exchange Server-based store to hold the calendar data. Only the Schedule+
  application can use this data; it cannot be opened in any other application.
  As long as Schedule+ clients open only other Schedule+ calendars, full
  interoperability exists. However, because Outlook was released later than
  Schedule+, Schedule+ cannot open an Outlook calendar. The one exception to
  this is the Windows versions of Schedule+ that was included in the Exchange
  Server Inbox client version 4.0 and 5.0). For additional information about a
  method that allows read-only access to an Outlook calendar with this version
  of Schedule+, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q170061 XCLN: Readme.txt for Msoutl32.dll

  Q140404 OL97: 16-Bit Client Unable to Read Schedule+ Data

  This capability was also later incorporated in Outlook for the Macintosh.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q197450 XCLN: Macintosh Outlook Client Version 8.1 New Features

- Outlook 97 is included with Exchange Server 5.0, as well as being available
  through retail sale. Later, Exchange Server 5.5 included Outlook 98 and
  eventually Outlook 2000 (included with the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3
  CD-ROM). These new clients offered the Outlook calendar interface, in
  addition to the existing Schedule+ interface. The biggest difference between
  the two interfaces is that the Outlook calendar is a folder under the user's
  top-level mailbox. In addition, the items in the folder are standard IPM
  message classes, so that custom forms and folder views apply. Lastly, because
  the calendar is a folder, you can add it to a user's offline folder file
  (.ost) and synchronize it. Outlook can open both earlier Schedule+ calendars,
  as well as later Outlook calendars. In addition, you can also configure
  Outlook to use Schedule+ as the primary calendar, so that Outlook uses the
  original Schedule+ application for any calendar operations and offers full
  interoperability with older Schedule+ users.

Exchange Client Interoperability
--------------------------------

The most basic explanation of interoperability is that any Schedule+ client
always has full interoperability with other Schedule+ clients and simple
interoperability with Outlook clients. However, interoperability is not always
that simple.

A more accurate way to explain interoperability between the different versions of
Exchange Clients is to list all of the clients and their level of
interoperability. The following table lists levels of interoperability between
all of the Exchange Clients.

   - (4) Outlook 32-bit forms are not supported on the Windows 16-bit and
     Macintosh platform clients. However, it is possible to supplement this
     with HTML forms that are based on Outlook 32-bit forms. When Windows
     16-bit or Macintosh platform clients receive an item that uses a custom
     Outlook 32-bit form, it contains a URL. HTML forms allow these clients to
     connect to OWA and for an HTML version of the form.

   - (5) Schedule+ does have a Contacts module, however, Schedule+ Contacts are
     not compatible with Outlook Contacts. Only another Schedule+ client can
     use Schedule+ contacts. Schedule+ contacts are limited; they do not offer
     fields for e-mail address, Internet Web sites, or many of the other fields
     that Outlook Contacts offer.

   - (6) Messages that contain voting buttons are not supported on the Windows
     16-bit and Macintosh platform clients. However, these clients can open and
     reply to a voting message that is sent from an Outlook 32-bit client.
