SYMPTOMS
========

You open a Form from a UserControl and no object can have the focus. Users
cannot click on anything, not even to close the Form.

CAUSE
=====

If a UserControl on a Modal Form opens another Modal Form which was loaded in
either the InitProperties or ReadProperties events, no object can have the
focus.

RESOLUTION
==========

- Do not load a Form modally from the InitProperties or ReadProperties Events
  of a UserControl on a Modal Form.

- Use a Timer to re-enable the window with the EnableWindow API function.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs only when using the compiled ocx. Everything works as
expected if the UserControl Project is added to this test Project instead of
using the compiled ocx. When this problem does occur, the only way to close the
Form is from the keyboard by pressing the ALT+F4 key combination. If the
BorderStyle property of the Form is set to 0 - None, the process will not work
and you cannot close the application gracefully.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a New UserControl Project and name it UsrCtlModalTest.

2. Add a CommandButton to the UserControl, and then add the following code:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           usrTestForm.Show vbModal, Me
        End Sub

        Private Sub UserControl_ReadProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)
        ' or in Sub UserControl_InitProperties ...
           Load usrTestForm
        End Sub

3. Add a Form to the Project and name it usrTestForm. From the File menu, Make
  UsrCtlModalTest.ocx. Close and Save the UserControl Project.

4. Create a New Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by default. Add a second
  Form to the Project. Add a CommandButton to Form1 with the following code:

        Form2.Show vbModal, Me

5. Choose Components from the Project Menu, and then check UsrCtlModalTest and
  OK.

6. Add the UsrCtlModalTest control to Form2. Run the Project and click on the
  buttons to open both Forms.

7. Try to close the last Form by clicking on the Close button in the Control
  Box.

  Note that no matter where you click, nothing but a beep is produced. The only
  way to close the Form is by pressing the ALT+F4 key combination. Once closed
  and reopened, it works fine. This is because you unloaded the instance of the
  Form that was loaded in either the InitProperties or ReadProperties Event. It
  works fine to Load the Form from the Click of the button.

Steps to Workaround Behavior
----------------------------

1. Open the UsrCtlModalTest.ocx project created above and place a Timer control
  on the Modal Form being launched, usrTestForm.

2. Set the Timer's Interval property to 100.

3. Paste the following into the declarations section of usrTestForm:

  Private Declare Function EnableWindow Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
     ByVal fEnable As Long) As Long

  Sub Form_Load
     Timer1.Enabled = True   ' Turn on the timer
  End Sub

  Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
    EnableWindow Me.hwnd, 1
    Timer1.Enabled = False   ' Turn off the timer
  End Sub

4. Repeat the steps above to create a Standard EXE project to test the
  UserControl. This time the Modal From can receive focus and will close when
  you click on the Close button.
