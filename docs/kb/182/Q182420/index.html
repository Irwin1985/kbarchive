-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you collect files as part of your inventory configuration and you use a
Windows NT reserved word for your site code, Microsoft Systems Management Server
may be unable to create the directory in which collected files will be placed.

Systems Management Server creates a directory called:

  &lt;Sms Root&gt;\Site.srv\Dataload.box\Files.col\xxx

where xxx is the site code of the site where collected files are placed.

If the site code which you are using is a reserved word, such as CON, Windows NT
does not allow Systems Management Server to create this directory.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the operating system does not allow creation of a
directory if that directory name is a reserved word.

In File Manager or Windows NT Explorer, if you try to create a directory using a
reserved word, Windows NT will display the following error message:

  File Manager cannot create directory. The specified name is already used by a
  file

Windows NT reserved words that cannot be used as a site code include:

  CON
  PRN
  AUX
  NUL

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to collect files and are using a reserved word as a site code, you
must reinstall your site and specify a new site code.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section
of this article, or wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack.
The hotfix should have the following timestamps:

  3/27/98    2:41pm        535,632 Base.dll (Intel)
  3/27/98    2:39pm        750,352 Base.dll (Alpha)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server versions 1.0 and 1.1.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available for version 1.2, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.


This is also true for the Systems Management Server 2.0 sites. The following
error message is seen in the NT_LOGON.LOG:

  Create Directory \\A1-PDC\SMSLOGON\Sites\PRN - Fail (5)

The remainder of the SMSLOGON share and directory are created correctly. Only the
&lt;SiteCode&gt; folder under the Sites folder fails to be created. While a
hotfix does exist for Systems Management Server 1.2, there is no hotfix
available at this time for Systems Management Server 2.0 to allow these site
codes to be used. If this error is encountered, the only remedy is to remove and
reinstall the site with a different site code.
