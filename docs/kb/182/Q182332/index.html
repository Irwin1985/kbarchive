-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server clients configured to use TCP/IP sockets may experience a delay
during the initial connection to a multihomed SNA Server computer. The time
delay before getting the application session depends upon the TCP/IP retry
timers configured on the client, but should be 45 to 55 seconds assuming the
retry-timer settings have not been modified from their defaults.

CAUSE
=====

Multihomed server support was added to SNA Server and SNA Server clients in SNA
Server 3.0 Service Pack 2. This new feature allows the SnaBase service to send
two entries (a new entry, TCPIP2, that lists all IP addresses of the server, and
the original entry, TCPIP, that lists only one of possibly many IP addresses
associated with the server) in its service-table updates for the TCP/IP
transport. The original entry is retained for backward compatibility with
earlier-version (pre-3.0 SP2) clients and servers.

SNA Server 3.0 SP2 (and later) clients now receive all of the TCP/IP addresses
configured on the SNA Server computer. However, the clients try to connect to
the SNA Server computer by trying the TCP/IP addresses in the order they are
listed in the service-table update received from the SNA Server computer. If the
first TCP/IP address exists on a subnet that is not reachable from the client's
subnet, the client is not able to try the next TCP/IP address in its list until
the TCP/IP retry timers expire. This can lead to a 45 to 55 second delay between
connection attempts over the different TCP/IP addresses.

Note: Once the initial connection is made, the SNA Server client will continue to
use the correct TCP/IP address for the duration of the application session. The
potential delay is only noticeable upon the initial application startup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 SP2 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 and 4.0
U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this update applied, clients that try connecting to multihomed servers will
search the TCP/IP address list received from the server and will choose an IP
address that it is most likely to get a successful connection based on the
client's own TCP/IP address. The client will attempt to connect to this TCP/IP
address first, and if that fails, it will then try the other addresses in the
list.

If SNA Server 3.0 SP1 clients (and earlier versions) fail to connect to a
multihomed Windows NT Server 4.0 computer running SNA Server, please refer to
the following Knowledge Base article:
