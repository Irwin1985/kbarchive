SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to send a message to an Internet recipient when you are not
connected to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, you may receive a non-
delivery report (NDR) similar to the following when you connect to the server:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject: &lt;subject&gt;
     Sent: 7/19/96 11:20:50 AM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

     &lt;recipient&gt; on 7/19/96 11:20:52 AM

     No transport provider was available for delivery to this recipient.

This problem occurs with Internet recipients that are not located in your
personal address book (PAB) or the global address list. The problem can occur
when you are using offline folders and an offline storage file (OST) or the
remote features of your e-mail client and a set of personal folders (.pst file).
Note that creating a new OST or a new profile does not resolve the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must connect to the Exchange Server computer in
online mode once, in order to cache all the gateway address routing table
(GWART) entries. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Configure the Microsoft Exchange Server information service to connect
  through a network instead of working offline. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail.

  b. Click Microsoft Exchange Server in the list of information services, and
     then click Properties.

  c. In the When Starting area, click the Connect With The Network option to
     select it, click OK, and then click OK again.

2. Verify that your computer is physically connected to the network. If you
  cannot physically connect your computer to the network, connect to the
  network using Dial-Up Networking.

3. Start your e-mail client, send a message to an Internet recipient, and then
  verify that you do not receive an NDR. Do not continue with these steps if
  you receive an NDR when you attempt to send a message to an Internet
  recipient while you are connected to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

4. Quit and log off the e-mail client. If you connected to the network using
  Dial-Up Networking, end the Dial-Up Networking connection.

5. Configure the Microsoft Exchange Server information service to work offline
  instead of connecting through the network. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail.

  b. Click Microsoft Exchange Server in the list of information services, and
     then click Properties.

  c. In the When Starting area, click the Work Offline And Use Dial-Up
     Networking option to select it, click OK, and then click OK again.

6. Start your e-mail client, send a message to an Internet recipient, and then
  verify that you do not receive an NDR.
