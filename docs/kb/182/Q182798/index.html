SYMPTOMS
========

If you add a new connector to an Exchange site and recalculate the routing
(&lt;org&gt;/&lt;site&gt;/Configuration/Site Addressing/Routing), you may find
that the routing table does not reflect the changes that you have made. This
problem can affect all sites within the organization. The Windows NT event log
still reports that the routing was successfully updated:

  Event ID : 5000
  Source : MSExchangeSA
  Description : Recalculation of the routing table is complete.  Result:
  The operation has completed successfully.

CAUSE
=====

An invalid address space was entered on a connector, which caused the routing
calculation to ignore subsequent connectors.

The syntax for address spaces on a connector is checked when the connector is
created in the Exchange Administrator program. However, in Exchange 4.0 SP4 and
Exchange 5.0, a mechanism to restrict the scope of an address space was
introduced. Using a LOCAL address space bypasses the syntax checking, so
therefore it is possible to add an invalid address space. The Administrator
program in Exchange 5.5 has been modified so that the scope of the address space
can be set without having to use the LOCAL method, although this can still be
used.

For more information on LOCAL routes, please see Knowledge Base article Q161947,
"XCON: MTA: Address Space Replication with LOCAL Address Spaces."

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do the following. First, examine the address spaces
for all connectors, paying particular attention to those added using the LOCAL
syntax. Examples of invalid syntax entered are:

  Type : LOCAL
  Address : X400:c=XX;a=VOID

The above address is invalid, because for LOCAL address spaces the delimiter
needs to be a comma instead of the usual semi-colon.

  Type : LOCAL
  Address : X400:c=MyCountry, a=*

This is invalid because "MyCountry" is not a valid country code.

Remove the invalid address spaces and then recalculate the routing. You will find
that the routes for new connector will now appear in the routing table.

For more complicated Exchange configurations with many connectors, it may not be
easy to examine every connector in the organization. In these cases, use the
hotfix described below. This ignores the invalid address spaces and fully
recalculates the routing for the Exchange site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
