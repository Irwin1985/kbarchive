- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server Manager opens a LAN connection to the ?Manage Agent? (MngAgent)
service that is running on each active SNA Server in the SNA subdomain to
retrieve and display status information for the server. However, if SNA Server
Manager loses its LAN connection to the server and is unable to reconnect to it,
Manager will display the SNA Server status as ?Offline,? even when the SNA
Server service is actually running.

If SNA Server Manager loses its LAN session to an SNA Server, Manager attempts to
reopen the connection for another three to four minutes. After that time passes,
Manager attempts to reconnect to the SNA Server only if its local ?service
table? (maintained by the SnaBase service) indicates that the MngAgent service
is active on that server. When running on an SNA Server Windows NT client, the
SnaBase service receives this status information from its ?sponsor? SNA Server.
When running on an SNA Server, the SnaBase periodically receives status updates
from other servers in the subdomain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To diagnose the cause of the offline status:

1. Verify the communication between Manager and the SNA Server

  If TCP/IP is being used to connect to the SNA Server, try issuing a "ping"
  command to determine if the remote SNA Server is reachable. If SNA Server is
  not reachable, there is a problem in the LAN connection, between the Manager
  computer and the SNA Server. If some other transport is being used, try to
  connect to a network resource on the server. If the connection attempt fails,
  this could be because of a LAN connection problem, or the user may not be
  authorized to connect to the server.

2. Determine whether the SNA Manage Agent service (MngAgent) is running on the
  SNA Server that appears as Offline. If this service is stopped, restart it
  and check for the presence of an &lt;ntroot&gt;\drwtsn32.log file, which may
  indicate that SNA Manage Agent failed abnormally. If the service is running,
  try stopping the service and restarting it.

  NOTE: See the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base that describe
  known problems that can cause a Manage Agent failure with SNA Server 3.0. If
  you run SNA Server 3.0, try upgrading to the latest SNA Server 3.0 Service
  Pack.

3. Capture the following additional diagnostic information if the problem is not
  related to the status of the Manage Agent service:

   - Capture a Microsoft Network Monitor (or Network General Sniffer(TM)) LAN
     trace of all traffic to and from the computer where SNA Manager is
     running.

   - Capture the following SNA traces from the computer running Manager:

      - SnaBase full internal trace

      - Manage Client full internal trace

  The above traces should capture the time period when the server status changes
  to the Offline status.
