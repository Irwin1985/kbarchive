-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a document in Rich Text Format (RTF) in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows to generate Help (.hlp) files with the Microsoft Help Compiler, unwanted
line numbering may precede paragraphs in the help source file. The document does
not show these line numbers in Word 97.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs in Word when you choose to continue a previous list, but
there are non-list paragraphs between the two lists. The list can be either a
bulleted or a numbered list.

Word places RTF codes after the first list which indicates that line numbering
should continue silently, as in the example below:

     {\*\pn \pnlvlcont\ilvl0\ls0\pnrnot0\pndec }

The codes in the example above specify the following:


     \pnlvlcont = continue line numbering but silently (don't display on
     screen)

     \ls0 = the list id that should be continued

     \pndec = the list is decimal (1,2,3)

However, these codes are unnecessary. Word relies on the list id (/ls#) to
determine whether a list should continue a previous list. When you take those
codes out of the RTF file, Word still renders the file correctly. Hence, the
additional RTF codes cause the Help compiler to place line numbers on every
paragraph between the two lists.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Help compiler does not allow you to continue a previous automatically
numbered list. To generate this effect, turn off automatic numbering. To turn
off Automatic numbering, follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click AutoFormat, and click Options in the AutoFormat
  dialog box.

2. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab, and click to clear the Automatic
  Numbered Lists check box.

3. Click OK twice.

You then have to type in the numbers for the list manually. Note that this is
only necessary if you have two separate lists, and the second list needs to
continue numbering where the first list stopped.

NOTE: Because bulleted lists do not provide the option to continue a previous
list, this situation is more rare. When it occurs it is more difficult to solve,
because you can not turn off the "continue previous list" option for bullets.

The following Word 97 code fixes any RTF document where bulleted lists are
causing the problem. The code cycles through each paragraph. If the current
paragraph is in a list, it copies the formatting of the list. It then removes
the list attribute and reapplies it. By default, these actions remove any
continuation of previous lists. Note that this will cause separate numbered
lists that were previously continuous to begin renumbering after each break.
However, since the Help files can not render this type of list, that problem
will need to be dealt with separately anyway by manually typing in the list
numbers.

     Sub BulletFix()
     '
     ' BulletFix Macro
     '
     Dim par As Object

     ' Cycle through all paragraphs in document
        For Each par In ActiveDocument.Paragraphs
           ' Select paragraph
           par.Range.Select
           ' Save its ListTemplate (its formatting)
           Dim lt As ListTemplate
           Set lt = Selection.Range.ListFormat.ListTemplate
           If TypeName(lt) &lt;&gt; "Nothing" Then
              Dim FirstLine As Double
              Dim LeftIndent As Double
              FirstLine = Selection.ParagraphFormat.FirstLineIndent
              LeftIndent = Selection.ParagraphFormat.LeftIndent

              ' Remove Bullets/Numbers
              Selection.Range.ListFormat.RemoveNumbers _
                 NumberType:=wdNumberParagraph
              ' Restore the list format
              Selection.Range.ListFormat.ApplyListTemplate _
              ListTemplate:=lt, ApplyTo:=wdListApplyToWholeList

              ' Restore Indentation Settings
              Selection.ParagraphFormat.FirstLineIndent = FirstLine
              Selection.ParagraphFormat.LeftIndent = LeftIndent
           End If
        Next
     ' Go back to the beginning of the document
     Selection.HomeKey Unit:=wdStory
     End Sub

Deleting the problematic RTF codes should be the last option. In this case, keep
a backup copy of the RTF file (in case the wrong codes are deleted). The file
could become corrupt and unreadable by Word.

For more information about the Listformat Property, while in the Visual Basic for
Applications Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "Listformat," click
Search, and then click to view "Listformat Property."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see

This problem also occurs with bulleted lists when numbered lists are converted to
bulleted lists.

Although there is no continuation option for bulleted lists, a bulleted list can
inherit this behavior from a numbered list. If you look at the RTF code, the
same problem RTF codes immediately follow the bulleted list, although they
specify "\pndec" (referring to a numbered list.)
