SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the function and effects of running DS/IS consistency
adjuster. Because of the potential problems that the DS/IS consistency adjuster
may cause, Microsoft recommendeds that you contact Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS) before you run it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DS/IS consistency adjuster is used in disaster recovery scenarios where it
is not possible to restore the directory to the recovery computer, or where the
information store (the Priv.edb or Pub.edb file) is copied to a recovery
computer with a name that is different from that of the original server.

The DS/IS consistency adjuster is run to re-create the directory objects for the
mailboxes and for public folders that are in the store and not in the directory.
This process also resets the Home-MDB attribute on all public folders in the
hierarchy that are homed on unknown sites or servers. In addition, the process
strips the public folder access control lists (ACLs) of any invalid entries
(that is, users who do not exist in the current directory). Servers and sites
are "unknown" and invalid entries exist when replication has not completed to
the server that the DS/IS consistency adjuster was run on or when a replication
connector to another site has been removed.

After the rehoming process is complete, if you re-create a replication connector
to the organization, there is a conflict for each rehomed public folder. The new
server wins the conflict because it has the latest changes to the public folders
in question. Accordingly, the public folder is homed on the new server, and the
new ACL is kept. This results in lost permissions for any users not on the site
where the DS/IS consistency adjuster was run.

The DS/IS consistency adjuster is modified in Exchange Server 5.5 and each of
these functions (making new directory entries for mailboxes, modifying ACLs in
mailboxes, rehoming public folders, and modifying ACLs in public folders) must
be selected manually to take effect. Additionally, a new attribute of public
folders in Exchange Server 5.5 is to "Limit Administrative Access" to a public
folder to a home site, which prevents other sites from being able to rehome
those particular folders. Note that this property is only fail-safe in an
environment that is completely Exchange Server 5.5. In a mixed version 4.0, 5.0,
and 5.5 Exchange Server environment, version 4.0 and 5.0 Administrator
Consistency Adjustment programs ignore the Administrative Access flag and rehome
the folders anyway.

NOTE: You do not need to run the DS/IS consistency adjuster if you only want to
restore an information store to a production server that has a good working
directory.

To run DS/IS consistency adjuster:

1. In the Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program, click a server running
  Exchange Server 5.5 that contains a public information store.

2. On the File menu, click Properties, and then click the Advanced tab.

3. Click Consistency Adjustment.

4. In DS/IS Consistency Adjustment, select the Remove unknown user accounts from
  public folder permissions check box, and then select All inconsistencies.

NOTE: Clear all other check boxes.
