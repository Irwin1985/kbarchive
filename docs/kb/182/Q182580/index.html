-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes setting up a Quick Menu for use in an Active Document
application, which is a new feature in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Chapter 31 of the Microsoft Visual FoxPro "Programmer's Guide," version 6.0 is a
good source for information on creating Active Document applications. The
chapter contains an explanation of Menu Negotiation, terms used in Menu
Negotiation, Help Menu Merging and enhancements to the DEFINE PAD command.

The steps below guide the developer in creating a Quick Menu that can be used in
an Active Document application. This menu will have a custom menu pad and
Colors, in addition to the menu pads provided by FoxPro with a Quick Menu. It
also illustrates Help Menu Merging with the Fruits menu pad.

Steps to Create a Quick Menu
----------------------------

1. Create a new menu, not a shortcut. The code below can be typed in the Command
  window to accomplish this task. In the New Menu dialog box select menu. Here
  is the code:

  CREATE MENU ADTest

2. From the System menu, point to the Menu pad, and then click Quick Menu.

3. Delete the View and Tools menu pads. This is not necessary, it just prevents
  the menu from getting too long in this example. The Program menu will be left
  in case Cancel, Resume or Suspend are needed.

4. Insert a new Menu pad between Edit and Program.

  NOTE: Select the Program prompt and point to the Insert button in the Menu
  Designer.

5. Name the new prompt \&lt;Colors. The \&lt; causes the C in Colors to be
  underlined. The result should be a submenu, which should be created now.

6. Create three submenu prompts for Colors and enter Red, Blue, and Green. The
  Result of each should be a Command. For the command, type in the following:

  

  WAIT WINDOW "Red"
  WAIT WINDOW "Blue"

7. Go back to the main Menu bar. Add a new prompt on the end after the Help
  prompt. Name it Fr\&lt;uits. The Result should be a submenu. Create the
  submenu just like the submenu for Colors. However, this time, use "Apples,"
  "Bananas," and "Grapes" for the prompts. Make the Results WAIT WINDOW
  commands with the fruit names just as Color example in step six. Go back to
  the main Menu bar when finished.

8. Now the menu negotiation needs to be created. For the File prompt, select the
  Options button. In the top-right corner of the Prompt Options dialog box is a
  Negotiate section. For the purposes of this dialog box, remember the
  following:

  Container = When the menu is run in Visual FoxPro.
  Object = When the menu is run hosted in an Active Document Container, such as
  Internet Explorer.

  The File prompt should be set properly. Object is set to None because the File
  menu is Internet Explorer's when the Active Document application is hosted.

9. Check the other menu prompts:

   - The Edit prompt should have defaulted to None for Container and to Left
     for Object. Object is okay, however, you need to change Container to Left
     so that the FoxPro Edit menu is available if the Active Document is run
     when not hosted.

   - The Colors menu is not from the Quick Menu. First, add ALT+C as the
     shortcut keys. Make both the Container and Object Negotiate as Middle for
     Colors.

   - The Program prompt should have defaulted to Middle for Container and to
     Left for Object.

   - The Window prompt should have defaulted to Right for Container and to Left
     for Object.

   - The Help prompt will need to be changed. The prompt should be set to None
     for Container and to Right for Object. Change the Container to Right (so
     it shows up in FoxPro) and to None for Object. The Fruit menu will be
     merged with the Active Document host's Help menu. There can only be one
     menu set to Negotiate Right when the menu is hosted.

   - For the Fruits prompt, set the shortcut keys to ALT+U. Next, change the
     Negotiate options to Right for both the Container and Object.

10. Preview the menu to see how it looks in Visual FoxPro.

11. After previewing the menu, from the System menu, point to Menu and then
  click Generate to create the .mpr file.

12. Build the menu into an Active Document application, like the sample Active
  Document application that can be created using the Microsoft Knowledge Base
  article listed in the REFERENCES section below. Refer to step five in that
  article for information on the program code to include the menu in the
  application. Test the menu prompts when the Active Document application is
  hosted in Internet Explorer.

13. When the Active Document application with the menu is running hosted in
  Internet Explorer, notice what menus are there and which Application they
  come from. The following list should be what is observed:

     File menu:     Internet Explorer
     Edit menu:     Visual FoxPro
     Program menu:  Visual FoxPro
     Window menu:   Visual FoxPro
     Colors:        From the sample menu
     Go:            Internet Explorer
     Favorites:     Internet Explorer
     Help:          Internet Explorer

14. Look at the bottom of the Help menu. There should be a prompt there with a
  submenu. The text of the prompt should be ActiveDoc1 Help. This text can be
  created by setting the Caption property of the ActiveDoc class that is the
  main program in the project. If the sample Active Document application from
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base article is being used, open the project, edit
  the ADTest class and change the caption property (use Fruit as a test).
  Rebuild the application and run it hosted. The menu prompt should now show
  Fruit Help, assuming Fruit is the new caption.

For more information on Active Documents and Menu Negotiation, follow the
instructions below to get into the Active Documents section of the Visual FoxPro
"Programmer's Guide."

Steps to Active Documents Topic
-------------------------------

1. In the MSDN Library for Visual Studio 6.0, open the Visual FoxPro
  Documentation book, and go to the What's New in Visual FoxPro page. The
  Active Documents topic from the "Programmer's Guide" should be the second
  item listed.

2. Click Active Documents to go to the Active Documents section of Chapter 31,
  "Interoperability and the Internet"
