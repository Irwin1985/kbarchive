The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server versions 2.11 and 3.0 or later can operate successfully in the same
subdomain. The SNA Server computer running the oldest version must be installed
as the primary server. Features new to version 4.0 cannot be used until all SNA
Server computers in the subdomain are running at least version 3.0 or later.

Although this article explains how to run different versions of SNA Server within
the same subdomain, when you are upgrading to a new version of SNA Server,
Microsoft recommends implementing an SNA subdomain that contains SNA Server
computers installed with the newer version and then migrating clients to these
new servers. This approach requires additional servers during the transition
period, though it reduces the interoperability issues raised when running SNA
Server computers of different versions within the same subdomain. Back-level SNA
clients are supported through SNA Server 3.0 and 4.0 level servers, though
Microsoft recommends that older clients be upgraded gradually, as time allows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a subdomain contains a combination of SNA Server versions 2.11 and 3.0 or
later, the configuration file of the earlier versions must be used, because the
SNA Server configuration file is not backward compatible. SNA Server 3.0 or
later can read earlier configuration files but cannot update the configuration
file when SNA Server 2.11 is configured as the primary configuration server. To
continue use of version 2.11 servers in the subdomain, SNA Server Manager cannot
be used to perform any configuration tasks. The SNA Server 2.11 Administrator
tool can be used to configure any SNA Server features that were available in
2.11. Features new to versions 3.0 and 4.0 will not be available until the
primary configuration server is running SNA Server version 3.0 or 4.0 and the
configuration file has been upgraded (or resaved using the SNA 4.0 Manager or
Microsoft Management Console).

When all servers are upgraded to version 4.0, the last computer to be upgraded in
the subdomain must be the primary server. The configuration file is upgraded and
then automatically copied to all backup servers in the subdomain. It is
recommended that until all servers are upgraded to version 4.0, the SNA Server
computers running version 4.0 be designated as member servers. Until all servers
are running version 4.0, and the configuration file is upgraded, the services
and features listed below are not available, because they require the version
3.0 or later configuration file.

- The TN3270 service that ships with version 3.0 and later (The TN3270 service
  that ships with version 2.11 will work, though it must be configured with the
  SNA Server 2.11 TN3270 Administration tool.)

- The TN5250 Service (not available with version 2.11)

- Host Print Service

- Shared Folders Gateway

- Host Security Integration

- PU Passthrough support

- SNA session level encryption

- Enhanced security for APPC and LUA LUs
