-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to move or copy a message created with a custom E-form from a public
folder to a folder in your mailbox or a PST file, you may encounter the
following error message in the Exchange Client:

  An item could not be copied. There is not enough memory available to
  perform the operation.


If you perform the same operation in the Outlook Client, you will receive the
following error message:

  Can't copy the items. Could not make another copy of the item. The
  original was either moved or deleted, or access was denied.

As a result of this error, the E-form message that you are trying to move or copy
is not copied or moved to the destination.

CAUSE
=====

The E-form message contains fields that can be multi-propertied. One or more of
these properties is null, which causes the error when you try to move or copy it
to another location.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use version 1461.3 of Store.exe and the following
associated supporting files for Exchange Server 5.0:

  Store.exe 1461.3 (or use 5.0 SP3)
  MDBMSG 1461.3 (or use 5.0 SP3)
  Gapi32.dll 1460.8 (or use 5.0 SP3)

or use version 2138.0 for Exchange Server 5.5.
