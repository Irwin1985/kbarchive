Product(s): Microsoft SNA Server
Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2,4.0
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): 
Last Modified: 02-APR-2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a host printer session in SNA Server Manager, the name of the
printer entered on the Printing tab of the Print Session dialog box may not be
retained after you close the Printing tab or after you save the changes. This
has been observed when adding the printer name of Hewlett-Packard LaserJet (HP
LJ) 4000N, and with the HP8100 series and LexMark Optra printers.

NOTE: This symptom may occur with other types of printers as well.


CAUSE
=====

SNA Server's host print service stores printer setting information in the SNA
Server configuration file (COM.CFG), in the same format that Windows NT uses.
This format has a fixed size part and a variable size part that is printer
dependent. SNA Server reserves 256 bytes for the variable size part. Print
drivers that use more than 256 bytes of data for the variable data overwrite
other information contained in the SNA Server configuration file. In this case,
the printer name is being overwritten; this is the reason it is not retained in
the print session setting.

PCL6 printer drivers exceed the 256-byte limit that is reserved for the variable
printer data by a large margin. Printers using a PCL6 print driver will
experience this problem. Other print drivers may exceed the 256-byte limit as
well.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can use the SNACFG utility to add the printer
session name to the SNA Server configuration.

The command line must be modified to reflect the following parameters:

  "prtsessname" must be replaced with the APPC print session name.
  "svrname" must be replaced with the name of the SNA Server.
  "printername" must be replaced with the name of the print device.
  Note that this can also be a network share name.

Open a command prompt. At the command prompt, enter the following line:

  SNACFG PRINTSESSIONAPPC prtsessname /SERVER:svrname
  DEVICENAME:"printername"

Doing this should correctly add the APPC print session name to the SNA Server
configuration.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0 Service
Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To print to the HP LJ 4000N, you can use other applications running on the
Windows NT Server computer that SNA Server is installed on.

This was resolved by installing the PCL 5E driver for the HPLJ 4000N from the
Hewlett-Packard Web site.
