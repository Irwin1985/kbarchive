SUMMARY
=======

If a Form takes up most of the screen at 640 x 480 (VGA) resolution, it only
takes up a small portion of the screen at 1600 x 1200. Normally, this is exactly
what you want to happen, but some circumstances arise where you want a Form to
retain the same proportional size and position regardless of screen resolution.
This article discusses a simple way to accomplish this for an Single Document
Interface (SDI) application. It does not address special considerations for
Multiple Document Interface (MDI) applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When designing Forms to be resized at run time, keep the following in mind:

- When designing Forms, it is best to design them for the lowest screen
  resolution you expect users to run. Even using the technique outlined here,
  it is best to stay with this rule because Forms resize better going to higher
  resolutions than they do going to lower ones.

- Use TrueType Fonts because they are scalable. Also, try to use Fonts that
  will be available on the user's system. Otherwise, a substituted Font may not
  scale properly.

- Because resizing may not always be exact, especially with Fonts, make the
  controls a little larger than the minimum necessary. Also, try to leave a
  little space between controls.

- Some controls, like CheckBoxes and Option buttons, do not resize, and some
  controls may require special handling. For example, the Height property of
  ComboBoxes is read-only at run-time, but changing the font size adjusts the
  Height. Other controls may not have a FontSize property and need some other
  property set to make FontSize appear correctly.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Change the video resolution to 800 x 600.

2. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add a Label, a CommandButton, and any other types of controls you would like
  to test.

4. Copy the following code into the Form's module:

        Option Explicit

        Dim MyForm As FRMSIZE
        Dim DesignX As Integer
        Dim DesignY As Integer

        Private Sub Form_Load()
        Dim ScaleFactorX As Single, ScaleFactorY As Single  ' Scaling factors
        ' Size of Form in Pixels at design resolution
        DesignX = 800
        DesignY = 600
        RePosForm = True   ' Flag for positioning Form
        DoResize = False   ' Flag for Resize Event
        ' Set up the screen values
        Xtwips = Screen.TwipsPerPixelX
        Ytwips = Screen.TwipsPerPixelY
        Ypixels = Screen.Height / Ytwips ' Y Pixel Resolution
        Xpixels = Screen.Width / Xtwips  ' X Pixel Resolution

        ' Determine scaling factors
        ScaleFactorX = (Xpixels / DesignX)
        ScaleFactorY = (Ypixels / DesignY)
        ScaleMode = 1  ' twips
        'Exit Sub  ' uncomment to see how Form1 looks without resizing
        Resize_For_Resolution ScaleFactorX, ScaleFactorY, Me
        Label1.Caption = "Current resolution is " &amp; Str$(Xpixels) + _
         "  by " + Str$(Ypixels)
        MyForm.Height = Me.Height ' Remember the current size
        MyForm.Width = Me.Width
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Resize()
        Dim ScaleFactorX As Single, ScaleFactorY As Single

        If Not DoResize Then  ' To avoid infinite loop
           DoResize = True
           Exit Sub
        End If

        RePosForm = False
        ScaleFactorX = Me.Width / MyForm.Width   ' How much change?
        ScaleFactorY = Me.Height / MyForm.Height
        Resize_For_Resolution ScaleFactorX, ScaleFactorY, Me
        MyForm.Height = Me.Height ' Remember the current size
        MyForm.Width = Me.Width
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Dim ScaleFactorX As Single, ScaleFactorY As Single

        DesignX = Xpixels
        DesignY = Ypixels
        RePosForm = True
        DoResize = False
        ' Set up the screen values
        Xtwips = Screen.TwipsPerPixelX
        Ytwips = Screen.TwipsPerPixelY
        Ypixels = Screen.Height / Ytwips ' Y Pixel Resolution
        Xpixels = Screen.Width / Xtwips  ' X Pixel Resolution

        ' Determine scaling factors
        ScaleFactorX = (Xpixels / DesignX)
        ScaleFactorY = (Ypixels / DesignY)
        Resize_For_Resolution ScaleFactorX, ScaleFactorY, Me
        Label1.Caption = "Current resolution is " &amp; Str$(Xpixels) + _
         "  by " + Str$(Ypixels)
        MyForm.Height = Me.Height ' Remember the current size
        MyForm.Width = Me.Width
        End Sub

5. Add a Module from the Project menu and paste in the following code:

        Public Xtwips As Integer, Ytwips As Integer
        Public Xpixels As Integer, Ypixels As Integer

        Type FRMSIZE
           Height As Long
           Width As Long
        End Type

        Public RePosForm As Boolean
        Public DoResize As Boolean

        Sub Resize_For_Resolution(ByVal SFX As Single, _
         ByVal SFY As Single, MyForm As Form)
        Dim I As Integer
        Dim SFFont As Single

        SFFont = (SFX + SFY) / 2  ' average scale
        ' Size the Controls for the new resolution
        On Error Resume Next  ' for read-only or nonexistent properties
        With MyForm
          For I = 0 To .Count - 1
           If TypeOf .Controls(I) Is ComboBox Then   ' cannot change Height
             .Controls(I).Left = .Controls(I).Left * SFX
             .Controls(I).Top = .Controls(I).Top * SFY
             .Controls(I).Width = .Controls(I).Width * SFX
           Else
             .Controls(I).Move .Controls(I).Left * SFX, _
              .Controls(I).Top * SFY, _
              .Controls(I).Width * SFX, _
              .Controls(I).Height * SFY
           End If
             ' Be sure to resize and reposition before changing the FontSize
             .Controls(I).FontSize = .Controls(I).FontSize * SFFont
          Next I
          If RePosForm Then
            ' Now size the Form
            .Move .Left * SFX, .Top * SFY, .Width * SFX, .Height * SFY
          End If
        End With
        End Sub

Try running this under different screen resolutions and the Form should take up
the same desktop area and retain its look and screen position. You may notice
that your design resizes better when changing to a higher resolution than it
does when changing to a lower one. You can also use the Mouse to Resize the Form
and it will re-scale automatically. Finally, if you change video resolution
while the Form is open, you can click on Command1 and it adjusts for the new
resolution.
