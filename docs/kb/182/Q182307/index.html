-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Some messages with attachments sent by the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service
may be encoded with Quoted-Printable encoding. If the message is received by an
older MIME-compliant client, the attachment may be shown as corrupted text.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server 4.0 uses Base64 encoding; Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 Internet
Mail Service use Quoted-Printable encoding for text attachments. Because many
older POP3 clients are still not Quoted-Printable aware, they may fail to decode
the attachment properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

- Install the provided hotfix and add the registry key shown below.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe as appropriate for your
  version of Windows NT).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Service\MSExchangeIS
     \ParametersSystem\InternetContent

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

     Value Name: ForceBase64
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
     Value:      0x1

4. Exit Registry Editor.
