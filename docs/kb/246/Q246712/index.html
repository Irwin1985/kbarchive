SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set the time interval for the Timer event in the Microsoft
Exchange Server Event Scripting Agent (and the time event in the Routing Object)
from the Agent Schedule dialog box, you can only set the time to be a multiple
of 15 minutes, such as 0, 15, 30, and so on.

You can programmatically set the time interval to anything you want. However, it
might take the event longer to fire than the setting you specify. For example,
if you set it to fire every 20 minutes, the event would actually be fired in 30
minutes.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server Event Scripting Agent and the Routing Engine are built on
the Exchange Event Service. The Event Service is implemented as a Microsoft
Windows NT service that receives notifications from server-based folders about
the state of folder items. The Event Service fires events when an item is added,
changed, or deleted in a folder. The Event Service also periodically checks
whether Timer events have come due and fires them. The interval between checks
is 15 minutes.

This means that a Timer event that is set to wait a number of minutes that is not
a multiple of 15 (for instance, 20) must wait until the end of the next 15
minute interval (in this case, 30 minutes) before it fires.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set Timer events to fire on multiples of 15 minutes.
