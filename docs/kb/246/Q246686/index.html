In this instance, SAP is the name of a company (Systemanalyse und
Programmentwicklung or Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing)
and not an acronym for Service Advertising Protocol.


Page 32: Figure 2-1 Corrections
-------------------------------

Client Components:

"SQL-DMO" is based on ODBC and belongs in the Open Interfaces box next to "RDO
OLE DB for ODBC."

"First is domain integrity."

To:
"First is entity integrity."

On page 39, first paragraph, last sentence, change:
"Domain integrity is enforced for a table by making sure that it has a primary
key."

To:
"Entity integrity is enforced for a table by making sure that it has a primary
key."


Page 56: SQL-DMO Clarification
------------------------------

On page 56, in the second paragraph, insert the following author comment.

"SQL-DMO is more than a set of Automation interfaces, as the paragraph suggests.
It is a dual interface COM component, providing both Custom and Automation
interfaces."


Page 57: Remove Database.Dump From Table 2-1
--------------------------------------------

On page 57, in Table 2-1, Remove the "Database.Dump" Object.Method and the
corresponding Action.

size."


Page 185: Typo In Note
----------------------

On page 185, in the second sentence, in the note, "test" should be "testdb".

Change:
"The Enterprise Manager will give the data file the logical name of testdb_Data
(instead of just test)..."

To:
"The Enterprise Manager will give the data file the logical name of testdb_Data
(instead of just testdb)..."


Pages 195 &amp; 196: Error In Filename Extensions In Example
--------------------------------------------------------

On pages 195 &amp; 196, in the FILEGROUP CREATION Example, all of the data file
names in the example use .mdf as their filename extension. Only the first one
should use .mdf. The rest, except for the last one (..\saleslog.ldf) should use
.ndf.


Page 197: Corrections To Bullet
-------------------------------

On page 197, the third white bullet, NAME should be FILENAME.

Change:
"Change the NAME property for files only in the tempdb database; this change
doesn't go into effect until you stop and restart SQL Server."

To:
"Change the FILENAME property for files only in the tempdb database; this change
doesn?t go into effect until you stop and restart SQL Server.

Changing the FILENAME can be used to move the files to a new physical location.
(Note that there is no supported way to change the logical name of any file.)"


Pages 199-200: Change Spt_ To Sys
---------------------------------

On page 199, in the last sentence, "spt_" should be "sys".

Change:
"All these system objects, in both the master and user databases, have names that
begin with spt_."

To:
"All these system objects, in both the master and user databases, have names that
begin with sys."


Pages 201 &amp; 202: Corrections TO GAM Bit Settings
------------------------------------------------

On page 201, the third bullet, in the last sentence:

Change:
"If the bit is 1, the corresponding extent is in use; if the bit is 0, the extent
is free."

To:
"If the bit is 0, the corresponding extent is in use; if the bit is 1, the extent
is free."

Page 202, change the table at the top of the page to:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Current Use of Extent                | GAM Bit Setting | SGAM Bit Setting | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Free, not in use                     | 1               | 0                | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Uniform extent, or full mixed extent | 0               | 0                | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Mixed extent with free pages         | 0               | 1                | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Page 205: Dbo Use Only Option Correction
----------------------------------------

On page 205, in the "dbo use only" database option description, the first
sentence needs the following modifications.

Change:
"When TRUE, this option prevents all users except the database owner from
subsequently using the database."

To:
"When TRUE, this option prevents all users except the database owner and members
of the db_owner role from subsequently using the database."


Page 209: Note Correction
-------------------------

On page 209, in the Note, revise the first sentence as follows.

Change:
"The only options that you can set for the master database are autoclose, torn
page detection, and trunc. log on chkpt."

To:
"The only option you can set for the master database is the trunc. log on chkpt.
option."


Page 215: Text Addition
-----------------------

On page 215, in the second sentence, add db_ddladmin.

Change:
"...but anyone with the sysadmin or db_owner role can create a table owned by
another use."

To:
"...but anyone with the sysadmin, db_ddladmin, or db_owner role can create a
table owned by another use."


Page 221: Table 6-1 Clarification
---------------------------------

Binary and varbinary datatypes can both store up to 8000 bytes.


Page 222: Change Bits To Bytes
------------------------------

On page 222, in the second paragraph, in the first sentence change bits to
bytes.

Change:
"...because the last six bits..."

To:
"...because the last six bytes..."


Page 228: Typo In Warning
-------------------------

On page 228, under "Warning", in the last sentence:

Change:
"We can't overemphasize that you're best bet for avoiding confusion..."

To:
"We can't overemphasize that your best bet for avoiding confusion..."


Page 231: Maximum Size Of A Single Data Row Correction
------------------------------------------------------

On page 231, in the third paragraph, in the second sentence change maximum size
of a single data row to 8060.

Change:
"The maximum size of a single data row is 8096 bytes."

To:
"The maximum size of a single data row is 8060 bytes."

Although SQL Server 7.0 does leave 8096 bytes on a data page for data and row
offsets, the maximum size of a single row is only 8060 bytes. The choice of an
upper limit was somewhat arbitrary. There are some things designed into the row
format, not yet exposed, which will cause the overhead of a row to grow in
future releases if the developers end up using them. They would like to have
your existing rows still fit even if extra space is needed for overhead in the
future. So, they chose 8060 bytes as a reasonable upper limit.


Page 231: Text Corrections
--------------------------

On page 231, revise the first sentence as follows.

Change:
"Data pages are the structures that contain all of a table's nontext and image
data."

To:
"Data pages are the structures that contain all of a table's data that is not
text or not an image."

Also, on page 231, in the third paragraph, revise the third sentence as follows.

Change:
"...(except for nontext and image columns, which are stored in their own separate
pages)."

To:
"...(except for text or image columns, which are stored in their own separate
pages)."


Page 238: Table 6-4 Correction
------------------------------

On page 238, Table 6-4, Information column, in the text following NULL bitmap
entry, change "byte" to "bit".

Change:
"(1 byte for each column in table; a 1 indicates that the corresponding column is
NULL)"

To:
"(1 bit for each column in table; a 1 indicates that the corresponding column is
NULL)"


Page 249: Paragraph Rewritten
-----------------------------

Page 249, replace the last full paragraph with the following text.

"The DROP_EXISTING option specifies that a given index should be dropped and
rebuilt as a single transaction, and is particularly useful in the case of
rebuilding clustered indexes. Because nonclustered indexes must go through the
clustered index to gain access to rows in a table, the DROP_EXISTING option
prevents the nonclustered indexes from having to be rebuilt twice. Normally,
when a clustered index is dropped, every nonclustered index has to be rebuilt to
change its bookmarks to RIDs, instead of the clustering keys. Then, if a
clustered index is built (or rebuilt), all the nonclustered indexes need to be
rebuilt again to update the bookmarks. The DROP_EXISTING option to the CREATE
INDEX command allows a clustered index to be rebuilt without having to rebuild
the nonclustered indexes twice. If you are creating the index on the exact same
keys it had previously, the nonclustered indexes do not need to be rebuilt at
all. If you are changing the key definition, the nonclustered indexes are only
rebuilt once, after the clustered index is rebuilt."


Page 255: DBCC Command Misspelled
---------------------------------

On page 255, in the second paragraph, the second sentence contains a misspelled
command.

Change:
"If this happens, you can use the DBCC CHECKINDENT command..."

To:
"If this happens, you can use the DBCC CHECKIDENT command..."


Page 258: Delete Text
---------------------

On page 258, in the first paragraph, delete the second to last sentence.

"A table-level constraint must always be named by its creator."

Also on page 258, in the first paragraph, in the last sentence delete
"column-level".

Change:
"...it's probably wise to explicitly name column-level constraints so that the
same name will be used on all servers."

To:
"...it's probably wise to explicitly name constraints so that the same name will
be used on all servers."


Page 273: Text Correction
-------------------------

On page 273, under the CASCADE bullet:

Change:
"A delete of all matching rows in the referenced table occurs."

To:
"A delete of all matching rows in the referencing table occurs."


Page 278: Typo In Code
----------------------

Change:

  ALTER TABLE employee  
  add department_no int CHECK (department_no &lt; 100 AND department_no &gt; 100)

To:

  ALTER TABLE employee  
  add department_no int CHECK (department_no &lt; 0 AND department_no &gt; 100)

Change:
"If the modified column participates in an index, the only type changes that are
allowed are increasing the length of a variable length type, changing
nullability of the column (for example, VARCHAR(10) to VARCHAR(20)), or both."

To:
"If the modified column participates in an index, the only type changes that are
allowed are increasing the length of a variable length type (for example,
VARCHAR(10) to VARCHAR(20)), changing nullability of the column, or both."


Page 294: Reword Paragraph For Clarity
--------------------------------------

On page 294, change the second to last paragraph to:

"You need to be aware when using ALTER TABLE to drop constraints that dropping a
PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint will automatically drop the associated index.
In fact, the only way to drop those indexes is by altering the table to remove
the constraint."


Page 295: Text Of Bullet Reworded
---------------------------------

On page 295, reword the fifth bullet.

Change:
"A column bound to a rule, accomplished via the following syntax:"

To:
"A column to which a rule is bound. Dropping a column is accomplished by using
the following syntax:"
