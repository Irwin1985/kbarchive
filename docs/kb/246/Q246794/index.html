-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An invokable APPC or CPI-C application may fail intermittently. When the failure
occurs, an event similar to the following is logged in the Windows NT
application log on the SNA Server computer:

  Event ID: 60
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: Failed to invoke APPC TP &lt;TP Name&gt;, sense data = 084C0000

  Note: X'084C0000' is an IBM Sense Code that indicates
  AP_TRANS_PGM_NOT_AVAIL_NO_RETRY.

This problem occurs when an instance of the APPC or CPI-C application stops
unexpectedly. In addition, this is most likely to occur if the application
issues RECEIVE_ALLOCATE() calls for multiple Transaction Programs (TPs).

If another instance of the application is started after the first one stops, the
effect is likely to be that host requests to invoke the application alternates
between successful execution and failure.

Note: Event 60s are general errors that are logged when an invokable APPC/CPI-C
TP cannot be invoked. Therefore, they result for reasons not related to the
problem described here.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server DMOD fails to mark all TPs registered by a process (for example
APPC or CPI-C application) as inactive when the process stops abnormally. SNA
Server may route host ATTACH requests to the TPs that are still marked as
active, which results in the problem described above.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0:

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+----------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time   | 
+----------------------------------+
| Snadmod.dll  | 11/22/99 | 2:40PM | 
+----------------------------------+
| Snashmem.exe | 11/22/99 | 2:41PM | 
+----------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



SNA Server 4.0:

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0 (all SPs), 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the update, the DMOD searches the service table to locate all
TPs that were registered by the process using the Process ID (PID) of the
stopped process to ensure that all of the TPs used by that process are marked as
no longer in use.

The Snashmem.exe tool used to view an SNA Server or Client service table has also
been updated to include the PID and process header information for each service
table entry. To see the new information shown by Snashmem.exe, perform the
following steps:

1. Start a command prompt and set the window with the following screen
  attributes so that the Snashmem.exe utility display does not scroll:

   - Screen window size: Width = 80, Height = 50

   - Font selection: Font = Raster Fonts, Size = 6x8

2. Choose OK.

3. Maximize the command prompt window.

4. Run Snashmem.exe to display its main screen.

5. Press S to look at the service table summary.

6. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the pointer to a service table entry.
  Note: The N and P keys are used to move to the next and previous pages,
  because the service table contains 1022 entries.

7. After you select a specific entry, press E to expand the option and show the
  details for the service table entry.

8. The following is an example of the new fields that show the PID and process
  header:

  shr-&gt;svce[2].srv.Bm.pProcessHdr = 564
  shr-&gt;svce[2].srv.Bm.Pid = 129
  shr-&gt;svce[2].srv.NPd.pProcessHdr = 564
  shr-&gt;svce[2].srv.NPd.Pid = 129
