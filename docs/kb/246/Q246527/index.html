NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



Before applying this hotfix, you may need to temporarily disable Windows
Networking Logon Discovery in your environment. This is required if your site
hierarchy consists of multiple SMS sites residing within a common Windows NT
domain. For additional information about this process, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q238780 Best Practices for Applying Systems Management Server 2.0 SP1

If you have previously specified a senior site for Windows NT Logon Point
Management, be sure to first back up your existing Senior.lst file and restore
it when the upgrade is complete. For additional information, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q235726 SMS: Specifying Senior Site for WinNT Logon Point Management

Consider applying the fix described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article in conjunction with this client hotfix bundle:

  Q246040 SMS: How to Configure the Client Verify Cycle

This Client Resource Kit utility is now available and allows you to reduce SMS
client-generated network traffic.

Client Hotfix Bundle Installation
---------------------------------

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method to apply the Client Bundle hotfix to I386-based
central, primary, and secondary site servers. The highest site server in your
SMS hierarchy should be upgraded first (for example, upgrade your central site
server first, followed by your primary site servers, and then your secondary
site servers). As with any upgrade, Microsoft recommends that you test this in a
lab environment prior to applying it to your production environment. The
Q246527_i386.exe hotfix download file is a 40-MB self extracting .exe file. When
you extract the files and subdirectories from this .exe file, make sure that you
retain the I386 and Alpha subdirectories. These subdirectories contain the
hotfix source files. The Q246527.exe file is an SMS Installer script that
applies the source files from the I386 subdirectory to update your site server.

1. Log on locally to your site server using an account with local administrative
  privileges.

2. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console. Manually stop the
  SMS_Site_Component_Manager and SMS_Executive services.

3. Run the Q246527.exe SMS Installer script and follow the wizard prompts.

4. After you run the installer script, check the Q246527.log file in your
  Sms\Logs folder to verify that the files are successfully installed to the
  site server. The SMS services are restarted as part of the Q246527.exe
  installation script process. You need to stop the SMS_Site_Component_Manager
  and SMS_Executive services again before you continue to the next step.

5. From the SMS primary site database server, use either the SQL Server 7.0
  Query Analyzer or SQL 6.5 ISQL/W tool to open the 54831.sql script file (this
  file is located in your I386 hotfix subdirectory).

6. Select the SMS database from within the SQL Server query tool and run the
  script. If you use a common SQL Server computer for multiple primary site
  databases, apply this script to the site database that belongs to the primary
  site you are currently upgrading.

7. Restart the SMS_Site_Component_Manager and SMS_Executive services. The hotfix
  files are automatically replicated out to all logon points and Client Access
  Points (CAPs) for clients to access.

8. After you finish the upgrade of your central and primary sites, you can then
  upgrade your secondary sites using any of the following methods:

   - Manually apply the hotfix using the same steps described above for your
     central/primary site servers, except you do not have to run the
     Q246527.sql script against any database (there is none).

   - Apply this client bundle unattended by creating a package for the client
     bundle and sending a mandatory advertisement (local Administrator context
     required) to your secondary site servers. View your Q246527.log file
     afterwards.

   - Advertise your package to the site servers using a non-mandatory
     assignment. Use Remote Control to manually perform the update when you are
     ready.

   - If you have the necessary network bandwidth between sites, perform an
     "Upgrade Secondary Sites" from your SMS Administrator Console by
     right-clicking the parent site of your secondary sites, clicking All
     Tasks, clicking Upgrade Secondary Sites, and then completing the Upgrade
     Secondary Sites Wizard.

9. After you upgrade your site servers, it can take up to 23 hours before your
  client computers perform their CCIM32 Client Configuration Information
  Manager polling cycle to receive their SMS component upgrades.

  NOTE: The following steps are necessary only if you have previously applied
  Q240921 to your environment. Use the following steps only after all client
  computers have been upgraded:

  a. Manually edit the Compver.ini file located in the
     Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder.

  b. Change the component version from .00.1380.2004 to 2.00.1380.1072.

  c. Save the changes.

WARNING: Editing the Compver.ini file incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may orphan your clients or cause them to become out of synchronization with the
site. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrectly
changing this file can be resolved. Use this step only if you have the specific
component version problem described above.

Method 2: Manual Installation:

NOTE: You can use this method for both I386-based and Alpha-based site servers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local subfolder on your site server or
  to a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required and
  must also be downloaded from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep
  the directory structure intact. The Q246527.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server and can only
  be run on I386-based machines. Please refer to installation Method 1 in this
  article for information about how to use the Q246527.exe file.

2. Close the Systems Management Server Administrator console and stop all
  Systems Management Server services from within Control Panel. If the
  SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop that as well.

3. Copy the following files from the hotfix I386 folder into the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Bin\I386 folder:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Bindcli9.dll
  Bindclin.dll
  Bindsvrn.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Falclin.dll
  Mslmcli9.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Mslmsvrn.dll
  Ndscli9.dll
  Ndsclin.dll
  Ndssvrn.dll
  Odpsys32.exe
  Odpusr32.exe
  Sinv32.exe
  Smsapm32.exe

4. If Alpha-based support is enabled on the primary site, copy the following
  files from the hotfix Alpha folder into the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Bin\Alpha
  folder:

12. WARNING: Editing the Compver.ini file incorrectly can cause serious problems
  that may orphan your clients or cause them to become out of synchronization
  with the site. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
  incorrect use of the following step can be resolved. Use this step only if
  you have the specific component version problem described below.

  If your current Systems Management Server Client Base Component version is in
  the 1000 range (for example, 2.00.1380.10&lt;xx&gt;), replace the
  Compver.ini file in the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder
  with the Compver1072.ini file that is located in the hotfix bundle source
  folder after renaming this file to Compver.ini.

13. If your current Systems Management Server Client Base Component version is
  in the 2000 range (for example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;), replace the
  Compver.ini file in the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder
  with the Compver2.ini file located in the hotfix bundle source folder. Note
  that you must rename the Compver2.ini file to Compver.ini.

14. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder with the
  Compver1110.ini file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after
  renaming this file to Compver.ini.

15. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Hinv folder with the Compver1054.ini
  file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this file to
  Compver.ini.

16. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Sinv folder with the Compver1070.ini
  file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this file to
  Compver.ini.

17. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Swdist folder with the Compver1110.ini
  file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this file to
  Compver.ini.

18. From the Systems Management Server site database server, use a SQL Server
  query tool (for example, Query Analyzer or ISQL/W) to open the 54831.sql
  script file. This file is located in the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; folder
  within the hotfix subfolder you created in step 1.

19. Select the Systems Management Server database from within the SQL Server
  query tool and run the script. If you are using a common SQL Server computer
  for multiple site databases, apply this script to the site database
  belonging to the primary site you are updating.

20. Restart the Systems Management Server Site services. The new files are
  replicated to all logon points and CAPs. After all logon points and CAPs are
  updated, allow an additional 23 hours for clients to begin their update
  polling cycle.

21. Only continue with this step after all clients are installed. This step is
  necessary only if the early revision of the hotfix for Q240921 was
  previously applied and your Systems Management Server Client Base Component
  version is in the 2000 range (for example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;). Manually
  reset the component version in the Compver.ini file located in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder. Change the component
  version from 2.00.1380.2004 to 2.00.1380.1072).
