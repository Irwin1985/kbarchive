SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use Performance Monitor and the Datalog.exe file
that is included with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit to log data and
generate alerts on a remote computer without having to log on to it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To log data and generate alerts on a remote computer without having to log on to
it, follow these steps:

NOTE: In the following steps, replace &lt;remotecomputer&gt; with the name of the
computer that you want to monitor.

1. Install the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit on the remote computer.

2. At the local computer, use Windows NT Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe) to
  create a workspace file:

  a. Start Performance Monitor, and then click Log on the View menu.

  b. Add the relevant counters, specifying all objects you want to log and the
     alerts you want to generate.

  c. On the Options menu, click Log.

  d. In the File Name box, specify a name for the log file using the .log
     extension.

  e. Click one of the logging interval options, and then click Save to save the
     logging options.

  f. On the File menu, click Save Workspace.

  g. In the File Name box, type a workspace file name using the .pmw extension,
     and then click Save.

  h. Quit Performance Monitor.

3. Copy both the workspace file you just created and the Datalog.exe file
  included with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit to the %SystemRoot%\System32
  folder on the remote computer.

4. At the local computer, set up the Data Logging service for the remote
  computer:

  a. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

  monitor \\remotecomputer setup

     NOTE: This command registers the service with Windows NT Server 4.0. You
     need to run the command only once for each computer you want to monitor.
     If you receive the following error message

  Failed to create Service

     it means that you have already run the command once.

  b. To use the workspace file for logging, type the following command, and
     then press ENTER:

  monitor \\remotecomputer filename

     where filename is the name of the workspace file you copied to the remote
     computer.

5. To start the monitoring process, type the following command, and then press
  ENTER:

  monitor \\remotecomputer start

6. To stop the monitoring process, type the following command, and then press
  ENTER:

  monitor \\remotecomputer stop

  After you stop the monitoring process, you can view the log file in
  Performance Monitor. For instructions about how to do this, see Help in
  Performance Monitor.

  Also, you can use the Schedule service and the AT command to schedule
  monitoring to occur at a set time. For example, if a server slows down
  noticeably between 2:40 A.M. and 2:50 A.M. every weeknight, you can log the
  data for that period without being physically present by typing the following
  AT commands:

  at \\remotecomputer 2:30 /every:m,t,w,th,f monitor start
  at \\remotecomputer 3:00 /every:m,t,w,th,f monitor stop

  If you want to be reminded about the log, type the following command, and then
  press ENTER:

  at \\remotecomputer 3:00 /every:f net send yourusername 'The Monitor is
  stopped. The log contains data for this week!'
