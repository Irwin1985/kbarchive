-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you apply an Exchange Server 5.5 service pack, error messages may be
displayed that state that the following files are in use and cannot be updated:

- Gwperf.dll

- Imsperf.dll

- Mdbperf.dll

- Mseperf.dll

- Mtaperf.dll

- Eseperf.dll

- Edbbcli.dll

When you attempt to start the services after you finish the service pack
installation, the directory information store does not start and generates the
following error message:

  Entry Point Not Valid.

CAUSE
=====

All of the *perf.dll files listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article are
Performance Monitor support dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). This problem can
occur because the Exchange Server service pack installer determines if these
DLLs have been opened by a process, but the installer does not determine if the
files are locked. The service pack installer generates a message that prompts
you with three choices: Ignore, Retry, or Abort. If you select Ignore, the file
versions of these DLLs and the new service pack executable files (Dsamain.exe,
Store.exe, and so on) are copied to the server, which creates a mismatch in the
version numbers of DLLs and .exe files. The Dsamain service does not start and
the following error message is generated:

  Entry Point Not Valid.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Stop all of the unnecessary services on the server, as well as any local or
  remote copies of Performance Monitor that may be running against the server.
  If the Edbbcli.dll file is listed as a file that cannot be updated in the
  error message that is displayed, make sure that no backup software is loaded
  or running, and also make sure that no backup agents are running on the
  server. Edbbcli is the Exchange Server database backup client that allows for
  online backups of the Exchange Server database.

2. Run the service pack update again. There is a delay of several minutes while
  the Directory service attempts to start. The Directory service cannot start
  and the following error message is displayed:

  The service did not respond to the control function.

  Click OK, and then continue with the service pack installation.

3. When an error message is displayed that lists the files that were skipped in
  the original service pack installation (*perf.dll), do not click Ignore,
  Retry, or Abort. With the service pack installation still running, press
  CTRL+ESC, and then start Windows Explorer. Go to the DLL that cannot be
  updated (typically the path to the file is either Exchsrvr\Bin or
  Winnt\System32) and rename the *perf.dll file to *perf.old.

4. Minimize Windows Explorer, and then click Retry in the service pack
  installation. You need to repeat this process for each DLL that is displayed
  in an error message during the service pack installation.

After you finish these installation steps, run the service pack installation
again and make sure that it finishes without error messages to make sure that
the service pack has been applied correctly.
