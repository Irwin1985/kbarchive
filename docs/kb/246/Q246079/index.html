SYMPTOMS
========

The Isinteg utility continually loops around certain folders in the information
store if you run it by using the following command line:

  isinteg -pri -fix -detailed -verbose -l isinteg.log -test folder

The following is a sample log file:

  Microsoft Exchange Information Store Integrity Checker v5.5.2448.0
  Copyright (c) 1986-1997 Microsoft Corp. All rights reserved.
  Started: 09/15/98 14:27:46
  Server name: SERVER1
  Store path: e:\EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA\PRIV.EDB
  Store size: 11795439616 bytes
  Output log: isinteg.log
  Check mode: check and fix
  Options: -pri -fix -detailed -verbose -l isinteg.log -test folder

  Starting test 1 of 3, 'reference table construction'
  Finished reference table construction. Time: 0h:0m:3s
  Starting test 2 of 3, 'Folder'
  Warning: MsgFolder 56 (Fid=0001-00000000A333, Mid=0001-000001A156D9,
  Inid=0001-000001BA5241): Prop ptagSiteID(67F80102) was not found in the
  ptagMsgPropList.
  Warning: MsgFolder 66 (Fid=0001-00000000A676, Mid=0001-0000018A9B31,
  Inid=0035-00000228EA45): Prop ptagSiteID(67F80102) was not found in the
  ptagMsgPropList.

The log continues until it reaches the following point:

  Warning: MsgFolder 128 (Fid=0001-0000000A617D, Mid=0001-0000019F533A,
  Inid=0035-000002582304): Prop ptagSiteID(67F80102) was not found in the
  ptagMsgPropList.
  Warning: Folder 1317 (Fid=0001-0000000A6703) "Inbox": RootFid is corrupted
  beyond redemption.
  Fix: Folder 1317 (Fid=0001-0000000A6703) "Inbox": Fixed The invalid entry in
  ptagRootFid with correct value.
  Error: Folder 1317 (Fid=0001-0000000A6703) "Inbox": Error
  ecNotFound-MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND processing this folder

At this point, the Isinteg utility returns to the first folder and starts again.
This looping continues until the log file consumes all of the available disk
space, at which point the Isinteg utility finally stops.

CAUSE
=====

The Isinteg utility cannot remove orphaned folders (folders that don't have a
parent or root folder associated with them), so the utility returns to the
beginning of the folders list. In the sample in the "Symptoms" section of this
article, the folder with the ID of 0001-0000000A6703 does not have a parent or
root folder associated with it, so it is orphaned, and triggers this looping
behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Knowledge Base:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q244976 XADM: Event ID 1197 and 1005 When Starting the Information Store

After the you apply the fix, if you run the new version of the Isinteg utility
against the information store, the utility logs the following information:

  Warning: Folder 1317 (Fid=0001-0000000A6703) "Inbox": RootFid is corrupted
  beyond redemption.
  Fix: Folder 1317 (Fid=0001-0000000A6703) "Inbox": Fixed The invalid entry in
  ptagRootFid with correct value.
  Fix: Folder 1317 (Fid=0001-0000000A6703) "Inbox": Removed the folder hierarchy
  rooted at this from the database because the Root does not exist.

After all of the folders have been checked, the Isinteg utility finishes
successfully.
