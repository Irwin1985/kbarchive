The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If your password-protected screen saver file is missing, the workstation is not
locked when the screen saver time-out occurs.

After the screen saver time-out occurs, the logoff message is ignored if you try
to log off.

If you press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, the Windows Security dialog box is not displayed.
Instead, the Unlock Workstation dialog box appears. You can then log on in order
to log off.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Unlock Workstation dialog box is not activated
if the specified screen saver file is missing.
