-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you process improperly formatted or corrupted .svf files, the Offer Status
Summarizer may show critical when viewed in site status. In addition,
advertisement status is no longer updated.

CAUSE
=====

Advertised Program Manager (APM) is responsible for generating .svf files for
status reporting at the site. In some cases, .svf files that contain corrupted
offer ID information may be written. When an .svf file is moved to the site
server and processed by the Offer Status Summarizer, the corrupted information
is inserted in the OfferStatusSummary table within the site database. If you
view this table, it contains corrupted data. The table itself is not corrupted,
but it contains invalid data that was inserted from the corrupted .svf file(s).
This invalid data is usually limited to the Offer ID column.

Typically, this problem does not exist until the Offer Status Summarizer attempts
to process an .svf file that contains an apostrophe and other characters (for
example, the word don't or any phrase or string of characters that contain an
apostrophe) in place of correct Offer ID information. In this case, the
apostrophe is read as a quotation mark when SQL Server tries to load this
information into the OfferStatusSummary table. This results in the following
error message in the Offersum.log file:

  Microsoft SQL Server reported SQL message 105, severity 15: Unclosed
  quotation mark before the character string ' ,1,1,0,1,0,0,0'.
  Microsoft SQL Server reported SQL message 170, severity 15: Line 1: Incorrect
  syntax near Nor

NOTE: The Offersum.log is generated only if logging is enabled for the Offer
Status Summarizer component.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, either configure a status message filter so these
error messages are not displayed, or clean up the database of invalid
information and identify the client computers that are generating these
corrupted .svf files.

NOTE: The downside of simply configuring a status message filter is that .svf
files continue to build up and status information is not updated.

To clean up the OfferStatusSummary table, you must use either ISQL/w (SQL Server
6.5) or SQL Query Analyzer (SQL Server 7.0) to perform queries against the SMS
database. Before you continue, make sure you have a current dump of the SMS
database.

Stop the SMS Inbox Manager (component of the Executive) and the SMS Site
Component Manager. Clean up the database using the following queries.

Queries to identify corruption in SQL tables:

  select * from OfferStatusSummary os
  ,OfferStatusSummaryDetail od WHERE
  od.OfferStatusSummaryID = os.OfferStatusSummaryID
  select * FROM
  OfferStatusSummary os
  ,OfferStatusSummaryDetail od
  WHERE
  od.OfferStatusSummaryID = os.OfferStatusSummaryID
  AND
  OfferID not like "[A-Z]%"
  AND
  OfferID not like "[0-9]%"

SQL queries to delete corrupted information while preserving site specific
entries.

NOTE: Replace &lt;xxx&gt; in the following examples with the site code of your
specific site.

  DELETE OfferStatusSummaryDetail
  FROM
  OfferStatusSummary os
  ,OfferStatusSummaryDetail od
  WHERE
  od.OfferStatusSummaryID = os.OfferStatusSummaryID
  AND
  OfferID not like "&lt;xxx&gt;%"

  DELETE OfferStatusSummary
  WHERE
  OfferID not like "&lt;xxx&gt;%"

Invalid data may be spread throughout the OfferStatusSummary table in such a
manner as to require purging all data from this table. In this case, run the
following queries against the SMS database:

  DELETE OfferStatusSummaryDetail
  FROM
  OfferStatusSummary os
  ,OfferStatusSummaryDetail od
  WHERE
  od.OfferStatusSummaryID = os.OfferStatusSummaryID

  DELETE OfferStatusSummary

While the services are stopped, move all .svf files to a temporary folder and
restart the SMS Inbox Manager service (component of the Executive). The log
should be free of error messages at this point.

NOTE: You must have logging enabled for the Offer Status Summarizer component to
confirm no more error messages are being written to this log.

As new .svf files flow into the Offersum.box folder, monitor the database using
SQL to determine when incorrect data is again written to the OfferStatusSummary
table. At that point, stop the SMS Inbox Manager and examine the .svf files to
determine which client computer generated the corrupted .svf file. Uninstall and
reinstall the client software on the computer that is identified and continue
the process to monitor for corruption. Reinstall the identified clients until
corruption is no longer noted. During this process, keep a record of the client
computers that have generated bad .svf files.

After you are finished, search all .svf files that were initially moved out of
the OfferSum.Box folder to identify those that may have been written by
malfunctioning client computers. After you have identified the .svf files,
delete them and move the remaining .svf files back to the OfferSum.Box file for
processing.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Manual Installation Instructions:

1. Close the Systems Management Server Administrator console and stop the
  Systems Management Server Site Component Manager and Systems Management
  Server Executive services.

2. Replace the Offersum.dll file in the
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\Bin\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version
  obtained from the update.

3. Replace the Srvmsgs.dll file in the
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\Bin\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version
  obtained from the update.

4. If the site server is a primary site server, replace the Srvmsgs.dll file in
  the &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\Bin\&lt;platform&gt;\00000409 folder with the
  version obtained from the update.

5. Run the 59090.sql script on the SQL Server computer (use ISQL/w or SQL Query
  Analyzer) to clean corrupted data from the OfferStatusSummary table.

6. Restart the Systems Management Server Site Component Manager and Systems
  Management Server Executive services.
