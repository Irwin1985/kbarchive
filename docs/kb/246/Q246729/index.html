-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Server spooler process may generate "Access violation" error
messages and stop responding (hang) intermittently. When this occurs, an error
message may be displayed, indicating that the print job was not finished
successfully because the printer is out of paper or another hardware problem has
occurred.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur with a print job with a long name. If the print job name
is longer than 200 bytes and the printer also has a hardware problem, the
spooler service may not generate an error message. This behavior can occur even
if you are logged on locally.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior, apply the Service Pack 6 Terminal Edition fix, which
is included in the security patch on the following web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-047.asp

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

- Do not print jobs with very long names.

- Keep the printer online and add paper.
