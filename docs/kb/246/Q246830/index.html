IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server is unable to locate the Invokable Auto-started TP in the SNA
Server Subdomain, an event ID 60 occurs in the Application Event Viewer. For
example:

  Event ID: 60
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: Failed to invoke APPC TP (HEX TP NAME) (ASCII TP NAME), local LU
  = (Local APPC LU), sense data = 84c0000

  Event ID: 730
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: The SNA Server was unable to locate an invokable TP (Name), APPC
  LU Alias (Local APPC LU), Workstation name: (null).

This Invokable TP is written as a service and is started by the Service Control
Manager under Windows NT. The SNA Server service attempts to locate the service
by the TP Name included in the ALLOCATE received from the Host or AS/400. When
the status of the TP service is verified, it is either not registered or it is
in an inactive state. SNA Server logs the event ID 60 after the timeout has been
exceeded. The timeout setting is a configurable setting located in the
properties of the Local LU Advanced settings. The default is 60 seconds.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by the TP starting before the SNA Server SnaBase service has
finished initializing.

This problem can also occur when you upgrade from Windows NT Server 4.0 Service
Pack 3 to Service Pack 4 or later. For additional information, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q197286 Third-Party Services May Fail to Start After Upgrade to NT SP4

Service Pack 4 changes the order of how the services are loaded for all Windows
NT services. Because the TP may not use the following resolution, the TP is
loaded before the initialization of SNABASE. Therefore, the TP does not
successfully register in the SNA Service Table. See the "More Information"
section of this article for information concerning the importance of the SNA
Service Table.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this issue, perform the following steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;TP NAME&gt;

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

  Value Name: DependOnService
  Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
  Value: SnaBase

4. Quit Registry Editor.

By adding this entry, the Service Control Manager verifies that the SnaBase
service has successfully started before starting the TP. This ensures that the
TP will register properly with the ST, giving the proper location and active
state information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All SNA Server services and resources are required to register themselves in the
SNA Service Table(ST). Because the ST is a dynamic memory allocated table, the
SNA Server service (and SNA clients) locates the needed services through the ST
within that current SNA Server Subdomain. In this case, the Auto-started
Invokable TP will register in the ST. With an Invoking TP, an ALLOCATE or
MC_ALLOCATE is received by the SNA Server outbound from the HOST. In the
ALLOCATE, the TP name resides ( for further information on the ALLOCATE review
the SNA Server SDK included with SNA Server). The SNA Server service checks the
TP name in the ALLOCATE, finds a match in the Service Table, and verifies that
it is in an active state (the Invokable TP has issued a RECEIVE_ALLOCATE). Once
this is found and verified, the conversation will continue.
