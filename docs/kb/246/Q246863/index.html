-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "Assignments are not mandatory over slow links" option in an
advertisement's properties, some or all of the following symptoms may occur:

- When there is a high-speed connection to the client access point (CAP) and a
  slow link to the distribution point, the Slownet utility evaluates the
  network speed against the high-speed connection to the CAP and assigns the
  advertisement. The advertisement then runs against the distribution point
  over the slow link.

- When there is a slow link to the CAP and a fast link to the distribution
  point, the Slownet utility evaluates the link speed to the CAP, and the
  advertisement is not assigned even though the link speed to the distribution
  point may be fast.

- If a client is assigned to multiple sites, the advertisement may not be
  assigned in spite of a fast link to the CAP and the distribution point for
  the site from which the advertisement originated, which indicates that a slow
  link is detected.

- If a site server has been rebuilt with a new site code and the clients still
  have the old site in the site list, advertisements may not be assigned due to
  slow link detection in spite of a fast link to the new site.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the slow-link detection method used on the Microsoft
Systems Management Server (SMS) client. The SMS client uses an algorithm to
evaluate the link speed to the CAP for the first site in its site list. Then it
uses the results to determine whether an assignment should occur in spite of the
link speed to the selected distribution point.

In addition, since the client only checks the link speed to the CAP in the first
site from its site list, a detected slow link to the CAP effectively blocks
assignment for other sites to which the client has a fast connection. Also, if
the CAP that the client attempts to use for slow-link detection is offline or
unavailable, the slow-link detection algorithm reports that the link speed is
slow and blocks the assignment.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods:

- Use collections to control the targeted resources for a given advertisement
  rather than the "Slow-link detection" option.

- Build additional logic into the package itself to prevent excessive traffic
  over a slow link.

- Use the Slownet2.exe utility to obtain, test, or set the Slownet threshold
  speed on the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Slownet2 Command Line Utility
---------------------------------

Description::

The Slownet2 utility expands the capability of the original Slownet utility by
enabling a user to obtain, set, and delete a slow network threshold setting for
a client. This setting overrides any per-site setting that is configured based
upon a client's site membership.

The Slow Network Threshold Speed registry value name is placed in the following
registry key.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Sms\Client\Configuration\Client
  Properties

Usage::

SlowNet2 [&lt;UNC destination path&gt; | GetThreshold | SetThreshold |
DelThreshold] ([required speed | 0 for Remote Access Service (RAS) check only])
(/v)

Parameters::

[&lt;UNC destination path&gt; | GetThreshold | SetThreshold | DelThreshold] must
be specified.

- &lt;UNC destination path&gt; - the universal naming convention (UNC) path
  whose speed is to be tested. A connection must be established for this path
  prior to starting the utility.
- GetThreshold - query and display the current value of the Slow Network
  Threshold Speed value name.
- SetThreshold - use the value specified in param2 as the new threshold. If the
  Slow Network Threshold Speed value name does not exist in the registry, it is
  created.
- DelThreshold - if the Slow Network Threshold Speed value name exists in the
  registry, it is deleted.
- ([required speed | 0 for RAS check only]) must be specified for SetThreshold
  only. If the value is 0 and RemotePath is specified, the utility only
  performs a RAS connection check. If found, an exit code of 1 is returned,
  which indicates a slow link. If only RemotePath is specified, the link speed
  is tested against the utility's default speed of 40,000 bps.
- (/v) is Optional Verbose mode.

If specified, the utility displays a trace of its actions and results.

Returns::

0 for success or fast (if testing link speed). 1 for unsuccessful or slow (if
testing link speed).
