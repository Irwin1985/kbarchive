The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use System Preparation Tool for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 to
create a duplicate computer configuration (an image), the host name is not
updated on the clone computer. As a result, all of the computer images produced
from the master computer have the same Domain Name Server (DNS) host name.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the System Preparation Tool for Windows NT Server
4.0 does not support a parameter for specifying the host name.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, create a batch file to change the host name in the
registry so it matches the computer name, and place the batch file in the
RunOnce registry key of the master computer. Follow these steps:

1. On the master computer, in Notepad, create a Host.cmd file that contains the
  following text:

  start %SystemRoot%\System32\Regchg.exe
  System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters Hostname REG_SZ
  %computername%

2. Copy the Regchg.exe utility to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder of the master
  computer.

  NOTE: The Regchg.exe utility is in the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit.

3. Add the Host.cmd file to the RunOnce key in the registry of the master
  computer:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32) and locate the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

  b. Add a new registry value to run the Host.cmd file:

     1. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

     2. Type an arbitrary value name (such as Host) in the Value Name box.

     3. In the Data Type box, click REG_SZ, and then click OK.

     4. In the String box, type the path to the Host.cmd file, and then click
        OK.

  c. Quit Registry Editor.

  NOTE: Do not restart the master computer after you add this value to the
  RunOnce key. When you restart the computer, the Host.cmd batch file runs
  after you log in and the operating system removes the value you just added to
  the RunOnce key.

4. Use System Preparation Tool for Windows NT Server 4.0 to create a clone of
  the master computer.

5. Log on to the clone computer.

  The Host.cmd file runs, changing the host name so it matches the computer
  name.

6. (Recommended) After you log on to the clone computer, run the Rdisk utility
  with the /s option to update the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) and the
  security hives in the Repair folder of the clone computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the System Preparation Tool for Windows NT 4.0 to duplicate a
computer, the security identifiers (SIDs) in the Repair folder of the master
computer are also duplicated to the clone computer, which can cause problems if
you attempt to use the Emergency Repair Disk on the clone computer. Immediately
after you use the System Preparation Tool for Windows NT 4.0, run Rdisk /s to
update the SIDs in the Repair folder on the clone computer.

Knowledge Base:

  Preparation Tool for Windows NT 4.0
