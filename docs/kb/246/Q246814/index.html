-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some of the new and enhanced features of Visual
SourceSafe 6.0, and provides links to additional relevant articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installation Procedures
-----------------------

SourceSafe 6.0, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q221576 INFO: How The Fast Get Operation Works in SourceSafe 6.0

Label Promotions
----------------

For information regarding label promotions, see the following article:

  Q246910 INFO: How Do Label Promotions Work in SourceSafe 6.0

OLE Automation
--------------

Numerous enhancements are made to OLE Automation in Visual SourceSafe 6.0.
Problems in Visual SourceSafe 5.0 are corrected, and additional functionality is
added by exposing the SourceSafe Administrative tools to the object model. OLE
Automation code that is written for SourceSafe 5.0 should work without problem
in SourceSafe 6.0. If any adjustments are needed, they should be minor.

For additional information regarding OLE Automation in SourceSafe 6.0, see the
MSDN article "Visual SourceSafe 6.0 Automation" at the following Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/techart/vssauto.htm
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/techart/vssauto.htm)

Archive and Restore
-------------------

In Visual SourceSafe 6.0, you can access the Archive and Restore functions from
within the SourceSafe Administrative menus. These commands were previously
accessible only from the command prompt.

For information regarding the Ssarc.exe and Ssrestor.exe utilities, see the
following article:

  Q176875 INFO: The Primary Functions of Ssarc.exe and Ssrestor.exe

Project Level Differences
-------------------------

In Visual SourceSafe 5.0, the Project Difference option compares your current
project against the version of the project that is stored in the user working
directory. In Visual SourceSafe 6.0, the Project Difference option also allows
you to compare the contents of projects with other Windows folders or other
projects in your database. Specifically, it allows you to compare:

- VSS project to VSS project
- VSS project to local folder
- Local folder to local folder

The addition of Browse buttons lets you specify how to perform the Project
Difference operation. To change the default behavior of this command, just
choose between Browse buttons.

Deploy Files from the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
----------------------------------------------------

Once a project has been designated as a Web project in the Visual SourceSafe
administrator, the Deploy option becomes available within the SourceSafe
explorer. Visual SourceSafe 5.0 allows you to deploy only entire projects from
the GUI. Visual SourceSafe 6.0 lets you deploy individual files as well as
entire projects.

Move Command Moves Files and Projects
-------------------------------------

In Visual SourceSafe 5.0, the Move Project command, located on the File menu,
lets you move projects. In Visual SourceSafe 6.0, this command has been improved
and renamed the Move command. If you select a project and click Move from the
File menu, the command works exactly as the Move Project command does in Visual
SourceSafe 5.0.

Visual SourceSafe 6.0 gives you the added ability to move individual files
between projects. To move a file from one project to another, select the file
you want to move. From the File menu, click Move, and then choose the
destination project from the Move command window.

When you move a file in SourceSafe 6.0, the file is copied to the destination
project and is given the shared file glyph. The original is deleted but is not
purged from its starting location. In other words, the Move operation shares the
file to the new project, and then deletes (but does not purge) the file from its
original project.

Create Database
---------------

In Visual SourceSafe 6.0, the administrator of a database can create a new
database from within the Administrative utility (Ssadmin.exe). To do this, from
the Tools menu, click Create Database.

For more information regarding the Create Database command, see the following
articles:

  Q216115 HOWTO: Set Up Multiple Databases in Visual SourceSafe 6.0

  Q238155 HOWTO: Create a New Database in Visual SourceSafe

Clean Up Temp Directory
-----------------------

Visual SourceSafe creates temporary files that are usually destroyed during a
normal session. Sometimes, due to unusual circumstances, these temporary files
remain in the Temp folder and take up disk space.

In Visual SourceSafe 5.0 and earlier, the administrator must explicitly open the
Temp folder and delete the files. In Visual SourceSafe 6.0, the administrator
can automatically delete temporary files by using the Clean up Temp Directory
command. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Open the SourceSafe Admin program.

2. Open the SourceSafe database containing the Temp folder that you wish to
  clean up.

3. From the Tools menu, click Clean up Temp Directory.

It is strongly recommended that all users log out of Visual SourceSafe before
using the Clean up Temp Directory command; otherwise, data may be lost. However,
if Visual SourceSafe finds a file in the Temp folder that is in use (that is, a
user is viewing the file), it does not delete the file.

Create Shortcut
---------------

The Create Shortcut feature provides an easy way to access a SourceSafe project.
Once a shortcut has been created, you can double-click the shortcut icon to open
the SourceSafe explorer to the designated project.

To create a shortcut, perform the following steps:

1. Open the SourceSafe explorer.

2. Select the project.

3. From the File menu, click Create Shortcut.

Note that the shortcut for the project should be placed on your desktop.
