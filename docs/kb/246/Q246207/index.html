-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Exchange Server 5.0 to Exchange Server 5.5 and the upgrade
does not work, you may experience the following symptoms:

- When you try to start the directory or information store, you receive the
  following error message:

  -1206, JET_errDatabaseCorrupted

- When you try to run the Exchange Server 5.5 upgrade again, you receive the
  following error message:

  An unexpected error has occurred. ID No. c106fdda

CAUSE
=====

When you receive a -1206 error when you are starting the information store or
directory, the database may not actually be damaged, but may be the wrong
version (for example, running an Exchange Server 5.0 database against an
Exchange Server 5.5 computer). In the case of a failed upgrade, this may be
because the databases were upgraded, at least partially, but the 5.5 files were
never copied into the Exchsrvr folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Verify that this is a version issue by examining the database headers with
  the Exchange Server 5.5 Eseutil utility.

2. Copy the Eseutil.exe and Ese.dll files from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD to the
  Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder where the databases are located.

3. From a command prompt, navigate to the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder, type the
  following commands, and press ENTER after each:

  eseutil.exe /mh priv.edb|find "State"

-and-

  eseutil.exe /mh pub.edb|find "State"

Both commands should return:

  "State: Consistent"

NOTE: Exchange 2000 Service Pack 2 and later, do not report the database state as
"Consistent" or "Inconsistent" but as "Clean Shutdown" or "Dirty Shutdown." The
meaning of "Clean Shutdown" is the same as "Consistent", and the meaning of
"Dirty Shutdown" is the same as "Inconsistent."

If the databases are not consistent, follow the instructions in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article to bring the databases to a consistent state
before continuing:

  Q180009 XADM: Exchange 5.5 Upgrade Fails With ID No: c106fdda

After the databases are consistent, perform the following steps to resolve the
issue:

1. Note the database and log file paths for the Information Store service and
  Directory service.

2. Rename the Dsadata and Mdbdata folders on each drive to Dsadata.old and
  Mdbdata.old, respectively.

3. Create new Dsadata and Mdbdata folders on each drive.

4. Uninstall Exchange Server.

5. Run Exchange Server 5.0 Setup. Install it in a new site with the same
  organization and site names. DO NOT JOIN AN EXISTING SITE.

6. If you had any connectors installed, such as the Internet Mail Service, make
  sure to install them during Setup by choosing to run a Complete/Custom Setup.

7. After the 5.0 Setup finishes, run Exchange Server 5.5 Setup, and click
  Upgrade. When Setup finishes, stop the Exchange Server services.

8. Run Performance Optimizer to put the databases and log files in their
  previous locations. Do not restart the services after the files are moved.

9. Rename the Dsadata and Mdbdata folders on each drive to Dsadata.new and
  Mdbdata.new, respectively.

10. Create new Dsadata and Mdbdata folders on each drive.

11. Copy the Dir.edb file from Dsadata.old to Dsadata. Copy the Priv.edb and
  Pub.edb files from Mdbdata.old to Mdbdata.

12. Start the System Attendant and the Directory service.

13. At a command prompt in the Exchsrvr\Bin folder, run "isinteg -patch"
  (without the quotation marks).

14. Start the Information Store service and any remaining Exchange Server
  services.


  At this point, all services should be started.

15. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program and verify that all
  connectors work.

16. Make a full backup of Exchange Server.
