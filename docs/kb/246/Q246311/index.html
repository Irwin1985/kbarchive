IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to set a Web site or virtual directory as an application, you may
receive the following error message:

  An error occurred getting or setting a configuration parameter 0x80110401

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several possible resolutions to this error. After each of these steps
verify that you are still receiving the error before proceeding to the next
step.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Use the Mdutil.exe file from the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) CD to check
  the consistency of the metabase. This executable file is available on the CD,
  but is not installed. Copy this file to the hard drive of the Web server
  though Windows Explorer. Use the following command line to enumerate and
  display the information in the metabase:

  

  "mdutil.exe enum_all"

  If this command fails or returns an error, then the metabase is corrupt and
  you should restore from a known backup, or remove and reinstall the NTOP. For
  more information , please consult: For additional information on backing up
  of the metabase, click the article number below to view the article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q234429 How to Manually Restore the Metabase When No Backup Exists

2. Change the system package in Transaction Server from the Interactive User to
  a user that has Local Administrators access:

  a. On the IIS computer, in the scope (left-hand) pane of the MMC, go to the
     following branch:

  

  Microsoft Transaction Server
           Computers
            My Computer
              Packages Installed

  b. Right-click the system package, and then click Properties on the Context
     menu.

  c. Click the Identity tab.

  d. Select the This user radio button, and then provide the user account and
     password.

     Note: Make sure to include the domain in the user text box, followed by a
     backslash before the user's name (for example DomainName\UserName).

3. Verify the permissions on the noted registry key:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Rededt32.exe).

  b. Locate and highlight the following registry key:

  HKEY Local Machine\Software\Microsoft\Transaction Server

  c. With this registry key highlighted, choose Permissions from the Security
     menu and verify that the following permissions (or greater) are set:

      - Creator Owner: Full Control

      - Administrators: Full Control

      - Everyone: Special Access

  Query Value Set Value
  Create Subkey
  Enumerate Subkey
  Notify
  Delete
  Read Control

      - System: Full Control

4. Synchronize the IWAM(computer_name) account using the steps in the following
  article:

  Q195956 Cannot Set AppRoot OutProc MTS Package Identity Set to Y

  You may also have to create a new account and use Adsutil.vbs to set
  WAMUserName and WAMUserPass to the new account.

5. Verify in Dcomcnfg.exe that IUSR(computer_name) and IWAM(computer_name) (or
  their equivalents) have access permission and launch permission on the
  Security tab.

6. Try the following Transaction Server utilities:

  %program files%\mts\mtxrereg.exe
  %program files%\mts\mtxstop.exe

7. Save or export, and then delete the following registry key:

  Hkey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\Userkeys\MS_IIS_DCOM_CLIENT

  After you do this, restart the computer to reinitialize the registry.

8. Re-apply the current service pack.

9. Check to see if the Guest group (for which the IUSR and IWAM accounts are
  members) is disabled.

  To work around this, enable the Guest account or disable Authorization
  Checking in Transaction Server using the MMC:

  a. In Transaction Server, select Packages Installed.

  b. Select IIS in-process applications, select Components, and then choose
     IISWAM1_ROOT_IISADMIN.

  c. Right-click Properties, click the Security tab, and then disable
     Authorization Checking.

  Note: This can also be caused by a missing IIS in-process application from
  Transaction Server. If you find that the IIS in-process application is
  missing from the Transaction Server installed packages, follow the steps in
  the following article:

  Q246309 How to Replace a Missing IIS in Process Applications in Transaction
  Server

If this error persists, you we will need to remove and reinstall the NTOP to
resolve this issue.
