-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Arcade for Windows, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Arcade for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Missile Command scenario is a nightmare. Your mission is to protect six
cities from nuclear attack. Your weapons are in three bases, each stocked with
10 defensive missiles.

When you survive an attack wave with at least one remaining city, you advance to
the next level of play and Missile Command restocks your missile bases. But the
onslaughts become more overwhelming with each level. Play continues until your
last city is destroyed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Defend your six cities from destruction by shooting down attack missiles, MIRVs,
bombers, killer satellites, and smart bombs. Use the mouse to aim your defensive
missiles, and use the keyboard or mouse to fire them from one of your three
bases. The missiles launched from Alpha Base and Omega Base travel at the same
rate. The missiles launched from Delta Base move faster.

Starting a New Game
-------------------

On the Game menu, click New, or press F2. When you start a new game, Missile
Command resets your score to zero.

Aiming and Firing Defensive Missiles with the Keyboard
------------------------------------------------------

1. Use the mouse to position the targeting crosshair.

2. Press the A key to fire a missile from Alpha Base.

3. Press the S key to fire a missile from Delta Base.

4. Press the D key to fire a missile from Omega Base.

The missile launches toward the your targeting crosshair. After you fire, quickly
move the targeting crosshair to prepare for your next launch. Missile Command
warns you when your missile supply is dangerously low.

Firing a Defensive Missile with the Mouse
-----------------------------------------

1. On the Options menu, click Player Controls to display the Player Controls
  dialog box.

2. Click Automatic Base Selection, and then click OK.

3. Move the mouse to position the targeting crosshair, and then click to fire a
  missile from the nearest base.

Scoring
-------

The scoring strategy for Missile Command rewards you for shooting down attack
missiles, bombers, killer satellites, and smart bombs. When you complete each
level, you score bonus points for any remaining defensive missiles and surviving
cities.

- Attack missile: 25 points
- Bombers: 100 points.
- Killer satellites: 100 points.
- Smart bombs: 125 points.

Scoring Bonus Points
--------------------

- Surviving defensive missiles: 5 points each
- Surviving cities: 100 points each

Level Multipliers
-----------------

On level 3 and higher, both standard and bonus points are increased by a level
multiplier to reward you for surviving the more challenging levels. For example,
if you survive level 2 with four cities and six missiles, you score 430 points
(100 points for each surviving city and five points for each remaining defensive
missile). If you survive level 3 with four cities and six missiles, you score
860 points because of the 2x level multiplier.

The following list shows the score multipliers for each game level:

- Level 1: 1x
- Level 2: 1x
- Level 3: 2x
- Level 4: 2x
- Level 5: 3x
- Level 6: 3x
- Level 7: 4x
- Level 8: 4x
- Level 9: 5x
- Level 10: 5x

The multiplier is 6x for Level 11 and higher.

Lives
-----

You start the game with six cities (lives) and continue until the last city is
destroyed.

You receive a bonus city for every 10,000 points you score. You don't see your
bonus cities until Missile Command uses them to replace destroyed cities at the
beginning of the next level.

Additional Scoring Information
------------------------------

Missile Command displays the High Scores screen at the end of each game. If your
score is higher than the lowest score on the current High Scores screen, Missile
Command asks for your initials. You can add them using the keyboard or mouse. If
you score one million points, Missile Command resets your score to zero.
