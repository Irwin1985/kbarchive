SYMPTOMS
========

Many FoxPro programmers want to be able to execute one screen from another. This
may present problems if the READ command from the calling screen is not cleared
before the next screen is executed and more than five screens are executed. The
most common error message encountered is "Too many READs in effect," which is
the result of having more than five READS in effect, which is a FoxPro limit.

CAUSE
=====

The most common, though incorrect, way to try to solve this problem is to enter
something similar to the following code in the VALID clause of a push button on
Screen1:

     CLEAR READ
     DO screen2.spr

Looking at this code, it appears that the READ command will be cleared and that
Screen2 will then be executed. Actually, the READ command from Screen1 stays in
effect, Screen2 is executed, and the Screen1 READ command is not cleared until
the READ command from Screen2 is cleared and control is returned to Screen1.

This behavior occurs because in order for the CLEAR READ command to be recognized
by the current READ command, program control has to be returned to that READ
command. In this example, the CLEAR READ command is issued and then program
control is immediately transferred to SCREEN2.SPR; the READ command for Screen1
never has a chance to act on the CLEAR READ command and therefore Screen1's READ
command is not cleared before the DO command for SCREEN2.SPR is issued.

RESOLUTION
==========

  

  ***************************************************************************
  IMPORTANT: This technique is not intended to replace a foundation READ, but
  is a way to get around the limitation of not being able to have more than
  five READs in effect at one time. Because a DO command is being executed
  from another DO command, there is a form of recursion occurring and the
  error "DO nesting too deep" will appear if the limit of 32 DO levels is
  reached.
  ***************************************************************************

To achieve the desired behavior, issue the CLEAR READ command as done above, but
don't issue the DO screen2.spr command until after the READ command has been
cleared. For example:

1. In the Screen Builder, create a new screen.

  NOTE: In FoxPro for MS-DOS, choose Screen Layout from the Screen menu, and
  change the screen type from Desktop to Window.

2. Create a push button with two prompts: &lt;Screen2&gt; and &lt;Quit&gt;. Make
  the variable "m.choice". Open the Valid code snippet and add this code:

        IF m.choice=1
           tobedone="screen2.spr"
        ENDIF
        CLEAR READ

  If the Screen2 button is chosen, TOBEDONE is set to the name of the proper
  program file. The CLEAR READ command is issued if either button is chosen.
  Control is returned to the READ command and it is CLEARed.

3. Open the Setup code snippet and add this line of code:

        tobedone=space(12)

  This variable stores the next screen to be executed.

4. Open the Cleanup code snippet and add these lines of code:

        IF EMPTY(PROGRAM(30))     &amp;&amp; Check if we are about to exceed the
           IF NOT EMPTY(tobedone) &amp;&amp; 32-level DO limit. If we are, the next
              DO (tobedone)       &amp;&amp; program isn't executed and an error
        *                            message appears.
           ENDIF
        ELSE
           WAIT WINDOW "32 DO Level Limit exceeded"
        ENDIF

  This code tests whether TOBEDONE has been assigned a value that means the
  Screen2 button was chosen. If Screen2 was chosen, the value in TOBEDONE is
  executed using a name expression. If the screen is exited in some other
  fashion, that is, the ESC key or the Quit button was chosen, nothing is
  executed.

  NOTE: Make sure this is the last line in the Cleanup code.

This code example never leaves the originating program, so all variables declared
in each screen set will remain defined until you quit the original calling
screen. The program will have to manually release the memory variables in the
Cleanup code.
