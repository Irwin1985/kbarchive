-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The ClassWizard, used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows 
   - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Invoking ClassWizard produces the following message:

  Out of memory. Unable to complete command

CAUSE
=====

The project .CLW file (containing Class Wizard information) may have grown
larger than 65530 bytes. This can occur if a project contains many classes that
have been created using Class Wizard.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two possible workarounds for this problem:

- Divide your project into multiple projects [that is, one project that builds
  a static library (.LIB file) containing the code that most likely won't
  change, and the other project that builds the .EXE and includes the library
  in the linker options]. -or-

- Delete the .CLW file and reconstruct the .CLW using only the source files
  that are significant. To build a new .CLW file, follow these steps: 1. Delete
  the existing .CLW file. 2. Load the project. 3. Go to App Studio. 4. Invoke
  ClassWizard by typing CTRL+W or choosing the Class Wizard button. 5. A
  message box will be displayed asking to rebuild the .CLW. Choose Yes. 6. A
  dialog box be displayed similar to the one shown on page 133 of the Visual
  C++ for Windows App Studio "User's Guide." The dialog box permits the user to
  select the source files that will be scanned by Class Wizard. By default, the
  dialog box selects all files. To minimize the amount of ClassWizard
  information that will be placed in the .CLW file, select only the source
  files that contain the classes for which you think you will need ClassWizard.

NOTE: Be cautious when deleting a .CLW file! First, you may lose message filter
information for classes. Message filters determine what messages are displayed
in the Messages list box in ClassWizard. To change the message filter for a
class, choose the Class Info button and then select the appropriate filter from
the Message Filter combo box.

Second, the project will lose information that maps resources created in App
Studio to classes created in ClassWizard. For example, when a developer invokes
Class Wizard when a dialog box resource is present in App Studio, ClassWizard
keeps information in the .CLW file that tells it which class is associated with
that resource (information for the class is displayed). If the .CLW file is
deleted, the user may be asked to select a class for the resource. This can
cause a problem. Consider the following scenario:

1. A dialog box is created in App Studio.

2. The .CLW file is deleted.

3. The developer reconstructs the .CLW file.

4. An attempt is made to create a class for the dialog box.

When an attempt is made to create a class for the dialog box, a list box appears
on the screen asking which class is to be associated with the dialog box rather
than the Add Class dialog box. Because no class has yet been created by
ClassWizard, the list box is inappropriate. To resolve the problem, go to the
Visual Workbench instead and invoke ClassWizard. Select Add Class from the
ClassWizard dialog box. You will then be permitted to create a class for the
dialog box, as well as specify the ID of the dialog box resource that will be
associated with the class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows
version 1.5.

rebuilding the .CLW file.
