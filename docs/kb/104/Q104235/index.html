own risk.

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT supports the use of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) ScanJet IIc color
scanner if you use it with the DeskScan II software supplied by Hewlett-Packard.
In order to ensure that the scanner runs correctly under Windows NT, you must
carefully observe the following:

NOTE: Much of the information in this article also applies to the HP ScanJet IIp
scanner.

- The scanner must be connected and turned on before you start the computer.

- The scanner must be unlocked.

- The Microsoft-provided driver, HPSCAN16.SYS, must be loaded through a device=
  line in the CONFIG.NT file.

- The HP-provided 25-pin terminator must be connected to the 25-pin Macintosh
  SCSI-out connection.

- A supported SCSI Host Adapter must be used.

- The cables must be SCSI I or SCSI II specification.

- Install the most current version of DeskScan II software. (The latest version
  is available on the CompuServe HP Peripherals Forum or by calling HP at (800)
  227-8164.)

- The proprietary HP scanner interface card which ships with the scanner is not
  supported under Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following operational notes discuss each of the essential elements for
correct operation of the HP ScanJet IIc. Troubleshooting tips and hints for more
effective operation of the HP ScanJet IIc with Windows NT version 3.1 follow the
operational notes.

Operational Notes:

1. The scanner needs to be connected to the SCSI Host Adapter in the computer,
  turned on, and unlocked before you start the computer. Otherwise, the
  computer will not recognize the scanner. Unlike some versions of the Windows
  NT Beta, the scanner does not have to be installed, unlocked, and turned on
  when installing the released version of Windows NT.

2. Edit the CONFIG.NT file so that it contains a line which loads the
  HPSCAN16.SYS driver. Use a text editor, such as Notepad, to add the following
  line to the CONFIG.NT file:

  DEVICE=%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\HPSCAN16.SYS

  The CONFIG.NT file can be found in the SYSTEM32 subdirectory. Setup copies the
  files HPSCAN16.SYS, HPSCAN32.DLL, and SCSISCAN.SYS to the hard disk when you
  install Windows NT.

3. The Hewlett-Packard provided in-line terminator must be connected to the
  25-pin Macintosh SCSI-out port. The scanner may not be recognized by the
  system or the DeskScan II software may fail to work if the SCSI bus is
  incorrectly terminated. Usually, a SCSI bus is terminated at both ends, but
  not in the middle. Therefore, if the scanner is the last device on the bus,
  the end of the bus will be at the 25-pin Macintosh SCSI-out port. Do not
  place an in-line terminator at the 50-pin SCSI-in connection. The scanner may
  not work properly if the HP provided terminator is replaced with a terminated
  cable or other SCSI device connected to the 25-pin SCSI- out port.

4. Microsoft has tested all of the SCSI Host Adapters listed in the Windows NT
  version 3.1 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) with the HP ScanJet IIc.
  However, as stated in the HCL, not all of the SCSI Host Adapters listed will
  work correctly with the HP ScanJet IIc. The following SCSI Host Adapters on
  the HCL will not work correctly with the HP ScanJet IIc:

     Maynard 16-bit SCSI Adapter  (ISA)
     Data Technology Corp. 3292   (EISA Adapter)
     Olivetti ESC-1               (EISA Adapter)

  The Maynard 16-bit and DTC 3292 SCSI Adapters are appropriately footnoted in
  the HCL as not working with scanners, but the HCL documentation does not
  mention that the Olivetti ESC-1 adapter will not work with the HP ScanJet
  IIc.

5. The HP ScanJet IIc is very sensitive to incorrect cabling. In order for the
  scanner to work, the cables must be of high quality and meet the SCSI I or
  SCSI II specification where appropriate (SCSI II Host Adapters require SCSI
  II cabling). You must ensure that all connections are firm, with all
  connector pins in solid contact. Shorter cables have a greater chance of
  success than longer cables. Be certain that the cables are in very good
  condition.

6. Use the most current version of the HP DeskScan II software. Presently, the
  most current version is 1.62. Versions earlier than 1.61 may not function
  properly under Windows NT.

7. Do not attempt to use the proprietary HP-provided scanner interface card with
  Windows NT. The supported SCSI Host Adapter takes the place of this card.
  However, HP has developed a driver that allows you to use the scanner with a
  SCSI adapter in the MS-DOS and Windows 3.0 or 3.1 environments. The name of
  this driver is SJIIIx.SYS and it is available by calling HP or from the HP
  forum on CompuServe.

Troubleshooting Hints and Tips:

If the scanner does not function or you get error messages from the DeskScan II
software advising you that the scanner cannot be found, then try the following
steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. To check if Windows NT has recognized the scanner hardware, start the
  Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and choose the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key. Select
  the following subkey

  \HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi\Scsi Port 0\Scsi Bus 0\Target Idx \logical Unit Id 0

  where x represents the SCSI ID number for the scanning device. Examine the
  entry at the SCSI ID number of the scanner. This entry should have a value of
  HP C1750 A.

2. In the Control Panel window, choose Devices to see if the 32-bit driver
  SCSISCAN.SYS was started. If it has not started, attempt to start it by
  choosing the Start button. Do not attempt to change the method by which it
  starts by using the Startup button. The default setting in the Startup dialog
  box is System. If you try to change this setting to Boot or some other
  setting, you may lock your Windows NT installation. If this happens, you will
  have to disconnect the scanner, start MS-DOS, and disable HPSCAN16.SYS in the
  CONFIG.NT before returning to Windows NT.

3. If HPSCAN16.SYS is loaded as a device driver in the CONFIG.NT file, but you
  do not have the HP ScanJet IIc connected to the SCSI Host Adapter, then your
  Windows NT will hang when started. The computer will need to be restarted. To
  recover, either turn the machine off and reconnect the scanner, or use the
  "dual boot" functionality of Windows NT by starting the MS-DOS environment
  and editing the CONFIG.NT to disable the HPSCAN16.SYS device line.

4. The DeskScan II software installation program will create a group called
  Scanner in the Program Manager. In this group, you will see an icon of a
  scanner with the icon title of DeskScan II. You may also see icons titled
  Scanner Test and SCSI Addresses, however, these two applications are not
  compatible with Windows NT. No resolution or workaround to this problem
  exists at this time.

5. Be sure that the SCSI ID number set for the scanner does not conflict with
  the SCSI ID number for any other device on the SCSI bus. SCSI addresses 0
  through 7 are displayed on a small, circular SCSI address indicator located
  between the 50-pin SCSI-in and the 25-pin Macintosh SCSI-out ports at the
  back of the scanner. In the middle of the indicator dial is a small, narrow
  slot which can be turned with a tiny flat-bladed screwdriver. Once you change
  the SCSI ID to a non-conflicting SCSI address, the new SCSI ID will be
  recognized at system startup and will be written into the Windows NT
  Registry.

6. To determine whether the HP ScanJet is locked or unlocked, look for a
  rectangular opening at the back of the scanner just above the 50-pin SCSI
  port. If there is a half-height black plastic block in the opening, then the
  scanner is unlocked. To lock the scanner, you must press down firmly on the
  plastic block. When the block is in the depressed position, a black bar will
  appear in the rectangular opening. To unlock the scanner, push the horizontal
  black bar back up to the top of the rectangular opening.
