The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is from parts 1 and 2 of the Microsoft FORTRAN
PowerStation README.TXT file located in the \F32\README\ directory.

  Part 1: Installing
  Part 2: Using the FL32 Compiler

MORE INFORMATION
================

Part 1: Installing
------------------

Using SHARE
-----------

If you are going to use Windows 3.1, you must start the share utility
prior to starting Windows in order to use the Browser. This is not
necessary if you will be using Windows for Workgroups (WFW), because
WFW has its own internal version of SHARE.

Modifications to SYSTEM.INI
---------------------------

Setup modifies the SYSTEM.INI file in your Windows directory. It adds
the following information in the [386ENH] section:

  device=c:\f32\bin\dosxnt.386
  device=c:\f32\bin\mmd.386

Without these device drivers installed, FORTRAN PowerStation will not
work from within Windows. The original SYSTEM.INI is renamed
SYSTEM.BK_

Running Setup from MS-DOS or Windows
------------------------------------

The DOSSETUP program installs all of the files necessary to run
Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation under MS-DOS. To use the product,
however, you need to ensure that your environment variables in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file are set to run the product correctly.

DOSSETUP has created a file called F32ENV.BAT. This file sets the
current environment of your MS-DOS session to the necessary values. If
you want Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation to be configured when your
machine starts, you need to copy the lines from F32ENV.BAT to the end
of your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

If you want to use the Integrated Debugging Environment, you need to
run the SETUP.EXE program from the Program Manager in Microsoft
Windows (version 3.1 or later). Running the Microsoft Windows Setup
program will not affect your ability to run in the MS-DOS environment;
it merely installs extra files used in the Microsoft Windows
environment. Although it is possible to run the browser tools
(SBRPACK.EXE and BSCMAKE.EXE) from the MS-DOS command line, these
tools are not installed by DOSSETUP.

Libraries Replaced by Setup
---------------------------

If you have older versions of the LIBC.LIB, KERNEL32.LIB, FP.LIB, or
NTDLL.LIB libraries in your installation directory, Setup replaces
them only if the ones on the distribution disk are newer than the ones
on your hard disk. The only library that Setup always replaces is
LIBF.LIB.

Running Setup from Windows for Workgroups (WFW)
-----------------------------------------------

If you install FORTRAN PowerStation from a PC running Windows for
Workgroups, you may get a warning message from Windows when you allow
Setup to restart Windows. If another user is connected to your PC, you
should make certain that restarting Windows on your PC does not cause
him or her to lose data before proceeding. Some network connections
may have to be re-established manually after Windows has restarted.

Using a Video Seven Graphics Card
---------------------------------

Video Seven provides a utility called V7VGA to enable extended
resolutions of their card. These extended capabilities are enabled by
default in MS-DOS, but are disabled by default in a Windows MS-DOS
session.

To use VESA modes in Windows, you must first run the command line
"V7VESA /1" using the utility supplied with FORTRAN PowerStation. You
can put this in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or run it in a Windows MS-DOS
session. In addition to running this program in a Windows MS-DOS
session, you must give the command line "V7VGA pure:off" inside the
Windows MS-DOS session. This enables the extended capabilities used by
VESA. V7VGA.EXE is provided on the utilities disk with the Video 7
card. V7VESA.COM is also provided. Microsoft provides V7VESA.COM, but
not V7VGA.EXE.

Problems Using 256-Color VESA Modes
-----------------------------------

Some video adapters do not execute a FLOODFILL correctly if they are
running in 256-color VESA modes. Instead of filling polygons
completely with the specified color, these adapters fill only the
lower half of the polygon. (You can check how your video adapter
executes FLOODFILL by running the GRDEMO project in the
..F32\SAMPLES\DEMO directory.

Possible MS-DOS Extender Conflicts
----------------------------------

Several Microsoft language products provide 32-bit MS-DOS-extended
tools that use the Microsoft DOSXNT MS-DOS Extender. The version of
DOSXNT used by Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 is not
compatible with the version used by Microsoft MASM version 6.1.

To ensure that all MS-DOS-extended tools run successfully, it is
recommended that you install each language product in a separate
directory and that you leave each version of DOSXNT.EXE in the
subdirectory that contains the tools it supports. This allows each
MS-DOS-extended tool to locate the appropriate version of DOSXNT.EXE.
Make sure that the PATH environment variable specifies the directory
in which you installed FORTRAN PowerStation version 1.0 before the
directory that contains MASM 6.1. This ensures that you can run the
latest versions of tools that are in common to both products.

If you install both FORTRAN PowerStation 1.0 and MASM 6.1 in one
directory, you will not be able to run MASM.EXE and ML.EXE from the
command line. However, you will be able to run these tools as commands
executed by NMAKE.

The DOS extender used by Version 1.0a of FORTRAN PowerStation
is compatable with MASM Version 6.11, Visual C++ 32-bit Edition
Version 1.0, and Visual C++ 16-bit Edition Version 1.5.

Part 2: Using the FL32 Compiler
-------------------------------

Temporary Files Created by FL32
-------------------------------

The FORTRAN PowerStation compiler creates temporary files during
compilation. These files are normally stored in a directory identified
by the TMP environment variable. (If a TMP environment variable has
not been set, these temporary files are stored in the directory where
FORTRAN PowerStation was installed.) If the directory identified by
the TMP environment variable does not exist, or there is not enough
space to create the temporary files, compilation will fail with the
message "F1914: cannot open internal files."

To check the location of the TMP environment variable, type SET at the
MS-DOS prompt. All currently set environment variables are listed. You
can use the Windows File Manager to locate the directory specified in
the TMP environment variable.

Using Assumed-size Arrays of Structures
---------------------------------------

Writing an assumed-size array without specifying element indices
should produce an error, but does not if the array is an array of
structures.

    subroutine sub(s)
    structure /struc/ 
      real r
    end structure
    record /struc/ s(*)

C  The following line is incorrect, but will not produce an error:

     write(*,*) s(i).r

C  Instead, a write statement such as the following should be used:

     write(*,*) (s(i).r, i=1,10)

Loop Counter Limitation
-----------------------

The largest number of iterations that a loop can perform is
2,147,483,647. This is because the tripcounter is an Integer*4
variable; the compiler does not check for overflow as a means of
increasing execution speed.

Notes on the Random Number Generator
------------------------------------

The random number generator provided with FORTRAN PowerStation is
different from the one provided with the 16-bit FORTRAN 5.1. The
sequence of numbers produced by RANDOM is different from that produced
by the same seed in the FORTRAN 5.1 random number generator.

The value -1 is an exception to the rule that a given seed always
produces the same sequence of values from RANDOM. Instead, -1 is
equivalent to RND$TIMESEED, which produces a different sequence each
time it is used.

Differences in Substring/Concatenation Operations
-------------------------------------------------

There is a difference in how FORTRAN 5.1 and FORTRAN PowerStation
handle substring/concatenation operations. FORTRAN PowerStation
produces the same results that VAX FORTRAN produces if the VAX
extensions (-4Yv) are enabled. If the VAX extensions are not enabled,
these operations are handled in the same way that FORTRAN 5.1 does.
For example, if you define

         CHARACTER*10    BUFFER1
         CHARACTER*11    BUFFER2, BUFFER3
         CHARACTER*1     CHAR1
         BUFFER1 = '0123456789'
         BUFFER2 = '0123456789 '
         BUFFER3 = '0123456789 '
         CHAR1 = 'X'

The statement

  BUFFER1 = BUFFER1(6:10)//BUFFER1(1:5)

produces "5678901234:with VAX extensions enabled and "5678956789" with
VAX extensions disabled.

The statement

  BUFFER2 = CHAR1//BUFFER2

produces "X0123456789" with VAX extensions enabled and "XX113355779"
with VAX extensions disabled.

The Statement

  BUFFER3 = BUFFER3(1:10)//CHAR1

produces "0123456789X" with either switch setting.

The assignment statements for BUFFER1 and BUFFER2 violate the ANSI
Standard. Section 10.4 of the Standard says that for a Character
Assignment Statement of the form

  v = e

"none of the character positions being defined in 'v' may be
referenced in 'e'." The FORTRAN PowerStation "Language Guide" does not
mention this and no run-time error is generated, even when /4Yb is
used.

Handling Mismatched Type and Length Warnings
--------------------------------------------

The FL32 compiler generates a mismatched type warning (F2606) if the
type of a formal argument is different from the type of the actual
argument used in the subprogram call. Under most conditions, this
situation will not prevent a program from executing, but certain
automatic type conversions, such as between REAL*4 and REAL*8, can
cause the program to crash. It is good practice to resolve mismatched
type warnings prior to running a program.
