-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Sound System hardware does not meet all of the requirements to
qualify for the Multimedia PC Marketing Council, Inc. (MPC) logo. However, if
Windows Sound System is installed on a computer that includes the following from
other cards, the system is considered MPC compliant:

- a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)

- a small computer system interface (SCSI)

- a joystick port

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MPC designation applies to a complete computer system or to a full upgrade
kit. The Windows Sound System is an audio card, which is one component of an
MPC-compatible system. You need to add the other components to have your system
qualify as an MPC system.

MIDI, SCSI, and joystick ports were omitted from the Windows Sound System because
most users do not require these components.

Alternative means of supplying this functionality are described below.

SCSI
----

Almost all CD-ROM drives have a SCSI interface card. If you install this card,
you must use an additional slot on your computer that you would not have had to
use if the Windows Sound System card had a SCSI interface.

MIDI
----

Windows Sound System supports MIDI out, but not MIDI in. For example, Windows
Sound System can play MIDI files, but cannot record them from a keyboard input
source. To record MIDI in, you must have a separate MIDI card installed, and you
must use it in conjunction with other MIDI software. The Windows Sound System
card was designed for business users, who are more likely to need to play MIDI
files than to create them.

Joystick
--------

A joystick port is not built into Windows Sound System because Microsoft believes
that the typical user uses a mouse to play games. For this functionality, you
can install a separate card.
