SUMMARY
=======

The following questions and answers pertain to applications, executables,
and libraries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. I have created an application that does not allow me to edit
     my database files. How can I correct this problem?

  A. Mark your database as excluded in the project, then rebuild your
     application. You must distribute these files to your end users.
     Including the database in the project automatically makes these
     files read only.

2. Q. Why can't I build an executable file from within my project?
     The options to do so are dimmed and unavailable.

  A. To build an executable file, you must purchase the Microsoft
     FoxPro Distribution Kit and install it in your FoxPro directory.
     Prior to installing the FoxPro Distribution Kit, make sure that
     the FoxPro files are not marked as read only.

3. Q. When I attempt to build an executable file, I receive the
     error message "Link command failed." How can I correct this
     problem?

  A. If you receive this error message, check the following items:

     a. Make sure that you have enough conventional memory.

     b. Make sure that you have enough disk space.

     c. Increase the number of file handles available to Microsoft
        FoxPro for MS-DOS. To do this, you can increase the FILES
        setting in the CONFIG.SYS file or increase the FILE HANDLES
        setting in the network configuration file.

     d. Make sure that FoxPro can find your COMMAND.COM file.

     e. Make sure that the following files are on your path:
        WLINK8.EXE, PROAPI16.EXE, and FOXSWAP.COM.

     f. If you are running the Extended Version of FoxPro, make
        sure that DOSMEM=ON is not in your CONFIG.FP file.

4. Q. My executable file runs correctly under the development
     version, but I receive the error message "Feature not available"
     under the stand-alone version. How can I correct this problem?

  A. First, check the "Features Not Available" list in the FoxPro
     Distribution Kit documentation. Certain features used for
     development are not available in the applications and
     executables you create. If you still encounter problems, it is
     possible that you are using a macro substitution in your
     program. You must either eliminate the macro substitution or
     include a program that issues the proper command, but is never
     called, in your project. If this problem persists, call
     Microsoft Product Support for FoxPro at (425) 635-7191, Monday
     through Friday, 6:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Pacific time, excluding
     holidays.

5. Q. What is the Library Construction Kit and what does it do?

  A. The Library Construction Kit is an application programming
     interface (API) that allows you to extend the capabilities of
     Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS. With this kit, you can create
     function libraries of C and assembly language routines that can
     be called from within FoxPro.
