- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

Compaq Corporation is now including the EXMEM.EXE memory manager with its COMPAQ
desktop computers. According to Compaq, this memory manager should be removed
prior to the installation of Windows, Windows for Workgroups, or MS-DOS
Upgrade.

During installation of Windows or MS-DOS, EXMEM.EXE may be detected as an
incompatible terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program, and other problems may
cause Setup to fail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

EXMEM.EXE with Windows 3.1 and 3.11
-----------------------------------

The EXMEM.EXE memory manager is a combined extended and expanded memory manager
for COMPAQ desktop computers. According to Compaq Technical Support, EXMEM.EXE
was designed to eliminate the need for two memory managers in the CONFIG.SYS
file (HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE).

Windows 3.1 does not recognize EXMEM.EXE as an expanded memory provider. If you
need expanded memory support, use EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS, which are provided
on the Windows disks, instead of EXMEM.EXE.

To use EXMEM.EXE with Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode, your CONFIG.SYS file
should include the following line:

       Device=C:\DOS\EXMEM.EXE NoEMS

If you plan to use EXMEM.EXE after you install Windows or Windows for Workgroups,
you must obtain an updated driver called CPQVDD.386. This driver is available as
either as SP0298.EXE or SP0298.ZIP from the Compaq bulletin board service
(BBS).

EXMEM.EXE with MS-DOS 6.x
-------------------------

EMM386.EXE is included with MS-DOS 6.x as well. The MS-DOS 6.x MemMaker utility
does not recognize EXMEM.EXE and its loadhigh component, RUNHI.EXE.

Compaq includes the RUNHI command with its version of MS-DOS 5.0. This command
replaces both DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH, and provides more control over where
programs are loaded. RUNHI is compatible with MS-DOS 6.x, but the following
problems can occur:

- DoubleSpace cannot be loaded high with RUNHI.

- Setup does not parse lines in CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT that start with
  RUNHI, so you may end up with duplicate driver invocations.

  For example, if you have RUNHI MOUSE.COM in AUTOEXEC.BAT, Setup finds that you
  have a mouse driver loaded and tries to update it, but it cannot find the
  line in AUTOEXEC.BAT where the driver is loaded, and adds C:\DOS\MOUSE at the
  end of AUTOEXEC.BAT. The original line is undisturbed.
