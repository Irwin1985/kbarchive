The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 2.1 or 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when you delete an
externally defined postoffice with the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE),
the following error may occur:

  Notice 53
  This Post office is a hub for other post offices.

This error will occur when the internal counter of indirect postoffice
connections is greater than 0 (zero). This value is stored with the external
postoffice configuration.

CAUSE
=====

There are two probable reasons this error will occur when trying to delete a
postoffice:

1. This postoffice is a hub for postoffice(s). This can be confirmed by creating
  a report from the ADMIN.EXE program. From the main menu, select External
  Admin, Report, Setup, All Post Offices, then print either to a printer or to
  a file. This file will show whether any of the externally defined postoffices
  are linked via indirect. These links need to be removed before the hub
  postoffice can be deleted or modified.

2. The .XTN file has a bad value in the internal counter for indirect
  postoffices. The .XTN file will be preceded by an eight-digit hexadecimal
  number such as 000000AB.XTN. The file must be manually corrected using the
  following process:

  a. Obtain the network and postoffice names of the suspected postoffice.

  b. Type out the NETWORK.GLB file that is located within the GLB directory of
     the postoffice. This file is not encrypted and is not formatted.

  c. Look for the network name of the problem postoffice and write down the
     eight-digit number that follows it. This is the ID of this network's
     associated .XTN file. Make two copies of this file (for example,
     XXXXXXXX.BAK and XXXXXXXX.TMP).

3. Use DEBUG on the .TMP file to find the affected postoffice and zero the
  indirect PO counter.

  The first defined postoffice name will appear at byte offset 101, and the
  associated location of the indirect postoffice counter will be at 389. These
  values are offset by 2BAh and 698 (decimal).

  The following chart details the first 20 possible file positions for
  postoffice names, the associated delete bit, and indirect PO counter
  locations.

       1C44           1C45                1ECD
       1EFE           1EFF                2187
       21B8           21B9                2441
       2472           2473                26FB
       272C           272D                29B5
       29E6           29E7                2C6F
       2CA0           2CA1                2F29
       2F5A           2F5B                31E3
       3214           3215                349D
       34CE           34CF                3757

4. Open the temporary XXXXXXXX.TMP file in DEBUG. (Note: The DEBUG command
  prompt is a hyphen). For example, type:

  "debug 00000009.tmp" (without the quotation marks)

5. At the hyphen (-) prompt, type D100 and press ENTER to get the name of the
  first postoffice in the file preceded by a one-byte delete code. If the
  delete code is 01 and the postoffice name is the one you want, you are
  viewing the correct record and you should go to step g.

  If the postoffice name is not correct or the delete code is 00 (indicating a
  previously deleted record), repeat step f using the next row in the table
  (-D3BA, -D674, -D92E, and so on) until you find the affected record.

6. Once you have found the affected postoffice record, type in Exxx of the
  associated value in the Indirect PO Counter column above. This value will be
  greater than 00 and will need to be reset. For example:

  "-E389

  xxxx:0389 01." (without the quotation marks)

7. After the period (.), type in 00 00 (zero zero space zero zero) and press
  ENTER. This will null bytes 389H and 38AH, which hold the indirect postoffice
  count. Now press W, ENTER (write to disk) and Q, ENTER, to quit DEBUG.

8. Copy the debugged XXXXXXXX.TMP file over the XXXXXXXX.XTN file. Then use the
  ADMIN.EXE program to delete the external postoffice definition.

  NOTE: If something went wrong and this didn't work, copy your XXXXXXXX.BAK
  file over your new XXXXXXXX.XTN file to restore it to its previous state.
