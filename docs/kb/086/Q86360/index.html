------------

This file provides important information not included in the
"Microsoft Getting Started" manual, the "Microsoft MS-DOS
User's Guide and Reference," the "Windows User's Guide" or in
online Help. Specifically, this file addresses problems with
updating networks.

For information about other files and documentation, see the
"Welcome" section of "Getting Started."

Caution: If you use a network, read the information about
        your network in this file BEFORE installing Windows
        3.1 and MS DOS 5.0.

Note: This file contains information which should be used if
     you are upgrading to both MS-DOS 5 and Windows 3.1. If
     for some reason you are upgrading only to Windows, see
     the NETWORKS.WRI file. For the location of the file, see
     the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1.

1. Introduction

If you use a network, you might need to update one or more files on
your hard disk before you set up Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. This file contains basic information about upgrading
networks which is appropriate for someone with experience setting up
networks and personal computers. If you do not have this experience,
you should get someone who does to help you ensure your network
software is compatible with Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0.

In many cases, there are separate network files which may need
updating to support MS-DOS vs. Windows 3.1. Thus, you should find the
section of this document which pertains to the network you have and
read the entire section once before trying to do anything. In many
sections, there may be a subsection for the Windows procedure and a
subsection for the MS-DOS procedure.

There are new versions of files for many widely used networks included
with this package of Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS. To make these networks
compatible with Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0, follow the procedure
outlined for your network to install the appropriate file (or files)
on your hard disk. For some networks, the network vendor should supply
the necessary files.

Important: To find which Setup Disk has a specific file, use any text
editor to open the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1 and then search
for the filename.

In general, if you are using a network:

o Check the list in Chapter 1, "Upgrading from a Previous
 Version of DOS to Windows and MS-DOS," of "Getting Started"
 to determine whether your network needs to be updated.

o Follow the procedures in this file to update your
 network files.

o If you have trouble after updating, see
 "Getting Started" for possible solutions.

You need to be familiar with the following tasks to successfully carry
out the procedures in this file:

o Using MS-DOS to change drives and directories

o Working with network software

o Searching a disk for a file

o Searching a file for text

o Editing a text file

o Renaming or backing up files

o Working with paths

o Identifying when a file was created

3.   General Notes

o There are many settings in the SYSTEM.INI file that affect
 the way Windows interacts with a network. You can change
 these settings to correct most problems you might have
 operating Windows with your network. See the SYSINI.WRI
 online document for information about changing the
 following SYSTEM.INI settings:

 [Boot]
 Network.drv=

 [Standard]
 Int28Filter=
 NetHeapSize=

 [386Enh]
 AllVMsExclusive=
 EMMExclude=
 FileSysChange=
 InDOSPolling=
 Int28Critical=
 NetAsyncFallback=
 NetAsyncTimeout=
 NetDMASize=
 NetHeapSize=
 Network=
 PSPIncrement=
 ReflectDOSInt2A=
 TimerCriticalSection=
 TokenRingSearch=
 UniqueDOSPSP=

o Many networks require the TimerCriticalSection entry
 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set
 to a value of 10000 or greater. For more information, see
 the SYSINI.WRI file.

o The default value for the NetHeapSize entry in the
 [Standard] section of the SYSTEM.INI file is 8K. Although
 some applications require this value, in most cases you
 can decrease the value to 4K in order to increase the
 amount of memory available to your applications. A few
 applications require the value to be 4K.

o If for some reason you use Setup to change your
 network configuration after you have already set up
 Windows, Setup might not remove all support for your
 previous network selection. Unnecessary files might be
 left in your Windows directory, and entries might be left
 in your WIN.INI or SYSTEM.INI files that could harm your
 system's performance. If you change your network
 configuration, check the notes about both your previous
 and new selections to see if any previous entries are no
 longer required.

o Some network adapter cards require the
 ExcludeHighRegion (or EMMExclude) entry in the [386Enh]
 section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set to the memory
 range used by the card. For more information, see your
 network-adapter documentation and the SYSINI.WRI file.

 These cards may also require an X= option on the EMM386
 command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For more
 information, see chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the
 "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

o Some network cards and some network transport stacks
 require special handling. Consult the following sections
 not only for the manufacturer of your network but also for
 the manufacturer of your network adapter and your
 transport stack.

o Many networks have pop-up message facilities that
 allow you to see messages sent from other servers or
 workstations. In most cases, these pop-up programs will
 cause the Windows part of Setup to fail if a message is
 received while setting up. Many networks provide
 additional utilities that allow them to work with Windows
 once Windows is set up, but these are generally not
 available during Setup. You should make sure any such pop-
 up service is disabled before setting up Windows. Please
 consult specific entries regarding your network in the
 following sections, or consult your network documentation
 for instructions.

o If you configured your remote-boot workstation to run
 Windows version 3.0, you may be loading a program called
 RIPLMEM.EXE or RPLMEM.EXE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT. This
 program is no longer required for running Windows version
 3.1.

o The Windows Resource Kit for the Microsoft Windows
 Operating System Version 3.1 contains additional
 information about setting up and configuring Windows for
 use with a network, and information for system
 administrators. This kit provides complete technical
 information about Windows version 3.1 for the support
 professional. It includes a technical reference manual,
 and a disk containing helpful utilities, system resource
 viewers, drivers, and accessories.

 To order the Windows Resource Kit within the United
 States, dial:

 1-800-642-7676

 To order outside of the United States, dial the phone
 number for your area. You can find this number on the
 International Subsidiary card.

o If you are running a shared copy of Windows from a network
 drive, make sure both your personal Windows directory and
 the shared network directory are included on the PATH
 command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

o If you receive sharing violations while running a shared
 copy of Windows, make sure that all of the files in the
 shared network directory are marked as read-only.

o If you have problems running a shared copy of Windows,
 remove the MS-DOS SHARE command from your system. With
 some networks, the MS-DOS SHARE utility must not be loaded
 on a workstation to run a shared copy of Windows.

o If you have problems and your network software is loaded
 high (in the upper memory area between 640K and 1 MB), try
 loading the network in conventional memory.

o Windows Print Manager spools print jobs to the location
 specified by the MS-DOS environment variable TEMP. If TEMP
 is not set, Print Manager will use the root of drive C.
 For diskless workstations, set the TEMP variable either to
 a RAM disk or to the location of a network directory (you
 must have full access to this directory). The TEMP
 variable may be set by placing a SET TEMP= statement in
 the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or network login script. For
 example, to spool to the network directory
 X:\USERNAME\WINUSER\TEMP, you would use the statement
 SET TEMP=x:\username\winuser\temp. Each user must have a
 personal TEMP directory.

o On some diskless workstations, you will not be able to
 start Windows in standard mode unless you have a TEMP
 environment variable set or you have added a swapdisk
 entry in the [NonWindowsApp] section of the SYSTEM.INI
 file. For more information about the swapdisk entry, see
 the SYSINI.WRI file.

o If you are running a peer-to-peer network, you may not be
 able to format a floppy disk by using File Manager. You
 can use the FORMAT command at the MS-DOS prompt instead.

o Some networks ship with their own copies of files that are
 included with Windows version 3.1. Usually Windows
 includes a newer version, and upgrades the one provided
 with the network when you run Setup. However, if you
 install the network after installing Windows 3.1, some
 network installation programs will overwrite the newer
 file provided with Windows with their own, older version.
 This older version may lack features provided in the newer
 version, or it may not function properly with Windows 3.1.
 You should back up your network and Windows files before
 upgrading your network software. If problems occur, you
 may need to restore the previous version of some files.

o If you use the MS-DOS Shell, note that most network
 software won't work correctly if you start it from an
 MS-DOS Shell command prompt. Start your network before
 starting MS-DOS Shell.

o You can install both Windows and MS-DOS from a network
 share point. To do so, carry out the following procedure:

 1. Make sure your network is running with at least one
    server and one client.

 2. Restart the client computer by inserting Setup disk 1
    into drive A, and pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

 3. Press ENTER at the Welcome screen. Then, at the next
    screen, press F3 twice to quit Setup.

 4. Create an INSTALL directory on the hard drive and make the
    drive current by typing the following at the command prompt:

    c:
    md install
    cd install

 5. Copy all the files on the disk to the INSTALL directory
    by typing the following at the command prompt:

    copy a:\*.* c:\install

 6. Insert each of the remaining Setup disks and copy all the files
    to the INSTALL directory.

 7. Expand the ATTRIB.EX_ file by typing the following at the
    command prompt:

    expand attrib.ex_ attrib.exe

 8. Insert Setup disk 1 into drive A.

 9. Remove the attributes from the IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS files by typing
    the following at the command prompt:

    attrib -h -s -r a:\io.sys
    attrib -h -s -r a:\msdos.sys

 10. Copy the IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS files to the INSTALL directory
     by typing the following at the command prompt:

     copy a:\io.sys c:\intall
     copy a:\msdos.sys c:\install

 11. Delete the ATTRIB.EXE file in the INSTALL directory by typing
     the following at the command prompt:

     del c:\install\attrib.exe

 12. Remove Setup disk 1 from drive A, and restart your computer
     by typing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

 13. Connect to the network and create a directory called DOSWIN
     on the network drive.

 14. Run Setup by typing the following at the command prompt:

     c:\install\setup /a

 15. Follow the directions on your screen.

 16. To install Windows and MS-DOS on a client computer from the
     network share point, connect to the network drive and run
     Setup by typing the following at the command prompt:

     dwsetup

 17. Follow the instructions on your screen.

o If you have copied the Windows and MS-DOS files to a network
 share point by typing "setup /a," and you want to run Windows
 from the network on a client computer, make sure you set up
 MS-DOS 5.0 only on the client computer before you type
 "setup /n."

4. Novell NetWare

Note: The procedures for Microsoft Windows 3.1 and MS-
     DOS 5.0 are integrated in this section.

Additional Notes at Press Time:

    NetWare Shell Version (NETX.COM):

    The NetWare workstation shell software is Novell's
    basic DOS shell and is included with MS-DOS 5.0.  You
    may require a different shell for a specific
    application.  Contact your authorized Novell reseller
    if you believe another shell may be needed. EMSNET5.EXE
    and XMSNET5.EXE, alternate shells, are available from
    Novell.

    Novell Remote Workstations (RPLFIX.COM):
    If you can't load MS-DOS 5.0 on your remote-boot
    workstation, contact Novell for the RPLFIX.COM file.

    Drive Mapping Utilities:
    If you run LOGIN.EXE, MAP.EXE, and SESSION.EXE from MS-
    DOS Shell or while MS-DOS Shell is running, a search
    path is not added to the existing path. Use these
    programs before starting MS-DOS Shell.

    TBMI2.COM and Task Swapper:
    If you can't use Task Swapper in MS-DOS Shell when
    running a Novell network, do the following:
    1. Expand and copy the IPX.OB_ and TBMI2.CO_ files to
       your hard disk. If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file has a
       command that loads the NET3.COM or NET4.COM file,
       expand and copy the file from the Setup disk to
       the hard drive.

       See the PACKING.LST file on Setup
       disk 1 for the location of the files and for
       instructions on how to use the EXPAND command.

    2. Use the IPX.OBJ file to create a new IPX.COM file.
       For information about creating an IPX.COM file, see
       your Novell documentation.

    3. Start your network, using the new IPX.COM and
       NETX.COM files.

    4. Start TBMI2.COM.

    5. Start the application that may be causing problems
       with Task Swapper.  Run the application and then exit.

    6. Display diagnostic information by typing the
       following:
       tbmi2 /d

    7. If the value in the field named Far Call Usage is
       not 0, you need to run TBMI2.COM before using Task
       Swapper.

       To get help with TBMI2.COM, type the following:
       tbmi2 /?

       The default configuration for TBMI2.COM is correct for
       most applications. If you need help configuring the
       program, contact Novell.

The Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade includes updated
versions of several Novell NetWare files that are required
to run with Windows 3.1. If you are running Novell NetWare,
the Windows part of Setup will copy the following files to
the SYSTEM subdirectory of your Windows directory (or the
shared network directory if you set up a shared copy of
Windows by using setup /n):

NETX.COM (version 3.26)
IPX.OBJ (version 3.10)
TBMI2.COM (version 2.1)
IPXODI.COM (version 1.20)
LSL.COM (version 1.21)

Before running Windows you may need to do the following:

o Replace your current NetWare shell with the NETX.COM
 provided (if your current NetWare shell is older than the
 version provided). Windows 3.1 requires that the NetWare
 shell components on your workstation (such as NETX.COM) be
 version 3.01 or higher. You can use these shell components
 even if your servers are running older versions of NetWare
 (as early as NetWare 2.10).

 Your current shell may have one of the following names:

 NET3.COM        XMSNET3.EXE     EMSNET3.EXE
 NET4.COM        XMSNET4.EXE     EMSNET4.EXE
 NETX.COM        XMSNET5.EXE     EMSNET5.EXE
 NETX.COM        XMSNETX.EXE     EMSNETX.EXE

 NETX.COM will run on MS-DOS versions 3.1 or higher. The
 EMS and XMS versions of the shell are available from your
 Novell dealer.

Note: The EMS NetWare shells (EMSNETX.EXE, etc.) are not
     supported when Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode.

If you have a NetWare version earlier than 2.1, contact your
network vendor for an update.

To update the NETX command for NetWare versions 3.11 or
earlier:

1. Expand and copy the NETX.CO_ file to your network directory.
  See the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 for the location of
  the files and for instructions on how to use the EXPAND command.

2. Replace the network startup command in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file with the NETX command.

After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For information about installing MS-DOS 5.0, see
"Getting Started."

Note: If you use any programs specific to Internetwork
     Packet Exchange (IPX), such as NVER, SYSCON, and
     RCONSOLE, you need to take additional steps to run
     these programs with MS-DOS Task Swapper. For more
     information about running these programs with MS-DOS
     Task Swapper, see the README.TXT file. See the
     PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 for the location of
     the README.TXT file.

o If you are running Novell IPXODI.COM and LSL.COM, you need
 to upgrade these to versions 1.20 or higher. Use the files
 provided with Windows and copy them from the SYSTEM
 subdirectory of your Windows directory (or your shared
 network directory) to the directory where your existing
 versions are located.

o To run Windows in standard mode, load the TBMI2.COM memory-
 resident utility when running Windows. Novell recommends
 that you create a batch file that will load this utility,
 start Windows, and then unload the utility when you quit
 Windows. The batch file could be named RUNWIN.BAT and look
 like this:

 TBMI2
 WIN
 TBMI2 /U

 TBMI2 enables you to safely run applications that use the
 NetWare IPX and SPX functions in standard mode Windows or
 the MS-DOS 5.0 task switcher.

o If you are running Novell IPX.COM, create a new version using
 the IPX.OBJ file. For information about creating an IPX.COM
 file, see your Novell documentation.

In addition:

o If you enable 32-bit disk access and you are running the
 XMS shell rather than one of the standard NetWare shells
 (NETX.COM, etc.), you can further improve performance by
 setting the OverlappedIO entry in the [386Enh] section of
 your SYSTEM.INI file to On.

o Do not try to log in, log out, attach, or detach a Novell
 server from the MS-DOS Prompt within Windows. You should log
 in before starting Windows, and attach or detach servers
 by using File Manager or the Printers option in Control
 Panel.

o If you experience problems starting applications while
 running Windows or Windows applications from a file
 server, make sure you are not running the MS-DOS SHARE
 utility. Current versions of the NetWare shell are not
 fully compatible with SHARE.

o If you have a Western Digital Ethercard Plus and have
 problems accessing drives by using the MAP ROOT command,
 contact Western Digital for an updated driver.

o By default, NetWare gives you access to only 40 files at a
 time. When you are running applications with Windows, you
 can exceed this limit rather quickly. If so, you might see
 unexpected error messages. To increase the file access
 limit, add the following line to your SHELL.CFG file:

 file handles = 60

 You should also add the following to your CONFIG.SYS file:

 files = 60

o If you get unusable output when printing to a NetWare
 server (such as incorrect fonts, garbled text, invalid
 page breaks, or blank lines), you may need to edit your
 print-job configuration. Try using the NetWare PRINTCON
 utility to set the Auto Endcap and Enable Timeout options
 to No.

o When running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, swapping to a
 drive on a NetWare 286 server might make starting Windows
 take up to a minute. See Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows,"
 in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for information
 about controlling the location of your swap file.

o A NetWare file server does not include the directory
 entries dot (.) and double dot (..) as MS-DOS does.
 However, the NetWare shell (version 3.01 or higher) can
 emulate these entries when applications attempt to list
 the files in a directory. If you have problems listing
 files or deleting directories, turning on the Show Dots
 feature will help. Add the following line to your
 SHELL.CFG file:

 show dots = on

 Turning on Show Dots will cause problems with earlier
 versions of some 286-based NetWare utilities, such as
 BINDFIX.EXE and MAKEUSER.EXE. Make sure you upgrade these
 utilities if you upgrade your NetWare shell. For more
 information, contact your Novell dealer.

o Redirected drives can look different in Windows than they
 did without Windows. For example, a device mapped as
 FileServerName/Volume:Directory will appear in Windows as
 FileServerName/Volume:\, showing the root of the file
 server's shared volume, rather than the subdirectory you
 expected. You can correct this with the MAP ROOT entry
 explained in the following information.

o In some cases, Windows applications may change the default
 directory on a drive. This might cause problems if, for
 example, your path includes the current directory on a
 network drive (that is, your path includes a drive letter
 without a specific directory, such as z: instead of
 z:\system).

 You can prevent this problem by using MAP.EXE and
 LOGIN.EXE versions 3.0 and later to set up fake roots, or
 by choosing the MAP ROOT function when mapping a
 connection in File Manager. This feature simulates the
 MS-DOS SUBST command, which sets the root of a given drive
 to a directory designated by the user instead of to the
 true root of the volume.

 For example, suppose you normally mapped drive F to the
 HOME\TERRI directory on the COUNT\SYS volume, and then
 included F: in your path. You would do this by including
 the following command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by
 typing the command before starting Windows:

 map f:=count\sys:home\terri

 The default directory on drive F would then be HOME\TERRI.
 To prevent Windows from changing this, you would replace
 the command above with the one shown below:

 map root f:=count\sys:home\terri

 This command would make the directory HOME\TERRI appear to
 be the root drive F.

o If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you can
 adjust the way Windows handles your network drive mappings
 by using the Network option in Control Panel.

 Normally, when you quit Windows, all of your drive
 mappings are restored to the way they were before you
 started Windows, and all changes you made inside Windows
 are lost. If you clear the Restore Drives option, the
 mappings you made inside Windows will remain when you quit
 Windows.

 Typically, each instance of the MS-DOS Prompt you start from
 Windows has its own set of drive mappings. Changes you
 make in one instance do not affect another. If you set the
 NWShareHandles option, drive mappings will instead be
 global, and changes made in one instance of the MS-DOS Prompt
 will affect all other applications. If you are running a
 NetWare 286 server, setting NWShareHandles increases the
 number of workstations that can be connected to the server
 before the server runs out of available connections.

 See the Help available in the Network dialog box in
 Control Panel for more information on these options.

o When setting up Windows for use with Novell NetWare, the
 following entry is added to the [windows] section of your
 WIN.INI file:

 load=nwpopup.exe

 This automatically starts the NetWare pop-up utility,
 which displays your incoming broadcast messages.

o If you are running Novell NetBIOS, you may need to specify
 TimerCriticalSection=10000 in the [386Enh] section of the
 SYSTEM.INI file.

o If you have applications or files that use extended
 characters (ASCII characters above 128) and you have
 problems viewing or using them, try adding the following
 line to your SHELL.CFG file:

 special uppercase = on

o When connecting or disconnecting network resources from
 File Manager,  Print Manager, or Control Panel, pay
 attention to the state of the Permanent check box. If this
 option is checked when you make a connection, the
 connection is automatically made each time you restart
 Windows. To stop reconnecting, disconnect with the
 Permanent option checked. If the option is not checked
 when you disconnect, the connection is removed for the
 current Windows session, but is reconnected when you
 restart Windows.

5.   Banyan VINES

5.1. MS-DOS Procedure

Banyan VINES version 4.1 is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
You can use Banyan VINES version 4.0x with MS-DOS 5.0 if you
have the REDIRALL.EXE or REDIR4.EXE file in the BANYAN
directory on your hard disk.

If neither file is on your hard disk, but you have the VINES
installation disks that include one of  these files, copy
the file to the directory on your hard disk that contains
network files.

If the files are not on either your hard disk or the VINES
installation disks, contact your Banyan VINES network
vendor.

If you have a VINES version earlier than 4.0, contact your
network vendor for an update.

Note: If you are upgrading from MS-DOS version 4.x, you
     do not need to update your network files.

5.2. Windows Procedure

Setup will correctly handle the following Banyan VINES
versions:

o Banyan VINES 4.0 is compatible with Microsoft Network and
 will be handled as such by Windows.

o Banyan VINES 4.1 and later come with additional Windows
 components, which are installed when you set up Windows
 for use with Banyan VINES 4.1.

See the following sections for information about running
these versions of VINES with Windows.

Note: You should start VINES and log in before starting
     Windows. Banyan does not support logging in while
     Windows is running. If you start Windows when the
     network is not loaded or you are not logged in, you
     will receive one or more error messages indicating that
     you will not be able to use VINES functions from within
     Windows.

5.2.1. Banyan VINES 4.0x

When you set up Windows for use with Banyan VINES 4.0x, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file:

TimerCriticalSection=5000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5

See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these settings.

o To use Windows printing functions with VINES 4.0, you must
 have VINES 4.00(5) or later and must have the NetBIOS
 support loaded. If you cannot print to a network printer,
 ask your network administrator to verify that you are
 loading NetBIOS and that you are running the proper
 version of VINES.

o If you are running VINES 4.0 with Windows running in 386
 enhanced mode and want to run non-Windows applications
 that use NetBIOS, you must install VINES 4.00(5) or later.
 In addition, you will need to start NetBIOS before
 starting Windows.

 If you start VINES NetBIOS support before starting Windows
 in standard mode, you may not be able to start any non-
 Windows applications. If you have this problem, load
 NetBIOS from within Windows, or contact your Banyan dealer
 for more information.

o Versions below site-specific patch 0H will not support
 Windows running in 386 enhanced mode.

o If you are running VINES version 4.0x and you have a
 problem with print jobs that time-out intermittently, you
 can either update to VINES 4.1x, or use the VINES SETPRINT
 utility to remove the timeout on your printer port by
 specifying the following:

 SETPRINT lptn servicename /D:INFINITE

 Lptn is the printer port, and servicename is the name of
 the network print queue.

5.2.2. Banyan VINES 4.1x

When you set up Windows for use with Banyan VINES 4.1, the
following entries are added to the [386Enh] section of your
SYSTEM.INI file:

Network=*dosnet, *vnetbios, vvinesd.386
TimerCriticalSection=5000
UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
PSPIncrement=5

See SYSINI.WRI for more information on these settings.

In addition:

o If you are running VINES 4.10 or 4.11 (below 4.11(5)) and
 you have problems printing, you may need to upgrade your
 VINES.DRV. This driver is available from Banyan.

o If you are running Banyan VINES 4.10 or 4.11, you do not
 need to load NetBIOS unless you are running NetBIOS-
 specific applications.  (It is not required for printing,
 as it is with VINES 4.0x.)

 If you are running version 4.10 and you want to run
 NetBIOS-specific applications with Windows running in 386
 enhanced mode, you must start NetBIOS before starting
 Windows. However, you can only run a single NetBIOS
 application at a time.

 If you are running version 4.11, you can load NetBIOS
 either before starting Windows or after starting Windows
 in 386 enhanced mode.

 If you want to run NetBIOS with Windows running in
 standard mode, you must load NetBIOS from within Windows.
 If you load NetBIOS before starting Windows, you will not
 be able to start any non-Windows applications.

 For more information on running memory-resident
 applications after starting Windows, see Chapter 7, "Non-
 Windows Applications," in the "Microsoft Windows User's
 Guide."

6.   Microsoft LAN Manager and 100-Percent Compatible
    Networks

6.1. MS-DOS Procedure

Follow the procedures in this section if you are using one
of the following networks:

o Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.1 or earlier

o 3Com 3+Open, versions 1.1 through 2.0

o Hewlett-Packard LAN Manager, version A.02.00 or earlier

o NCR LAN Manager, all versions

o Olivetti Olinet-LM, version 2.0 or earlier

o Ungermann-Bass Net/One LM, versions 1.1 through 2.0

The updating procedure differs, depending on which version
of LAN Manager you are using. Follow the instructions for
the version you have. If you are not sure which version
you have, see the following section.

6.1.1. Determining Which Version You Are Using

To determine which version you are using, type the following
at the command prompt:

net config workstation

If you see information about your configuration, you have an
Enhanced version. This information indicates whether you
have Enhanced version 2.x or Enhanced version 1.x.

If you receive an error message when you type the command,
you have a Basic version. To find out whether you have Basic
version 2.x or Basic version 1.x, check the creation dates
of the files in your LAN Manager directory (typically
C:\\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC). If the files are dated before July
1990, you have version 1.x. Files dated after July 1990 are
typically version 2.0; files dated after July 1991 are
typically version 2.1.

Note: If you installed 3Com 3+Share with minimal NetBIOS
     implementation, do one of the following:
     - Reinstall with a complete NetBIOS implementation.
     - Copy the REDIR.400 file to replace the MSREDIR.EXE
       file on your hard disk.
     - Call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) and request the LAN
       Manager 2.0 supplemental disk; see your registration
       card for the phone number.

6.1.2  Microsoft LAN Manager Version 2.1

No MS-DOS procedure is required for Microsoft LAN Manager Version
2.1.

6.1.3. Microsoft LAN Manager Version 2.0 Enhanced

To update LAN Manager version 2.x Enhanced, replace your
current NETWKSTA.EXE and NETBEUI.DOS files with the new
versions included with the Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0
Upgrade. It's a good idea to preserve your current files by
renaming them with a different extension, such as .OLD or
.BAK.

To update LAN Manager version 2.x Enhanced:

1. Rename the following files:

  NETWKSTA.EXE (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG) to
  NETBEUI.DOS (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI)

2. Copy the EXPAND.EXE file on Setup disk 1 to the DOS directory
  on the hard drive.

3. Open the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 to determine the
  location of the NETWKSTA.2X_ and NETBEUI.DO_ files.

4. Use the following syntax to expand and copy the new
  files to your network directory:

  expand [drive1:]netwksta.2x_ [drive2:][path]netwksta.exe
  expand [drive1:]netbeui.do_ [drive2:][path]netbeui.dos

  The [drive1:] parameter specifies the location of the
  compressed file you want to expand. The [drive2:][path]
  parameter specifies the destination for the expanded file.

  For example, if the NETWKSTA.2X_ file is on a disk in
  drive A, and your NETWKSTA.EXE file is in the
  LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG directory on drive C, type this at the
  command prompt:

  expand a:\netwksta.2x_ c:\lanman.dos\netprog\netwksta.exe

  Note: Do not restart your computer.

After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For information about installing MS-DOS, see
"Getting Started."

For information about loading LAN Manager device drivers
into the upper memory area, see the README.TXT file. For
the location of the README.TXT file, see the PACKING.LST
file on Setup disk 1.

Note: Do not use the MS-DOS LOADHIGH command with the
     LAN Manager net start command. The net start command
     loads the network redirector (NETWKSTA.EXE) into the
     upper memory area. If you do not want to load
     NETWKSTA.EXE into the upper memory area, add the UMB=NO
     command to the [workstation] section of your LANMAN.INI
     file.

Note: If you are running Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x
     Enhanced or an OEM version of LAN Manager 2.x Enhanced,
     you may want to take advantage of any remaining space
     in the upper memory area by loading LAN Manager
     services such as NETPOPUP in this area. Call Microsoft
     Customer Service to request the LAN Manager 2.0
     supplemental disk and technical notes. See your
     registration card for the phone number.

Note: If you are running Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x
     Enhanced and get a "NET3055" message, do ONE of the
     following:
     o Use the RAM switch in the DEVICE command for EMM386
       in your CONFIG.SYS file, and the LIM=YES command in
       the [workstation] section of your LANMAN.INI file.
     o Use the NOEMS switch in the DEVICE command for
       EMM386 in your CONFIG.SYS file, and the LIM=NO
       command in the [workstation] section of your
       LANMAN.INI file.

6.1.4. Microsoft LAN Manager Version 2.x Basic

To update LAN Manager version 2.x Basic, replace your
current REDIR.EXE, NET.EXE, and NETBEUI.DOS files with the
new versions included with the Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0
Upgrade. It's a good idea to preserve your current files by
renaming them with a different extension, such as .OLD or
.BAK.

To update LAN Manager version 2.0 Basic:

1. Rename the following files:

  REDIR.EXE (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\REDIR)
  NET.EXE (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC)
  NETBEUI.DOS (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI)

2. Copy the EXPAND.EXE file on Setup disk 1 to the DOS directory
  on the hard drive.

3. Open the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 to determine the
  location of the REDIR.2X_, NET.EX_, and NETBEUI.DO_ files.

4. Use the following syntax to expand and copy the new
  files to your network directory:

  expand [drive1:]redir.2x_ [drive2:][path]redir.exe
  expand [drive1:]net.ex_ [drive2:][path]net.exe
  expand [drive1:]netbeui.do_ [drive2:][path]netbeui.dos

  The [drive1:] parameter specifies the location of the
  compressed file you want to expand. The [drive2:][path]
  parameter specifies the destination for the expanded file.

  For example, if the REDIR.2X_ file is on a disk in drive
  A, and your REDIR.EXE file is in the LANMAN.DOS\REDIR
  directory on drive C, type this at the command prompt:

  expand a:\redir.2x_ c:\lanman.dos\redir\redir.exe

After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For information about installing MS-DOS, see
"Getting Started."

Note: After updating your network, REDIR.EXE loads into
     the upper memory area. If you do not want to load
     REDIR.EXE into the upper memory area, add the UMB=NO
     command to your LANMAN.INI file. The UMB=NO command
     must directly follow the START RDR $1 command.

6.1.5. Microsoft LAN Manager Version 1.x Enhanced

To update LAN Manager version 1.x Enhanced, replace your
current NETWKSTA.EXE file with the new version included with
the Microsoft Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade. It's a
good idea to preserve your current file by renaming it with
a different extension, such as .OLD or .BAK.

To update LAN Manager version 1.x Enhanced:

1. Rename the following file:

  NETWKSTA.EXE (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG)

2. Copy the EXPAND.EXE file on Setup disk 1 to the DOS directory
  on the hard drive.

3. Open the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 to determine the
  location of the NETWKSTA.1X_ file.

4. Use the following syntax to expand and copy the new file
  to your network directory:

  expand [drive1:]netwksta.1x_ [drive2:][path]netwksta.exe

  The [drive1:] parameter specifies the location of the
  compressed file you want to expand. The [drive2:][path]
  parameter specifies the destination for the expanded file.

  For example, if the NETWKSTA.1X_ file is on a disk in
  drive A, and your NETWKSTA.EXE file is in the LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
  directory on drive C, type this at the command prompt:

  expand a:\netwksta.1x_ c:\lanman.dos\netprog\netwksta.exe

  Note: Do not restart your computer.

After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For information about installing MS-DOS, see
"Getting Started."

Note: Do not use the LOADHIGH command to load any LAN
     Manager version 1.x files into the upper memory area.
     This might result in memory conflicts that could cause
     your system to fail.

6.1.6. Microsoft LAN Manager Version 1.x Basic

To update LAN Manager version 1.x Basic, replace your
current REDIR.EXE file with the new version included with
the Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS 5.0 Upgrade. It's a good idea to
preserve your current file by renaming it with a different
extension, such as .OLD or .BAK.

To update LAN Manager version 1.x Basic:

1. Rename the following file:

  REDIR.EXE (usually in C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC)

2. Copy the EXPAND.EXE file on Setup disk 1 to the DOS directory
  on the hard drive.

3. Open the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 to determine the
  location of the REDIR.1X_ file.

4. Use the following syntax to expand and copy the new file
  to your network directory:

  expand [drive1:]redir.1x_ [drive2:][path]redir.exe

  The [drive1:] parameter specifies the location of the
  compressed file you want to expand. The [drive2:][path]
  parameter specifies the destination for the expanded file.

  For example, if the REDIR.1X_ file is on a disk in drive
  A, and your REDIR.EXE file is in the LANMAN.DOS\BASIC
  directory on drive C, type this at the command prompt:

  expand a:\redir.1x_ c:\lanman.dos\basic\redir.exe

After you complete the procedure, set up MS-DOS 5.0 on your
computer. For information about installing MS-DOS, see
"Getting Started."

Note: Do not use the LOADHIGH command to load any LAN
     Manager version 1.x files into the upper memory area.
     This might result in memory conflicts that could cause
     your system to fail.

6.2. Windows Procedure

Many networks, such as IBM LAN Server, Digital Pathworks,
and 3Com 3+Open, are based on Microsoft LAN Manager. Consult
your network documentation, network distributor, or system
administrator to learn whether your network belongs in this
category, and if so, on which version of LAN Manager it is
based.

The following notes include general information about using
LAN Manager networks and information about specific versions
of LAN Manager.

6.2.1. Ungermann-Bass Net/One

o Ungermann-Bass Net/One LAN Manager is based on Microsoft
 LAN Manager. Choose the Microsoft LAN Manager option when
 running the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program. Setup should
 correctly identify your network and the proper version
 number.

In addition:

If you are using an Ungermann-Bass network card with any
network, including networks not produced by Ungermann-Bass,
your system may not run correctly in 386 enhanced mode
unless you have the proper settings in your SYSTEM.INI file.

If you experience problems, follow these steps:

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI file by using a text editor such
  as Notepad. SYSTEM.INI is located in your Windows
  directory.

2. Find or add the [386Enh] section in the file.

  If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
  choosing Find from the Search menu, typing [386Enh], and
  then choosing the OK button.

3. Find or add the TimerCriticalSection=10000 line in
  this section.

4. Save your SYSTEM.INI file.

5. Quit and restart Windows.

6.2.2. Using the Ungermann-Bass XNS Transport Stack

If you are using the Ungermann-Bass XNS transport stack and
running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you must make sure the
transport stack is not using expanded memory. If your system
is configured to provide expanded memory with a memory
manager such as EMM386, you can disable that product's
expanded-memory option. Or, if you want to continue using
expanded memory, you can disable its use by using the
Ungermann-Bass transport stack as follows:

1. Open your PROTOCOL.INI file by using a text editor
  such as Windows Notepad. PROTOCOL.INI is located in your
  LAN Manager directory.

2. Find the section [XNS_XIF].

  If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
  choosing Find from the Search menu, typing [XNS_XIF], and
  then choosing the OK button.

3. Add a line NOEMM, or, if the line already exists,
  make sure that it is not commented out with a semicolon
  (;) at the beginning of the line.

4. Save your PROTOCOL.INI file.

5. Restart your workstation.

6.2.3. Using LAN Manager and Expanded Memory

If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, it is
recommended that you not use expanded memory with LAN
Manager. If you do, you may find that your system slows down
considerably or it may lock up occasionally. If this is a
problem, turn off the use of expanded memory by modifying
your LANMAN.INI and PROTOCOL.INI files. The exact procedure
will vary depending on what components you are running. See
your LAN Manager documentation for further details.

1. Open your LANMAN.INI file by using a text editor such
  as Notepad. LANMAN.INI is located in your LAN Manager
  directory.

2. Find or add the section [workstation].

  If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
  choosing Find from the Search menu, typing [workstation],
  and then choosing the OK button.

3. Find or add the LIM= line in this section, and then
  edit it to read:

  LIM=NO

4. Save your LANMAN.INI file.

5. Restart your workstation.

Or you can stop your workstation and restart it again using
the net stop workstation and net start workstation commands.

In addition, you may want to configure other network
components (such as protocol stacks) to avoid using expanded
memory. Consult your network documentation for the specific
component for instructions on how to do this.

6.2.4. Using Pop-up Services

LAN Manager Enhanced includes pop-up services you can use to
see incoming broadcast messages. These pop-up services can
disrupt the Windows screen display, so you must either
disable them or run the LAN Manager WinPopup utility so they
can coexist with Windows.

The WinPopup utility should be located in your LAN Manager
NETPROG directory, included in your path. To automatically
start the utility when you start Windows, include the
following entry in the [windows] section of your WIN.INI:

load=winpopup.exe

If you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager version 2.0
or 2.1 Enhanced, the Windows part of Setup adds this line to
your WIN.INI file. If you are running LAN Manager 1.x
Enhanced, you must insert this line yourself. See WININI.WRI
for information on modifying your WIN.INI file. If you are
using LAN Manager 1.x, you also need to obtain an updated
version of NETPOPUP.EXE from your network dealer.

Note: Windows version 3.1 includes an updated version of
     the WinPopup utility. This utility may not be
     compatible with all networks that are based on
     Microsoft LAN Manager. If you are running AT&amp;T/NCR
     StarGroup LAN Manager version 2.0 Release 3.5, you
     should use the WNETMSG utility provided instead of
     WinPopup.

Alternatively, if you want to disable the pop-up services,
use the following procedure:

1. Find your LAN Manager root directory.

2. Use Notepad to open the LANMAN.INI file, and locate
  the line that begins with WRKSERVICES=.

3. Remove the NETPOPUP or MINIPOP entry from this line.

  If you remove the netpopup and minipop entries but leave
  the messenger entry, messages will still be received but
  will be recorded in the MESSAGES.LOG file in your LAN
  Manager directory rather than being displayed on the
  screen. If you do not want to log your messages, you can
  also remove the messenger entry from this same line.

4. Save the file.

5. Quit Windows, and then restart your workstation.

6.2.5. LAN Manager Basic

When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager Basic (all
versions), the following entry is added to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

network=*dosnet, *vnetbios, lanman10.386

See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.

Network software based on LAN Manager Basic, or on LAN
Manager Enhanced without full API support, must not be
loaded in the high memory area (the first 64K of extended
memory).

You need to modify the LANMAN.INI file in your network
directory to prevent the network from loading in the HMA.
Find all lines that begin with REDIR and add the following
command-line option to each:

/HIMEM:NO

6.2.6. LAN Manager 1.x

Some early copies of LAN Manager 1.x require a maintenance
upgrade to run with Windows. If you experience problems,
contact your network vendor for an upgrade.

6.2.7. LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced

When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager 2.0
Enhanced, the following entry is added to the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

network=*vnetbios, *dosnet

See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.

For Windows to support LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced, you must
have the files NETAPI.DLL, PMSPL.DLL, LANMAN.DRV,
LANMAN.HLP, WINPOPUP.EXE, and WINPOPUP.HLP. These files are
located in your LAN Manager NETPROG directory, which should
be in your path. Windows also includes updated versions of
these files, which will be automatically installed on some
older versions of LAN Manager.

6.2.8. LAN Manager 2.1 Basic

If you upgrade from an earlier version of LAN Manager Basic
to version 2.1 Basic using the Over-the-Network Upgrade
process, your SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files may be left with
incorrect information. This will only happen if your upgrade
procedure has been configured to update Windows
installations.

This problem will cause you to receive a warning that
"WinPopup" cannot be found, and all network functions in
Windows File Manager, Print Manager, and Control Panel will
be unavailable.

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open your WIN.INI file by using a text editor such as
  Notepad. WIN.INI is located in your Windows directory.

2. Find or add the load= line in the file.

  If you're using Notepad, you can find this section by
  choosing Find from the Search menu, typing load=, and then
  choosing the OK button.

3. Remove the word WinPopup or WinPopup.exe from this
  line.

4. Save your WIN.INI file.

5. Quit Windows.

6. Change to the Windows directory.

7. Start Windows Setup by typing setup at the MS-DOS
  prompt.

8. Choose the Network entry to display a list of network
  options.

9. Choose the option Microsoft LAN Manager (version 2.1
  Basic).

10. Choose to accept the configuration shown.

11. Restart Windows.

6.2.9. LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced

When you set up Windows for use with LAN Manager 2.1
Enhanced, the following entry is added to the [boot] section
of your SYSTEM.INI file:

Network.drv=lanman21.drv

See the SYSINI.WRI file for more information on this entry.

For Windows to support LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced, you must
have the files NETAPI.DLL, PMSPL.DLL, LANMAN21.DRV,
LM21_W31.HLP, WINPOPUP.EXE, and WINPOPUP.HLP. These files
are usually located in your LAN Manager NETPROG directory,
which is on your path. If Windows cannot find any of these
files, you may receive warning messages when starting
