The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.3, 3.30a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS RESTORE command will only place backed-up files into the directory
where they were backed up from. If you do not want to restore the files you
backed up with the MS-DOS BACKUP utility to the same directory, you can either:

- RESTORE to a different drive.

-or-

- Fool RESTORE using the SUBST command.

NOTE: This information applies to MS-DOS Restore (RESTORE.EXE). It does not apply
to Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS (MSBACKUP.EXE) or Microsoft Backup for Windows
(MWBACKUP.EXE).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example
-------

If you want to restore the files backed up from the C:\DATA directory but don't
want to mix them with the files currently in the C:\DATA directory, and you have
another hard drive on your system, you can restore to drive D with the following
command:

  restore a: d:\data\*.*

RESTORE would place all files backed up from the \DATA directory into the D:\DATA
directory.

However, if you do not have another hard drive, you can use the following
commands:

  md c:\old
  subst d: c:\old
  restore a: d:\data\*.*

RESTORE will place all files backed up from the \DATA directory into the D:\DATA
directory, which is actually the C:\OLD\DATA directory.

Explanation
-----------

The MS-DOS BACKUP utility stores the full path of each file that is backed up
(for example, \DATA\INFO.DAT). This allows RESTORE to recreate your entire
subdirectory structure, if necessary.

When you specify "RESTORE A: D:\DATA\*.*", RESTORE searches for the files backed
up from the \DATA directory, and copies them to the \DATA directory on drive D.
Because the drive letter is not saved by BACKUP, RESTORE is able to place the
file in a \DATA directory on any MS-DOS logical drive (but only in a the \DATA
directory).

SUBST allows you (and many utilities, including RESTORE) to substitute a drive
designator (such as D) for a directory path (such as C:\OLD).

Notes
-----

SUBST can be used to substitute any drive designator up to drive Z. However, if
the drive you are "creating" with SUBST is F through Z, you will usually need to
have a LASTDRIVE= command in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example, if you want to
be able to use SUBST with drive M, add the following command to CONFIG.SYS:

  " lastdrive=m " (without the quotation marks)

(Note: You can use any letter after M in the alphabet.)

It is recommended that you not add or delete any drives created with SUBST while
running Microsoft Windows.
