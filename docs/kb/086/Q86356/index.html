1. README CONVENTIONS
=====================
If you have questions about procedures or commands mentioned in this
file, you will probably find answers in the Microsoft "MS-DOS User's
Guide and Reference." The following paragraphs describe frequently
mentioned topics that the guide covers in more detail.

Many sections of the readme discuss changing your CONFIG.SYS file. For
detailed information about modifying a CONFIG.SYS file, see Chapter 11
of the "MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

The readme often refers to DEVICE commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.
These DEVICE= statements are meant to be examples of the type of
command you might need to add to your CONFIG.SYS file. You need to
modify these statements to reflect the configuration of your system.
For more information, see the DEVICE command in Chapter 14 of the
"MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

The readme sometimes asks you to use the EXPAND command to copy files
from the distribution disks to your hard disk. See Chapter 14 of the
"MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference" for more information about using
the EXPAND command.

2. NOTES ON SETUP
=================
For information about the Windows portion of Setup and Setup conflicts
with terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs, see the SETUP.TXT
file.  For the location of the file, see the PACKING.LST file on Setup
disk 1.

2.1 Priam and Everex Disk-Partitioning Software
-----------------------------------------------
For information about Priam and Everex, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.2 SyQuest Removable Hard Disk
-------------------------------
For information about SyQuest, see the section "Setup displays the
'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
"Getting Started."

2.3 Iomega Bernoulli Products
-----------------------------
Bernoulli Cache

For information about Bernoulli Cache, see the section "Setup displays
the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
"Getting Started."

Note: The most recent Iomega products may include Future Systems
     Solutions' SpeedCache+, which is usually loaded with a command
     in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you use SpeedCache+, open your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file with any text editor, type "rem" and a space
     in front of the command that loads the SCPLUS.EXE file, and save
     the file, and restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
     For example, the modified command line should look like this:

     REM SCPLUS INSTALL

     After you have installed Windows and MS-DOS, remove the "rem"
     from the command line, save the file, and restart your computer.

Fixed Drive and Bernoulli Removable Drive

If your computer has a fixed disk drive, the fixed disk drive should
be used to boot your computer. The ROM on the Iomega PC2B or PC4B
adapter should be disabled. Refer to the Host Adapter Installation
guide for more information.

Bernoulli OAD and RCD Drivers

All versions of Iomega OAD drivers are compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.
The OAD drivers began shipping in May 1992

If you are using an Iomega RCD driver, such as RCD.SYS or RCD4.SYS,
you need at least version 4.7 for a PC2 adapter or version 6.2 for
a PC4 adapter. If you have an Iomega PC0 adapter (A10-20.COM) or a
PC3B adapter (RCD3.SYS), you will need a new adapter card. Contact
Iomega Customer Service for more information.

If you have problems installing Windows and MS-DOS 5.0 on a bootable
Bernoulli drive, and you are using the new Iomega OAD driver, disable
the driver in the CONFIG.SYS file before running Setup. To disable the
driver, open your CONFIG.SYS file with any text editor and type "rem"
and a space in front of the command that loads the driver. The command
line should look something like this:

REM DEVICE=C:\OADDOS\DOSOAD.SYS

Save the file and restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. Then
Run Setup again. If you cannot set up Windows and MS-DOS, contact
Iomega Customer Service for more information.

If you are able to set up Windows and MS-DOS, remove the "rem" from
the command line that loads the OAD driver, save the file, and
restart your computer.

2.4 Disk Manager
----------------
For information about Disk Manager, see the section "Setup displays
the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
"Getting Started."

2.5 SpeedStor and Volume Expansion
----------------------------------
If you have a SpeedStor partition on your computer, Setup probably
referred you to this section for one of the following reasons:

* Setup could not find in your CONFIG.SYS file a command
 for the device driver that supports your SpeedStor partition.
 If this is the case, add the command line to your CONFIG.SYS
 file, restart your computer, and run Setup. For more information
 about adding the command line to your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
 SpeedStor documentation.

* Your CONFIG.SYS file has a DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS line in it.
 If this is the case, carry out the following procedure:
  1. Use the EXPAND command to expand and copy the SSTOR.SYS
     file to your hard disk. Make sure you copy the SSTOR.SYS
     file to the same path as the HARDRIVE.SYS file.

     See the PACKING.LST file on Setup disk 1 for the location
     of the SSTOR.SYS file on the Setup disks and for instructions
     on how to expand and copy it to your hard drive.

  2. Replace the DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS file with a DEVICE=SSTOR.SYS
     command. For example, if the command that loaded the
     HARDRIVE.SYS file was "DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\HARDRIVE.SYS", you
     would replace it with the following:

     DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\SSTOR.SYS

  3. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

  4. To make sure you can access your hard drive, type the following
     at the command prompt:

     dir

  5. Insert Setup disk 1 in drive A, and type the following at the
     command prompt:

     a:setup

If you have a Novell or Xenix partition, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

If your system is an IBM PS/2 or has MicroChannel architecture,
contact your software vendor for disk-partitioning software that is
compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

2.6 Novell Partitions
---------------------
For information about Novell Partitions, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.7 Vfeature Deluxe
-------------------
For information about Vfeature Deluxe, see the section "Setup displays
the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of
"Getting Started."

2.8 Columbia Data Products Device Driver
----------------------------------------
If you use a Columbia Data Products device driver, carry out the
following procedure:

  1. Remove the DEVICE=SSTBIOS.SYS and DEVICE=SSTDRIVE.SYS commands
     from your CONFIG.SYS file before running Setup.
  2. Restart your system.
  3. Run Setup.
  4. Reinstall the device drivers by returning the DEVICE=
     commands to your CONFIG.SYS file and restarting your system.

2.9 Incompatible Primary DOS Partition
--------------------------------------
If Setup referred you to this section, and no other section in part 2
of this README.TXT file is relevant to your system, you have a
partition that is incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. You must delete the
partition from your hard disk. See the section "Setup detects a
problem with your primary DOS partition" in Chapter 3 of "Getting
Started." Make sure you back up the files on your hard drive before
deleting your partition.

2.10 WYSE Partition
-------------------
If you have partitions created by WYSE DOS 2.11 or 3.1, you must
delete them from your hard disk before running Setup. See the section
"Setup detects a problem with your primary DOS partition" in Chapter 3
of "Getting Started." Make sure you back up the files on your hard
drive before deleting your partition.

2.11 286 Accelerator Card
-------------------------
If your system includes a 286 accelerator card, Setup may not be able
to determine the amount of extended memory you have and may
incorrectly install MS-DOS 5.0. If this occurs, disable the card
before running Setup. If you can't disable the card, install MS-DOS
5.0 manually. Use the procedure in the "Priam and Everex" section of
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen"
in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.12 Iomega Bernoulli Products
------------------------------
If Setup refers you to this section, see section 2.3 of this file.

2.13 AT&amp;T 6300 Computer
-----------------------
If you use an AT&amp;T 6300 computer and your ROM BIOS is version 1.20 or
earlier, contact your vendor for a ROM BIOS upgrade. The ROM BIOS
version number is displayed when you start your computer.

2.14 Western Digital SCSI Hard-Disk Controller
----------------------------------------------
If you are using a Western Digital WD 7000 FASST or AT/XT SCSI
controller with hard-disk ROM version 3.35 or earlier, contact
Columbia Data Products Customer Services for an upgrade before
installing Windows and MS-DOS 5.0. The ROM version number is displayed
when you start your computer.

2.15 Machine-Specific HIMEM.SYS Switches
----------------------------------------
For HIMEM.SYS /machine switch values, see "You receive the 'Missing
HIMEM.SYS' message" in Chapter 4 of "Getting Started," and page 545 of
the "User's Guide" for Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

2.16 Toshiba with a Hard RAM Disk
---------------------------------
These instructions apply to Toshiba models T1200, T1600, T1200XE and
T1000LE.

To use the hard RAM disk, do the following before installing MS-DOS
5.0:
 1. Back up your hard RAM disk.
 2. Using the Toshiba Setup program, delete the hard RAM
    disk by allocating zero kilobytes to it. All data on
    the hard RAM disk will be lost.
 3. Restart your system.
 4. Install Windows and MS-DOS.
 5. Use the Toshiba Setup program to reinstall the hard RAM
    disk.
 6. Run FDISK, change to drive 2, and create a primary DOS
    partition. Quit FDISK.
 7. Use the FORMAT command to format drive D.

2.17 Unix And Xenix Partitions
------------------------------
If you have a Novell or Xenix partition, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.18 Apricot XEN-S Computer
---------------------------
To install Windows and MS-DOS on an Apricot XEN-S computer:
  1. Remove the DEVICE=AEMM386.SYS command from your CONFIG.SYS file.
  2. Restart your system.
  3. Run Setup.
  4. Put the DEVICE=AEMM386.SYS command back in your CONFIG.SYS file
     and restart your system.

2.19 4DOS
---------
Setup replaces the SHELL command in your CONFIG.SYS file with one that
invokes COMMAND.COM. To recover your 4DOS SHELL command, retrieve it
from the original CONFIG.SYS file, which is saved as CONFIG.DAT on
your Uninstall disk.

If external DOS utilities display messages that refer to error
numbers, contact JP Software for an upgrade.

2.20 LapLink
-------------
If you use Traveling Software LapLink, disable the LapLink device
driver before you install Windows and MS-DOS. The driver conflicts
with the Setup program. Once you install Windows and MS-DOS, reenable
the LapLink driver.

2.21 Stacker
------------

If you are using Stacker data-compression software on your computer,
begin by determining which drives are compressed and which are
uncompressed.

To determine which drives are compressed and which are uncompressed

*   Type the following at the command prompt:

   [drive]:\stacker\swapmap

   For the [drive] parameter, type the letter of the drive
   that contains your Stacker directory.

   If drive C was drive C at boot time, carry out Procedure 1.

   Otherwise, the drive that was C at boot time is the uncompressed
   drive. The drive that is now C is compressed. Carry out Procedure
   2.

Procedure 1

To set up Windows and MS-DOS

1   Type the following at the command prompt:

   a:setup

2   When the "A disk-compression program is in use" screen
   appears, choose Continue Setup.

3   Follow the instructions on your screen.

Procedure 2

You need to determine whether there is enough disk space on your
uncompressed drive to set up MS-DOS 5.0

To determine whether there is enough disk space

*   Type the following at the command prompt:

   chkdsk [drive]:

   For the [drive] parameter, type the letter of the
   uncompressed drive.

   Information about your hard disk appears. If the bytes
   available on disk are more than 3,000,000, carry out
   Procedure 1. Otherwise, carry out Procedure 3.

Procedure 3

To set up Windows and MS-DOS on a computer that has Stacker installed:

1   Quit Setup if you have not already done so.

2   Set up MS-DOS on floppy disks by typing the
   following at the command prompt:

   a:setup /f

   Follow the instructions on your screen.

   NOTE
   If your Setup disks are a higher density than your drive A, see
   section 2.27 of the README.TXT file to set up MS-DOS on floppy
   disks.

3   Restart your computer from the hard disk by removing disks
   from all floppy disk drives, and restarting your computer by
   pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

4   To determine the path of COMMAND.COM file, type the following
   at the command prompt:

   set

   A list of environment variables appears on your screen.

   The line that begins with COMPSPEC= indicates the location of the
   COMMAND.COM file. For example, the following indicates that the
   COMMAND.COM file is in the DOS directory:

   COMSPEC=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM

5   Type the following at the command prompt:

   c:\stacker\swapmap

   The drive that was C at boot time is the uncompressed drive. The
   drive that is now C is the compressed drive.

6   Create an OLDDOS directory by typing the following at the command
   prompt:

   md c:\olddos

7   Copy your old DOS files to the OLDDOS directory. For example, if
   your files are in C:\DOS, type the following at the command
   prompt:

   copy c:\dos\*.* c:\olddos

8   Delete your original DOS files from your DOS directory. For
   example, if your original files are in the DOS directory on
   drive C, type the following at the command prompt:

   del c:\dos\*.*

9   Copy all files from the Startup/Support disk to the directory that
   contained your original DOS files.

   For example, if the Startup/Support disk is in drive A, and you
   want to copy the files to the DOS directory on drive C, type the
   following:

   copy a:*.* c:\dos

10  If the COMSPEC variable indicates that the COMMAND.COM file is in
   a directory other than the one your original DOS files were in,
   copy the COMMAND.COM file to the directory the COMSPEC variable
   specifies.

11  Copy the COMMAND.COM file to the DOS directory on the uncompressed
   drive. (Refer to Step 5 to determine which drive uncompressed.)
   For example, if the Startup/ Support disk is in drive A and the
   DOS directory is on the uncompressed drive E, type the following
   at the command prompt:

   copy a:command.com e:\dos

12  Insert the Help/BASIC/Edit/Utility disk in drive A, and copy all
   the files from it to your DOS directory on drive C. Then insert
   the Supplemental disk in drive A, and copy all the files from it
   to your DOS directory on drive C.

13  On the uncompressed drive, update any drivers in your CONFIG.SYS
   file that load before the STACKER.COM file.

   Typically, these files are located in the DOS directory on the
   uncompressed drive. For example, if the DOS directory contains the
   SETVER.EXE, EMM386.EXE, and HIMEM.SYS files, copy these files
   From your floppy disks to the DOS directory on the uncompressed
   drive. To determine the location of the device driver files on the
   Startup/Support, Help/BASIC/Edit/Utility, and Supplemental disks,
   open the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1 by using any text
   editor.

   If a driver you need is not located on one of these disks, expand
   and copy the driver from the Setup disks. To determine the
   location of the driver you need, open the PACKING.LST file on
   Setup Disk 1 by using any text editor. The PACKING.LST file also
   contains instructions on how to expand the compressed files on the
   Setup disks.

   Note: Do not update the SMARTDRV.EXE or SMARTDRV.SYS files. Setup
   will update these file for you.

14  Copy the CHKDSK.EXE file from the DOS directory on drive C to the
   DOS directory on your uncompressed drive.

15  Insert the Startup/Support disk in drive A, and restart your
   computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. Then type the following at the
   command prompt:

   sys a: c:

16  Remove disks from all floppy disk drives, and restart your
   computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. If Stacker prompts you to
   update the COMMAND.COM file, choose Yes.

17  To make sure you can access your hard disk, type the following at
   the command prompt:

   c:
   dir

18  Insert the Startup/Support disk in drive A, and type the following
   at the command prompt:

   a:
   sys a: c:

19  Repeat step 16.

20  Before setting up Windows, read the following information.

If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are
certain steps you need to take before setting up Windows.

*  If you have not set up MS-DOS 5.0, and you want to set up
  Windows only on a computer with an older version of Stacker,
  your computer might halt on Setup disk 3 while it is analyzing
  your system software. If this happens, remove the Setup disk,
  restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, and run
  Setup again by typing the following at the command prompt:

  a:setup /w /c

  Note: Before you run Setup again, make sure all the commands
        that load memory-resident programs have been disabled
        in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. To disable
        a command, type "rem" and a space in front of the command
        in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then save the
        file, and restart your computer.

*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must
  set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When
  setting up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB)
  of disk space uncompressed for storing system files. To
  leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended
  that you allocate as uncompressed disk space twice the
  amount of your system memory. For example, if your
  system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB
  of disk space uncompressed. For more information about
  swap files, see "Working with Windows Swap Files" in Chapter 14,
  "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

  If Stacker is already set up on your computer and there is not
  enough uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run
  the STAC utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount
  of uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your
  Stacker documentation.

*  If you upgraded from an earlier version of Stacker to
  Stacker 2.0 or later, choose the Custom Setup option
  when you run Setup. When Setup prompts you, don't choose to let
  Setup modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Modify
  these files yourself after Setup is complete by carrying out
  the following steps:

  * In your AUTOEXEC.BAT, add Windows to your path.

  * Copy the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE files to your
    uncompressed drive, unless you use a different memory
    manager, such as QEMM-386.

  * Add DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to
    your CONFIG.SYS file, unless you use a different memory
    manager such as QEMM-386. The command lines that load these
    drivers should appear before the command that loads
    STACKER.COM.

  * Make sure a copy of SMARTDRV.EXE is on the
    uncompressed drive. In your CONFIG.SYS file, the
    SMARTDRV.EXE command line should include the
    "/double_buffer" switch and should be the path
    of the file at boot time. For example, if SMARTDRV.EXE
    is in the root directory at boot time, you would include
    the following command in your CONFIG.SYS:

    DEVICE=C:\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

    SMARTDRV.EXE should be loaded before STACKER.COM in the
    CONFIG.SYS file.

  * In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the SMARTDRV.EXE command
    line should be the path of the file after disk drives
    are swapped. Also, add the /L switch to the SMARTDRV.EXE
    command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, but didn't
  upgrade from Stacker version 1.1, choose the Express Setup
  option when you are prompted. Setup will modify your CONFIG.SYS
  and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for you. When Setup is finished making
  the modifications, it displays a message at the end
  of the Windows portion of Setup that notifies you of the
  modifications that have been made. If you have used Stacker to
  swap your startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
  ask whether you want to update to the new version of the
  CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Choose Yes.

*  If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
  need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
  yourself, using the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files that
  Setup generates. For information about using these files,
  see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself,"
  following this topic.

*  After you have set up MS-DOS manually, type the following at
  the command prompt to set up Windows:

  a:setup /w

  Note: After you have set up Windows and know your system is
        working correctly, you might want to delete the DOS files
        in your OLDDOS directory.

Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself
---------------------------------------------------------

If Setup cannot modify your startup files, Setup writes proposed
changes to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files. (These files may
also be named CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x if CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN already exist.) In this case, you must either move
the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files to a drive
that is available when you start your computer, or use a
text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file
so that any references to HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and
EMM386.EXE appear after the DEVICE command that loads
the drivers for your disk drives. Refer to the CONFIG.WIN
and AUTOEXEC.WIN files for the proposed changes.

Note: You have the choice of using HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE
     as your memory managers, or of using a third-party
     memory manager, such as QEMM-386. If you decide to
     use a third-party memory manager, do not copy HIMEM.SYS
     or EMM386.EXE to a drive that is available when you
     start your computer, and do not add commands for these
     files to your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file. These files
     should already include the correct command lines for your
     memory manager.

     If you decide to use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE instead
     of the third-party memory manager, delete the commands
     that load the third-party memory manager in your
     CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then add command lines
     for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE in your CONFIG.SYS or
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

2.22 Dell DOS 3.30
------------------
Some Dell DOS 3.30 installations were done with a utility called
AFORMAT, which creates and formats multiple 32 MB partitions. These
extended partitions become invisible with Windows and MS-DOS unless
you run a utility called FIXPART before or after installing Windows
and MS-DOS. Contact Dell to obtain the FIXPART utility.

2.23 Tandy with ROM DOS
-----------------------
Contact your hardware manufacturer for information about upgrading a
Tandy computer with ROM DOS to MS-DOS 5.0. This applies to the
following models: 1000HX, 1000SL, 1000SL2, 1000TL, 1000TL2, 1000TL3,
2500XL, 2500XL2.

2.25 SpeedStor BootAll option
-----------------------------
If you have SpeedStor BootAll, see the section "Setup displays the
'Incompatible Partition' screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.26 Setup switches for corporate administrators
------------------------------------------------
The following Setup switches can be used when installing Windows and
MS-DOS:

/G              Does not create the Uninstall Disk, does
               not ask if the user is on a network, and does
               not offer the hard disk backup option.

/G /H:filespec  Runs the MS-DOS portion of Setup in Batch-mode
               and uses the default Setup options. Also
               runs the Windows portion of Setup according to
               FILESPEC file.

/J              Does not ask if the user is on a network and
               does not offer the hard disk backup option.

/W              Installs Windows only.

/A              Expands and copies Windows files on Setup disks
               to a network server.

               Note: Typing "setup" at the command prompt for
                     the network drive will run Windows-only
                     Setup.

                     To set up both Windows and MS-DOS from a
                     network share point, you must use the procedure
                     in section 3, "General Notes," of the
                     NETWORKS.TXT file. If you use this procedure,
                     typing "dwsetup" will install both Windows and
                     MS-DOS.

2.27 Setting up MS-DOS on floppy disks if your Setup disks
    are a higher density than your drive A
----------------------------------------------------------
To make a setup of floppy disks, carry out the following procedure:

1    Insert Setup disk 1 in your high density drive (for example,
    drive B) and a formatted floppy disk in drive A.
2    Type the following at the command prompt:
    b:setup /f /m
    Specify drive A for the Startup/Support disk. Follow the
    instructions on your screen.
3    Insert Setup disk 1 in your high density drive (for example,
    drive B), and type the following at the command prompt:
    b:setup /f
    Follow the instructions on your screen.

Use the disk you created in step 2 as your boot disk. Use the disks
you created in step 3 when you want to use an MS-DOS command.

2.28 Your non-Windows application runs out of memory after Setup
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running a non-Windows application that uses a lot of
memory, and it runs out of memory from the command line, try the
following:

* Lower the amount of memory that SMARTDrive uses. For more
 information, see "Using the SMARTDrive Command Line" in Chapter
 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

* Run the non-Windows application from Windows. For more information,
 see Chapter 7, "Non-Windows Applications," in the "Microsoft Windows
 User's Guide."

2.29 MS-DOS Shell doesn't work correctly on a computer with an 8514
    display or ATI Ultra card
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If the MS-DOS Shell doesn't work correctly after installing Windows
and MS-DOS and your system has an 8514 display or ATI Ultra card,
carry out the following procedure:

1    Run Setup again.
2    Choose the Install MS-DOS only option.
3    Change the Video Type to 8514.
4    Complete Setup.

2.30 DR-DOS, Superstor, and DELWATCH
------------------------------------
Superstor

If you use SuperStor on a computer with DR-DOS, do not use the DR-DOS
version of SSTORDRV.SYS driver with MS-DOS 5.0. This driver has not
been tested with MS-DOS 5.0. Instead, carry out the following
procedure:

1    Back up all of your data files onto floppy disks.
2    Install MS-DOS onto floppy disks by typing the following at the
    command prompt:

    a:setup /f /m

3    Reformat your hard drive and transfer your system files by
    inserting the Startup/Support disk in drive A, and typing the
    following at the command prompt:

    format c: /s

4    Run Setup to install Windows and MS-DOS.
5    Restore your data files to the hard drive.

DELWATCH

If you are using the DELWATCH utility with DR DOS, carry out
the following procedure.

Note: To determine if DELWATCH is on your system, and has been
     creating "pending delete" files, run the DR-DOS CHKDSK utility.

Note: Even if you run DELWATCH from a floppy disk, you need to run
     the DELPURGE utility as described in step 3 below.

1    Before running Setup, open your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
    and remove the command that loads the DELWATCH file. Then save
    the file.
2    Restart your computer.
3    Run the DELPURGE utility to purge your hard drive of "pending"
    delete" files.
4    Run Windows and MS-DOS Setup.

2.31 You receive the "Unable to control the A20 line"
    message
-----------------------------------------------------
If you receive this message during Setup, carry out Procedure 1.
If you receive this message after Setup, your computer is an 80386 or
80486, and you are trying to run Windows 3.0, carry out Procedure
2.

Procedure 1

1    Quit Setup if you have not already done so.
2    Run Setup again.
3    Choose the Install MS-DOS only option.
4    When you restart your computer, observe whether this message
    appears on your screen.

    If you receive this message again, you need to add a /MACHINE
    switch to the command that loads the HIMEM.SYS file in your
    CONFIG.SYS file. See the table in "You receive the 'Missing
    HIMEM.SYS' message" in Chapter 4, "Troubleshooting During System
    Startup," in "Getting Started" to determine what switch to use.
    After you have added the switch to your CONFIG.SYS file, restart
    your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

5    Run Setup again.
6    Choose the Install Windows only option.

Procedure 2

*    Expand the WINA20.386 file from the Setup disks and copy it to
    the root directory of drive C. See the PACKING.LST file on Setup
    disk 1 for the location of the WINA20.386 and for instructions
    on how to expand and copy the file.

2.32 You receive the "You must have the file WINA20.386 in the root
    of your boot drive to run Windows in Enhanced Mode."
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you receive this message after Setup, your computer is an 80386
or 80486, and you are running QEMM-386, carry out the following
procedure:

1    Open your CONFIG.SYS file with any text editor.
2    Add the following line to the end of the file:

    switches=/w

3    Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing
    CTRL+ALT+DEL.
4    Run Windows.

2.33 Bootsafe
-------------
If you are running Bootsafe, you may experience problems while
running Setup. Carry out the following procedure:

1    Open your AUTOEXEC.BAT with any text editor.
2    Type "REM" and a space in front of the line that loads
    Bootsafe. For example, the line might look something like this:

    rem c:\cpav\bootsafe

3    Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing
    CTRL+ALT+DEL.
4    Run Setup again.
5    After installing Windows and MS-DOS, remove the "REM" and space
    you added before the command that loads Bootsafe in your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then save the file, and restart your computer
    by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

2.34 Reinstalling MS-DOS after installing Windows and MS-DOS
------------------------------------------------------------
Before you reinstall MS-DOS, note the SMARTDRV.EXE switches which may
be in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Because setting up MS-DOS alone will
remove all existing SMARTDRV.EXE switches, you will need to manually
restore any switches which Setup removes.

3. NOTES ON MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=============================

3.1 386MAX (5.11 or Earlier)
----------------------------
If you have used the SETVER command to report a different version
number to a program you are loading into the upper memory area with
386LOAD.COM or MAXHI.COM, also use the SETVER command to report that
number to 386LOAD.COM or MAXHI.COM. For information about the SETVER
command, see Chapter 14 of the "MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

The new version number is reported to all programs loaded by
386LOAD.COM and MAXHI.COM.

MAXHI.COM programs supplied with versions of 386MAX earlier than 5.0
are incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

3.2 All Computers Inc. Expanded-Memory Driver (ALLEMM4.SYS)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5 or later of the All Computers expanded-memory driver
(ALLEMM4.SYS) is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0 HIMEM.SYS. Contact All
Computers to get an updated driver.

3.3 Problems Loading into the Upper Memory Area
-----------------------------------------------
Some computers with bus master DMA controllers may not be able to load
device drivers or programs into the upper memory area. Add a
"DEVICE=SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER" command before any DEVICEHIGH
commands in your CONFIG.SYS file. Make sure the command includes the
full path of the SMARTDRV.EXE file. For example, if the SMARTDRV.EXE
file is in the WINDOWS directory on drive C, the command would look
like this:

DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

Also, add an /L switch to the SMARTDRV.EXE command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This is required if you use the /DOUBLE_BUFFER
switch in your CONFIG.SYS file.

3.4 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS)
------------------------------------------
If you use Intel's EMM.SYS driver with Aboveboard, use EMM.SYS version
4.0 revision D or later. If you have an earlier version, contact Intel
for a free upgrade.

3.5 XMAEM.SYS and XMA2EMS.SYS
-----------------------------
Setup disables the CONFIG.SYS commands that load XMAEM.SYS and
XMA2EMS.SYS. If your system uses both drivers, replace the commands
with a DEVICE=EMM386.EXE command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

If your system includes an XMA card, remove the REM command that
precedes the DEVICE=XMA2EMS.SYS command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

3.6 Using QEMM or 386Max to load high
-------------------------------------
If you use QEMM or 386Max to load device drivers high, Setup will not
detect and update these device drivers. If you load your device rivers
high, carry out the following procedure:

1     Open your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file with any text editor,
     and remove the commands or switches that load the device drivers
     high.

2     Run Setup again, and choose the Install MS-DOS Only option.

3     When Setup is complete, open your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
     file with any text editor, and insert the commands or switches
     that load your device drivers high.

4     Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing
     CTRL+ALT+DEL.

4. MAKING YOUR HARDWARE COMPATIBLE WITH MS-DOS 5.0
==================================================

4.1 Acer 1100/33 and CTRL+ALT+DEL
---------------------------------
If you have an Acer 1100/33 computer with an Award BIOS, you may not
be able to restart your system by using CTRL+ALT+DEL. Contact Acer for

----------------------------------
If your Corel Corporation disk driver doesn't work correctly, contact your
vendor for an upgrade.

4.7 External Floppy Disk Drives
-------------------------------
If you can't use your Nth, Procomm, or Sysgen external floppy disk
drive, contact your vendor for an update.

4.8 Hardcard
------------
a) Hardcard II

  If you can't use Plus Development Hardcard II or Hardcard
  II XL when running EMM386.EXE, specify the exclude (x=)
  switch to prevent EMM386 from conflicting with the card's
  BIOS address.

  See your Hardcard II manual to determine which address
  space to exclude. See the "MS-DOS User's Guide and
  Reference" for more information about the exclude switch.

b) Hardcard 40 or Passport

  If you are using Hardcard 40 or a Passport removable
  disk, and you have a DEVICE command for PLUSDRV.SYS in
  your CONFIG.SYS file, carry out the following procedure
  before installing Windows and MS-DOS:

  1. Disable or remove the DEVICE command for PLUSDRV.SYS
     command line in your CONFIG.SYS file.
  2. Run Setup.
  3. Reenable or return the DEVICE command for PLUSDRV.SYS
     in your CONFIG.SYS file. Make it the last line in the
     file.

4.9 IBM PS/1, installing MS-DOS 5.0
-----------------------------------
If your IBM PS/1 stops running after installing Windows and MS-DOS,
see "MS-DOS or Windows won't start after you run Setup" in Chapter 4
of "Getting Started."

4.10 NCR VGA BIOS
-----------------
If you have an NCR VGA BIOS and can't switch between screens when
running MS-DOS Shell or QBasic, see your NCR manual for information
about making your VGA BIOS PS/2 compatible.

4.11 Olivetti System with a CGA Video Board
-------------------------------------------
An Olivetti system with a CGA video board may not scroll correctly.
Add the /s switch to the DEVICE=ANSI.SYS command in your CONFIG.SYS
file.

4.12 Toshiba T3100SX
--------------------
Toshiba T3100SX computer's suspend/resume feature is incompatible with
EMM386.EXE. Either disable the feature or do not use EMM386.EXE.

4.13 Western Digital VGA Card
-----------------------------
If you have a Western Digital VGA card and are using RAMBIOS.EXE and
RAMBIOS.SYS, load RAMBIOS.SYS before ANSI.SYS and DISPLAY.SYS in your
CONFIG.SYS file, and load RAMBIOS.EXE before GRAPHICS.COM in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

4.14 ATI WonderCard 3.x
-----------------------
If you have an ATI WonderCard, see "Setup screens are unreadable" in
Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

4.15 XGA and EMM386.EXE
-----------------------
If you use an XGA display with EMM386.EXE, you may need to exclude
certain memory ranges with the EMM386 EXCLUDE option (x=). To
determine which memory ranges to exclude, use the reference disk that
came with your computer to view the memory map.

4.16 Zenith Computer
--------------------
To use the GRAPHICS command with a Zenith computer, set the STACKS
command in your CONFIG.SYS file to at least STACKS=9,256. For
information about the STACKS command, see Chapter 14 of the "MS-DOS
User's Guide and Reference."

4.17 Zeos 486 and Task Swapper
------------------------------
