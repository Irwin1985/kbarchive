-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is a list of features new in version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks MS-DOS client:

Readme Is Not Copied During Installation
----------------------------------------

If a README.TXT file exists, it is not copied to the server by the installation
program.

Low Density Disks Are No Longer Supported
-----------------------------------------

Installation from 360K disks is no longer supported; the disk media should be
either two 720K, 3.5-inch disks or one 1.2 MB, 5.25-inch disk.

Global Address List
-------------------

The Global Address List entry appears as the first entry in the address list
dialog box used to address mail and the Global entry appears in the address list
dialog box that appears after the Address/Browse command if Global Address List
is enabled in the Mail Administrator program for the postoffice.

Orphaned Personal Address List (PAL) Entry Behavior
---------------------------------------------------

If an invalid address is found in the PAL while the MS-DOS client is trying to
transmit mail, the message

  ALIAS NO LONGER VALID

will appear, followed by the alias and the list in which it was found. The prompt
line will display the message, "Remove address from your list?"

Printer Port Selection Under Print/Configuration
------------------------------------------------

There is a new menu item named Port. Selecting this command results in moving the
input focus to the port display line and highlights the port that was previously
selected. The user can now change the selection.

The numbers 1, 2, and 3 for the port choices are highlighted and indicate that
you can use the corresponding accelerator key to make a selection.

Macbinary Support
-----------------

The MS-DOS client only saves the data fork of attachments that are saved to disk
and are marked as type Macbinary. Automatic detection of Macbinary attachments
is not supported.

This means that a Macbinary file can arrive via a gateway and the MS-DOS client
will not decode the attachment if the user tries to save it.

Compose Accelerator Keys Highlighted
------------------------------------

On the compose screen, the accelerator keys for the fields TO, CC, SUBJECT,
PRIORITY, and ATTACHMENTS now are highlighted.

Retained Messages
-----------------

If you press the ESC key to leave a reply or forward composition screen, you are
prompted with the following question:

  Retain this message in compose buffer?

If you select Yes, you can get back to the message by selecting Compose later on.
If you select No, the buffer is cleared so that when you next select Compose, a
blank message will appear.

The "Retain this message in compose buffer" prompt only appears if the preference
for confirmations is set to Yes.

The editin capabilities for a retained message will be the same as when the
message is originally loaded. For example, you cannot edit the body of a
forwarded message.

If you select Forward or Reply and there is a retained message in the compose
buffer, you are prompted with the following question:

  Clear compose message?

If you select No, you are returned to the state the computer was in before you
selected Forward or Reply.

Folders in CC List
------------------

The FOLDERS option (which was previously available for the TO list) appears as
one of the address lists in the Address List dialog box when you select Carbon
Copy (CC) recipients.

Command-Line Option Usage
-------------------------

If you use the Help (-? or -h) option on the command line, the Mail program
displays a list of command-line options with usage descriptions. This same
display appears if the Mail program cannot find the postoffice when you start
Mail. The usage display is as follows:

 Usage:  mail [options] [mailbox]

     -&lt;25-50&gt;       Specify number of lines on screen
     -c             Indicate use of color monitor
     -d&lt;drive&gt;      Specify database location
     -e&lt;drive:path&gt; Specify location of graphics executables
     -h,-?          Show help
     -i&lt;drive:path&gt; Specify location to create temporary graphics files
     -n&lt;1-999&gt;      Set polling period in seconds
     -n0            Disable polling
     -p&lt;password&gt;   Specify password
     -sCGA,-sEGA,   Specify monitor type
     -sHERC,-sVGA,
     -sMONO
     -v             Reduce screen snow
     -x             Set notification method (see documentation)
     -w&lt;1-15&gt;       Set color scheme

NOTE: On MS Net compatible networks, the -x option disables NetBIOS notification.
On Novell networks, the -x option enables NetBIOS notification.

Border Color Command-Line Option
--------------------------------

The -w command-line option can now be used to set the border color. It must be
followed by a number from 1 to 15, which corresponds to the following colors:

  Parameter   Color
  -----------------------------
      1       Blue
      2       Green
      3       Cyan
      4       Red
      5       Magenta
      6       Brown
      7       White
      8       Gray
      9       Bright blue
     10       Bright green
     11       Bright cyan
     12       Bright red
     13       Bright magenta
     14       Yellow
     15       Bright white

Message List Selections and Scroll Maintained
---------------------------------------------

When you press the ESC key after reading a message from the Inbox or folder list,
you will be returned to read mode with the same selections and scroll position
maintained. To get back to the main menu, you must press the ESC key again. This
behavior minimizes keystrokes for reading many messages and is consistent with
the notion that using the ESC key brings the user up one level in the menu
hierarchy. The previous behavior was to escape immediately to the main menu,
clear all selections, and reset the scroll position.

Default Confirmation Preference
-------------------------------

The preference screen now displays the following:

  What is default response to confirmation?

Your response to this question sets the default selection for any Yes/No
response. The default is No.

NOTE: To get to the Preferences screen, press the F3 key while you read a
message.

Erase Changed to Delete
-----------------------

All occurrences of the word "Erase" have been changed to "Delete."
