-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes message flow between Exchange Server and the IBM
OV/VM-PROFS Connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Message flow from Exchange Server to IBM OV/VM-PROFS 
----------------------------------------------------

1. The message is passed by the Exchange Server information store to the
  connector's MTS-OUT folder if on same Exchange Server computer. Otherwise,
  the message transfer agent (MTA) routes it to the Exchange Server computer
  where the OV/VM Connector is installed, and places it in the connector's
  MTS-OUT folder.

2. The OV/VM Connector picks up the message from the MTS-OUT folder, looks up
  the directory entries for the recipients, and places the message in the
  READYOUT folder.

  NOTE: Specifically, the process, Lsmexout.exe, listed in Exchange Connectivity
  Administrator's Process Manager as "Transfer from Exchange for OV/VM," or
  "LME-PROFS-MEXOUT," is responsible for the above action. In the Queues tab of
  the OV/VM Connector Property page, MTS-OUT is called "Outbound from
  Exchange," and READYOUT is called "Outbound to OV/VM."

3. The OV/VM Connector receives the message from the MTS-OUT folder and puts it
  into the READYOUT folder.

4. The OV/VM Connector then translates it into an intermediary GML structure
  (similar to DIA), breaks out the attachments into separate messages, and
  places the message header(s) (one for the body, one for each attachment) into
  the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Q\Dia2vm.in directory as a file with the
  extension .rdy, and places the message body (*.tmp) and attachments (*.att)
  into separate files in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Q\Objects directory.

  NOTE: Specifically, the process, Lsmexdia.exe, listed in Exchange Connectivity
  Administrator's Process Manager as "Exchange to OV/VM Transform," or
  "LME-PROFS-MEXDIA," is responsible for the above action.

5. The OV/VM Connector then picks up the *.rdy file (and associated files), and
  sends an OV/VM distribution to RSCS/VM over an LU 0 session. When RSCS
  confirms that it has received the distribution, the OV/VM Connector removes
  the *.rdy file and associated files.

  NOTE: Specifically, the processes Lsdiavm.exe and Lsnje.exe, listed in
  Exchange Connectivity Administrator's Process Manager as "Outbound to OV/VM"
  ([LME-PROFS-DIAVM]), and "NJE Server" ([LME-PROFS-VMDIA]), respectively, work
  together to process the message. Lsdiavm.exe does the message conversion, and
  Lsnje.exe handles the SNA interface and acts as a traffic cop for the LU 0
  session.

Message Flow from IBM OV/VM-PROFS to Exchange Server
----------------------------------------------------

1. The OV/VM Connector listens to receive an incoming distribution from RSCS,
  receives the distribution over an LU 0 session, and generates a file in the
  Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Q\Vm2mex.in directory (extension *.rdy) containing
  the message header, and generates a file in the
  Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Q\Objects (extension *.snd) containing the message
  body (or document/binary file).

  NOTE: Specifically, the processes Lsnje.exe and Lsvmdia.exe, listed in
  Exchange Connectivity Administrator's Process Manager as "NJE Server"
  ([LME-PROFS-NJE]), and "Inbound from OV/VM" ([LME-PROFS-VMDIA]),
  respectively, work together to process the message. Lsnje.exe handles the SNA
  protocols and acts as a traffic cop for the LU 0 session, and Lsvmdia.exe
  handles the message conversion.

2. The OV/VM Connector picks up the *.rdy file (and associated files) from the
  Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Q\Vm2mex.in directory, translates the message into
  Microsoft internal format, and puts the message in the READYIN folder.

  NOTE: Specifically, the process Lsdiamex.exe, listed in Exchange Connectivity
  Administrator's Process Manager as "OV/VM to Exchange Transform," or
  "LME-PROFS-DIAMEX," is responsible for the above action.

3. The OV/VM Connector then verifies the validity of the recipients and puts the
  message into the MTS-IN folder.
