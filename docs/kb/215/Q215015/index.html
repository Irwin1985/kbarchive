-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0, by
default, members of the "SMS Admins" local group cannot start the Windows
Management service unless they also have administrator-level rights or unless
they log on locally.

This becomes an issue when members of the "SMS Admins" group attempt to connect
to the SMS Database by way of a remote administrator console and they are unable
to connect to the SMS Provider because the Windows Management service stopped or
suffered a General Protection Fault.

The default Distributed COM (DCOM) security settings enable only an administrator
or the locally logged on user to start a program. If the Windows Management
service stops for any reason, it cannot be restarted by the connection attempts
from the remote SMS administrator console, unless the logged-in user is a domain
administrator.

WORKAROUND
==========

To enable the remote SMS administrator consoles to restart the Windows
Management service when you connect, manually change the DCOM startup security
settings as follows by using the DCOM Configuration utility, Dcomcnfg.exe:

1. Log on as the administrator of the computer where the SMS provider is
  installed (the site server or the site database computer).

2. Run the DCOM Configuration tool (Dcomcnfg.exe).

3. On the Applications tab, click Windows Management, and then click Properties.

4. In the Windows Management Properties dialog box, click the Security tab.

5. Click "Use custom launch permissions", and then click Edit.

6. In the Registry Value Permissions dialog box, click Add.

7. Scroll through the names until you find the "SMS Admins" group, select it,
  and then click Add.

This change must always take place on the SMS Site Server; if the SMS Provider is
installed on the SQL Server, it must take place there as well.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DCOM security settings can be set per program and this can be done without
affecting the other program's DCOM security settings.

To set the DCOM security for the SMS, use the following steps on the SMS Site
server and if the SMS Provider is on a separate SQL Server, perform these steps
there as well:

1. Click Start, click Run, and then type "DCOMCNFG" (without the quotation
  marks) to open the DCOM Configuration Properties utility.

  NOTE: If you receive a DCOM Configuration Warning dialog box containing a
  message such as:

  The CLSID {B58C2444-A1A3-11D1-B024-000697C9A284}, item D:\Microsoft
  Office\Office\1033\MSOHELP.EXE and title MsoHelp Key Search Dialog has the
  named value AppID, but is not recorded under \\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppId. Do
  you wish to record it?

  You can click Yes to record the information and proceed. The message you
  receive may or may not be for Microsoft Office, this was used strictly as an
  example.

2. Select the Windows Management program on the Applications tab, and then click
  Properties.

3. On the General tab, set the Authentication Level: to Default.

4. On the Location tab, confirm that "Run application on this computer" check
  box is selected.

5. On the Security tab, the default permissions are set for the Access and
  Launch sections. Also by default, under Configuration, the "Use Custom
  configuration permissions" is checked, and the following permissions are set
  on both the SMS Site Server and the Remote SQL Server (SMS Provider):

  CREATOR OWNER - Full Control
  Everyone - Read
  INTERACTIVE - Special Access
  (Query Value, Set Value, Create Subkey, Enumerate Subkeys, Notify, Delete, and
  Read Control)
  &lt;Domain Name&gt;\Administrators - Full Control
  SYSTEM - Full Control

6. On the Identity tab, it is recommended that the option button "The System
  Account (services only)" be selected.

7. On the Endpoints tab, the entry "...default system protocols" exists and
  within its properties, the Endpoint assignment "Use default endpoints" is
  checked. In Windows 2000, you may not be able to edit the "...default system
  protocols" properties. This seems to be the only difference in settings
  between Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and Microsoft Windows 2000.

IMPORTANT: Please use caution when adjusting these settings as an incorrect
configuration can cause the system to become unstable or unusable. These are the
default settings found on both NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 servers with SMS or SQL
(with the SMS Provider) installed.
