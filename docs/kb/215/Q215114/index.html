The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you upgrade a Systems Management Server 1.2 site server to Systems Management
Server 2.0, the existing 1.2 clients are unable to report inventory and are
unavailable for remote tools or software distribution until they (the 1.2
clients) are upgraded to Systems Management Server 2.0 clients. The processes
that install a client are not enabled on the upgraded site.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
2.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Systems Management Server 2.0 site server must be configured to install
clients through the Systems Management Server Administrator console. This
includes enabling discovery methods, client installation methods, and client
agents to be installed. After clients are installed as Systems Management Server
2.0 clients, they are no longer orphaned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A future version of Systems Management Server will include a Site Configuration
Wizard utility that allows you to create site templates. This will facilitate
the configuring of multiple upgraded sites in a large hierarchy.
