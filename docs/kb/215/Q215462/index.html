MORE INFORMATION
================

The Security Issue
------------------

A document file can potentially be attached to a nontrusted template that
contains macros. Microsoft Word considers documents and templates that are
stored in either the user templates folder or the workgroup templates folder as
trusted, or free of unwanted macro viruses. To determine where Word is storing
your trusted user and workgroup templates, click Options on the Tools menu, and
then click the File Locations tab.

Microsoft provides a Word Template Security Patch to protect your documents from
macro viruses that could potentially be spread from a nontrusted template.

With the Template Security Patch applied, Word warns you with the following
warning when the document that you are opening is attached to a nontrusted
template that contains macros:

  The document you are opening contains macros or customizations. Some macros
  may contain viruses that could harm your computer.

  If you are sure this document is from a trusted source, click Enable Macros.
  If you are not sure and want to prevent any macros from running, click
  Disable Macros.

Installation Considerations
---------------------------

You can only apply the Word Template Security Patch utility to Microsoft Word 97
(SR-1) and (SR-2). You must first patch the original, or base, Microsoft Office
or Word 97 installations with SR-1 before you can apply the Template Security
Patch.

NOTE: This patch modifies the Microsoft Word executable file. Reinstalling
Microsoft Office 97 or updating SR-1 to SR-2 requires that the Template Security
Patch be applied to your system again.


How to Determine Whether Word SR-1 or SR-2 Is Installed on Your System
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can check your version of Word in the About dialog box. To check Microsoft
Word, follow these steps:

1. Open Microsoft Word 97.

2. On the Help menu, click About Microsoft Word.

3. Determine whether the dialog box contains the following text:

   - Microsoft Word 97 SR-1

     -or-

   - Microsoft Word 97 SR-2


How the Security Patch Can Be Applied to an Administrative Network Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Word Template Security Patch can be applied to an administrative "run from
network server" installation of Word, provided that you have the permissions to
write to the network folder where the Word executable resides. To patch a "run
from network server" installation, follow these steps:

1. Log on as an administrator (or as any user with Write access to the
  installation folder) on a workstation that runs Word from the server.

2. Close any open sessions to the Microsoft Word executable.

3. Run the Template Security Patch.

After the patch is complete, users at other workstations are protected from macro
viruses that can be spread from a nontrusted template the next time that they
start Word.

How to Determine Whether Word SR-1 or SR-2 Was Patched
------------------------------------------------------

You can verify that your Word executable has been successfully patched by running
the Wd97SP.exe program. The utility can determine whether your Word program was
previously patched and notifies you with the following message:

  Microsoft Word has already been patched.

How to "Silently" Install the Patch (Without User Prompts)
----------------------------------------------------------

You can apply the Security Patch silently to Word 97 installations by running it
with command-line switches.

To extract the patch executable, type the following command:

  "wd97sp.exe /q /c:"Wdpatch.exe -s"" (without the quotation marks)

Winword.exe is then patched in silent mode, with no user prompts.

Troubleshooting Patch Errors
----------------------------

When you run the Template Security Patch, it checks the Windows registry for the
location of the Word executable file and then performs a test to make sure that
you actually have Microsoft Word 97 SR-1 or SR-2 installed on your computer.

Specifically, the patch is not successful if the following key in the Microsoft
Windows registry refers to an incorrect location for Microsoft Word 97:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{000209FF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\LocalServer32

Run Setup with the /y Switch to Correct the Registry:

Try to run Setup with the /y switch for Word or Office to repair registry
corruption.

To run Setup with the /y switch, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Word or Office CD into the CD-ROM drive. If you installed Word or
  Office from floppy disks, insert the Setup Disk 1 in the floppy disk drive.

2. Click Start and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\setup /Y" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the drive that contains the CD or Setup
  Disk 1.

4. Click OK.

5. Click Reinstall.

This reregisters Word and all Office programs when you run Office Setup.

Turn Off Virus Protection Before Running the Patch:

Some virus protection programs can interfere with the Template Security Patch. If
you use a virus protection program on your computer, turn off the virus
protection program before you run the patch. (You can turn on the virus
protection program again after the patch is complete.)

Error Message: "Cannot Open Word Executable":

If you attempt to run the patch, the following error message may appear:

  Cannot open Word executable.

  It may be read-only or on a drive to which you do not have write access.

When you click OK, the following error message appears:

  Patch has failed.

This problem may occur in one of the following cases:

Case 1

If you run Word 97 and Word 2000 or later on the same computer, the path for the
version of Word that you ran last will be in the registry key. If you last ran a
version of Word later than Word 97, the patch will fail, because the patch is
not designed for versions of Word later than Word 97.

To correct this problem, run Word 97 before you run the security patch, or
manually change the following registry key to the correct path:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{000209FF-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\LocalServer32

Case 2

The Word 6.0/95 Export converter is not installed. To correct this problem,
install the Word 6.0/95 Export converter before you try to run the Word 97
Template Security Patch.

Patch Does Not Function with Microsoft Windows 2000 Installed:

If you have Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Word 97 for Windows installed,
even in a dual boot environment between Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft
Windows 98 and Windows 2000, the Word 97 Security Template Patch will be
installed but will not function correctly. Macros in an attached template in a
nontrusted location may still be activated, and no macro warning message appears
when you open a Word document.
