SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the flow of messages through the Microsoft Connector for
Lotus Notes (MSNC).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Message sent from Exchange to Lotus Notes:

1. The message will be routed by the Message Transfer Agent (MTA) to the
  Exchange Server computer with the Notes Connector. There will be four MAPI
  folders that reside within the Information Store: MTS-OUT, READYOUT, MTS-IN,
  and READYIN. For a message outbound from Exchange Server, it will be placed
  in the MTS-OUT folder of the Notes Connector.

2. The Lsmexout.exe process will then pick up the message from this MTS-OUT
  folder, look up the directory (DIR) for the target recipients before placing
  the message into the READYOUT folder.

  This process is listed in the Exchange Connectivity Administrator's Process
  Manager as "Transfer from Exchange to Notes," or "LME-NOTES-MEXOUT" process.
  In the Queues tab of the Notes Connector property page, the MTS-OUT folder
  and READYOUT folder map to "Outbound from Exchange" and "Outbound to Notes"
  respectively.

3. The next Notes Connector process then converts the message into a Notes mail
  format and deposits it into the Notes mailbox router (Mail.box).

  The Lsmexnts.exe process is listed in the Exchange Connectivity
  Administrator's Process Manager as "Convert Exchange to Notes," or
  "LME-NOTES-MEXNTS."

Message sent from Notes to Exchange Server:

1. The Notes Connector will poll the Notes outbound mail router (Exchange.box)
  and pick up any mail deposited there. This process will also convert the
  message into MAPI format and deposit it into the READYIN folder on the
  Exchange Server computer with the Notes Connector.

  This process is Lsntsmex.exe. The Lsntsmex.exe process is listed in the
  Exchange Connectivity Administrator's Process Manager as "Convert Notes to
  Exchange," or "LME-NOTES-NTSMEX." In the Queues tab of the Notes Connector
  property page, the READYIN and MTS-IN folder map to "Inbound from Notes" and
  "Inbound to Exchange" respectively.

2. The next process, Lsmexin.exe then looks up and confirms the directory
  entries for the recipients, and moves the message from the READYIN folder
  into the MTS-IN MAPI folder.

  This process is listed in the Exchange Connectivity Administrator's Process
  Manager as "Transfer to Exchange for Notes," or "LME-NOTES-MEXIN."

3. The Information Store then decides whether the recipients are local or
  require further work by the MTA to hand the message off to remote Exchange
  Server computers.
