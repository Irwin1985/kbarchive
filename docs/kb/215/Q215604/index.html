-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, you can delete some
of the default folders created by the Outlook client, specifically:

- Contacts
- Drafts
- Notes
- Tasks
- Journal

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Outlook Web Access client is not aware of the format or notes used
in the Contact, Drafts, Notes, Tasks, and Journal folders. Therefore, the OWA
client believes the folders contain normal e-mail messages and treats these
folders as a normal folder with e-mail messages, which can be deleted using the
OWA client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+--------------------------------------+



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Outlook Web Access version 5.5.
This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use OWA, you can delete the default Outlook folders by following these
steps:

1. Click the "Up one folder" button to display a list of folders in the OWA
  client.

2. Select the folder you want to delete, like the Tasks folder.

3. On the toolbar, click the "Delete the current folder" button.

4. You receive the dialog box prompt, "Are you sure you want to delete the
  current folder and its subfolders?"

5. Click OK to delete the folder.

NOTE: If you select a folder that the OWA client recognizes as a special folder,
such as the Inbox folder, you will not be able to delete it. You will receive an
error message saying "Unable to delete this special folder," if you try to
delete the Inbox folder or any of the following folders: Calendar, Deleted
Items, Inbox, Outbox and Sent Items.

With Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5, you can delete the Contacts folder as well as
other special folders. This was however changed in Exchange Server 5.5 SP1, and
Contacts can no longer be deleted.
