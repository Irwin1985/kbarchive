-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This is a step-by-step troubleshooting guide for examining Windows NT Virtual
DOS Machine (NTVDM) or Windows on Windows startup issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To begin troubleshooting, determine whether you are dealing with problems in the
NTVDM or problems in both the NTVDM and the Windows on Windows subsystem.

NOTE: Sysedit.exe is a 16-bit program available within Windows NT for
troubleshooting these issues.

Problem Diagnosis
-----------------

To diagnose your problem:

1. Start System Configuration Editor (Sysedit.exe).

  If this program starts correctly, then there is not an issue with either the
  NTVDM or the Windows on Windows subsystem. The problem then is with your
  program not Windows NT. If the program is an older version and requires EMS
  memory, you must configure it. For more information, please see the following
  Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:

  Q99279 MS-DOS-Based Application and Command Prompts

  Q196875 Error When EMS Memory Is Configured for MS-DOS App in .pif File

  If the program requires more convential memory than is available, please see
  the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q99363 Increasing Memory for MS-DOS-Based Applications

  However, if System Configuration Editor does not start correctly, then you do
  not know where the problem lies. Because the problem could be with either
  Windows on Windows or NTVDM, go to step 2. If troubleshooting determines that
  the problem is with the Windows on Windows subsystem, then all of the steps
  listed below in the Troubleshooting section below apply.

2. Run the MS-DOS shell (running the "Command.com " (without the quotation
  marks) command from the MS-DOS command prompt).

  If this program starts, then run the "Edit.com" (without the quotation marks)
  command, then you know that NTVDM works. If the shell does not start, then
  all of the troubleshooting steps below apply (except steps 3 and 4).

3. Check and delete the default NTVDM. Run the "Sysedit.exe " (without the
  quotation marks) command at a command prompt.

  NOTE: If for any reason your computer does not pass the previously mentioned
  test, then repeat the entire procedure above after you complete the next
  three steps.

  a. Start Task Manager, click the Processes tab, and then click the Image name
     column.

  b. Look for the Image name ntvdm, and then stop the process if you find it in
     the list. If you do not find it in the list, skip the next step.

  c. Repeat the procedure outlined in steps 2 and 3 above.

Troubleshooting 
---------------

Please repeat the following steps in the order they appear to troubleshoot issues
with either the NTVDM or Windows on Windows subsystems.

Please note that steps three and four apply only to the situation where the
Windows on Windows subsystem does not start.

1. Check the Autoexec.nt and Config.nt files for anything unusual or anything
  that can be commented out.

2. Rename Autoexec.bat.

3. Check for changes in Win.ini or System.ini, or replace by expanding the
  original files off of the installation media.

4. Rename all other *.ini files, if possible.

5. In the Config.nt file, allow the following values only:

  dos=high, umb
  device=%SystemRoot%\System32\Himem.sys
  files=60
  shell=%SystemRoot%\System32\Command.com /e:4096

  NOTE: The default entries off of the installation disk will allow SYSEDIT to
  run, but other entries as outlined above may be needed for other programs to
  run. Also, files has a valid range of 5 to 254.

6. Verify the environment variables by doing either of the following:

   - Click Start, click Settings, click Control Panel, double-click System, and
     then click the Environment tab.

  -or-

   - Run the "set" (without the quotation marks) command at the command prompt
     and check all environmental variables for nulls, blanks, double equal sign
     (==) marks, or other unknown entries.

7. Ensure that the path is the same as the default path off of the CD; that is,
  that there are no entries prepended to the path. If a nonstandard entry is
  there, remove it. Add only the entries needed for your one program and the
  defaults.

8. Check path length for lengths after expansion that are near 200 characters.
  Path is a combination of path in Autoexec.nt and on the Environment tab in
  the System tool of Control Panel. If the path is over 100 characters, change
  it for testing.

9. If this does not work, you have missing or corrupted files. (More likely, the
  files will be corrupted rather than missing; try to replace these first.)

   - Ntio.sys

   - Ntdos.sys

   - Ntvdm.exe

   - Ntvdm.dll (3.1 only)

   - Redir.exe
