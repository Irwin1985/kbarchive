-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create an application that uses an ActiveX control that you add at
run-time with syntax similar to the following:

     THISFORM.AddObject("myctrl","olecontrol","mscomctllib.listviewctrl.2")

Then you build this application into an executable file, create a distribution
with the Setup Wizard, and install your application on other computers, when you
attempt to run code similar to the preceding code you receive an error like the
following:

     Program Error
     OLE error code 0x80040112: Appropriate license for this class not found.

CAUSE
=====

A distribution created with the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard only allows a
run-time license, while the AddObject method requires a design time license.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the control you want to use into a class that is saved in a Visual Class
library or into a class created with the DEFINE CLASS command. Next, add an
instance of the class at run-time instead of adding the control. Please see the
MORE INFORMATION section for details.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following example demonstrates using the DEFINE CLASS command to create a
subclassed OleControl, then adds the subclassed OleControl at run-time.

1. Paste the following code into a program (.PRG) file:

        PUBLIC oform1
        oform1=CREATEOBJECT("form1")
        oform1.Show
        READ EVENTS
        RETURN

        DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form
           AutoCenter = .T.
           cNextKey = "1_"
           Name = "Form1"
           Caption = "Treeview Demo Form"

           ADD OBJECT cmdExit AS commandbutton WITH ;
              Top = 204, ;
              Left = 276, ;
              Height = 27, ;
              Width = 84, ;
              Caption = "E\&lt;xit"

           ADD OBJECT cmdAddLV AS commandbutton WITH ;
              Top = 204, ;
              Left = 10, ;
              Height = 27, ;
              Width = 106, ;
              Caption = "Add Listview"

           ADD OBJECT cmdAddLVClass AS commandbutton WITH ;
              Top = 204, ;
              Left = 130, ;
              Height = 27, ;
              Width = 136, ;
              Caption = "Add Listview Subclass"

           PROCEDURE Destroy
              CLEAR EVENTS
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE cmdExit.Click
              thisform.release()
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE cmdAddLV.Click

             * The following AddObject causes the error.
          Thisform.AddObject('Lv1','olecontrol','mscomctllib.listviewctrl.2')
          Thisform.SetLVProps()

           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE cmdAddLVClass.Click
              * The following code shows the workaround. The class OC1 is
              * defined in the last 3 lines of this program.
              * Alternanely, you could use an object stored in a Visual Class
              * library (.vcx) file.

           Thisform.NewObject('LV1','OC1')

              Thisform.SetLVProps()
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE SetLVProps
              thisform.setall('enabled', .F.,'commandbutton')
              WITH thisform.LV1
                 .visible = .t.
                 .height = 190
                 .left = 75
                 .width = 250
                 .view = 2
                 .listitems.add(,,"List Item 1",,)
                 .listitems.add(,,"List Item 2",,)
              ENDWITH
              thisform.cmdExit.enabled = .t.
              thisform.cmdExit.setfocus()
           ENDPROC
        ENDDEFINE

        DEFINE class OC1 as olecontrol
           OleClass = 'mscomctllib.listviewctrl.2'
        ENDDEFINE

2. Add the program to a project and build the project into an executable (.exe)
  file. Name the file lvtest.exe.

3. Create a directory called TestDir and place a copy of the executable file
  from the preceding Step 2 into the directory.

4. Run the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard.

5. In the Setup Wizard dialog box, "Step 1 [ASCII 150] Locate Files" is
  displayed in the list box. In the Distribution Files text box select the
  TestDir directory you created in Step 3, click Select and then click Next.

6. In the Setup Wizard dialog box, "Step 2 [ASCII 150] Specify Components" is
  displayed in the text box. In the Application Components option group, select
  the "Visual FoxPro runtime" check box.

7. Next, select the ActiveX controls check box. The Add ActiveX Controls dialog
  box appears.

8. Scroll through the "Select ActiveX controls to install" list box, select
  "Microsoft ListView Control, version 6.0", click the Close button to exit the
  dialog box and then click Next.

9. In the "Step 3 [ASCII 150] Create Disk Image Directory" step of the Setup
  Wizard, select or type in the directory name you want to use for the creation
  of your disk images, and then click Next.

10. In "Step 4 [ASCII 150] Specify Setup Options", of the Setup Wizard dialog
  box, type "ListView Test App" in the "Setup dialog box caption" text box and
  type "None" in the Copyright information text box and then click Next.

  NOTE: In each case, type in the text without the quotation marks.

11. In the "Step 5 [ASCII 150] Specify Default Destination" step of the Setup
  Wizard dialog box, click Next.

12. In the "Step 6 [ASCII 150] Change File Settings" text box, in the Setup
  Wizard dialog box, select the PM Item check box in the grid next to
  Lvtest.exe (the executable file name).

13. In the "Program Group Menu Item" dialog box, type "ListView Test App" in the
  Description text box, and "%s\lvtest.exe" in the Command Line text box.

  NOTE: Omit the quotes.

  Click OK to close the Program Group Menu Item Dialog box, click Next and then
  click Finish to complete running the Setup Wizard.

14. In the "Setup Wizard Disk Statistics" dialog box, click Done.

15. The distribution files will be in a subdirectory of the directory you listed
  in "Step 3 - Create Disk Image Directory". The subdirectory is named
  disk144. You can install the distribution you have created by copying the
  contents of the Disk1, Disk2, Disk3 and Disk4 directories to diskettes and
  then run the Setup.exe program from the first diskette. You can also connect
  to the computer that contains the distribution through a network to run the
  setup. The installation should be on a computer that does not already have
  Visual FoxPro 6.0 or Visual Studio 6.0 installed.

16. On the installation computer, from the Windows Taskbar, select Start, point
  to Programs, and then point to Visual FoxPro Applications. Click the
  ListView Test App program item.

17. When the application starts, click the Add Listview button. An error like
  the one listed in the SYMPTOMS section occurs.

18. Select Cancel, and repeat Step 16. This time, click the Add Listview
  Subclass button, and the error does not occur.

The preceding example uses a subclass of the OleControl class called OC1. This
subclass is programmatically created with the DEFINE CLASS command contained in
the last three lines of code in the program example.

Alternately, you could create a subclass of the OleControl class with the Visual
Class Designer. Here are the steps to accomplish this task:

1. Type the following in the Command window:

  

        CREATE CLASS

2. In the New Class dialog box, type a class name. You could use OC1 to be
  consistent with the preceding example.

3. Select OleControl in the Based On list box.

4. In the Store In text box, type the name of a .vcx file in which to store the
  class, or select an existing .vcx file after pressing the ellipse [...]
  button. Use OCTest for the purposes of this example.

5. Click the OK button to create the class.

6. In the Insert Object dialog box, select the Create Control option button.
  From the Object Type list, select the ActiveX control you want to use. In
  order to be consistent with the preceding example, select the "Microsoft
  ListView Control, version 6.0" and then click OK. The new class displays in
  the Class Designer. You may now save the class.

7. The following code would add an instance of the object at run-time in the
  preceding example:

  

        Thisform.NewObject('LV1','OC1', 'OCTest.vcx')

You need to be sure that the .vcx file was added to your project before building
your .exe so that the NewObject command works correctly.
