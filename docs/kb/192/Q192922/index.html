-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After implementing the hotfix described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article
Q188880, "SMS: OSR2 and Internet Explorer 4.0 Inventoried as Windows 98", delta
MIF files are not processed. The following errors are displayed in the
Datalodr.log file (note that the entries that begin with "SQL" only appear if
SQL Tracing is enabled):

  SQL&gt;&gt;&gt;select * from Operating_System_COMM where datakey = 7
  SQL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Done. CGroup::IsGroupInDatabase - MIF type does not
  match type in Defined Group for Attribute Installation Date in Group
  MICROSOFT|OPERATING_SYSTEM|1.0 finished processing current machine. Cannot
  process MIF X00000000.MIF, moving it to BADMIFS

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if inventory has previously been taken using the hotfix
described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q159087, "SMS: Does Not Identify
Pentium Pro (P6) Processor Speeds". As a result, any delta MIF files created
using the hotfix mentioned in Q188880, "SMS: OSR2 and Internet Explorer 4.0
Inventoried as Windows 98", are not processed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
