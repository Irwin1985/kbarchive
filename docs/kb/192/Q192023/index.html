-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When importing users via directory synchronization (dirsync), the custom
recipient (CR) creation may fail. Those imported users have a non-unique alias
or address that can create duplicate proxy addresses. For example, dirsync is
attempting to import a user with the alias SOMEONE, while a user with an SMTP
proxy address of someone@microsoft.com already exists. This newly introduced
user's SMTP proxy should be automatically set to be someone2@microsoft.com.
Instead, the attempt to create a unique proxy is not done, and the entire
creation of the CR fails.

CAUSE
=====

If the "AddressMappingFileName" and "SMTPDomain" values in the
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDX registry key
are enabled, it causes the Addr_map.cfg file to be in use. If the file is in use
when dirsync reaches the duplicate proxy address, dirsync does not attempt to
create a unique address, and therefore, is unable to create the custom
recipient.

The whole point of having the Addr_map.cfg file is to ensure that users can
retain their original SMTP address from Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.
Therefore, as can be expected, when this feature is activated by the registry
entries, it attempts to retain the original SMTP address.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Microsoft recognizes the need for resolving the CR creation failure as mentioned
in the situation above. We have modified Exchange Server version 5.5 so that a
new registry key is now available.

The new code allows for the setup of a new registry value. Perform the following
steps to set these values:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDX

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

     Value Name: Unique SMTP for AddrMap
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
     Value:      0 (Default) or 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

If this value is set to 0 (default), functionality remains as is. If this value
is set to 1 (True), then the Directory Exchange Agent (DXA) and the
AddressMappingFileName registry setting is used to create specific SMTP proxies.
The DXA will then create a unique SMTP address much in the same way it does now
for the secondary MS Mail (PC) proxy.

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Component: dirsync

  File Name     Version
  -----------------------
  Dxa.exe       5.0.2358.0


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.


Additional query words: Unique SMTP for AddrMap, addr_map.cfg, dirsync, migration, MS Mail
