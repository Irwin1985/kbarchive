The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Links 2001 
- Microsoft Motocross Madness, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Plus! Game Pack: Cards and Puzzles 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install any of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive the following error message:

  Unable to find specific language .dll - unable to continue.

When you click OK, Setup does not complete and you are returned to Windows.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you do not have enough free space on your hard disk
to install the game.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, free up enough space on your hard disk to install the
game. To do this, use one or more of the following methods.

Remove Programs You No Longer Need
----------------------------------

You can often free significant space on your hard disk by removing programs you
no longer use. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. In the list of installed programs, click a program you no longer want
  installed on the computer, and then click Add/Remove. Follow the instructions
  on the screen to remove the program.

4. Repeat step 3 for each program you want to remove.

5. When you are finished removing programs, close Control Panel.

Delete Temporary Files
----------------------

Under normal circumstances, temporary files are closed and deleted when you exit
Windows. However, if you exit Windows incorrectly (for example, restarting the
computer or turning it off when Windows is running), temporary files may not be
closed or deleted.

To delete temporary files, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "*.tmp" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the Look In box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

5. On the File menu, click Delete.

  NOTE: If you receive an "Access Denied" message, quit all running programs and
  then repeat steps 1-5.

  To quit all running programs, follow these steps:

  a. Disable any anti-virus programs or disk utilities installed on the
     computer. For information about how to disable these programs, see the
     printed or online documentation for the program.

  b. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.

  c. Quit all programs except Explorer and Systray (which are parts of
     Windows). To quit a program, click the program, and then click End Task.

  d. Repeat this step to quit all unnecessary programs.

Delete Temporary Internet Files
-------------------------------

Temporary Internet files are cached copies of the Web pages you access, as well
as supplementary files such as graphic images and videos. You may find that Web
pages you have accessed in the past take longer to load the first time you visit
them after you delete these cached files.

To delete temporary Internet files, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Internet.

3. On the General tab, under Temporary Internet Files, click Delete Files.

  NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x, click Settings on the
  Advanced tab, and then click Empty Folder.

Empty Recycle Bin
-----------------

To empty the Recycle Bin, right-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop, and
then click Empty Recycle Bin. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to
delete the files, click Yes.

For more information about how to free space on your hard disk, click Start,
click Help, click the Index tab, type "troubleshooting" (without the quotation
marks), click the Disk Space Help topic, and then click Display.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For information about the minimum system requirements needed to install and run
Motocross Madness, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

To determine the amount of free space on your hard disk, follow these steps:

2. Right-click your hard disk, and then click Properties.

3. On the General tab, note the amount of free space.

4. Click OK.

  NOTE: If you have multiple hard disks, repeat steps 2-4 for each hard disk to
  determine the amount of free space on each hard disk.

5. Close the My Computer window.
