-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install a run-time application that uses the FoxFont font, the install
places the FoxFont.fon file in the directory with your application's executable
file. When you run the executable, it does not use FoxFont, instead it
substitutes another font, such as Courier New.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro 6.0 run-time applications no longer use the FoxFont when it is in
the application directory. In order to use the FoxFont, it must be installed in
the Fonts directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place a copy of the FoxFont.fon font file in the Windows\Fonts directory. You
can do this automatically by distributing the FoxFont.fon with your application
and adding the following code to the initialization code of your application.
This copies the font to the Windows/Fonts directory if it does not yet exist
there. You would need to place this code before any other objects or code that
use FoxFont, such as forms, reports, _SCREEN.FONTNAME="foxfont" commands, and so
forth.

Sample Code
-----------

     LOCAL lcAppDir, lcWinFontDir

     * Get current App directory from SYS(16).
     lcAppDir = SUBSTR(SYS(16), 1, RAT('\',SYS(16),1)-1)

     * Get WinDir environment and find the Fonts directory.
     lcWinFontDir = GETENV('windir')+'\Fonts'

     * Check that FoxFon.fon is in App directory and not in Fonts directory.
     IF FILE(lcAppDir+'\foxfont.fon') AND !FILE(lcWinFontDir+'\foxfont.fon')
        * Copy the file
        COPY file (lcAppDir+'\foxfont.fon') ;
           TO (lcWinFontDir+'\foxfont.fon')
        SET MESSAGE TO    &amp;&amp; Clears "&lt;nnnnn&gt; bytes copied" from status bar
        WAIT "" TIME 2    &amp;&amp; Pause to allow font to be loaded
     ENDIF

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project called Fonttest and add a program named Main with the
  following contents:

        * This uses CREATE OBJECT and a form class, but the same steps
        * work with a form created with DO FORM.

        oform1=CREATEOBJECT("form1")
        oform1.Show
        READ events

        DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form
           Height = 169
           Width = 309
           AutoCenter = .T.
           Caption = "Font Test Form"
           Name = "Form1"

        ADD OBJECT command1 AS commandbutton WITH ;
           Top = 108, ;
           Left = 108, ;
           Height = 27, ;
           Width = 84, ;
           Cancel = .T., ;
           Caption = "E\&lt;xit", ;
           TabIndex = 2, ;
           Name = "Command1"

        ADD OBJECT text1 AS textbox WITH ;
           FontName = "FoxFont", ;
           FontSize = 9, ;
           Value = (chr(227)), ;
           Height = 25, ;
           Left = 84, ;
           Top = 36, ;
           Width = 144, ;
           Name = "Text1"

        PROCEDURE Destroy
           Clear events
        ENDPROC

        PROCEDURE command1.Click
           Release thisform
        ENDPROC

        ENDDEFINE

2. Build the project into an executable file.

3. Place the executable from Step 2 and the Foxfont.fon from your Visual FoxPro
  6.0 home directory in a separate directory. The Visual FoxPro home directory
  can be determined by issuing the following command in the Command window:

  " ?HOME() " (without the quotation marks)

4. Run the .exe file. When the form appears, the text box contains a lower case
  a with two dots over it, or some other character. The FoxFont character for
  CHR(227) is the symbol for pi, and this is what would appear if FoxFont were
  being used.

Demonstration of Workaround
---------------------------

1. Paste the code listed in the RESOLUTION section into the Main program created
  in Step 1 of the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section. Insert the code at the
  beginning of the program, before the CREATEOBJECT command.

2. Repeat steps 2-4 in the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section. This time, the
  symbol for pi appears in the text box.

Previous versions of FoxPro for Windows and Visual FoxPro for Windows allowed
run-time applications to find and use the FoxFont if it was located in the
application directory. However, Visual FoxPro 6.0 requires any font used by a
run-time application to be in the Windows\Fonts directory.

Windows 9x and Windows NT each store font files in a subdirectory of the Windows
directory called Fonts. Any font files in this directory are available for use
by applications. Windows 9x installs, by default, to the C:\Windows directory,
and Windows NT installs, by default, to a directory called C:\WINNT.
Additionally, you have the option to specify the directory where Windows will be
installed during Windows Setup. The preceding code retrieves the Windows
directory name using the WINDIR environment variable. This makes the code
generic, so it works properly regardless of the Windows directory name, or
whether the operating system is Windows 9x or Windows NT.
