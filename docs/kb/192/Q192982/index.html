-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Internet Mail Service is configured to disable auto replies
to the Internet, auto forwards to an Internet address are also suppressed.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Service cannot detect the difference between a message that is
an auto reply and a message that is an auto forward. The difference between the
messages is that the auto forwarded message has the MAPI property
PR_AUTO_FORWARDED set.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Component: Internet Mail Service

  File Name      Version
  -------------------------
  Msexcimc.exe   5.5.2407.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

New code was added to the Internet Mail Service to enable detection of an auto
forwarded message. To add the necessary registry key, follow these steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC
     \Parameters

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

     Value Name: AlwaysAllowForwarding
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
     Value:   1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

After this key is added and the new Internet Mail Service hotfix is applied, auto
forwarded messages can be sent while auto replies are disabled.
