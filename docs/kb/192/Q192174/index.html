SUMMARY
=======

In certain cases you may find it necessary to remove and re-add the Event
Service service. The following Event IDs may be seen in these cases.

One series of events that might occur, requiring the removal and reinstallation
of the Event Service is:

  Event ID   : 0
  Source     : MSExchangeES
  Type       : Informational
  Category   : General
  Description: The Microsoft Exchange Event Service (5.5.1960.3)
               Started successfully.

  Event ID   : 5
  Source     : MSExchangeES
  Type       : Error
  Category   : General
  Description: An unexpected MAPI error occurred. Error returned
               was [0x80004005].

  Event ID   : 1
  Source     : MSExchangeES
  Type       : Informational
  Category   : General
  Description: The Microsoft Exchange Event Service stopped successfully.

Before removing the Event Service as a solution, verify that this server is a
public folder server. If the server is not a public folder server, the Events
Service will not start. For additional information, please refer to the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base, which explains this
requirement in more detail:

  Q182082 : XADM: Event Service Won't Start If Alternate PF Server Selected

MORE INFORMATION
================

Removing the Event Service and re-adding it does not require that you stop any
other Exchange Server services or reboot the server.

WARNING: Removing the Event Service will cause you to lose all scripts installed
on the server and all permissions assigned on the Eventconfig_&lt;server
name&gt; for the server.

Steps to Remove Event Service
-----------------------------

You will need your Exchange Server CD.

1. Run Setup from the Exchange Server CD.

2. Click on the Add/Remove Button from Setup program.

3. Select Exchange Server, and click on the Change Option button.

4. Clear the Microsoft Exchange Event Service option.

5. Click Ok, then click Continue, and click Yes to remove one component.

6. Check the services under Control Panel Services and be sure the Event Service
  has been removed.

7. Re-run the Exchange Server Setup, following the same steps, and select the
  Microsoft Exchange Event Service.

8. Reapply any service packs that were installed on Exchange Server prior to the
  removal of the Event Service. This, however, requires the stopping of
  services by the service pack installation.
