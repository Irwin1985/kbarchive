SYMPTOMS
========

The directory synchronization (dirsync) process fails when approximately 150
containers or more are set to be exported to more than one Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks requestor. The process works for the first requestor, but fails with
the second and subsequent requestors; they fail to get their updates. The
following errors may be seen in the application event log when the logging level
for the MSExchangeDX category is set to Maximum in the properties for the
directory synchronization service:

  Event ID: 143
  Description: Unable to update the remote dirsync entry 233 in directory
  service.

  Event ID: 133
  Description: Error DS_Service_error , problem DS_E_ADMIN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
  returned by the Microsoft Exchange DS. (thread 0).

  Event ID: 168
  Description: State information could not be updated. Duplicates may be sent or
  received during the next synchronization cycle for remote dirsync 233.
  (thread 452)

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to a Jet page size limitation.

Jet limits page size to 4 KB. Jet tries to store all the information for a record
in the page. If the combined data exceeds the page size, the data is stored
elsewhere, and a 6-byte pointer is stored in the original page. After you add
enough values/attributes, Jet can no longer add anything else, so it generates
this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recognizes the need for people to export large numbers of containers
to more than one MS Mail (PC) requestor. We have modified the necessary Exchange
Server components so that more containers can be exported.

This feature is available in the latest service pack for Exchange Server version
5.5. For additional information, click the following article number to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this feature should have the following file attributes or
later:

Components: Administrator Program and Directory Synchronization

+--------------------------+
| File name  | Version     | 
+--------------------------+
| Admin.exe  | 5.5.2653.23 | 
+--------------------------+
| Dxa.exe    | 5.5.2653.11 | 
+--------------------------+
| Dxamsg.dll | 5.5.1960.3  | 
+--------------------------+
| Schema.csv | N/A         | 
+--------------------------+
| Schema.ini | N/A         | 
+--------------------------+

NOTES:

- The updated Admin.exe, Dxa.exe and Dxamsg.dll files should be applied on the
  dirsync server experiencing this problem.
- The updated Admin.exe file should be applied on all Exchange Server
  computers, so that they are aware of the new schema.
- The updated Dxamsg.dll file should be applied on all servers that are used to
  check the event logs of the dirsync server that has this feature.

To apply this feature:

1. Stop all the Exchange Server services except the directory service.

2. On the dirsync server, type the following command at a command prompt, and
  then press ENTER:

  "admin -i schema.csv -d servername -o schema.ini" (without the quotation
  marks)

3. Stop the directory service.

4. Copy the updated Admin.exe, Dxa.exe, and Dxamsg.dll files to the Exchsrvr\Bin
  folder.

5. Restart all the Exchange Server services.

6. Check the event log for successful data conversion or any errors. Note that
  the updated Administrator program will now be used for any changes to the
  Exchange Server services or when additional Recipients containers are added
  to the Export Container tab in the properties for the Remote DirSync
  Requestor object.

7. Copy the updated Admin.exe file to all Exchange Server computers.

8. Copy the updated Dxamsg.dll file to all servers that are used to check the
  event logs of the dirsync server that has this feature.


WORKAROUND
==========

Reduce the number of containers exported to MS Mail (PC) requestors during
dirsync to a number below 100.

STATUS
======

This feature was first included in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.
