SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates two methods of implementing "What's This?" Help on an
ActiveX Control created in Visual Basic. Adding this feature to your control
allows your users to quickly access the appropriate Help topics for your
control.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An ActiveX control can have its own helpfile and help information for the
contained controls. As per encapsulation rules of COM, it is recommended to have
separate help system for a UserControl. However, in some cases, it is
appropriate to inherit the help from the client form in which the ActiveX
control is sited. This article describes both of these methods.

Method 1: Using Separate Help System for the UserControl
--------------------------------------------------------

If the UserControl has its own helpfile, then this method is well suited.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX Control project. UserControl1 is created by default.

2. Place three controls onto the UserControl.

3. Select Project1 Properties from the Project menu. On the General tab, specify
  the help file in the Help File Name field.

4. For each control on UserControl1, change the WhatsThisHelpId to a valid value
  for your help file. Close all open windows.

5. Select Add Project from the Project menu to add a new Standard EXE project.
  Project2 is created by default.

6. Place UserControl1 onto Form1. Change the BorderStyle property of Form1 to
  Fixed Single. Set the WhatsThisButton property to True.

7. Run the project. Click on the "?" button in the title bar, and then click on
  any control in the UserControl. The appropriate help is shown.

  NOTE: When you click on the "?" button and then click on the UserControl in
  the area not covered by contained controls, no help is shown. This is because
  the UserControl does not have a WhatsThisHelpId in design-mode. However,
  WhatsThisHelpId property is available when it is sited, and the client form
  can assign a value to it. If you want to assign a WhatThisHelpId at
  design-time itself, cover the UserControl with a Frame or PictureBox and
  assign the WhatsThisHelpId to that control.

8. Stop the project. Go to Project Properties of Project2 and specify a helpfile
  for it.

9. Set the WhatsThisHelpId of UserControl1 to a valid value. Add necessary
  controls and set their WhatsThisHelpId.

10. Run the project. Click on "?," and then click on the UserControl in the area
  not covered by contained controls. Note that the correct Help is shown. Note
  that the help information shown comes from Project2's helpfile and not from
  UserControl1's helpfile. If this behavior is not desired, apply the "Note"
  from step 7.

Method 2: Inheriting Help from the Client Application
-----------------------------------------------------

In some cases, such as when the UserControl is simple, it may not have its own
help file. In this case it is desirable to inherit the help system provided by
the client application.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX Control project. UserControl1 is created by default.

2. Place three controls onto the UserControl.

3. Select Add Project from the Project menu to add a new Standard EXE project.
  Project2 is created by default.

4. Place UserControl1 onto Form1. Change the BorderStyle property of Form1 to
  Fixed Single. Set the WhatsThisButton property to True.

5. Select Project2 Properties from the Project menu. On the General tab, specify
  the help file in the Help File Name field.

6. Set the WhatsThisHelpId of UserControl11 to a valid value. Add necessary
  controls to Form1 and set their WhatsThisHelpId.

7. Run Project2. Click on "?" and click on UserControl11 in the area not covered
  by contained controls. The specified help topic is displayed. If any
  contained control is clicked, no help topic will be displayed. To achieve
  this effect implement the following steps:

  a. In the General Declarations section of UserControl1, add the following
     code:

           Public Property Get HelpFile() As String
             HelpFile = App.HelpFile
           End Property

           Public Property Let HelpFile(ByVal vNewValue As String)
             If Dir(vNewValue) = "" Then
                 Err.Raise 53  ' File not found
             Else
                 App.HelpFile = vNewValue
             End If
           End Property

           Public Sub InheritHelp(Optional nWhatsThisHelpId As Integer)

             Dim cTemp As Control
             If nWhatsThisHelpId = 0 Then
                 nWhatsThisHelpId = UserControl.Extender.WhatsThisHelpID
             End If

             For Each cTemp In Controls
                 On Error Resume Next  ' Ignore errors in next statement
                 cTemp.WhatsThisHelpID = nWhatsThisHelpId  ' some controls
                                  ' may not have WhatsThisHelpid property
                 On Error GoTo 0  ' Turn off error handling
             Next

           End Sub
     

  b. In the client Form's General Declaration section, add the following code:

           Private Sub Form_Load()
             UserControl11.HelpFile = App.HelpFile
             UserControl11.InheritHelp  ' Pass WhatsThisHelpId if different
                   ' help Id is desired for contained controls
                   ' By default, the HelpId of usercontrol will be inherited
           End Sub
     

8. Run the project. Click on "?" and click anywhere on the UserControl. Note
  that the specified Help Topic is displayed.
