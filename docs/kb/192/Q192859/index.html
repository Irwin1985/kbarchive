-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 Service Pack 4 includes the
following three utilities to help resolve specific database issues:

- SMSIDDUP: Duplicate SMSID Locator

- DATDUPCK: Duplicate Data Key Checker

- DATDUPCL: Duplicate Data Key Cleaner

This article describes these utilities and their application.


MORE INFORMATION
================

These utilities are located in the Support\Debug\&lt;platform&gt; directory of
the Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4 source.

SMSIDDUP: Duplicate SMSID Locator
---------------------------------

The duplicate SMSID locator generates a report, called Smsiddup.log, that
contains computers that have duplicate SMSIDs.

Usage:

     SMSIDDUP &lt;sql_server_name&gt; &lt;sql_login&gt; &lt;sql_password&gt; &lt;sms_database&gt;

NOTE: If &lt;sql_password&gt; is NULL, use double quotation marks for the
password field, as in the following example:

     SMSIDDUP SERVER sa "" SMSDB

Alternatively, for interactive operation, you can use:

     SMSIDDUP

Requirements:

SMSIDDUP requires that the SQL Server for Systems Management Server is running
Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 3 or later. You should run SMSIDDUP from a
computer that has the Systems Management Server Administrator program installed
and functioning properly, to ensure that all required DLL files are available.

Additional Information:

In Systems Management Server, it is possible to have two different types of
duplicates. The Systems Management Server Database Manager will locate first
type of duplicate. Querying on this type duplicate in the Systems Management
Server Administrator program will produce multiple records.

However, the Systems Management Server Database Manager will NOT locate the
second type of SMSID duplicate. In this situation, the data for a given machine
in the current machine data table refers to a single machine. When a different
machine using the same SMSID is inserted into the database, Systems Management
Server moves the "old" machine data to the historical machine data table. In
this case, Systems Management Server is not "aware" that there is more than one
machine using the SMSID. Querying on the SMSID in the Systems Management Server
Administrator program will produce a single record. Viewing the history for the
Identification group in this record will show that the machine name changes
frequently (the machine name does not actually change; multiple machines
actually report using different names).

SMSIDDUP locates this second type of SMSID duplicates. These duplicates can cause
the Systems Management Server Dataloader to process machine MIF files very
slowly or to stop responding. These duplicates may also lead to database
corruption. This second type of SMSID duplicates are commonly the result of
having a "cloned" Sms.ini file present (that is, an image install of a computer
was done with an existing Sms.ini file in the image).

To assist in cleaning up the second type of SMSID duplicates, SMSIDDUP produces a
report containing the SMSID, site code, machine name, domain, and the Last
Hardware Scan time from any of the second type of SMSID duplicates. You should
delete these machines from the SMS database, and also delete their Sms.ini
files. After deleting the machines from the database and also deleting their
associated Sms.ini files, you can reinventory these machines, and they will be
assigned a new unique SMSID. As history and unused common/specific records are
removed from the database, remnants of the second type of duplicates will be
removed. If the Sms.ini files on these clients are not deleted and the machines
are simply deleted from the database, they will reappear in the database after
their next inventory, and you must repeat the cleanup process. To completely
eliminate this problem, the Sms.ini file on the client must be deleted.

DATDUPCK: Duplicate Data Key Checker
------------------------------------

The duplicate data key checker generates a report, called Datdupck.log, that
lists rows in the SMS database with duplicate datakey values.

Usage:

     DATDUPCK &lt;sql_server_name&gt; &lt;sql_login&gt; &lt;sql_password&gt; &lt;sms_database&gt;

Alternatively, for interactive operation, you can use:

     DATDUPCK

Requirements:

DATDUPCK requires that the SQL Server for Systems Management Server is running
Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 3 or later. You should run DATDUPCK from a
computer that has the Systems Management Server Administrator program installed
and functioning properly, to ensure that all required DLL files are available.

Additional Information:

When using Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2 or earlier to attach
sites to one another, it is possible for information in the SMS database to be
duplicated incorrectly. Symptoms of this may appear in data that is stored as
COMMON rather than SPECIFIC according to the DMTF specifications. Examples of
this would be in the PC_BIOS or Disk data, although any COMMON storage may be
affected. Symptoms may be displayed as a duplicate drive C or no drive A for
certain systems. Other symptoms may exhibit themselves as well, depending on the
state of the child and parent databases before the site attachment.

For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

DATDUPCL: Duplicate Data Key Cleaner
------------------------------------

The duplicate data key cleaner cleans duplicate datakey inventory from the
database.

Usage:

     DATDUPCL &lt;sql_server_name&gt; &lt;sql_login&gt; &lt;sql_password&gt; &lt;sms_database&gt;

Alternatively, for interactive operation, you can use:

     DATDUPCL

Requirements:

DATDUPCL requires that the SQL Server for Systems Management Server is running
Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 Service Pack 3 or later. You should run DATDUPCL from a
computer that has the Systems Management Server Administrator program installed
and functioning properly, to ensure that all required DLL files are available.

Additional Information:

The SMS database should be in single user mode, to ensure that no users or SMS
services are accessing the database at the time DATDUPCL runs. You should make
sure that all SMS services are stopped and no Systems Management Server
Administrator consoles are running against the database while DATDUPCL runs.

WARNING: DATDUPCL modifies the SMS database. Before using DATDUPCL, execute these
DBCC commands from ISQL/W or the SQL Enterprise Manager:

     dbcc checkdb
     dbcc newalloc

Refer to the "Examining the Error Log and DBCC Output" topic in the SQL Server
Books Online and verify that there are no errors. If any errors are returned, do
NOT execute DATDUPCL. Instead, contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS).
If no errors are returned, perform a dump of the SMS database and then proceed.

Depending on the number of duplicate datakey entries, DATDUPCL can delete a large
amount of information from your SMS database. It is necessary to delete this
information to clean the duplicate datakeys; the information will be reported by
means of hardware and software inventory at the next inventory interval. Because
DATDUPCL can delete a large amount of information, you must ensure that your SMS
database log size and tempdb size are sufficient. The following are some good
guidelines for these sizes:

     Tempdb size  = (SMS database size * .25)
     SMS log size = (SMS database size * .35)
