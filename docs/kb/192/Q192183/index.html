-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

In MDI child forms, accelerator keys such as CTRL+TAB, CTRL+F6, and CTRL+F4 will
not work when the focus is set to the following controls:

Combobox
Tabstrip
Slider
Listview
Treeview
MaskedEdit Control
DBGrid
DBCombo
DBList
few non-intrinsic controls.

The accelerator keys will work for the following controls:

CommandButton
Textbox
Listbox
Picturebox
Checkbox
OptionButton
Vertical Scroll Bar
Horizontal Scroll Bar
DriveListBox
DirListBox
FileListBox

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to trap the keys in the KeyDown event of each child form and
to simulate the right behavior by sending the WM_SYSCOMMAND message. See the
MORE INFORMATION section below for a step-by-step example that describes how to
implement this workaround if many forms are present in a project.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. From the Project menu, add Form2 and a MDI Form. For Form1 and Form2, set the
  MDI child property to True.

3. Place a CommandButton and a ComboBox in Form2. Add more controls in Form1 and
  Form2 as desired.

4. Paste the following code in the MDI form's General Declaration section:

        Private Sub MDIForm_Load()
           Form1.Show
           Form2.Show
        End Sub

5. Run the application. When the focus is on CommandButton, the keys CTRL+TAB
  and CTRL+F4 work. But, when the focus is on a ComboBox, the above keys fail.
  Note that for a ComboBox, F4 and CTRL+F4 will drop the list as expected.
  Experiment with other controls.

Steps to Resolve the Problem
----------------------------

The following steps describe a generic solution that can be applied to any
project that has this problem:

1. Paste the following code in any existing module. If there is no module, add a
  module from the Project menu, and paste in the following code:

        Option Explicit

        Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias "SendMessageA" _
        (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, ByVal wParam As Long, _
        ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

        Public Const SC_CLOSE = &amp;HF060
        Public Const SC_NEXTWINDOW = &amp;HF040
        Public Const WM_SYSCOMMAND = &amp;H112

        Public Sub NextWin(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer, sCtl _
        As String, hWin As Long)
        If (KeyCode = vbKeyTab And (Shift And vbCtrlMask)) Or (KeyCode = _
              vbKeyF6 And (Shift And vbCtrlMask)) Then
            If Not (sCtl = "CommandButton" Or sCtl = "OptionButton" Or _
               sCtl = "TextBox" Or sCtl = "CheckBox" Or _
               sCtl = "ListBox") Then ' This line is to save CPU time. _
                  ' Code will work even without this If block
                  ' Modify the If block to include other controls as needed
               Call SendMessage(hWin, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_NEXTWINDOW, 0)
            End If
        ElseIf KeyCode = vbKeyF4 And (Shift And vbCtrlMask) Then
           Call SendMessage(hWin, WM_SYSCOMMAND, SC_CLOSE, 0)
        End If
        End Sub

2. For each child form, change the KeyPreview property to True and add the
  following to their code windows:

        Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
           ' Any key processing code specific to project.
           ' Check for CTRL+TAB, CTRL+F6 and
           ' CTRL+F4 here itself for Forms with intense key processing
           NextWin KeyCode, Shift, TypeName(Me.ActiveControl), Me.hwnd
        End Sub

3. Run the project. All the forms should now function properly irrespective of
  which control has the focus.
