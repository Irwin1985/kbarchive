MORE INFORMATION
================

Readme.txt File: Inaccurate Instructions for Running AVI's
----------------------------------------------------------

In the "Animation Files" section, change step 4 to read as follows:

Animation Files

To view the animation files on this CD:

1. Choose Run from the Start menu.

2. Type D:\ANIMATIONS (where D is your CD-ROM drive letter).

3. This will open a Windows Explorer window.

4. Double click the appropriate .EXE file you wish to view. This will launch the
  requested file in the appropriate viewer.

To run the appropriate file with the shell controls and text you must double
click the .EXE file, not the associated .AVI file.


Ebook: Error Printing Chapter 17
--------------------------------

When trying to print all of Chapter 17 from the Ebook, you may receive an error
similar to the following:

  Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
  file://C:\\windows\temp\~hhDD3F.htm.

  Invalid argument.

The chapter will print through the page titled Using NetMeeting, within Lesson 4.
To print the remainder of the chapter, you will need to print one page at a
time.


Ebook problems with Internet Explorer 5.0
-----------------------------------------

If you have Internet Explorer 5.0 installed on your system the ebook setup will
not detect it and will try to install Internet Explorer 4.

To install the electronic version of the book without replacing Internet Explorer
5.0 with Internet Explorer 4, Copy and Paste the win98tk.chm onto your hard
drive. This installation is fully functional and will allow you to use the ebook
without the CD-ROM in the drive.

Please note: This file is 5778 KB, so you will need to check available disk space
before installing.

If you do not have the required disk space available, you can install a shortcut
for the electronic version of the book without replacing Internet Explorer 5.0
with Internet Explorer 4 as follows:

1. Put the Windows 98 Training Kit CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.

2. Right-click a blank area of your Desktop, point to New, and then select
  Shortcut.

3. In the Command Line box type d:\Ebook\Win98tk.chm (where d: is your CD-ROM
  drive letter).

4. Click Next.

5. In the Select A Name For the Shortcut box type Windows 98 Training Kit.

6. Click Finish.

7. Right-click the Windows 98 Training Kit icon, and then select Properties.

8. Click Change Icon, and then in the File Name box type d:\ebook\Win98tk.ico
  (where d: is your CD-ROM drive letter)

9. Click OK, and then click OK.

This will install a shortcut on your desktop that will allow you to run the
electronic version of the book with Internet Explorer 5. However, the Search
function for the electronic version of the book will not work.


Page xxix: NetWatcher Not Covered in Training Kit
-------------------------------------------------

Page xxix of "Microsoft Windows 98 Training" states that one of the topics of the
associated training exam is Net Watcher, and that Net Watcher is covered in
lesson 1 of page 12. This is incorrect. Net Watcher is not covered in the
training book.


Page xxxiii: Incorrect URL
--------------------------

Page xxxiii:
Change: "http:www.microsoft.com/train_cert/cert/bus_bene.htm"
To: "http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/default.asp"


Page 7: Typographical Error
---------------------------

Page 7, last paragraph, last sentence:
Change: "PPRP"
To: "PPTP"


Page 9: Pentium Processor Recommended For NT Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------

Page 9, first component:

Change the first component from: "Minimum hardware standards"
To: "Hardware standards"

Change the Windows 98 hardware standard from: "486DX-66 MHz"
To: "Minimum: 486DX-66 MHz"

Change the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 hardware standard from: "486/25 processor
or better"
To: "Minimum: 486/25 processor" "Recommended: Pentium processor"


Page 68: Typographical Error
----------------------------

Page 68, paragraph 6, sentence 2:
Change: "Thisis~2.txt".
To: "THISIS~2.TXT".


Page 108: Text Error
--------------------

Page 108, paragraph 2, sentence 1:
Change: "includes a core composed of three components:"
To: "includes a core composed of four components:"


Page 254: Install cvt32.dll from Windows 98 installation CD
-----------------------------------------------------------

On pages 253 and 254, under exercise 2, you will need to put the Windows 98
Installation CD in the CD-ROM drive before you proceed with step 4. The
cvt32.dll is on the Windows 98 Installation CD rather than the Training CD that
comes with the kit.

After Step 3 add:
"Insert the Windows 98 Installation disk in the CD-ROM drive."

After Step 9 add:
"Remove the Windows 98 Installation disk, and put the Training CD in the CD-ROM
drive."


Page 273: Minor Text Correction
-------------------------------

Page 273, last sentence:
Change:
"3. Except the default file name..."
To:
"3. Accept the default file name..."


Page 369: Steps Incorrect
-------------------------

Page 369:
Change:
3. Select Client and click Add.
4. Select Microsoft and Client For NetWare Networks.

To:
3. Select Service and click Add.
4. Select Microsoft and File and printer sharing for NetWare Networks.


Back Cover: System Requirements Do Not List Windows 98
------------------------------------------------------

The system requirements on the back cover of the Training Kit do not list Windows
98 as a system requirement for using this Training Kit and the accompanying
CD-ROM. It does list Windows 95 or Windows NT. Windows 98 should be added to the
system requirements for viewing the demonstrations and course material and for
completing the hands-on exercies.

Change:
"To view the demonstrations and the HTML based course material, you need a
computer running Windows NT or Windows 95 and a CD-ROM drive."

To:
"To view the demonstrations and the HTML based course material, you need a
computer running Windows NT, Windows 95, or Windows 98 and a CD-ROM drive."

Add "Windows 98" as the first bullet in the system requirements for the hands-on
exercises.
