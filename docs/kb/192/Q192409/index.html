IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The problem described in this article is difficult to identify. One way to check
for the problem if you suspect you are experiencing it is to calculate the
number of files open on the Window NT-based computer, and look at their size. If
you have approximately 180 GB of open files that are not being closed
continuously or are opened and closed rapidly in a looping condition, you may be
experiencing this problem. Also, your programs may be receiving an
INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES error message when attempting to open, create, or extend
a file.

This problem is intermittent. If you try the operation again it is possible for
it to succeed. This occurs because it is possible to have a program create and
close files faster than Windows NT can clean up. When this occurs it is possible
for the program to succeed if retried.

One method that can be used to identify the problem is to start Task Manager and
click the Performance tab. At the bottom, locate the Kernel Memory section and
watch the value for Paged Memory. You may experience the problem when that value
reaches approximately 190. If this value goes back down immediately, you should
be able to retry the operation that caused the error message and have it succeed
if the system has enough resources to fulfill the program's request.


RESOLUTION
==========

Install the following files and set the following registry entry.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack




WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor

2. Navigate to the following registry subtree:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
  Management

3. From the Edit menu, click Add Value.

4. Enter UnusedFileCache as the value name and set the Data Type to REG_DWORD.

5. Click OK and enter a value of 0 (zero) or 5-40 as the data value.

  0 = Default behavior similar to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3.
  5 - 40 Trim unused file cache based on pool usage.
  This number represents the percent of pool that we allow to be consumed by
  unused segments. Where 5 is most aggressive. (For example, it increases the
  size of the cache the least ) and 40 is least aggressive. (For example, lets
  the cache grow to the largest before trimming) .

  Internal testing found that this fix has positive benefits in that it also
  increases the performance of some applications such as IIS. It works best
  when set to 15-20. Do not choose a value greater than 20 without extensive
  stress testing.

6. Click OK, quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
