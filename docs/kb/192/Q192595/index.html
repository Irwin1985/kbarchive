-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message through the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus
cc:Mail and the cc:Mail recipient views the message, the date on the message may
be incorrect.

For example, if you sent the message on January 1, 2000, the date is displayed as
"1/1/1900" (without quotation marks) instead of "1/1/2000." Note that this
problem also occurs when an Exchange Server recipient receives a message through
the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, and then views the message in an
e-mail client.

This problem only occurs when you use Import.exe version 8.0 and a DB8 cc:Mail
post office.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
