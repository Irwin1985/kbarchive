Product(s): Microsoft Systems Management Server
Version(s): 2.0 SP4
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): kbsms200
Last Modified: 06-AUG-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you downloaded the German, Japanese, French, Korean, Chinese Traditional, or
Chinese Simplified version of Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 4
(SP4) before May 30, 2002, 8:00 P.M. Pacific time, you may have two files
(Clicore.exe and Ccmcore.exe) with improper date stamps.

Notes:

- English and International Client Pack versions are not affected by this
  problem. This problem affects only non-English SMS 2.0 SP4 Server
  installations.

- This problem occurs when you install clients by using Windows Networking
  Logon Client Installation, not by using Windows NT Remote Client
  installation.

- This problem does not occur if you upgrade from SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2)
  directly to SMS 2.0 SP4. It occurs only if you upgrade from SMS 2.0 Service
  Pack 3 (SP3) to SMS 2.0 SP4.

- Existing SMS clients are upgraded successfully. The problem affects only new
  client installations.

Because of an incorrect data stamp on client Setup files, new Systems Management
Server (SMS) client installations may not succeed. This problem occurs with the
German, Japanese, French, Korean, Chinese Traditional, and Chinese Simplified
server versions of SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4). When this problem occurs, base
and optional components may not be installed.

The following entries are recorded in the &lt;Windows
Folder&gt;\MS\SMS\Logs\Clisvcl.log file:

  Client Configuration Installation Manager - (LAUNCH_CONTINUOUS_START)
  Client Configuration Installation Manager - Attempting to launch application
  Verifying application [C:\WINNT\MS\SMS\CORE\BIN\ccim32.dll]
  #$#$#$#$#$ ERROR: The Client Service is not authorized to run this
  application! (5)
  *** Client Configuration Installation Manager - Error launching (#0x5)
  !!!WARNING: Problem starting App (5). Doing App Verify.
  Still waiting for previous verify to finish.
  Finished list processing, return code = 0x5

CAUSE
=====

If you downloaded the German, Japanese, French, Korean, Chinese Traditional, or
Chinese Simplified version of SMS 2.0 SP4 before May 30, 2002, 8:00 P.M. Pacific
time, you may have two files (Clicore.exe and Ccmcore.exe) with improper date
stamps.

To confirm that you are affected by this problem, view the Modified date stamp on
your site server for the Clicore.exe and Ccmcore.exe files in the following
folders:

  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\I386

  -and-

  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\Alpha

If these files have a date stamp of 01/18/2001 (instead of 1/18/2002), and if you
are using Windows Networking Logon Client Installation, your SMS 2.0 SP3 logon
points will not be updated properly with the SP4 version of these files. This
will affect new client installations that use Windows Networking Logon
Installation (Smsman.exe and Smsls.bat).

RESOLUTION
==========

The correction for this problem was updated on May 30, 2002. To download the
updated SP4 version, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/servicepacks/sms20sp4/default.asp

NOTE: If you already upgraded your SMS sites with the original International
version of SMS 2.0 SP4, see the "Correcting Sites" section in this article.
Microsoft recommends that you download the updated SP4 installation image (from
the Web site that is listed earlier in this article) before you upgrade
additional SMS sites to SMS 2.0 SP4.

Correcting Sites
----------------

If you already installed the original International SMS 2.0 SP4 release, there
are two methods that you can use to correct your sites.

Method 1:

Reapply SMS 2.0 SP4 after you download the updated International version of the
SP4 installation source.

Method 2:

Obtain and apply a hotfix that installs versions of the Clicore.exe and
Ccmcore.exe files with the corrected data stamps.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

  Q199078 SMS: How to Remove a Systems Management Server 2.0 Client

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the original International
releases of SMS 2.0 SP4. This problem was first corrected on May 30, 2002, with
new International versions of SMS 2.0 SP4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

To install the hotfix, use one of the following methods on all SMS primary and
secondary site servers on which you installed the original International version
of SP4.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

To use the hotfix installer:

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

3. Copy the Q323652.exe hotfix file and platform folders to the new folder. The
  Q323652.exe hotfix file must be one folder "above" the platform folders.

4. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  run Q323652.exe. Complete any necessary manual installation steps.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

To manually install the hotfix:

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services.

3. Replace the Ccmcore.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with
  the version of the file from the hotfix.

4. Replace the Clicore.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with
  the version of the file from the hotfix.

5. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder with the version of
  the file from the hotfix. Note that you must rename Compverbase.ini to
  Compver.ini.

NOTE: After you apply the hotfix either manually or by using the hotfix
installer, start Windows Explorer and then open the
&lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder.
Right-click the Ccmcore.exe file, and then click Properties to verify that the
file's modified date is 18-Jan-2002. Repeat this process to make sure that the
Clicore.exe file has a modified date of 18-Jan-2002.
