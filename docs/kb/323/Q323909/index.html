-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Print jobs that are reported by event ID 10 in the System Event log and banner
pages may indicate that they are owned by ANONYMOUS LOGON. Additionally, if the
RestrictAnonymous key is set to level 2, and the Everyone group was removed from
the permissions of the Spool folder, the spooler stops responding (hangs).

Log Entry Example
-----------------

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: Print
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 10
  User: NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON
  Computer: &lt;computer name&gt;
  Description:
  Document 1, Test - Notepad owned by ANONYMOUS LOGON was printed on HP LaserJet
  4Si via port LPT1:. Size in bytes: 818; pages printed: 1

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 spooler on the client tried to close the remote printer by
using the SYSTEM account instead of impersonating the user who originally opened
the printer. The SYSTEM account tried to do this under the following
conditions:

- When it spooled a GDI print message.

- The local spooler was under load.

- It was necessary to create another RPC connection to the computer.

Under these conditions, a NULL session pipe is created with no credentials.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

  31 May 2002  17:28  4.0.1381.7155    169,744  Gdi32.dll



WORKAROUND
==========

You do not have to use this workaround if the hotfix is installed on all of the
clients that are printing to the print server. A client is defined as any
computer, including servers and workstations, that sends print jobs to a print
server. However, to prevent the spooler from hanging and continue to
occasionally print ANONYMOUS LOGON print jobs, you can restore the permissions
on the Spool folder, or restore the default setting on the RestrictAnonymous
setting to 0 or 1:

1. View the %SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Printers folder.

2. Add the Everyone group with Full Control rights.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
