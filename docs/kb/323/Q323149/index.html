-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to migrate an existing Qwest DSL user who is running
Mac OS X to set up MSN Broadband powered by Qwest for Macintosh computers with
both Mac OS 9.2 and Mac OS X installed. MSN Broadband software is designed to
work with Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The minimum computer system requirements for MSN Broadband for Macintosh
computers are as follows:

- PowerPC Macintosh computer (G3 or higher recommended)

- 32 MB of RAM (64 MB or more recommended)

- Mac OS 8.6 or later, not including Mac OS X

- 32 MB of available hard-disk space

- CD-ROM drive

- Ethernet port

- Video resolution of 800 x 600 or higher running thousands of colors
  (resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher recommended)

- 28.8 Kbps or higher modem (optional, required only for dial-up connections)

The MSN Broadband powered by Qwest software supports Mac OS 8.6 - 9.x only. The
MSN Broadband software will not install on a Macintosh computer that is running
OS X. However, because new Macintosh computers come standard with both Mac OS
9.2 and OS X installed, MSN Broadband can be used, provided your computer is
running OS 9.2 when configuring the Cisco DSL Modem.

To install the MSN Broadband software on a Macintosh computer running Mac OS 9.2

1. Locate the MSN Broadband Installation Guide included in the Welcome Kit.

2. Follow all setup instructions as described on pages 2 to 5.

To configure the Cisco DSL Modem while running Mac OS X for use with MSN
Broadband

It is possible to configure your modem to work with MSN Broadband while running
Mac OS X. However, because the MSN Broadband software will not install on a
Macintosh computer running Mac OS X, using MSN Broadband with Mac OS requires
manual configuration of the DSL modem while running Mac OS 9.x. In addition,
manually configuring the modem and computer to use MSN Broadband does not permit
installation of the following applications included on the MSN Broadband
CD-ROM.

- Internet Browser (IE) 5.1 for Macintosh

- MSN Messenger 2.1 for Macintosh

- Outlook Express 5.0.4 for Macintosh

For these reasons, using MSN Broadband with Mac OS X is not recommended.

If you choose to install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X, be aware of the following:

- To use IE 5.1 for Macintosh: IE 5.1 comes bundled with Mac OS X systems and
  is already included in your system programs.

- To use MSN Messenger for Macintosh: MSN Messenger can be downloaded for free
  from http://www.microsoft.com/mac/messenger.

- To send and receive e-mail: Outlook Express (OE) is not compatible with Mac
  OS X. Microsoft Entourage, which comes bundled with Microsoft Office X for
  Macintosh, is the only e-mail program compatible for use with MSN Broadband.
  If you install MSN Broadband with Mac OS X and you do not have Microsoft
  Entourage, you cannot use your @msn e-mail address to send and receive
  e-mail.

For more information about using Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and Microsoft
Entourage with MSN Broadband, visit http://www.helpdesk.msn.com/

To configure MSN Broadband on a Macintosh computer running Mac OS X

1. Turn on your Macintosh computer.

2. On the Apple menu, click System Preferences.

3. In the System Preferences window, click Startup Disk.

4. Highlight the Mac OS 9.x System Folder, and then click Restart. When prompted
  with Are you sure you want to set the startup disk and restart the computer?,
  click Save, and then Restart. Your computer will now restart.

5. Make sure the Cisco Commander application is installed on your computer. If
  it is not, you can download it from the Qwest Web site at
  http://www.qwest.com/dsl/customerservice/downloads/mac/DSLUpdater.sea.hqx

6. Quit all other programs.

7. Locate your MSN Migration kit. You will need the key codes found near the
  mailing label to reconfigure your DSL modem.

Step One: Reconfigure Your DSL Modem

Use these instructions to reconfigure your Cisco DSL modem to work with MSN
Broadband powered by Qwest.

1. Make sure the DSL modem is plugged in and powered on. When the modem is on
  and properly communicating with the computer, the LAN LNK light on the front
  of the modem shows a steady green light.

2. Make sure Cisco Commander is installed on your computer.

  Note: If you don't have Cisco Commander installed, download it from the Qwest
  Web site at
  http://www.qwest.com/dsl/customerservice/downloads/mac/DSLUpdater.sea.hqx

  For additional assistance in using Cisco Commander, print the .pdf
  instructions "Upgrading your Cisco modem with a Mac" from the Qwest Web site
  at
  http://www.qwest.com/dsl/customerservice/downloads/docs/Mac_67x.pdf

3. Double-click Cisco Commander.

4. In the Search For Devices dialog box, make sure your modem appears in the
  list of devices. If your modem does not appear in the list, click Discover.

  Note: If your modem still does not appear, call MSN Customer Support at 1
  (866) 783-7868 for assistance.

5. Click OK.

6. In the Authenticate dialog box, type the executive password that you use to
  access your modem. You created this password when you first configured your
  modem for Qwest DSL service. If you don't use an executive password, leave
  this box blank.

  Note: If you previously had an executive password, but cannot remember it,
  contact MSN Customer Support at 1 (866) 783-7868 for assistance.

7. Click OK.

8. In the Cisco Commander window, click the Call tab, and then click Set PPP
  Login Info.

9. In the PPP Authentication dialog box, do the following:
  a. In the Login ID box, type the Key 1 code printed on the back cover of the
  Migration kit, followed by @msndsl.net
  b. In the Password box, type the Key 2 code printed on the back cover of the
  Migration kit.

10. Click OK.

11. On the File menu, click Quit.

Step Two: Configuring Mac OS X

Use these instructions to reconfigure your startup disk to Mac OS X and configure
your TCP/IP settings for Mac OS X.

1. Close any programs open in Mac OS 9.x.

2. On the Apple menu, select Control Panels, and then click Startup Disk.

3. From the list, click Mac OS X, and then click Restart. Your computer will now
  restart.

4. On the Apple menu, click System Preferences.

5. Under Internet &amp; Network, click Network.

6. At Location:, select New Location.

7. Type a name for your new location, for example, MSN Broadband, and then click
  OK.

8. At Show:, select Active Network Ports.

9. Drag Built-in Ethernet to the top of the Port Configurations list.

10. After Show:, select Built-in Ethernet.

11. Click the tab TCP/IP.

12. After Configure, select Using DHCP.

13. Click Apply Now.

14. Close the Network window.
