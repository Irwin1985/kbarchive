SUMMARY
=======

This article lists Microsoft Knowledge Base articles for problems that are fixed
in the Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) Hotfix Rollup
Package (HRP), and also describes how to obtain the HRP.

You must install SMS 2.0 SP4 before you install the HRP. For additional
information about how to install SP4, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q311457 SMS: How to Obtain and Install Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack 4

To obtain the SMS 2.0 SP4 HRP immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support
Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) phone
numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web
site::

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

International Client Pack versions of the HRP will also be made available through
PSS soon after the English-language version of the HRP is released.

IMPORTANT: The application of this hotfix makes a modification to the SMS
database and performs a site reset. Therefore, you must provide an account and
password with the necessary privileges to modify the SMS database. Additionally,
this hotfix updates the SMS Client Base components.

IMPORTANT: If you have an SMS hierarchy with multiple sites in the same domain,
it is important that you apply this hotfix to all sites in the hierarchy at once
in order to avoid any mismatched SMS Client components.
