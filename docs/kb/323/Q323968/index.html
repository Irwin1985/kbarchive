SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure a Global Positioning System (GPS) device
for use with Microsoft Pocket Streets.

How to Configure a GPS Device for Use with Pocket Streets
---------------------------------------------------------

To configure your GPS device for use with Pocket Streets, follow the steps in
this four-part procedure, in the order in which they are presented.

Part 1: Install Pocket Streets:

You can install Pocket Streets on the following mobile devices: Pocket PCs,
palm-sized PCs that run Microsoft Windows CE 2.11 or later, and hand-held PCs
that run Windows CE 2.0 or later. ActiveSync 3.1 or later is required for
installation.

Make sure that ActiveSync 3.1 or later is also installed on your desktop computer
and that your mobile device is synchronized before you install Pocket Streets.

To install Pocket Streets on your mobile device, do one of the following, as
appropriate to your situation:

- If Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips is not installed on your desktop computer,
  follow these steps

  1. Verify that your desktop computer meets the minimum system requirements
     for Streets &amp; Trips.

     For information about the system requirements, see the "References" section
     later in this article.

  2. Insert the Streets &amp; Trips CD into your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, and
     then run Setup to install Streets &amp; Trips.

  3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Pocket Streets.

- If Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips is installed on your desktop computer,
  follow these steps:

  1. Insert the Streets &amp; Trips CD into your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. Hold
     down SHIFT to prevent Streets &amp; Trips Setup from starting
     automatically.

  2. Start Windows Explorer and locate the &lt;drive&gt;:\PStreets folder,
     where &lt;drive&gt; is the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive that contains the
     Streets &amp; Trips CD.

  3. Open the PStreets folder, and then double-click Setup.exe.

  4. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Pocket Streets.

For more information about installing Pocket Streets, see the "References"
section later in this article.

Part 2: Download and Install the Pocket Streets 2002 English Update:

To download and install the Pocket Streets 2002 English Update, visit the
following Microsoft Web site:

  Microsoft.com Download Center - Pocket Streets 2002 English Update
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=32104
  (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=32104)

Part 3: Copy a Map to Your Mobile Device:

1. In Streets &amp; Trips, create a map of the area in which you are currently
  located.

2. Connect your mobile device to your desktop computer (if it is not already
  connected).

3. Double-click Microsoft ActiveSync on your desktop computer.

4. In ActiveSync, click Explore. The Mobile Device folder for your device opens
  in Windows Explorer.

5. In Windows Explorer, locate the map file (.mps) that you created in part 3,
  step 1.

6. Drag the map file to My Documents in the Mobile Device folder for your
  connected device.

  The map is copied to your mobile device for use with Pocket Streets.

Part 4: Connect and Configure the GPS Device:

NOTE: The steps in the following procedure may vary, depending on your particular
hardware.

1. Connect a serial cable to your GPS device.

2. If the GPS cable and the serial cable for the mobile device both use female
  connectors, attach a gender changer.

3. Insert the null modem connection.

4. Connect the serial connector for the null modem to the serial port of the
  mobile device.

5. When the devices are connected, use your mobile device to open the map that
  you created and copied to My Documents in the Mobile Device folder.

6. On the Tools menu, point to GPS, and then click Configure GPS Receiver.

7. Click the appropriate COM port, and then click OK.

8. On the Tools menu, point to GPS, and then click Track Position.

  Your current position on the map appears. It may take several minutes for the
  GPS device to initialize, calculate, and display your current position. By
  default, the GPS position is updated every 15 seconds. This update interval
  cannot be changed.

How to Test Your GPS Device
---------------------------

If you cannot connect your mobile device to your GPS device by using the
procedure in part 4 of this article, test your GPS in terminal mode. To do so:

1. Connect the GPS device to your mobile device, and then either start it in
  simulation mode or verify that three or more satellites are recognized.

  To connect your GPS device to your mobile device, follow steps 1 through 4 in
  part 4 of this article.

2. Click Pocket PC, and then click Settings.

3. Click Connections, and then click Modem.

4. Click New Connection.

5. In the "Select a Modem" list, click a modem. For example, click Hayes
  Compatible.

6. In the "Baud rate" list, click 4800.

7. Click Advanced, and then verify that the "Use terminal before connection"
  check box is selected and that the connection settings are configured as
  follows:

  Data bits: 8
  Parity: None
  Stop bits: 1
  Flow control: Hardware

8. Click OK, and then click Next.

9. Type a phone number, and then click Next.

10. Click to clear the "Cancel call" and "Wait for dial tone" check boxes.

11. Click Finish.

12. Open the new connection that you just created. A terminal window appears
  that displays data similar to the following:

$GPRMB,A,,,,,,,,,,,,V*71

 $GPGGA,225224,3400.000,N,06854.375,E,1,07,2.0,638.3,M,-37.5,M,,*6D

 $GPGSA,A,3,06,10,17,,22,23,,26,30,,,,4.3,2.0,3.0*33

 $GPGSV,3,1,09,06,86,096,51,10,18,043,40,17,49,307,47,21,04,225,00*74

 $GPGSV,3,2,09,22,14,310,39,23,40,223,46,24,04,081,00,26,37,119,45*7B

 $GPGSV,3,3,09,30,24,202,42,,,,,,,,,,,,*43 $PGRME,15.0,M,22.5,M,15.0,M*1B

 $PGRMM,WGS 84*06

If the data that appears in the terminal window is illegible or appears garbled,
investigate possible communications issues between the GPS device and the mobile
device. For more information about how to troubleshoot this issue, contact your
GPS manufacturer.

If after approximately one minute, you receive a message that either no carrier
was found or no dial tone was found, the mobile device is not receiving the data
from the GPS device on that COM port. To troubleshoot this issue, use a
different COM port.
