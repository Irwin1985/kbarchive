========

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if terrain blending is turned on, or if the video driver
for your video adapter is outdated.

This issue is known to occur on computers with AMD K6-2-based processors.
Computers with AMD K6-2-based processors may not be able to use the terrain
blending feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot and resolve this issue, use the following methods, in the order
in which they are presented.

Method 1
--------

Turn off terrain blending. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Start Zoo Tycoon Dinosaur Digs, and then click Play Freeform Game.

2. In the Map List, click a Zoo Tycoon map (for example, click Basic Grass Map
  (Small)), and then click Play.

  NOTE: In this step, make sure that you select a Zoo Tycoon map and not a
  Dinosaur Digs map.

3. Click the Game Options button.

4. Click the Sound &amp; Video tab. (This tab is located directly below the File
  Options tab on the right side of the Game Options dialog box.)

5. Under Terrain Blending, click Don't Blend, and then click the File Options
  tab.

6. Click Main Menu, and then click No when you are prompted to save your current
  zoo.

7. Start a Dinosaur Digs game and test whether the issue is resolved. If this
  procedure resolves the issue, you do not have to follow the remaining steps
  in this article. If the issue is not resolved, go to Method 2.

If you cannot start Zoo Tycoon Dinosaur Digs, you can turn off terrain blending
by editing the Zoo.ini file. To do so, follow these steps:

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
  Notepad.

2. On the File menu, click Open.

3. In the "Files of type" box, click All Files, in the "Look in" box, browse to
  the &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon folder, where
  &lt;drive&gt; is the drive on which Windows is installed.

4. Locate the Zoo.ini file, click the Zoo.ini file, and then click Open.

5. Locate the following lines in the [advanced] section of the Zoo.ini file,
  where &lt;n&gt;is a number:

  drag=&lt;n&gt;
  click=&lt;n&gt;
  normal=&lt;n&gt;
  level=&lt;n&gt;

6. Change the values for each of the following lines that you located in step 5
  to 0. For example:

  drag=0
  click=0
  normal=0
  level=0

7. Click Save on the File menu, and then quit Notepad.

Method 2
--------

Update the video driver for your video adapter, and then remove and reinstall Zoo
Tycoon and Dinosaur Digs. To do so, follow these steps.

4. Click to clear the following check boxes under Selective Startup:

  Process SYSTEM.INI file
  Process WIN.INI file
  Load Startup Items

  check box, and then click Disable All.

6. Click OK, and then click Restart to restart the computer.

  you cleared are still cleared. If you see a selected, unavailable check box
  (it appears dimmed and has a check mark in it), your computer is not truly
  "clean-booted" and you may need assistance from the manufacturer of the
  program that is listed next to the selected, unavailable check box.
