The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Analyze tool against a Visual SourceSafe database, you may
receive an error message that is similar to the following in the Analyze.log
output:

  There is a diff chain size mismatch in file "MyFile.txt" (FYIAAAAA) at
  version 12(versions earlier than that version can no longer be retrieved from
  the database).

If you try to retrieve an earlier version of the file (that is, versions that are
earlier than the version that is listed in the error message), you receive the
following error message:

  Unable to finish writing to the file

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of an error in a log entry record that causes the
difference chain (or delta) to be unusable. The delta is calculated each time a
file is checked in. The delta is used to properly regenerate older versions of
the file.

This error occurs when the file delta is not properly calculated or when the
calculation cannot complete. The following conditions can cause this error to
occur:

- Loss of network connectivity.

- Not enough disk space on the Visual SourceSafe server computer.

- Client ends the check-in operation prematurely.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following methods to resolve this problem:

- Restore the file pairs from backup. For example, if you use the information
  in the error message that is listed in the "Symptoms" section, you must
  restore the FYIAAAAA file and its matching .a or .b file (FYIAAAAA.A or
  FYIAAAAA.B).

  NOTE: Any changes that are made to the file since the last backup are lost.

- Archive and delete the history from the file at the version that is listed in
  the error message. To do this, use the Ssarc.exe command-line utility. For
  example, if you use the information in the error message that is listed in
  the "Symptoms" section, run the following command at a command prompt:

  ssarc -d -v12 archive1.ssa $/Apps/Source/MyFile.txt

  After you archive the history from the file, you can safely delete the
  Archive1.ssa file that is created.

  NOTE: You cannot access any history that is earlier than the version that is
  archived.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
