  ' Construct an instance of the SomeType type.
  Dim ba as new BitArray(10)
         
  ' Visual Basic uses ( ) instead of [ ] to specify array elements.
  Console.WriteLine(ba(2))          'Displays True or False

  'Visual Basic also allows you to access the indexer by its name.
  Console.WriteLine(cs.Bit(2))    'Displays same as previous line

NOTE: While not shown in the code samples here, the vertical ellipsis shown in
the book should be retained.

To:

  ' Construct an instance of the BitArray type.
  Dim ba AS new BitArray(10)
         
  ' Visual Basic uses ( ) instead of [ ] to specify array elements.
  Console.WriteLine(ba(2))          'Displays True or False

(first line: "public StringBuilder AppendFormat(IFormatProvide formatProvider")
and continuing on to page 284, with the following:

  public StringBuilder AppendFormat(IFormatProvider formatProvider, 
     String format, params Object[] args) {

     // If an IFormatProvider was passed, find out
     // whether it offers an ICustomFormatter object.
     ICustomFormatter cf = null;
     if (formatProvider != null)
        cf = (ICustomFormatter) 
           formatProvider.GetFormat(typeof(ICustomFormatter));

     // Keep appending literal characters (not shown in this pseudocode)
     // and replaceable parameters to the StringBuilder's character array.
     while (MoreReplaceableArgumentsToAppend) {
        // argFormat refers to the replaceable format string obtained
        // from the format parameter
        String argFormat = ...;

        // argObj refers to the corresponding element 
        // from the args array parameter
        Object argObj = ...;
   
        // argStr will refer to the formatted string to be appended
        // to the final, resulting string
        String argStr = null;

        // If a custom formatter is available, let it format the argument.
        if (cf != null) 
           argStr = cf.Format(argFormat, argObj, formatProvider);

        // If there is no custom formatter or if it didn't format
        // the argument, try something else.
        if (argStr == null) {
           // Does the argument's type support rich formatting?
           IFormattable formattable = argObj as IFormattable;
           if (formattable != null) {
              // Yes; pass the format string and provider to
              // the type's IFormattable ToString method.
              argStr = formattable.ToString(argFormat, formatProvider);
           } else {
              // No; get the general format using
              // the thread's culture information.
              if (argObj != null) argStr = argObj.ToString();
              else argStr = String.Empty;
           }
        }
        // Append argStr's characters to the character array field member.
        ...
     }
     return this;
  }
