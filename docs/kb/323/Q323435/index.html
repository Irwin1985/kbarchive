- Microsoft Dungeon Siege, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Dungeon Siege, game performance may be slower than you
expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order that they are
presented.

Method 1: Install the Dungeon Siege Update
------------------------------------------

Install the latest Dungeon Siege Update. For additional information about the
Dungeon Siege Update, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q324477 Dungeon Siege 1.0: Availability of the Dungeon Siege Update and the
  Fixes Included in the Update

Method 2: Add a Parameter to the Desktop Shortcut Properties
------------------------------------------------------------

If you set Bltonly to True, it forces blt mode instead of flip mode, which works
around problems with earlier video cards.

NOTE: If the slow performance does not occur when you try to save or start a
game, skip this method and continue to method 2.

1. On the desktop, right-click the Dungeon Siege shortcut, and then click
  Properties.

2. Click the Shortcut tab.

3. In the Target box, click the end of the line of text, press the SPACEBAR one
  time, type "bltonly=true" (without the quotation marks), click Apply, and
  then click OK.

NOTE: This procedure only affects the performance of Dungeon Siege if you start
it by using the shortcut on the desktop. If you start the game by using a
different shortcut, such as the shortcut on the Start menu, performance is
unaffected by this procedure.

Method 3: Check the Minimum Video, Processor, and RAM Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that your computer exceeds the minimum video, processor, and RAM
requirements that you need to play Dungeon Siege. For additional information
about the minimum system requirements for Dungeon Siege, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q320018 Dungeon Siege: Minimum System Requirements for Version 1.0

Method 4: Quit Unnecessary Programs
-----------------------------------

1. Quit all unnecessary programs by right-clicking each program on the task bar
  and then clicking Close.

2. Quit programs that are running in the background by pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE
  to start the Task Manager.

  Click each program in the list, and then click End Task.

NOTE: Do not quit Dungeon Siege, Explorer, or Systray when performing these
steps.

Method 5: Update Video Card and Sound Card Drivers
--------------------------------------------------

1. Contact your video hardware manufacturer to obtain and install the latest
  version of the driver for your video adapter.

2. Contact your audio hardware manufacturer to obtain and install the latest
  version of the driver for your sound card.

For information about how to contact your video or sound card manufacturer, see
the "References" section of this article.

Method 6: Raise the Dungeon Siege Priority Option
-------------------------------------------------

1. Start Dungeon Siege.

2. On the Main menu, click Options.

3. Click the Game tab.

4. Click the Raise App Priority On/Off button to the On position.

5. Click OK.

This sets Dungeon Siege to highest priority in Windows.

Method 7: Edit Video Settings
-----------------------------

1. Start Dungeon Siege.

2. On the Main menu, click Options, and then click the Video tab.

3. In the Screen Resolution list, click 640x480x16.

4. In the Shadows list, click None.

5. In the Filtering list, click Bilinear Filtering.

6. Click OK.

NOTE: If this method does not improve performance, leave the modified video
settings in place until you have tried methods 7 and 8. If none of the methods
succeeds, you can restore the default settings, or select the settings that you
prefer.

Method 8: Add Parameters to the Desktop Shortcut Properties
-----------------------------------------------------------

Setting Asynccursor to False disables the asynchronous cursor. This increases the
frame rate but slows mouse response time. Setting Vsync to False improves the
video performance.

NOTE: You do not have to delete the parameter that you added in method 1 before
you add these parameters.

1. On the desktop, right-click the Dungeon Siege shortcut, and then click
  Properties.

2. Click the Shortcut tab.

3. In the Target box, click the end of the line of text, press the SPACEBAR one
  time, type "asynccursor=false vsync=false" (without the quotation marks),
  click Apply, and then click OK.

NOTE: This procedure only affects the performance of Dungeon Siege if you start
it by using the shortcut on the desktop. If you start the game by using a
different shortcut, such as the shortcut on the Start menu, performance is
unaffected by this procedure.

Method 9: Install the VIA 4-in-1 Driver
---------------------------------------

If you have a motherboard that is based on the VIA Technologies chip set
installed on your computer, make sure that you have the most recent VIA 4-in-1
driver for your motherboard installed.

NOTE: Contact your hardware manufacturer before you install the latest VIA 4-in-1
driver on your computer or make any modifications to your computer's BIOS
settings.
