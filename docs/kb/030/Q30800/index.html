The following information is from the Microsoft Macro Assembler
Version 5.10 OS2.DOC file.

Calling OS/2 Macros
   You can simplify calls of OS/2 systems services by using the
macros. The OS/2 macros are organized into groups that can be enabled
by including the file OS2.INC and defining constants associated with
each group. For example, to enable file management macros, put the
following lines in the source file where the macros will be used:

INCL_DOSFILEMGR EQU 1
INCLUDE os2.inc

   Note that the constant must be defined before the include file is
specified. The groups of macros and the constants associated with each
are described later in this file.
   Macros have the name of the OS/2 call preceded by an at sign (@).
For example, the macro to call the DosFindNext service is called
@DosFindNext.
   Parameters are passed to macros by listing them on the same line as
the macro name in much the same way as in most high-level languages.
For example, you could use the following lines to call the
@DosFindNext macro:

dHandle   DW      -1            ; Directory handle
dResult   FILEFINDBUF &lt;&gt;        ; Structure for results
dlResult  EQU     $ - dResult   ;   length of result
dCount    DW      1             ; Find one file at a time
          .
          .
          .
          @DosFindNext [dHandle], dResult, dlResult, dCount

   When passing memory locations as arguments, you can specify the
contents of the specified variable by enclosing it in brackets. In the
command line above, the value of the word variable dHandle (-1) is
passed as the first argument.
   To pass the far address of a variable, give the argument without
brackets. The addresses of dResult and dCount are passed in the
command-line above. Note that dResult is defined as a structure of
type FILEFINDBUF. The FILEFINDBUF structure is defined in the include
file.
   You can pass word values in registers or constants by listing them
without brackets. For example, dlResult is a constant in the example.
If the file handle were in register DX instead of in the variable
dHandle, you could substitute the register name. You cannot pass
doubleword constants. For example, to pass a doubleword zero, you must
first store the value in a variable.
   The macros do type checking. An error will be generated if you pass
an argument of an invalid size or if you pass the wrong number of
arguments. All arguments are expected to be word or doubleword values.
Addresses are always far, and are thus passed as doublewords.
   Note that the macros cannot check to see that you are actually
passing an an address when required, since the macro has no way of
knowing whether you are passing the address as a doubleword pointer
variable or as a label specifying an address.
   If you wish to pass a value stored in a byte variable or register,
you must expand this value to a word before passing. For example, use
CBW to expand a byte in AL to a word in AX.
   Most valid operands can be passed as arguments. For example, the
following are valid arguments:

    [es:[di]]              ; Contents of a word indirect memory operand
    &lt;[DWORD PTR es:[di]]&gt;  ; Contents of a doubleword indirect memory operand
    &lt;SIZE var1&gt;            ; A constant
    es:table[bx]           ; Address of an indirect memory operand

   Note that arguments containing spaces or tabs must be enclosed in
angle brackets so that the macro will see them as a single argument.
   The macros assume that DS=SS. If you change either of these
registers temporarily, you should restore the register before passing
arguments. The macros may change the contents of AX or BX, so you
should save any important values in these registers before using an
OS/2 macro.
