SUMMARY
=======

Browse lists often do not consistently contain all computers in a Windows NT
network. This is caused by a variety of factors that range from individual
computer configurations to inadequate name resolution.

This article describes the browsing functions within Network Neighborhood. You
may have computers running Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation that
require constant enumeration in Network Neighborhood. It is possible to obtain
this functionality statically.

NOTE: The remainder of this article assumes that basic network connectivity is
already established throughout the network, especially for the target computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to ensure that computers are consistently listed and
available in Network Neighborhood. This operation requires that the target
computers are running and connected to the network. Because this method of
creating a static Network Neighborhood involves creating .lnk files on your hard
disk, you can populate other computers in the network by simply copying these
files as shortcuts. The .lnk files need to be stored in the
%SystemRoot%\Profiles\%Username%\NetHood folder.

NOTE: The NetHood folder is located in the %SystemRoot% folder in Windows 95 and
Windows 98. This folder is hidden by default in Windows NT.

Performing these steps does not affect the ability of a workstation to work with
or connect to other workstations or servers in the network, and it does not
affect administration of the computers in question.

1. Configure network connectivity. At a minimum, the computer you use to create
  the static Network Neighborhood entry must be able to use NetBIOS name
  resolution with the target computer. This involves the installation and
  configuration of protocols such as NetBEUI, IPX/SPX, and TCP/IP on the
  computer involved in nonrouted environments. Proper name resolution is needed
  in routed environments. This scenario includes Windows Internet Name Service
  (WINS), Domain Name System, and the Lmhosts files.

2. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Computer.

3. In the Named box, type "ComputerName" (without the quotation marks) (where
  ComputerName refers to the name of the computer you are statically adding to
  Network Neighborhood), and then click Find Now.

4. After the computer is found, drag the computer icon into Network
  Neighborhood. Click Yes, when you are prompted to create a shortcut.

5. After you put the icon into Network Neighborhood, you can rename it. To
  populate many computers on the LAN/WAN, the .lnk files created during this
  process can be copied to the NetHood folder of any user profile. After you
  log off and then log back on, the static entries in Network Neighborhood are
  permanently listed.
