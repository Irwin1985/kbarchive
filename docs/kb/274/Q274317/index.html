-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine if Microsoft Windows NT accounts are
attempting to open mailboxes in Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view this information, follow these steps:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

2. In the console tree, double-click Servers, right-click the server object, and
  then click Properties.

3. Click the Diagnostic Logging tab, and then in Services, click MSExchangeIS -
  Private.

4. In Categories, click "Logons and Access Control", and then set the logging
  level to Maximum.

5. Click OK to apply the settings. You do not have to restart any of the
  services for event messages to be logged.

Once the logging level is set, view the application event log in Event Viewer.
Four different events messages report information about Windows NT accounts that
are accessing mailboxes:

- An event 1009 message indicates that a Windows NT account has logged into a
  particular Exchange Server mailbox:

  Event ID: 1009
  Event Type: Success Audit
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Event Category: Logons
  Description: DOMAIN\User1 logged on as /o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=Recipients/cn=User1.

- An event 1013 message indicates that an account has opened its primary
  mailbox, and that it has opened an additional mailbox. This message does not
  report if the account has opened any folders or messages. To find this
  information, you can check mail client permissions on folders in the client
  program by getting the properties of folders in the client and checking the
  Permissions tab. You can also check the Permissions tab on the properties of
  the mailbox object in the Exchange Administrator program to see if any
  additional accounts have been given direct or inherited permission to the
  mailbox:

  Event ID: 1013
  Event Type: Success Audit
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Event Category: Logons
  Description: DOMAIN\User1 was validated as
  /o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=Recipients/cn=User1 and logged on to
  /o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=Recipients/cn=User2.

- An event 1016 message indicates that a Windows NT account accessed an
  Exchange mailbox, but that it is not the primary account for that mailbox.
  This event message is logged regardless of the diagnostic logging level:

  Event ID: 1016
  Event Type: Success Audit
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Event Category: Logons
  Description: NT User DOMAIN\User1 logged on to User2 mailbox, and is not the
  primary Windows NT account on this mailbox.

- An event 1029 message indicates that a particular mailbox was unable to gain
  access to a folder after it logged into another mailbox. To determine why
  this mailbox was denied access, use the Exchange Administrator program to
  determine which permissions have been set in the administrator and the client
  computer:

  Event ID: 1029
  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Event Category: Access Control
  Description: /O=ORG/OU=SITE/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=USER1 failed an operation because
  the user did not have the following access rights:

  'Create Subfolder'

  The distinguished name of the owning mailbox is
  /O=ORG/OU=SITE/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=USER2. The folder ID is in the data section
  of this event.

For the preceding event messages, User1 is accessing User2's mailbox. User1's
Exchange mailbox is using DOMAIN\User1 as the primary Windows NT account.
User2's mailbox is using DOMAIN\User2 as the primary Windows NT account.
