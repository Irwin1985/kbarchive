-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you modify the Mapnotes.tbl file to send attributes from Exchange Server to
the Lotus Notes Server field, and that field is not present in the Notes
database, the addresses in the Notes address book may be deleted if you request
a full reload. The following error messages may be logged in the connectivity
logs:

  LME-NOTES-DXA(01b1) 1 64099:Error {Not found} detected when Writing Note and
  LMD &gt;&gt; dxanotes(764)

  LME-NOTES-DXA(01b1) 2 64073:Error {Not found}: While processing Transaction
  8943 &gt;&gt; dxanotes(463)

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur during directory synchronization (dirsync) from Exchange
Server to Notes if a new field that did not previously exist in Notes appears in
the mapping rules; in that case, the Notes entry is not updated at all. Because
a full reload from Exchange Server to Notes forces the data to replicate to
Notes, Notes determines that the entries that are not updated or created have
disappeared from the address book, and deletes those entries.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure that the mapping rules are correct before
you change the production .tbl files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
