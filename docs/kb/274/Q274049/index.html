SYMPTOMS
========

When you use one of the Encarta programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may be unable to use the Text-to-Speech or the Voice Control
feature in Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia or record sounds properly in the
Microsoft Encarta Language Learning programs.

In addition, you may receive error messages stating that your sound card is not
configured properly.

NOTE: The sound recording function in Microsoft Windows may still work properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if more than one sound card is installed in your
computer.

The recording software that is installed with Encarta Encyclopedia and the
Encarta Language Learning programs is associated with a particular sound device.
If more than one sound device is installed in the computer, the Encarta program
may not be associated with the sound device that is associated with sound
recording and playback in Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, temporarily disable the sound device that the Encarta
program is associated with, and then uninstall and reinstall the Encarta
program.

To do this, use the following methods in the order in which they are presented.

Temporarily Disable the Conflicting Sound Device
------------------------------------------------

To temporarily disable the conflicting sound device:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia or "Sound and Multimedia".

  device" box in the Recording or Sound Recording section.

4. Click the Devices or the Advanced tab. If you are using Microsoft Windows
  2000, click the Hardware tab.

5. Locate the sound device that is associated with the Encarta program. To do
  this, use the appropriate method for your operating system.

  Double-click the sound device that is not listed in the "Preferred device" box
  on the Audio tab.

6. Disable the sound device that you identified in step 5. To do this, use the
  appropriate method for your operating system.

  Click "Do not use audio features on this device", and click OK.

  Windows Millennium Edition:

  Click "Do not use audio features on this device", and click OK.
