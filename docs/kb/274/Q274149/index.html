SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Active Server Pages (ASP) in Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0
or Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, a session cookie is sent to a user's
browser. This cookie identifies the user for the time that they are on the site.
These cookies are sometimes called memory cookies, because they are never stored
on the user's hard drive like a regular cookie. In reality, this is an
additional header that is sent to the browser. Anytime a Web site sends
additional information such as this, the browser is required to send it back
with each request (provided the server name does not change). The following is
an example of an ASP Session Cookie:

  Set-Cookie: ASPSESSIONIDGQQGGLIC=HKEDPNNBNBBKMOCFFBEIJENM; path=/

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that every time a user connects to a
Web site it is just like the first time they connected to the Web server. This
is a problem in an environment where you store server-side information for
users. The session cookie is a means of performing such tasks.

A problem can occur if developers decide to store confidential or sensitive
information in the session. For example, if a developer writes a piece of ASP
code that requests a user's credit card number, the developer can store this
information in a session variable (session variables are linked to the session
cookie) on the server. The user can then browse to a page that lists the
information they entered (for example, an authorization page or an order
confirmation page). The credit card (when the list is generated) may be pulled
from a session variable. If so, this information may be at risk.

If a malicious user performs a network trace or something similar, they could
possibly obtain the session cookie from the user's browser when it is sent back
to the server. If the malicious user makes a request to the server and presents
that cookie (or actually replays the request), they could effectively see that
users information stored in the session variables. The malicious user only needs
to know the page that generated the output (for example, the order confirmation
page).

Microsoft recommends that developers use SSL to encrypt sensitive information in
order to hide the session cookie. In most cases, this will work fine; however,
if the user goes from an HTTPS (secured) connection, and then back to HTTP
(non-secured), the cookie is readable. This presents a problem, because the
session cookie issued by a secured and non-secured request is the same.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft has determined this to be a problem in IIS 4.0 and 5.0. The cookie
specification in RFC 2109 states that a cookie may be marked as Secure. IIS does
not differentiate between secure and non-secure cookies.

RESOLUTION
==========

For IIS 5.0 (Windows 2000):

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Q274149_W2K_SP2_x86_en.exe now
  (http://www.microsoft.com/Windows2000/downloads/critical/q274149/default.asp)

NOTE: After you apply the patch, run the following commands to enable secure
cookies (this example enables them for site 1):

  "cd %windir%\system32\inetsrv\adminsamples" (without the quotation marks)
  "adsutil set w3svc/1/AspKeepSessionIDSecure 1" (without the quotation marks)

For IIS 4.0 (Windows NT Server 4.0):

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that you determine are at risk of attack. Evaluate your computer's
physical accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other factors to
determine the degree of risk to your computer. See the associated Microsoft
Security Bulletin () to help determine the degree of risk. This fix may receive
additional testing. If your computer is sufficiently at risk, Microsoft
recommends that you apply this fix now.

To resolve this problem immediately, download the fix by clicking the download
link later in this article or contact Microsoft Product Support Services to
obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone
numbers and information about support costs, please visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.
