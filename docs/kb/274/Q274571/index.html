SYMPTOMS
========

When you use one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, you
may experience any of the following symptoms:

- Fonts may not be displayed in the program.

- Fonts may be displayed as symbols in the program.

- Fonts may be distorted in the program.

CAUSE
=====

These behaviors can occur if any of the following conditions is true:

- Too many fonts are installed on the computer.

- One or more fonts are damaged.

- A font that is included with Microsoft Windows has been replaced by an
  incompatible version of the font.

- The video driver that is installed on the computer is not working correctly.

- The program is using the Monotype Sorts font instead of the default font for
  the program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve these issues, use the following methods, in the order in which they
are presented.

After you perform each method, test to see if the issue is resolved. If the issue
continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce the Number of Fonts in the Fonts Folder to 700 or Fewer
--------------------------------------------------------------

To reduce the number of fonts in the Fonts folder:

1. Quit any programs that are running on your computer.

2. Create a new folder on the Microsoft Windows desktop.

  To create a new folder, right-click a blank area on the Windows desktop, click
  New, click Folder, type the name that you want, and then press ENTER.

3. Double-click the new folder to open it.

4. Click Start, click Run, type "fonts" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

5. Right-click a blank area of the taskbar, and then click Tile Windows
  Horizontally.

  NOTE: The Fonts folder window and the window for the folder that you created
  in step 2 should equally divide your screen.

6. Right-click and drag any font that is 3 kilobytes (KB) or less in size from
  the Fonts folder to the folder that you created in step 2 of this procedure,
  and then click "Move here".

To select multiple fonts, use one of the following methods:

   - To select consecutive font files, click the first item, press and hold
     down SHIFT, and then click the last item.

   - To select font files that are not consecutive, press and hold down CTRL,
     and then click each item.

7. Test to see if the issue is resolved. If the issue continues to occur, repeat
  step 6, except drag the following fonts from the Fonts folder to the folder
  that you created in step 2:

   - Monotype Sorts
   - Monotype Sorts 2

8. Test to see if the issue is resolved. If the issue still occurs, continue to
  the next step.

9. Note the number of fonts that is displayed in the lower-left corner of the
  Fonts folder window.

  If the Fonts folder contains more than 700 fonts, repeat step 6 to drag
  additional fonts from the Fonts folder until you reduce the number of fonts
  in the Fonts folder to 700 or fewer.

NOTE: Before you drag additional fonts from the Fonts folder, attempt to
determine which fonts your Microsoft multimedia program uses so that you do not
move those fonts. To do this:

  a. Insert the installation CD-ROM for the program into the CD-ROM drive while
     holding down the SHIFT key to prevent the program from starting
     automatically.

  b. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

  c. In the Named box, type "*.ttf" (without the quotation marks).

  d. In the "Look in" box, click your CD-ROM drive, and then click Find Now.

10. Test to see if the issue is resolved. If the issue still occurs, repeat step
  6, except drag the fonts that the Microsoft multimedia program uses, and
  then uninstall and reinstall the program.

Reduce Graphics Hardware Acceleration in Windows
------------------------------------------------

To reduce graphics hardware acceleration in Windows:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
  None (the Basic acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

If this resolves the issue, contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to
inquire about how to obtain and install the latest video driver for your video
adapter.

appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

To identify the manufacturer and model of your video adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. In Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98, click the Device Manager
  tab.

  In Microsoft Windows 2000, click the Hardware tab, and then click Device
  Manager.

4. Click the plus sign (+) next to "Display adapters" to expand the branch.

5. Under the "Display adapters" branch, note the manufacturer and model of your
  video adapter, and then click OK.

6. Close all open windows.

How To Determine Which Fonts Are Used by a Microsoft Multimedia Program
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To attempt to determine which fonts are used by a Microsoft multimedia program:

1. Insert the installation CD-ROM for the program into the CD-ROM drive while
  holding down the SHIFT key to prevent the program from starting
  automatically.

2. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

3. In the Named box, type "*.ttf" (without the quotation marks).

4. In the "Look in" box, click the letter that represents your CD-ROM drive, and
  then click Find Now.

If you do not find any fonts, any of the following items may be true:

   - The program does not install any special fonts. The program uses Windows
     fonts.

   - The fonts for that program are contained in a compressed file.

   - The fonts are located on a different CD-ROM for the program.
