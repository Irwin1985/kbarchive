-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server services may not start after a service account password change.
The following message may be logged in the System event log:

  Event ID: 7013
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Logon attempt with current password failed with the following error:
  Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.

The following message may be logged several times:

  Event ID: 7001
  Source: Service Control Manager
  (Specific Exchange Service)
  The service did not start due to a logon failure.
  or
  The dependency service or group failed to start.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Exchange Server services cannot start if the
password for the Exchange Server service account has been changed in the User
Manager for Domains utility but not in the Exchange Server Administrator
program.

RESOLUTION
==========

On the Exchange Server computer:

1. Update the password for the Exchange Server System Attendant and Directory
  services:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then locate the System
     Attendant service and the Directory service.

  b. Click Startup for each of these two services, and then update the password
     to match the updated password in the User Manager for Domains utility.

  c. Start these two services.

2. Change the Exchange Server service account password in the Exchange Server
  Administrator program:

  a. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Configuration
     container.

  b. On the File menu, click Properties. The Properties dialog box for the
     Configuration container is displayed.

  c. Click the Service Account Password tab. The Service Account Password
     Change dialog box is displayed.

  d. In the Password box, type the new password, and then retype the password
     in the Confirm Password box.

  e. Click OK. The following message is displayed:

  Initializing Service Account Password Change.

     This message displays the changes that are occurring for all of the servers
     in the site.

  f. Stop and restart the Exchange Server services on all of the servers in
     your site to complete the change to the Exchange Server service account
     password for the Exchange Server site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue typically occurs when you use the domain Administrator account as the
Exchange Server service account. If you use the Administrator account to install
Exchange Server, the Administrator account becomes the Exchange Server service
account. Microsoft recommends that you create an account other than the
Administrator account and use that account as the Exchange Server service
account.

Server service account password, click the article number below to view the
