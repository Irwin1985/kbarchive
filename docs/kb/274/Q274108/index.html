-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 has the ability to establish Novell NDS
volume objects as logon points to an SMS site. It may occasionally be necessary
to troubleshoot failures in the creation process of that logon point.

You can enable logging for the SMS_NDS_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER, which will produce
an nd_logon.log file in the sms\logs directory on your site server. Review of
this log will provide you with valuable information concerning the cause of any
failures.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two pieces of information that SMS requires to successfully connect to
the Novell resource:

- The security, as established in the Admin console, of a SITE SYSTEM
  connection account.

- The proper path to the volume object where the SMSLOGON folder will be
  created.

Troubleshooting Security
------------------------

1. Log on to the Site server as the account that was set as the Site System
  connection account for NDS.

  This will tell you whether the account can successfully authenticate to the
  NDS tree.

2. Then try to connect to the volume where the SMSLOGON folder will be created.
  Manually create a directory and then delete it.

  This process will tell you whether the connection account has the correct
  credentials to create the logon point.

Troubleshooting the Path
------------------------

By referencing the nd_logon.log, verify that the path selected was typed
correctly. The correct path should be as follows:

  \\NDS_TREE_Name\.volume_object.OU.O

NOTE:

- Depending on the Novell tree hierarchy, there may be more OUs (containers) in
  the path. The spelling of the tree name and all the objects in that path is
  of great importance.

- The volume object needs to be the object as it appears in NWADMIN (Novell's
  administrative utility), not just the name of the volume, such as "Apps" or
  "Vol1." The volume object consists of the file server upon which the volume
  is installed. For example, if a file server is called "FS1" and the volume is
  "Vol1," the volume object would be "FS1_vol1." This object should be found in
  the container in which the file server resides.
