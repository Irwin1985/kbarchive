-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Systems Management Server (SMS) version 1.2 hotfix for
Microsoft Office 2000 distribution on computers that are running Microsoft
Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition, or
Microsoft Windows Mellinnium Edition (Me), packages that spawn child processes
do not finish and you may receive the following error message:

  Unable to open self-extracting EXE


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the SMS package, or program, that is called by Pcmuncw9
requires another process to be spawned and closes the parent process handle.
Package Command Manager (PCM) then interperets that the program is finished
which causes PCM to close the mapped drive for the program; however, the program
is not finished.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next SMS service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date       Time      Version         Size     File name     Platform
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  4/10/2001  5:39:46  1.2(Build 786)  16,256b  Pcmuncw9.exe  Intel

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

1. Revert to the previous version of Pcmwin16.exe because the original Service
  Pack 4 (SP4) version of Pcmwin16.exe did not call Pcmuncw9.exe, which causes
  the Office environment variable to not be set.

  -or-

2. After you apply the hotfix, use a batch file that calls %pcmunc%\%1 %2 %3 %4
  and so on, and then modify all of your package commands to call this batch
  file with each designated program and the program's arguments. This procedure
  does work but you may need to modify hundreds of package command which may be
  unreasonable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install this hotfix across your organization, replace the existing version of
the Pcmuncw9.exe file on the SMS site server, and then open and save the
System.map file in the SMS folder. The Pcmuncw9.exe file is in the following
folder:

  Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin
