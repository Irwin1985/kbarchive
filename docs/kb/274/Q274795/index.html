-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Site System status in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console at a central site, the summary dates and times for child
sites may not be synchronized with the actual values at the child sites
themselves. This becomes more noticeable in large SMS hierarchies in which you
can see that some sites' summary dates and times remain up-to-date, while others
remain out of synchronization by hours or days.

If, for example, a site hierarchy consists of three tiers (a central site, a
primary child site, and numerous third-tier secondary sites), the Site System
status summary dates and times for the child sites, when you view them on the
central site console, may not be synchronized. When you view the same summary
dates and times on the primary child site, all the summary times for that site
and its child sites are current.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is known to occur in site hierarchies with three or more tiers. A
primary site with a number of subordinate sites can potentially delete site
summaries that it has processed and has submitted to SMS Replication Manager for
replication to its own parent site. The parent site may therefore receive only a
fraction of the site summaries for its subordinate sites.

One factor that influences this behavior is the time of the incoming site
summaries at the first primary site to receive child site summaries. If the
summaries arrive and are processed by SMS_SITE_SYSTEM_STATUS_SUMMARIZER within a
short time frame, they can be placed in the same replication batch to that
site's parent. Only the newest site summary in that replication batch is sent to
the parent site, which gives the appearance at the parent site that some sites
may be offline.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date       Version          Size        File name     Platform
  --------------------------------------------------------------
   6/10/00   2.00.1493.2154   1,571,744   Basesvr.dll   Intel
  11/10/99   2.00.1250.0007     762,688   Preinst.exe   Intel
   6/10/00   2.00.1493.2154   2,409,744   Basesvr.dll   Alpha



Installing the Hotfix
---------------------

Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: This method is for Intel-based computers only.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha folders are required; it is
  important to keep the folder structure intact. The Q274795.exe file is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run Q274795.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard. You can run this
  file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

5. The SMS services are stopped as part of the installation process. The
  services are automatically be restarted when the hotfix installation is
  complete.

Manual Installation:

NOTE: You can use this method for both Intel-based and Alpha-based site servers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha folders are required and must
  also be downloaded from Microsoft site. It is important to keep the folder
  structure intact. Q274795.exe is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that
  updates specific files on your site server and can only be run on Intel-based
  computers. Refer to the first installation method in this article for
  information about how to use Q274795.exe.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services in Control
  Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. Copy the Basesvr.dll file from the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder into the
  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Sms\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder.

4. Restart the SMS services.
