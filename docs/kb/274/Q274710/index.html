SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the how to use the ExClean utility to remove attachments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may want to remove all instances of a message attachment from an Exchange
Server 5.5 computer. For example, if there has been an outbreak of a new e-mail
virus strain, but the antivirus vendors have not updated their signature files,
if you are an administrator, you may need to remove an infected attachment
completely before you restart Exchange Server. In another scenario, you may want
to remove a classified attachment from servers to prevent further transmission
and exposure.

You can use the ExClean utility to remove attachments from the attachment table
and quarantine transitory messages that have text that matches the attachment
name. ExClean is not a replacement for commercial antivirus software.

ExClean uses the ISScan utility to remove attachments from the attachment table
according to the names and attachment sizes that you specify in the graphical
user interface (GUI). ExClean also scans the Imcdata and Mtadata folders for
data files that contain the attachment name that you specified. These files are
moved to the ExClean subfolder of their respective data folders. As an
administrator, you can examine the files in the subfolders to determine if those
data files are infected with a virus, or if the files only have the attachment
name in their contents.

NOTE: Before you use ExClean, update Exchange Server 5.5 to Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 4 (SP4), and install the latest version of ISScan. For more
information about ISScan, please contact the Microsoft Product Support Services
(PSS) at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/webresponse.asp
  (http://support.microsoft.com/support/webresponse.asp)

To use ExClean to remove an attachment:

1. Double-click the ExClean icon, and then run the utility from the command
  prompt. Run the program from a local drive (for example,
  C:\&lt;Dir&gt;\Exclean), and not with a UNC name
  (&lt;\\servername\sharepoint&gt;\exclean).

  NOTE: You receive an error message if ExClean does not find Exchange Server on
  the local computer.

2. Read the introduction and click Next.

3. Enter the databases that you want to scan, and then click Next.

  NOTE: If a database is unavailable, a message is displayed in the Remarks box.

4. Type the attachment name and a size range, and then click Next.

  The size range is only used when the information store is scanned, and not
  during the MTA and IMS scan.

5. Click Finish. If the Finish button is unavailable, the Remarks section
  contains an explanation. Use the Back button to correct any errors.

ExClean verifies ISScan and store version compatibility, stops the Exchange
Server services (if necessary), calls ISScan with parameters that are specified
in the GUI, and then scans the Imcdata and Mtadata files for a match with the
attachment name. If matches are found in the Imcdata or Mtadata folders, the
utility creates subfolders and moves the suspicious files. ExClean does not
restart any services. After ExClean is finished, a dialog box is displayed that
reports either a success or error message. After you finish ExClean, restart the
information store service.

ExClean is available from Microsoft PSS.
