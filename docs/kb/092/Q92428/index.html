SUMMARY
=======

Attachmate Corporation's Extra! for Windows requires a Data Link Control (DLC)
driver to work with Windows for Workgroups. This driver supplies the DLC
protocol and allows 3270 emulators to communicate with host systems.

The Microsoft DLC driver, MSDLC.EXE, is included with Microsoft LAN Manager
version 2.1a or later and can be installed with the additional information
provided in the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. MSDLC.EXE is supported by
the Microsoft LAN Manager support group.

The MSDLC protocol for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 is available from the
Internet. The downloadable file is named WFWDLC.EXE. NOTE: The file WFWDLC.EXE
is intended for use with Windows For Workgroups version 3.11 only and is not
guaranteed to work with any other version of Workgroups.
