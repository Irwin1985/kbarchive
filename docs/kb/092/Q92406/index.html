-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information describes the Intel EtherExpress 16 Network card
specifications. For more information about this Network card, contact Intel
Corporation.

PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
-----------------------

The Intel EtherExpress 16 is a half-slot board. It is short enough to allow an
adjacent board to use a piggyback card that is also half length. The board is
4.2 inches tall and 6.5 inches long.

CONNECTORS
----------

The board has two external connectors:

DIX:    A 15-pin, D-shaped connector for AUI interfaced to thick
       Ethernet cables

BNC:    A cylindrical, bayonet connector for interfacing to thin Ethernet
       or Cheapernet cables

FCC COMPLIANCE
--------------

The board is an FCC Class B device, making it suitable for use in both commercial
and residential applications.

ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIFICATIONS
----------------------------

The board can operate under the following environmental conditions:

  Operating Temperature:  0 to 50 degrees centigrade
  Operating Humidity:     10 to 90 percent, non-condensing

MEMORY ON BOARD
---------------

The board has 32K bytes of RAM on it. While this memory is used to buffer the
communications between the board and the network (whether you select
memory-mapped or I/O-mapped buffering), Intel recommends using I/O-mapped
buffering.

ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS
-------------------------

Bus Characteristics
-------------------

The board works in 8- or 16-bit Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) busses. This
is the same bus that is used on IBM PCs (8 bit) and IBM PC/ATs (8-bit or
16-bit). The board also works in EISA computers (because EISA computers are
designed to accept both ISA and EISA boards).

Slot Characteristics
--------------------

Use a 16-bit slot whenever possible because it provides faster transfer of data
between the computer and the network. If a 16-bit slot is not available, an
8-bit slot works, but at lower performance.

WORST-CASE POWER CONSUMPTION
----------------------------

Power consumption depends upon the kind of connector being used. The table below
shows worst-case power consumption.

  Connector                    Worst-Case Consumption in mA
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  BNC                          610 @ +5V
                               215 @ +12V
  DIX                          610 @ +5V
                               *variable @ +12V

* When the DIX connector is used, the board does not consume any power
 at +12V. It simply passes it through to power any external
 transceiver connected to the AUI cable. To provide you with a means
 of estimating the amount of power likely to be consumed, the following
 table shows the power consumption for external transceivers made by
 three different manufacturers:

  Manufacturer         Model                   Power Consumed
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  Intel                External                150 mA
  Synoptics            508 10BASE-T            420 mA
  HP                   ThinMAU 28641A          270 mA

CABLE SPECIFICATIONS
--------------------

Each connector requires a different kind of cable. Here are the specifications
for the cable required for each kind of connector.

Cable for DIX Connectors
------------------------

DIX connectors use the standard transceiver cable or AUI cable conforming to the
10BASE-5 specification. An example suitable cable is Belden 9898. The maximum
distance between the computer and the transceiver on the thick Ethernet cable is
50 meters.

Cable for BNC Connectors
------------------------

BNC connectors require RG-58 coaxial cable conforming to the 10BASE-2
specification. This is sometimes called thin Ethernet or Cheapernet cable. The
layout of the network must conform to the following specifications:

- Maximum trunk length with repeaters in the network: 300 meters

- Maximum trunk length without repeaters in the network: 185 meters

- Minimum distance between nodes: 1 meter

Configuring the Intel ExtherExpress 16 and 16TP Network Adapters for ISA
Computers." The installation guide is available from Intel Corporation.
