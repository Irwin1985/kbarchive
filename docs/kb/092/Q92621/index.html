The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows Sound System, if a vocabulary file or user file is missing or
corrupted you may receive the following error message:

  There are one or more user (*.usr) or voice (*.vcb) data files in the
  VOICEPIL.INI that cannot be found. The Voice Pilot will resort to using the
  default file as a substitute.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you start Voice Pilot and the above error message is displayed, a vocabulary
file (.VCB) or a user file (.USR) has been deleted or is missing from the
Windows Sound System directory and no modification has been made to the
VOICEPIL.INI file.

To correct the error message, use the following steps:

1. Look at the Windows Sound System directory and note the user .USR and .VCB
  data files that are listed.

2. Edit the VOICEPIL.INI file in the WINDOWS directory.

3. Delete any lines under the [USER] and [APPS] section headings that did not
  appear in the directory listings for .VCB and .USR.

4. Save the VOICEPIL.INI file, then run Voice Pilot again.

You will also get the above error message if a user or vocabulary file is
corrupted.

If a &lt;.VCB&gt; file is corrupted and you get the above error message you can
continue using Voice Pilot. Voice Pilot will use the DEFAULT vocabulary file
instead of the corrupted one.

One way to determine which &lt;.VCB&gt; file is corrupted is when you run Voice
Pilot and the vocabulary that comes up for the application in use is the default
vocabulary and not your modified or custom made version for that application.
Voice Pilot will use the DEFAULT vocabulary for any Windows application that
does not have a custom made vocabulary. There is no way to fix a corrupted
vocabulary file.

If a &lt;*.USR&gt; file is corrupted you will also get the above error message
when you run Voice Pilot. You can continue using Voice Pilot since it will
simply ignore the corrupted &lt;*.USR&gt; file. The corrupted user file will
still show up as a user in the user list. One way to test for a corrupted user
file is to try to set it as the active user, if it is corrupted Voice Pilot will
show the following error message:

  Corrupt voicepil.ini file. Voice Pilot cannot make requested user name
  active. Please reinstall the Voice Pilot.

To correct the problem you need to remove the corrupted user file either by
removing the user entry from VOICEPIL.INI or deleting the user from the user
list in Voice Pilot. There is no way to fix a corrupted user file, you will lose
all the training for that user. If you have a back up file for that user simply
replace it to keep the user listed under Voice Pilot.
