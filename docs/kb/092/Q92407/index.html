SUMMARY
=======

Because enhanced mode Windows provides an extended MS-DOS environment, at times
it may invoke system code running in real mode or even V86 mode. This article
describes the process that Windows employs to pass protected mode data to
V86-mode addressable areas, and discusses some potential problems arising from
this scheme.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Data that resides outside of the V86-addressable area must be copied into the
affected VMs virtual 1 megabyte (MB) space to be accessible by code running in
V86 mode. Enhanced mode Windows (to be more precise, the V86 memory manager
virtual device driver) provides two possibilities to do this: local API
translation buffers (accessible via the V86MMGR_Allocate_Buffer and
V86MMGR_Free_Buffer services) and global API translation buffers. This article
focuses on the global API translation buffers.

At initialization time, virtual device drivers (VxDs) may ask enhanced mode
Windows to set up a global API translation buffer (APITB) via the
V86MMGR_Set_Mapping_Info service call, passing in a required (minimum) and a
desired (maximum) buffer size. As a result, Windows allocates one global APITB
in the corresponding address locations of all virtual machines (VMs) according
to the following algorithm:

The APITB is always aligned on 4K boundaries and is a multiple of 4K. It is never
smaller than the largest minimum size requested by all VxDs and never larger
than the largest maximum size requested. Unless the user sets
"ReservePageFrame=yes" in SYSTEM.INI, Windows attempts to allocate the APITB in
the 384K adapter segment; if necessary, Windows will shrink it to the minimum
size. If there is no space in the 384K adapter segment, the APITB will be
allocated in conventional memory.

Thus, in a sense, the term "global" has two meanings: It means that the buffer is
visible to all virtual machines and that the buffer is being shared by all VxDs.
Although any VxD can request participation in the APITB, participation should be
restricted to VxDs that need to provide access to it asynchronously. The
swap-file virtual device, as well as most network protocol virtual devices (such
as the virtual NetBIOS device), utilize the APITB. Because (asynchronous)
hardware interrupts from the hard disk as well as the network can be reflected
into any VM, the translation buffer accessed by these virtual devices must be
global to all VMs.

In the case of the virtual NetBIOS device, the NetHeapSize= parameter in
SYSTEM.INI is used to determine the APITB size that the virtual NetBIOS device
requests from Windows.

Note that the APITB is nothing more than a reserved area in the corresponding
memory locations of all virtual machines. A virtual device driver claims parts
of the buffer by submitting a V86MMGR_Map_Pages call and releases it by calling
the V86MMGR_Free_Map_Page_Region service. When portions of the APITB are being
claimed, Windows flags these portions as unusable for other VxDs and maps
physical pages into those portions. Any request for buffer usage will be 4K
aligned; that is, the memory manager will always claim multiples of 4K from the
APITB, regardless of the actual size of the request.

This poses a potential problem with virtual device drivers that claim portions of
the APITB for unpredictable amounts of time. For example, the virtual NetBIOS
device claims a portion of the APITB when an asynchronous NetBIOS request is
being submitted from a protected mode VM and releases it when the callback
routine associated with the NetBIOS request is invoked. Under heavy
network-traffic conditions, one NetBIOS request may cause a new portion of the
APITB to be allocated while another request is pending; this process may cause
the APITB to become fragmented, thus failing bigger NetBIOS calls although the
overall number of pages available in the APITB may be enough to satisfy the
request (the V86MMGR always looks for a contiguous number of pages to satisfy a
buffer claim request and does not compact memory within the APITB). That
scenario may cause the following problem to appear:

Although the NetHeapSize parameter in SYSTEM.INI is sufficiently large, a full
screen message with the following contents pops up:

  This application requires a larger buffer for transferring information over
  the network. You can increase the buffer size by modifying the NetHeapSize
  setting in your SYSTEM.INI file. Include or modify the following setting in
  the [386Enh] section in your SYSTEM.INI file: NetHeapSize=&lt;suggested new
  value&gt;

  If the NetHeapSize value is still too low, this message will appear again,
  suggesting a new value.

In pathologic cases, this may happen repeatedly, even if the NetHeapSize
parameter is set to a value significantly higher than the maximum size needed.

To resolve this problem, you should either limit all NetBIOS requests to NCBs
smaller than 4K so that fragmentation does not become an issue, or make sure
that all pending NetBIOS requests have completed before submitting a larger
NetBIOS request.

The NetAsynchFallback= entry in SYSTEM.INI allows applications to bypass the
global APITB and work on a local APITB. This forces calls originating in real
mode to be synchronous, but if the call orginates in protected mode,
NetAsynchFallback has no effect; it does not transform the call to synchronous.
There is no method for forcing everything to be synchronous.

The NoWaitNetIO option in the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI can be set to
translate everything from synchronous to asynchronous. If this option is set to
"=OFF", which is the default, requests will not be translated. If it is set to
"=ON", all synchronous requests will be translated to asynchronous requests.
