The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows version 3.1 works correctly with versions 5.1 and later of the QEMM386
memory manager. This article discusses the following issues:

- Behavior of Windows Setup

- Using the Stealth Option with Third-Party Display Drivers

- Optimize Utility Loads SMARTDRV.EXE 4.0 High

- Data Loss with SMARTDrive

- Windows May Use B000-B7FF

- Setup Err Msg: Incorrect MS-DOS Version

Behavior of Windows Setup
-------------------------

Windows Setup should detect QEMM386 if it is running when you install Windows. If
you are running QEMM386 version 5.1, 5.11, or 5.12, Setup adds the following
line to the [386enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

       device=*qemmfix

This line causes Windows to load the QEMMFIX virtual device driver when starting
in 386 enhanced mode. This device, developed jointly by Quarterdeck Office
Systems and Microsoft, modifies the behavior of these versions of QEMM386 to
make them compatible with Windows 3.1. The device driver is built into
WIN386.EXE and is not visible as a separate file on your disk.

Note: QEMM386 versions 5.13 and later do not require the QEMMFIX device driver.

Using the Stealth Option with Third-Party Display Drivers
---------------------------------------------------------

A few third-party Windows display drivers may have conflicts with the Stealth
option in QEMM386 version 6. These conflicts can create video problems or
prevent you from starting Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

In most cases, such conflicts can be resolved by configuring QEMM386 to NOT
overlay the video ROM with high RAM. To do this, add "X=C000-C7FF" to the
QEMM386 command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. Depending on your configuration,
you may be able to exclude a smaller range of memory and leave more memory
available. In some cases, you may need to use "XST=C000" or disable the Stealth
option altogether. Consult your QEMM386 documentation for more information.

Optimize Utility Loads SMARTDRV.EXE 4.0 High
--------------------------------------------

If you load SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0 with the /DOUBLE_BUFFER option, earlier
versions of the Quarterdeck Optimize utility may recommend loading SMARTDRV.EXE
in an upper memory block (UMB). SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER does not function
correctly if it is loaded high. Make sure the SMARTDRV.EXE line in CONFIG.SYS
does not include the LOADHI.SYS command.

Data Loss with SMARTDrive
-------------------------

If SMARTDrive is NOT flushing its buffers on exit, you are probably using a
version of QEMM prior to 6.02. Earlier versions of QEMM trap the INT 2Fh call.
If INT 2Fh is trapped, SMARTDrive does not receive the system shutdown broadcast
message and does not flush its buffers when you quit Windows or press
CTRL+ALT+DEL. In addition, SMARTDrive does not switch its cache size back to the
MS-DOS mode value.

Windows May Use B000-B7FF
-------------------------

By default, Windows 3.1 uses UMA addresses B000-B7FF. Many expanded memory
managers also attempt to use this area, which causes a conflict with Windows. To
correct this problem, do one of the following:

- Exclude the B000-B7FF range with the memory manager.

  -or-

- Install MONOUMB2.386 with the following steps:

  1. Copy and expand the MONOUMB2.38_ file that is on your Windows disk to your
     Windows SYSTEM directory. For example, type the following at the MS-DOS
     command prompt:

  expand a:\monoumb2.38_ c:\windows\system\MONOUMB2.386

     where "\windows\system" is the name of your Windows SYSTEM directory.

  2. Add the following setting to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

  device=monoumb2.386

Setup Err Msg: Incorrect MS-DOS Version
---------------------------------------

Windows Setup may display the following error message:

  Incorrect MS-DOS Version - You Must Have Version 3.1 or Later

If you use QEMM386 version 5.x or 6.x to load MS-DOS resource files in the upper
memory area (UMA), the Windows 3.1 Setup program may fail. This error is likely
to occur during a network installation because more file handles are being used
by the system on startup.

To correct this problem, try increasing the FILES= statement in the CONFIG.SYS
file. Quarterdeck recommends increasing the number of files in increments of
five until the error is corrected.
