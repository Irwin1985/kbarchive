SUMMARY
=======

The Thomas Conrad TC5043 series of network adapters are built to be 100- percent
compatible with the Novell NE1000 and NE2000 network interface cards.

The NDIS driver provided with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) does not function
properly with revision A of this board when operating in NE2000 compatibility
mode. Thomas Conrad now has ROM upgrade that works with one version of this
board.

As a temporary workaround for this problem, place the adapter in NE1000
compatibility mode and then use the NE1000 NDIS driver from Windows for
Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Thomas Conrad has confirmed this to be a problem with revision A of this series
of network adapters. For additional information, contact Thomas Conrad technical
support.

You can determine the revision number of the TC5043 series adapters by examining
the Serial number on the back edge of the network adapter. The revision letter
is located at the end of the serial number.

Updated ROM
-----------

Thomas Conrad has an updated ROM for the TC5043 that allows the board to operate
as fully NE2000-compatible. The problem with revision A of this board resulted
from 2 bytes of code that had to be corrected in their ROM.

Contact Thomas Conrad technical support to obtain this ROM update.

NOTE: There are two versions of the TC5043: one uses SMT (Surface Mount
Technology) and one uses the standard DIP (Dual Inline Package) technology. The
SMT boards CANNOT be upgraded, since the ROM is not a removable chip. The cards
that can be upgraded have the ROM chip in a socket on the left side of the card,
just above center. The ROM has a white sticker on it with a number. Thomas
Conrad needs this number when you request your update.

The TC5043 series of network adapters are manufactured by Thomas Conrad, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
