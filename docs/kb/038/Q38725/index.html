Questions:

Why don't uninitialized global variables show up in the library
listing when the module containing them has been placed in the
library? It appears that the librarian does not "see" uninitialized
global variables.

If my main program declares an extern, and an .OBJ with which its
linked declares it globally (without extern), but doesn't initialize
it, the symbol appears in the link map and space is allocated for it
in the .EXE. This behavior seems different from previous versions of
the compiler. If the .OBJ file is placed as a library rather than
linked explicitly, the symbol does not appear in the .EXE. Why does it
behave differently?

Response:

In Version 5.00 of the C Compiler, we introduced a new concept into
our linking process called "communal data." Communal data can be
declared in many modules, but only one copy of the data will exist
in the linked .EXE file. (It is similar to the concept of COMMON
blocks in FORTRAN.)

In C, data declared outside of a function without a storage class is
now considered to be communal data. (This is a change from previous
versions.) Communal data declarations generate no definitions, just
declarations; whereas initialized, or global, data declarations
generate both definitions and declarations.

Communal declarations may refer to a global definition. If they do,
the linker simply adjusts the address as necessary. However, if
there is no global definition of the variable, the linker combines
the declarations into one definition and allocates the appropriate
amount of space. For example, it is legal to declare

   int x;

in several different modules without a corresponding

   int x = 0;

Communal declarations are NOT copied into libraries. (This is
documented on Page 84 of the "Microsoft C Language Reference Manual.")
If you want the variable to appear in a library, it MUST be
initialized so that it is global rather than communal. Communal
variables are not included in libraries because they can cause
strange conflicts. For example, let's suppose you
unwittingly used a variable name that was also the name of a communal
variable in your library. At link time, the linker would allocate
only ONE copy of that variable without generating any warning.

The symptom would be that your variable would mysteriously change
every time you called the library function that used the communal
variable. This problem would be a very difficult to trace.

Now that we understand communal variables and how they interact with
libraries, we can answer your questions.

The first question was basically, "Why don't my communal variables
show up in the library listing?" Because communal data is not placed
into the library, it won't show up in the listing.

The second question was, "How come the communal variable shows up in
the .EXE file if I link it from an .OBJ file but not from a .LIB
file?" It shows up from the .OBJ file because the communal variable
is allocated space by the linker if it doesn't resolve to a global
definition. It does NOT appear in the link produced by the .LIB file
because it does not appear in the library dictionary.

Note: this behavior is the result of doing something we ask you not to
do; namely, putting communal data in a library. Data intended to be
placed in a library must be initialized.
