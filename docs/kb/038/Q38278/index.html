When a numeric data type (INTEGER, LONG, SINGLE, DOUBLE, or CURRENCY)
stored in a user-defined TYPE is PUT directly to a random-access file
as the third argument of the PUT statement, the values stored in the
file are stored the same as those written with PUT using variables
defined in a FIELD statement and initialized with LSET A$ = MKI$(i).

This is true for all TYPEs, except if you compile with the /MBF
option. When you compile with /MBF, SINGLE or DOUBLE user-defined
TYPEs still store on disk in IEEE format instead of in MBF format,
which is not what you desire when you compile /MBF.

This information applies to QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50,
to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS
OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

When you compile with the /MBF compiler option, you cannot use a
SINGLE or DOUBLE declaration in user-defined variables that are used
as the third argument of a random-access PUT. When compiling /MBF, you
must use STRING*4 and STRING*8 to PUT single- and double-precision
numbers that are in a user-defined TYPE; this requires using MKS, MKD,
CVS, and CVD for conversion of those numbers between string and
numeric TYPEs.

More information on this subject can be found under "Using
Random-Access Files" on Pages 126-134 in the "Microsoft QuickBASIC
4.0: Programming in BASIC: Selected Topics" manual supplied with
QuickBASIC Version 4.00 or 4.00b and in the "Microsoft BASIC Compiler
6.0: Programming in BASIC: Selected Topics" manual supplied with
Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 6.00 or 6.00b, or starting on Page
102 in the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's Guide" for Microsoft
BASIC PDS 7.00.

User-defined TYPEs are not available in earlier versions.

If you define an integer, such as in a user-defined TYPE, it is stored
as 2 bytes. A long integer is stored as 4 bytes. A single-precision
variable is stored as 4 bytes. A double-precision variable is stored
as 8 bytes. Fixed-length strings are stored with 1 byte per character.

Variable-length-string variables (such as x$ AS STRING) cannot be
placed in a user-defined TYPE record. For information about the
special way variable-length strings are stored on disk when written
directly as the third argument of the PUT# statement, search for a
separate article with the following words:

   PUT and THIRD and "BAD RECORD LENGTH" and VARIABLE and STRING

Code Example
------------

The code example below shows two equivalent methods of reading and
writing to random files when you compile without the /MBF option. One
method uses user-defined-TYPE records, and the other (older) method
uses variable-length strings in a FIELD statement to define the file
record. Note how much simpler your code is when you use user-defined
TYPE records instead of records defined by a FIELD statement.

   ' Note: This program is NOT compatible with the /MBF compiler
   ' option because of the single- and double-precision TYPEs in the
   ' user-defined TYPE. When compiling /MBF, you must use STRING*4
   ' and STRING*8 to PUT single- and double-precision numbers that
   ' are in a user-defined TYPE, which requires rewriting this program
   ' to use MKS, MKD, CVS, and CVD for conversion of those numbers.
   ' INTEGER, LONG, and STRING TYPEs are independent of the /MBF option.
