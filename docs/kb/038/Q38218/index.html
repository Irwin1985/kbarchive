Question:

Why is the following statement

   pointer1++ = pointer2 ;

illegal, causing error 2106 : left operand must be lvalue,
when the following statement is legal?

   *pointer1++ = *pointer2 ;

Both pointer1 and pointer2 are declared as pointers to the same type.

Response:

Because the post-increment operator ++ has higher precedence than the
assignment operator =, the following statement

   pointer1++ = pointer2 ;

is equivalent to the following statement:

   (pointer1++) = pointer2 ;

As defined by the post-increment operation, the result of evaluating
the expression (pointer1++) is NOT a lvalue. So (pointer1++) cannot
be used as a left operand of the assignment operator.

However, a statement such as the following, which is equivalent to
*(pointer1++) = *pointer2 ;, is legal:

    *pointer1++ = *pointer2 ;

This statement is legal because although (pointer1++) is not a lvalue,
it can be used for indirection and *(pointer1++) is a lvalue.

It is very important to understand the difference between the value of
the expression (pointer1++) and the value of pointer1. Although
(pointer1++) has higher precedence in the above statements, the result
of evaluating (pointer1++) has the old value that pointer1 had before
the evaluation of the expression (pointer1++). Because of the side
effect of the post-increment operator, the evaluation of (pointer1++)
causes the value of pointer1 to be incremented by 1 only after the
rest of the statement has been evaluated. In other words, as an
address, (pointer1++) points to the same memory location as pointer1
used to. Therefore, *pointer1++ or *(pointer1++) represents the same
object as *pointer1 used to.

The following example has the effect of assigning "a" to memory
offset location 0x100, then incrementing ptr1 to point to memory
offset 0x101:

char * ptr1 = 0x100; /* ptr1 points to memory offset 0x100
                        in the current data segment
                        for small or medium memory models */
*ptr1++ = 'a';
