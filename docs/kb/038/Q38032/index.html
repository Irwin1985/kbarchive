QuickC version 2.00 is a window-like programming environment that
integrates a text editor, a compiler, a debugger, and a make utility.
Major differences between version 2.00 and the previous releases of
QuickC are listed below. After each listing there is a source
reference where you can find more detailed information in the
documentation that accompanies QuickC version 2.00.

The following listing shows features that are exclusive to QuickC
version 2.00:

 1. 512K memory available required for QC.EXE.

 2. Online Help. QuickC version 2.00 offers instant Online information
    on all important C topics. The following lists some of the topics
    for which help is available:

    a. C-keywords, operators, library functions, prototypes,
       definitions

    b. Environment Help (help on menu choices, dialog boxes, etc.)

    c. C Run-time Errors

    d. Help (on Help)

    You can also add information to the OnLine Help database yourself,
    using the HELPMAKE utility. (See Chapter 4 "Getting Help" in the
    "Up and Running" documentation.)

 3. Customize the QuickC Editor:

    It is possible to use another set of editing command keystrokes
    using the .KEY files QC.KEY, ME.KEY, BRIEF.KEY, and EPSILON.KEY.
    These files can be used to remap the keystrokes of the QuickC
    editor so that it emulates the Microsoft Editor, Brief, and Epsilon
    editors. You also can create your own .KEY file with the MKKEY
    utility.

    You can use your own choice of editor or word processor instead of
    the QuickC Editor. However, use of other editors will not support
    the symbolic information necessary to the debugger.

    (See "Customizing the Editor" in "Up and Running," Pages 26-28.)

 4. Incremental Compiling/Linking. If you choose the incremental
    compilation option, then only those functions that have changed
    since the last compilation will be recompiled. (See section 4.3.15
    of "QuickC Toolkit.")

 5. Presentation Graphics. In addition to the existing graphics
    functions, version 2.00 offers Presentation Graphics, which is the
    name given to the library of chart-generating functions. With
    this package, you can display data as a variety of graphs such as
    pie charts, bar and column charts, line graphs, and scatter graphs.
    Fonts and font sizes are also manipulated through these routines.
    (See Chapter 13 "Presentation Graphics' in "C For Yourself.")

 6. Support for the "Olivetti Color Board" graphics card.

 7. InLine Assembly Code. QuickC has the ability to handle
    assembly-language instructions right in your C program. This
    ability is built in and does not require a separate assembler
    program. (See Chapter 15 "InLine Assembly" in "C For Yourself.")

 8. "C For Yourself" (an introduction to the C language). This book
    assumes that you have programmed before, but are not familiar with
    the C language. Topics covered are as follows:

    a. Functions and data types.

    b. Input/output and graphics.

    c. QuickC implementation of the C Language.

    d. Summaries of common run-time functions. (Details of all run-time
       functions are available in the OnLine Help facility.) (See the
       "C For Yourself" manual.)

 9. NMAKE (program maintenance utility). NMAKE is similar to the MAKE
    utility and helps automate software development and maintenance.
    NMAKE is typically used in the following situations:

    a. Updating an executable file whenever any of the source or object
       files has changed

    b. Managing libraries, to rebuild a library whenever any of the
       modules in the library has changed

    c. In a networking environment, to update the local copy of a
       file that is stored on the network whenever the master copy
       has changed
