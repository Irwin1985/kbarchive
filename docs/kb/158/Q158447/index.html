SUMMARY
=======

The unattended setup mode of Windows NT 4.0 does not offer a way to run a
program once the setup is complete. Nevertheless, this functionality may be very
useful if you want to set up other components on your system after the
completion of the unattended setup (for example, running a batch file, launching
a hands-free service pack update, or starting the setup routine of other
products).

This article describes how to run a program once (after an unattended setup has
completed).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Automatically running any kind of program after an unattended setup has
completed is not normally possible. The following steps explain how to run a
program only once after an unattended setup has completed.

Windows NT must be installed with the AutoLogon option enabled so that the system
automatically logs itself onto the network immediately after setup is complete,
thus allowing a session to be automatically opened and a specific program to be
launched.

For additional information about enabling AutoLogon for initial logon after
running Windows NT 4.0 Setup, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q157361 How to Automatically Log On After an Unattended Setup

To set up Windows NT 4.0 and to run a program automatically after the setup has
completed, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Create a new share on a network server and then copy the i386 folder (or
  appropriate platform folder) from the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc to the new
  share.

2. Obtain the Regini.exe program from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit and place
  it in the shared network installation point.

3. Using a text editor (such as Notepad), create a text file and name it
  Runonce.ini. Save the file to the shared network installation point. In this
  file, create the following entries (making sure to place a carriage return at
  the end of each line):

  \Registry\Machine
          Software
            Microsoft
              Windows
                CurrentVersion
                  Run
                    RUNBATCH = REG_SZ "BATCH.CMD"

4. Add the following entry to the [Unattended] section of the Unattend.txt
  file:

  OEMPreinstall = Yes

5. Add the following entries to the [GUIUnattended] section of the Unattend.txt
  file:

  DetachedProgram = "%SystemRoot%\System32\REGINI.EXE"
  Arguments = "%SystemRoot%\System32\RUNONCE.INI"

  For additional information about parameters for the Unattend.txt file, please
  see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q155197 Unattended Setup Parameters for Unattend.txt File

6. Save and close the Unattend.txt file.

7. Using a text editor, create a text file and save it to the shared network
  installation point as Cleanup.inf. The contents of the Cleanup.inf file must
  be:

  [Version]
  signature="$CHICAGO$"

  [DefaultInstall]
  DelReg = Delete.Reg

  [Delete.Reg]
  HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run","RUNBATCH"

8. Using a text editor, create a batch file and save it to the shared network
  installation point as Batch.cmd. This batch file can include any command, and
  will be run only once after the unattended setup has completed. The Batch.cmd
  file must also contain the following lines:

  %SystemRoot%\System32\rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection
  DefaultInstall 132 %SystemRoot%\System32\cleanup.inf

  NOTE: The above command should be all on one line; the line is wrapped for
  readability.

  Triggering the Cleanup.inf file in this manner prevents the running of the
  Batch.cmd file in future logons.

9. During the first phase of the unattended setup, all system files are
  temporarily copied to C:\$Win_nt$.~ls and C:\$Win_nt$.~bt. The Dosnet.inf
  lists the files that have to be copied to the system.

  Therefore, the next step is to edit the Dosnet.inf and add the following lines
  to the end of the [Files] section:

  d1,REGINI.EXE
  d1,RUNONCE.INI
  d1,BATCH.CMD
  d1,CLEANUP.INF

10. The Txtsetup.sif file is used during the text-mode phase of the unattended
  setup. This file tells the setup process which files have to be copied to
  the hard disk.

  The next step is to modify the Txtsetup.sif file in the shared network
  installation point. Add the following lines to the end of the
  [SourceDisksFiles] section of the Txtsetup.sif file:

  BATCH.CMD   = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0
  REGINI.EXE  = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0
  RUNONCE.INI = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0
  CLEANUP.INF = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0

  Adding these lines causes the files above to be copied to the System32
  directory.

11. Run Setup using the appropriate switches, specifying the Unattend.txt file
  containing the modifications discussed above.

Method 2
--------

1. Create a $oem$ directory under the I386 directory.

2. Create a registry file by exporting the Runonce.ini file out of the registry.
  The file should look similar to the following:

  REGEDIT4
  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce]
  @="c:\\WinNT\\System32\\Calc.exe"

  NOTE: Replace "C:\\WinNT\\Sytem32\\Calc.exe" with whatever command you want to
  run. Give the file a descriptive name, such as Runonce.reg.

3. Copy Regedit.exe to the $oem$ directory.

4. Use a text editor to create a file named Cmdlines.txt. In this file, add the
  following lines:

  [commands]
  ".\regedit /s runonce.reg"

5. In the Unattend.txt file, make sure you have OEMPREINSTALL set to "Yes".

6. Run unattended setup for Windows NT 4.0.
