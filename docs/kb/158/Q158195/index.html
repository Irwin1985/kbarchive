SUMMARY
=======

Time Zone Editor (Tzedit.exe) is available on the OEM Service Release 2 CD-ROM.
You can run this tool directly from the CD-ROM by double-clicking it in the
Admin\Apptools\Tzedit folder on the CD-ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Time Zone Editor was introduced as a means of quickly updating time zone
information to account for border disputes, addition and removal of time zones,
and other time zone-specific changes. Time Zone Editor has two main functions:

- You can edit a time zone name or adjust the start and end dates for daylight
  saving time. Time zone information changes affect every user of the computer.

- You can use Time Zone Editor to create new time zone entries for the
  Date/Time tool. You can have an unlimited number of time zones customized any
  way you want.

To edit a time zone:

1. In Time Zone Editor, click a time zone and then click Edit.

2. Change the time zone name, abbreviation, or the difference from Greenwich
  Mean Time.

  The abbreviation is a short string name passed back to programs that ask for
  more information about the time zone. This is the Standard time abbreviation
  that applies to the Standard time zone. In the Daylight Saving Time box, the
  Abbreviation box is the Daylight abbreviation that applies when daylight
  saving time is in effect. Many communication programs, such as mail programs,
  may use this information.

3. If you want daylight saving time to be automatically enabled for the time
  zone, click Automatically Set Daylight Saving Time. Then, in the boxes
  underneath the option, fill in the start and stop days and times.

  In the Abbreviation box, type a name to apply when daylight saving time is in
  effect.

  In the Daylight Bias box, select the amount of time to move forward or
  backward from the Standard time for daylight saving time. In most cases, this
  value should stay at the default value of +1:00 hour. This causes the time to
  move forward by one hour on the daylight saving time start day and time and
  fall back one hour on the daylight saving time last day and time.

To create a new time zone:

1. In Time Zone Editor, click New.

2. In the Time Zone Name box, type a name for the time zone to be displayed in
  the Date/Time tool.

  Time zone names should start with the general template GMT+\- 0x:00, and
  cannot exceed 63 characters. This ensures that the time zone name is sorted
  in the list box and placed in its proper order (for example, GMT+03:00 or
  GMT-04:00).

3. In the Abbreviation box, type a name for the Standard time zone name
  abbreviation. The name should not exceed 31 characters.

  The abbreviation is a short string name passed back to programs that ask for
  more information about the time zone. This is the Standard time abbreviation
  that applies to the Standard time zone. In the Daylight Saving Time box, the
  Abbreviation box is the Daylight abbreviation that applies when daylight
  saving time is in effect. Many communication programs, such as mail programs,
  may use this information.

4. In the Offset From GMT box, select the time difference from Greenwich Mean
  Time. This value is the actual number that gets used in the data fields to
  determine the time zone's bias from Greenwich Mean Time.

5. If you want daylight saving time to be automatically enabled for the time
  zone (if the area uses daylight saving time), click the Automatically Set
  Daylight Saving Time check box to select it. Then, in the boxes underneath
  the option, fill in the start and stop days and times.

  The Abbreviation box is an optional entry. Type a name to apply when daylight
  saving time is in effect.

  In the Daylight Bias box, select the amount of time to move forward or
  backward from the Standard time for daylight saving time. In most cases, this
  value should stay at the default value of +1:00 hour. This causes the time to
  move forward by one hour on the daylight saving time start day and time and
  fall back one hour on the daylight saving time last day and time.

Changes made with Time Zone Editor affect the stored data for time zones in the
registry. If a time zone is already set on the computer, that data is saved in
another location in the registry. In order for the new information to be used,
you must use the Date/Time tool in Control Panel and select or re-select the
time zone.
