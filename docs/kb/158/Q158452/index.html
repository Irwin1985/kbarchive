SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the steps required to install and configure Windows 95 for
the Remoteboot service under Windows NT Server 4.0. Prior to performing any of
the steps outlined in this article, you must have properly installed the
Remoteboot service on Windows NT and have configured the remoteboot client for
MS-DOS. For more information, please see the following articles here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Article-ID: Q158277
  TITLE : How to Configure DOS for Remoteboot on Windows NT 4.0

  Article-ID: Q158454
  TITLE : How to Install Remoteboot on Windows NT 4.0

For this article, it is assumed that your system's Remoteboot service,
Server-Based Setup (SBS) installation directory, and machine directory reside in
a Windows NT 4.0 Server configured for remoteboot.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Requirements
------------

An SBS of Windows 95 requires 90 megabytes (MB) of available disk space on the
server, as well as an additional 2 MB for the Windows 95 client configuration
files and at least 10 MB for each Windows 95 machine directory. More disk space
is required if users install additional software.

The remoteboot client computer requires 8 MB of RAM, must use a 386DX or higher
processor, and must have a supported Remoteboot Network Card.

Installing SBS for Windows 95 Clients
-------------------------------------

The following procedures are taken from the Windows NT Server Networking Guide
Help file in the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.

For more information about SBS servers, see the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource
Kit. The resource kit describes additional purposes, beyond remoteboot, that you
can use an SBS server for.

To install an SBS server for a Windows 95 client, you will need a Windows 95
installation compact disc (not to be confused with a floppy disk) and the
Windows 95 client computer. You must then complete the following steps:

1. On the server that will contain the SBS files, create a shared directory with
  90 MB of available disk space. The shared directory can have any name.

  NOTE: As you share the directory, assign read-only permission for regular
  users and full access for administrators. Use Server Manager to focus on the
  shared directory, and set read-only permission for the Users group and full
  permission for the Administrators group. In File Manager, on the Disk menu,
  click Share As (do NOT open the Security menu and click Permissions).

2. Install one regular Windows 95 client on the network or use an existing one.
  You will use this client to configure the SBS server.

3. Log on to the Windows 95 client using an account that has write access to the
  shared directory on the SBS server.

4. Put the Windows 95 compact disc in the client's CD-ROM drive. In Windows
  Explorer, switch to the Admin\Nettools\Netsetup directory.

  NOTE: Only the retail version of Windows 95 includes the Netsetup.exe utility.
  Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1, 2, and 2.5 do not include the Netsetup.exe
  utility.

5. Double-click the file Netsetup.exe.

  Note that you must run Netsetup.exe at a Windows 95 client. Errors will occur
  if you run this file on a computer running Windows NT.

6. In the Server-Based Setup dialog box, click Set Path, and specify the path to
  the SBS server. In specifying the path, you can type a drive letter for a
  mapped drive, a network name for a server (for example, \\server1\sharedir),
  or a network path to a specific directory (for example,
  \\server1\sharedir\rpl\win95). The button name becomes Change Path if a
  server was defined previously.

7. Click OK, then click Install.

8. Server-Based Setup now presents you with a series of dialog boxes asking you
  to select among various options. The boxes you see may include the following:

   - A dialog box for specifying an installation policy controlling how users
     can install Windows 95 from the server. If you support only remoteboot
     clients, click Server. If you support other SBS functions as well, click
     User's Choice. Do not click Local Hard Drive.

   - A dialog box for setting the source path for Windows 95 files. This is the
     path to the compact disc on the client.

   - A dialog box for indicating whether you want to create a default setup
     script. Specify that you do NOT want to create a default setup script.
     Setup scripts for Windows NT remoteboot installation require special
     settings.

   - A dialog box for providing a CD Key number for product identification.

   - A dialog box for directing Server-Based Setup to copy Windows 95 files to
     the SBS shared directory.

9. At the remoteboot server, insert the compact disc or floppy disk containing
  the Windows NT remoteboot for Windows 95 files. Change to the newly inserted
  disc or disk, then change to the Update\Win95 directory. To update the
  Windows 95 files for remotebooting, run Win95srv.bat. The following inputs
  illustrate this process:

     d:
     cd \clients\rpl\update\win95
     win95srv.bat &lt;dest&gt;

  where &lt;dest&gt; is the shared directory on the SBS server.

10. If you are updating from version 3.51 or earlier of the Remoteboot service,
  start the Remoteboot service at the remoteboot server (if it is not already
  started). Then run the program Rbootsrv.bat to update the remoteboot files
  and database for Windows 95 remotebooting. Thus, at the server's command
  prompt, you would type:

  d:
  cd \clients\rpl\update\win95
  rbootsrv.bat &lt;SBS_path&gt; &lt;RPL_path&gt; [\\servername]

  where:

   - &lt;SBS_path&gt; is the path to the installed SBS server's Windows 95
     files.

   - &lt;RPL_path&gt; is the path to the remoteboot directory.

   - \\servername is the name of the remoteboot server (you can omit this if
     you are typing at the remoteboot server).

11. At the remoteboot server, start Remoteboot Manager.

12. On the Configure menu, click Check Configurations to activate the new
  configurations.

Installing the First Windows 95 Client
--------------------------------------

Each remoteboot client has a machine directory. This directory contains
client-specific configuration information and data. Stored here are the
appropriate initialization and configuration files, the registry, desktop, start
menu directories, spool directories and the swap file and temp directories.
These machine directories can reside on any server on the network provided that
the server is running NetBEUI and IPX protocols and that there is ample disk
space available. You may want to spread the load of the machine directories
across servers.

1. On the server that will contain the machine directory, create a shared
  directory with at least 10 MB of space available per client. Additional space
  may be needed depending on the installed applications. The share directory
  can have any name and be located in any directory. One suggestion is that you
  create the directory under the WINNT\RPL and supply a name of Win95.mac.

  NOTE: The server for the machine directory must be in the same domain or
  workgroup as the SBS server.

  NOTE: The machine directories may not be subdirectories of the SBS directory.

2. Set the permissions for the share and directory (NTFS only). The group
  RPLUSERS and the group ADMINISTRATORS both need full control.

  NOTE: For added security (NTFS only), assign the permissions to a machine
  directory so that only the users who will use the client have full control of
  the machine directory for that remoteboot computer.

3. Boot the remoteboot client with DOS 6.2x.

4. Using the NET LOGON command, log on to the remoteboot client using an account
  that has read access to the SBS server and write access to the server with
  the machine directory share. Many users have found it easier to use the
  administrator account during the installation process for full access to all
  systems.

5. Using the NET USE command, map one drive to the SBS share and another to the
  machine directory share.

  NOTE: The drive letters used during this step cannot be changed and will be
  dedicated to the booting and operation of the Windows 95 remoteboot client.
  For example, in the following:

  net use F: \\NTSERVER\WIN95.SBS
  net use G: \\NTSERVER\WIN95.MAC

  drive F is mapped to the Windows 95 SBS and drive G is mapped to the Windows
  95 machine directory share. These drive letters cannot be changed or used for
  other shares since Windows 95 uses them during its operation.

6. Change to the drive letter mapped to the SBS share. In the above example,
  this is drive F.

7. Run the Windows 95 Setup program by typing:

  Setup /t:temppath

  where /t: is required and temppath is a path to a directory to store temporary
  files during the installation. This path could be G:\win.tmp. Note that the
  temp path is completely removed after completing the installation of Windows
  95.

  NOTE: You may want to use SETUP /T:TEMPPATH /IW /IS MSBATCH.INF. This bypasses
  licensing during setup and skips scandisk.

8. Setup will display the following dialog boxes:

   - Server-Based Setup dialog box. Select "Setup Windows to run from a network
     server."

   - Startup Method dialog box. Select "Start Windows from the network
     (remoteboot server)."

   - Machine Directory dialog box. Enter the drive letter and a directory to
     install the Windows 95. (The drive letter must be the same drive letter
     mapped for the computer's directory, and the directory name should reflect
     the configuration for the computer. For example, G:\DELL5166 might be used
     for a Dell Pentium 166. The directory is created during setup.)

   - Setup Options dialog box. Choose custom setup.

   - Analyzing Your Computer dialog box. Select "No, I want to modify the
     hardware list." (You should exclude as many hardware types and items from
     the auto-detection as possible. If during the auto-detection phase, the
     system fails, you should restart the setup process and exclude more items
     from the auto-detection phase.)

     NOTE: If your network adapter is using IRQ2 or IRQ3, this will conflict
     with the serial port detection and possibly cause the system to fail
     during Setup.

   - Select Components dialog box. Clear the checkbox for Communications if
     your remoteboot client doesn't have a modem.

   - Network Configuration dialog box. Select the appropriate network adapter
     and the desired protocols. If your network adapter is not displayed, you
     will have to add and configure your adapter.

     NOTE: If you add your network adapter, you must confirm the resource
     settings for the adapter by selecting OK. If you select Cancel, your
     Windows 95 remoteboot setup will fail to boot properly.

   - Identification dialog box. Make sure the workgroup name is the same as the
     domain or workgroup name of the SBS server and machine directory server.

When the Windows 95 setup program completes, reboot the client and either turn it
off or leave it at the prompt that asks you whether you want to boot from the
network or not.

9. At the remoteboot server, start the Remoteboot Manager.

10. Create a profile for the Windows 95 client. In the Configuration box, choose
  the Windows 95 configuration that corresponds to the client's network
  adapter type. The adapter type should be the same one used to do the DOS6.2x
  remoteboot.

11. Select the client's workstation record by double-clicking on it or selecting
  Properties from the Remoteboot menu, and assign the new Windows 95 profile.

12. Once the profile has been configured, you need to move the client- specific
  Windows 95 real-mode boot files from the client's machine directory to the
  Rpl\Rplfiles\ Profiles\&lt;profile_name&gt; directory on the remoteboot
  server. To do this, go to the remoteboot server (or a client with write
  access to the remoteboot server's Rpl directory), and run the
  Rpl\Bin\Win95clt.bat program by typing:

  cd &lt;systemroot&gt;\rpl\bin
  win95clt mach_directory \\rpl_server profile_name

  where:

   - mach_directory is the path to the client's machine directory.

   - \\rpl_server is the name of the remoteboot server.

   - profile_name is the name of the Windows 95 profile associated with the
     client.

  For example, you could type:

  cd \winnt\rpl\bin
  WIN95CLT G:\DELL5166 \\NTSERVER WIN95

  NOTE: You must have a drive letter explicitly pointing to the machine
  directory and cannot specify the UNC name for the location of the machine
  directory. If you try to use the UNC name, the remoteboot client will not be
  able to locate the full registry during the boot process.

  NOTE: If the machine directory is on the same computer as the Remoteboot
  service, then you can just type in the local path.

13. At the SBS server, edit the Machines.ini file in the SBS directory. Add the
  following lines for the new client.

     [Adapter ID]
     SysDatPath=G:\machine_dir
     G=\\mach_server\mach_share

  where:

   - Adapter ID is the network adapter ID (MAC address from manufacturer)
     specified in the remoteboot workstation record for this client.

   - G:\machine_dir is the location of the client's machine directory on a
     server.

  NOTE: The drive letter G: is the same drive letter assigned during the
  installation of Windows 95 for the machine directory.
  G=\\mach_server\mach_share assigns a drive letter to the shared directory
  where the machine directory resides. The G= should be the same drive letter
  assigned during the installation of the Windows 95 for the machine
  directory.

  Based on our previous examples, the Machine.ini for our client would contain
  the following:

        [12345AB67C89]
        SYSDATPATH=G:\DELL5166
        G=\\NTSERVER\WIN95.MAC

14. Power on the remoteboot client. The client will now boot to Windows 95 and
  complete the Windows 95 Setup program.

For more information about installation, refer to the Windows NT 4.0 Resource
Kit.
