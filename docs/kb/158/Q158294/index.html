SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and attempt to restore the registry
information of a specific key by choosing Restore from the Registry menu, the
following error message appears:

  Registry Editor could not accomplish the requested operation.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by trying to restore a key that was saved with the Save
Subtree As... option from the registry menu. This cause is described in this
article.

Additionally, attempting to use Load Hive with a key that was saved using Save
Subtree As... causes the following error:

  Registry Editor could not load the key.
  The file is not a valid registry file.

The error message indicated in the Symptoms section can also be caused by opening
the registry of a remote computer and attempting to save the registry
information of a specific key by clicking Save Key from the Registry menu.

For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q139600
  TITLE : Registry Editor Save Key Saves Key on Wrong Computer

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

When saving the key, instead of clicking the Save Subtree As... option, click the
Save Key option from the Registry menu. When trying to restore the key, click
the Restore option from the Registry menu. The saved key will be restored
without error.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Save Key option saves, as a file, the information contained in a registry
key and in all of its subkeys. A file created using Save Key can be loaded into
the registry (with Load Hive), or can be restored (with Restore). This format is
readable by the Registry Editor and should be used when trying to move or save
registry keys from one registry to another.

The Save Subtree As... option saves the contents of the currently selected key as
a text file, including all subkeys and value entries for that key. This format
is used to provide a user readable text format for verifying all of the entries
in a key or subkey, and it is not meant to move or save registry keys.

Additional query words: prodnt registry restore subkey
