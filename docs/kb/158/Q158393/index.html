-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Soccer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you or your computer opponent selects a red-carded player to take a free or
corner kick, the player does not approach the ball, and the game stops
responding (hangs).

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this issue from occurring, substitute a new player for the red-carded
player as soon as possible. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Press the ESC key, and then click Coaching.

2. To substitute a player on the home team, click and drag the number for a new
  player and drop it on the number for the red-carded player.

3. To substitute a player on the away team, click See Away, and then click and
  drag the number for a new player and drop it on the number for the red-carded
  player.

4. Click Play Game.

NOTE: Soccer substitutes the new player for the red-carded player the next time
the ball is out of play (goal kicks, corner kicks, and throw-ins) and in your
possession.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Soccer, version 1.0.
