-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Macintosh 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following article contains the Screen Sizes, Color Configuration, and Sound
Problems sections of the Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia Readme.txt file and
discusses possible display and sound issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SCREEN SIZES AND COLOR CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------

On startup, Encarta checks your monitor to ensure you are running in at least 256
colors. If your monitor is set to black and white or 16 colors, you will be
reminded to switch to a higher color depth.

Encarta will run on any 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch) or higher resolution
Macintosh-compatible monitor, although Encarta's video clips, panoramas and
still images look best in Thousands or Millions of colors.

NOTE: Running in Millions of colors requires more memory to display images in
Encarta. If you normally run in this color mode and experience out-of-memory
conditions, you can increase the amount of memory Encarta requests by quitting
the application, clicking on the Encarta 97 Encyclopedia icon, choosing Get Info
from the File menu, and then increasing the preferred size in the section
labeled "Memory Requirements".

Encarta is not designed to run in black and white, in 16 colors, or on monitors
displaying less than 640x480 pixels (e.g. Color Classics, older PowerBooks, and
all 12" Apple monitors).

SOUND PROBLEMS
--------------

If the audio is missing or interrupted, check the following:

Sounds may be inaudible if the sound level is turned down. To set the sound
level, open the Sound control panel (incorporated into the Monitors &amp; Sound
control panel on some machines) and experiment with the speaker volume setting.
If you set the sound level to maximum, you may get some distortion. With
external speakers, be sure they are connected properly and turned on. You will
generally be able to adjust sound level with the external speaker volume knob as
well as with the Sound control panel.

If Virtual Memory is enabled on your Macintosh, you may find that sounds are
choppy. When Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are sometimes placed on the
hard disk rather than in physical RAM. For optimal performance, reduce Virtual
Memory to its lowest possible level. For more details on Virtual Memory, check
the MEMORY USE section.

In low memory situations, you may find that sounds will not load or play. If you
cannot get a sound to play and are sure that your Sound control panel is set
correctly, or if you are receiving error messages when attempting to play
sounds, you may need to allocate more memory to Encarta. Refer to the MEMORY USE
section for suggestions on how to solve memory problems.

Audio is available in Collages only when running the encyclopedia on a Power
Macintosh.

Version 1.5.1 of Connectix RAM Doubler has a known bug that prevents audio and
video clips from playing properly on Power Macintosh models. To obtain upgrade
information, contact Connectix Corporation.
