SUMMARY
=======

A white paper on ShivaRemote is located on Microsoft TechNet and can also be
found on the following World Wide Web location:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/

ShivaRemote 3.59, which ships with Microsoft Exchange, can be used with the
Microsoft Exchange client to allow users to remotely access a computer running
Microsoft Exchange Server (either through a computer running Windows NT Server
with RAS or Shiva LanRover). This article discusses server settings necessary to
allow a Microsoft Exchange client to connect over Shiva.

NOTE: ShivaRemote version 3.59 will connect to any Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
dial-up server, but the Microsoft Exchange client over a ShivaRemote connection
is only supported specifically dialing into either a Shiva LanRover or a
computer running Windows NT 3.51 with RAS. (Dialing into NT 4.0 is not supported
with Shivaremote 3.59)


MORE INFORMATION
================

If possible, prior to testing ShivaRemote from a client computer, test dialing
into the computer running Windows NT Server with RAS from either a computer
running Windows NT Workstation (with RAS) or from a Windows 95 client (with
Dial-up Networking). This will help eliminate the RAS server as the source of
the problem. There are updated modem scripts for Windows NT that may also be
necessary for proper operation, depending on the modem being used on the server
and client computers.

If you are unable to connect from a computer running Windows 95 or Windows NT
Workstation, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information on setting up RAS
under Windows NT or contact Microsoft technical Support for assistance.

Specifically for an Exchange client to connect properly over ShivaRemote through
a computer running Windows NT Server with RAS:

1. Access must be granted to all remote users in the Remote Access Administrator
  utility. Open the utility (Windows NT creates a Remote Access group when RAS
  is installed on the server), click Users/Permissions, click each user you
  want to allow dial-in capabilities, and select the "Grant dial-in permission
  to user" check box.

2. In Control Panel Network, click Remote Access Service, click Configure, and
  click Network. Ensure the "Require Microsoft encrypted authentication" check
  box is not selected in the Network Configuration dialog box of Windows NT
  RAS. Check either the "Allow any authentication including clear text" or the
  "Require Encrypted Authentication" check box.

  If the "Require Microsoft encrypted authentication" check box is selected, the
  Client computer will receive the following error message when connecting:

  Unable to negotiate LCP connection. Please check that remote device is
  installed and configured, and that dial-in is enabled.

3. Ensure the Windows NT account does NOT have the "User Must Change Password at
  Next Logon" check box selected.

  If you have this check box selected, you will receive the following error
  message when attempting to log on to Microsoft Exchange :

  The MS Exchange directory service could not be opened. You must change your
  password before logging on for the first time.

4. If IPX is desired as the protocol for connectivity over ShivaRemote, either
  Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) or a NetWare server must
  be configured to respond to the find_nearest_server query. For FPNW, this
  option is set through Control Panel FPNW, "respond to Find_Nearest_Server
  request."

5. ShivaRemote 3.59 requires a local account to be granted dial-in access
  (version 3.59 does not understand Domains). A RAS server primary domain
  controller (PDC) or backup domain controller (BDC) is recommended.

  If the computer running RAS is only a member server, you must grant dial-in
  access to a local account on the server running RAS by first creating a local
  account via User Manager for Domains (with the same username and password as
  the domain account), selecting User/Select Domain and typing the machine name
  of the computer running Windows NT Server with RAS.

  Then access must be granted to that local user via the Remote Access Admin
  utility by selecting Server/Select Domain and typing the machine name of the
  RAS server, then selecting the local account you wish to grant access to.

  Windows NT PDC's or BDC's "local accounts" are also the Domain accounts,
  (unlike a computer running Windows NT Server that has two sets of accounts:
  the local accounts for the machine and the domain accounts). Because of this,
  it is recommended to have the computer running Windows NT Server with RAS set
  up as a PDC or BDC.
