MORE INFORMATION
================

When working with public, mailbox, or personal folders, a user with Owner
permissions can modify the forms associated with that folder by specifying
information on the Forms Tab of the Properties Dialog for that folder.

The Forms Tab can be used to copy or install a custom form into the selected
folder. Forms that you have copied or installed in a folder are listed on the
Compose menu when that folder is open. The Forms Tab also allows you to specify
what forms are allowed in the folder with the following options:

  Only Forms Listed Above
  -----------------------
  Allows only those forms that are listed under Forms Associated
  With This Folder.

  Forms Listed Above And The Standard Forms
  -----------------------------------------
  Allows forms that are listed under Forms Associated With This
  Folder, New Message forms, New Post forms, and files such as
  documents and spreadsheets.

  Any Form
  --------
  Allows any form.

If you attempt to post or send to the folder with a form that is not allowed, you
will receive the error message or Non-Delivery Report mentioned above.
