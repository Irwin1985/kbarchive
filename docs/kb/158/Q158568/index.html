SUMMARY
=======

With the release of Windows NT version 4.0, the drivers for certain SCSI
adapters have been moved from the base operating system to the Windows NT Driver
Library included on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM. Check the following list to
determine if any of your adapters are affected by this change. If your computer
has an adapter that appears on this list, you must create a driver disk before
you can use that adapter. Use the driver disk to install the appropriate
driver(s) during Setup, or keep the disk handy and install the driver once Setup
is finished.

Note that an unattended upgrade can no longer be performed with these adapters.
On x86-based computers, the recommended method of performing Setup with any of
these adapters is to use the three boot floppy disks with the CD-ROM.

The following drivers have been moved:

- Always.sys

- Dtc329x.sys

- T128.sys

- T13b.sys

- Tmv1.sys

- Ultra124.sys

- Wd33c93.sys

The following adapters are affected by this change:

- Always IN-2000

- Data Technology Corp. 3290

- Maynard 16-bit SCSI Adapter

- MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum-16

- Trantor T-128

- Trantor T-130B

- UltraStor 124f EISA Disk Array Controller

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a driver disk for drivers that have been moved to the Driver Library,
follow these steps:

1. Create a blank formatted 3.5-inch disk.

2. Copy all the files from the Drvlib\Storage\Retired\&lt;platform&gt; folder to
  the floppy disk.

  For enabler drivers, copy the files from the Drvlib\Storage\Fenb folder.

3. Label the disk Driver Disk.

To install drivers from the driver disk during Windows NT version 4.0 Setup,
follow these steps:

1. Start Windows NT Setup.

2. When you see the "Setup has recognized the following mass storage devices in
  your computer" message, press S to skip detection.

3. Press S to display a list of supported SCSI host adapters.

4. Click Other at the bottom of the list.

5. Insert the Driver Disk you created. Select your host adapter from this list.

  Windows NT will then recognize any devices attached to the adapter. Repeat
  this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers when Setup recognizes one of the supported SCSI host adapters
without making the devices attached to it available for use, follow these
steps:

1. Restart Windows NT Setup.

2. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup is inspecting your
  computer's hardware configuration..." press F6. This prevents Windows NT
  Setup from performing disk controller detection and allows you to install a
  driver from the Driver Disk you created. Note that all SCSI adapters will
  have to be installed manually.

3. When Windows NT Setup displays the message "Setup could not determine the
  type of one or more mass storage devices installed in your system, or you
  have chosen to manually specify an adapter" press S to display a list of
  supported SCSI host adapters.

4. Click Other at the bottom of the list.

5. Insert the Driver Disk when you are prompted to do so, and select your host
  adapter from the list. Note that in some cases, Windows NT Setup will
  repeatedly prompt you to swap disks.

  Windows NT will then recognize any devices attached to the adapter. Repeat
  this step for each host adapter not already recognized by Windows NT Setup.

To install drivers from your Driver Disk after running Windows NT 4.0 Setup,
follow these steps:

1. After installing the properly configured adapter in your computer, start
  Windows NT version 4.0 as you normally would.

2. In Control Panel, double-click SCSI Adapters.

3. Click the Drivers tab, and then click Add.

4. Click Have Disk, insert your Driver Disk in the appropriate floppy disk
  drive, and then click OK.

5. Click the driver in the list and then click OK. Click Continue to load the
  driver.

6. Restart the computer.
