SUMMARY
=======

This article tells you how to create a fresh installation of the Microsoft
Exchange Macintosh client on a workstation where the client was previously
installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a fresh install on the Macintosh Exchange client on a workstation
where the client was previously installed:

1. Create a Temp folder on the desktop.

2. If using offline folders (that is, working offline), make sure a connection
  is made to Microsoft Exchange Server, and all information is synchronized
  with the server. To synchronize: On the Tools menu, click Synchronize, and
  click All Folders).

3. Move any Personal Folders and/or Personal Address Books to the Temp folder
  you created in Step 1.

4. Move the files Microsoft OLE Automation, Microsoft OLE Extension, and
  Microsoft OLE Library to the Temp folder created in Step 1.

  NOTE: These OLE files are located in the System Folder in the Extensions
  folder.

5. Drag the "Microsoft Exchange" folder (or the folder where the Macintosh
  Exchange client was previously installed) and all of its contents to the
  Trash can on the desktop.

6. Open the System folder, open the Preferences subfolder, and drag the
  following files and folders to the trash can on the desktop:

  Exchange Files folder
  Exchange Help folder
  Exchange Profiles folder
  Exchange Preferences file
  Exchange Services file
  Mspst.ini file
  Exchngm.ini file
  RPC Preferences file

7. Open the System folder, open the Extensions subfolder, and drag the following
  file to the trash can on the desktop:

  Microsoft RPC Runtime Library

8. Open the System folder and drag the following folder to the trash can on the
  desktop:

  Exchange Temporary Items

  Note: Your Macintosh may not have some of these files. That is okay. Just make
  sure all files listed above that do exist on your Macintosh are dragged to
  the trash can on the desktop.


9. If your profile is Appletalk, it is also recommended that you remove the
  Appletalk Preferences file located in the Preferences folder in the System
  folder.

10. Hold down Option key and empty trash.

  NOTE: To empty trash: from Finder, click the Special menu and then click the
  "Empty Trash" option.

11. Restart the Macintosh.

12. Rebuild the desktop on restart:

  b. Click OK when prompted to rebuild the desktop file(s).

13. Re-install the Macintosh Exchange client: insert the Microsoft Exchange
  Macintosh client compact disc in the Macintosh CD-ROM drive, and click
  Microsoft Exchange Setup.

14. Create a new profile by double-clicking on the "Exchange Settings" icon in
  the Microsoft Exchange folder (or where you installed the Microsoft Exchange
  Macintosh client). Choose Show Profiles. Choose Add, and then follow the
  steps in the Profile Wizard.

  NOTE: If client was working offline previously, a new offline folder will
  need to be re-created. Click Yes when prompted with "Do you travel with this
  computer?" during profile creation.

15. Remove and re-create any old Inbox Assistant rules.

16. Test connectivity between Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Exchange
  Macintosh client.

17. Copy the Personal Folders and Personal Address Book files from the Temp
  folder on the desktop (the folder created in Step 1) to the folder where the
  Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client was installed (by default this is the
  Microsoft Exchange folder).

  NOTE: If necessary, add the Personal Folders and Personal Address Book files
  to the appropriate Profile Service:

  a. Run Exchange Settings, click Show Profiles,open the appropriate profile
     and edit as needed.

18. Drag the Temp folder on the desktop to the trash can.
