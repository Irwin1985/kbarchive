SUMMARY
=======

A white paper on ShivaRemote is located on Microsoft TechNet and can also be
found on the following World Wide Web location:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/

The ShivaRemote 3.59 software (which ships with Microsoft Exchange) can be used
with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client to allow users to remotely access
a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server (via dial-in to a Windows NT RAS
server or Shiva LanRover). This article discusses the necessary steps to install
and configure the ShivaRemote software that ships with Microsoft Exchange to
work under Windows 3.x. (Additional informationn on Shiva can be found in the
Reference section below).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install ShivaRemote on Windows 3.x:

1. Select the ShivaRemote component during Microsoft Exchange client Setup; this
  will install the Shiva Setup program.

2. Run the Shiva Setup program from the icon located in the Microsoft Exchange
  program group.

3. Install and configure ShivaRemote Dial-In Driver and protocols (Shiva's
  software configuration notes, CONFIG.HLP, have additional information).

Shiva is not installed by default; however, when a typical installation is
performed, an icon for setting up ShivaRemote is created in the Exchange program
group. This Setup program for the Windows 3.x version of ShivaRemote modifies
the Autoexec.bat, Win.ini, and System.ini files.

Note: The ShivaRemote setup icon that is added to the Microsoft Exchange Windows
3.x client program group only adds the DIAL.386 driver to the System.ini; some
manual steps are necessary.

ShivaRemote Setup copies all of its files to the directory ShivaRemote is being
installed into, except for VNB.386 and CTL3D.DLL. These two files are copied to
the \&lt;Windir&gt;\System directory.

Configuration of ShivaRemote
----------------------------

To configure ShivaRemote for use with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client:

1. Test the modem connection from Terminal.exe to ensure the modem itself is
  able to dial out and to verify the proper comm port.

  For more information about using terminal to test your modem, see the
  following article from the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q105940 Troubleshooting Serial Port Problems in Windows [win3x]

  a. Set up your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys as follows:

     NOTE: the Novell client software must be licensed from Novell.

     Config.sys
     ----------
     device=c:\dos\setver.exe
     device=c:\dos\himem.sys
     device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems
     shell=c:\dos\command.com /p
     dos=high,umb
     lastdrive=z

     autoexec.bat
     ------------
     lsl
     c:\exchange_dir\dialodi.exe
     ipxodi
     vlm (or netx)

     The net.cfg (nwclient directory)
     --------------------------------
      preferred server=servername
      Link Driver DIALODI

  b. Ensure you receive no error messages when booting with the newly
     configured Autoexec.bat and Config.sys.

2. Install the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client software. (Run Setup from
  the Microsoft Exchange 3.x client compact disc or from a sharepoint).

  Select Custom install and verify that Shiva is selected. (Setup will create a
  "ShivaRemote setup" icon in the Microsoft Exchange Program group).

3. If possible, verify a valid exchange mailbox/account exists while connected
  to the LAN. (start the Exchange client, create a profile and make sure you
  can log on to your mailbox and send a piece of mail to yourself).

4. Run "ShivaRemote setup" from the Microsoft Exchange Program group.

5. Click OK to install ShivaRemote.

6. Select the port and your specific modem manufacturer/model.

7. Specify a Description, Dial-in-Name (NT account that has been granted dial-in
  access on the server), Password (Password for the NT Account you are dialing
  in on), and Phone number.

8. Dial the computer running RAS. (Microsoft Exchange is supported dialing into
  either a computer running Windows NT Server with RAS or a Shiva LanRover).

  (For additional server configuration information, see the Reference section
  below.)

9. Once connected, minimize ShivaRemote Connect.

10. Start the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client. Enter the User Name
  (Exchange Mailbox Name), the Password (Windows NT Domain Password), and the
  Domain (Windows NT Domain Name that your Account is in) and verify you can
  be properly logged in.

If the above step allows you to properly send/receive mail, ShivaRemote and
Microsoft Exchange are configured correctly.

The Exchange Client remote capabilities can now be configured (remote mail or
offline folders).

To set up the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client to automatically dial:

1. In Control Panel/Mail-Fax, select the properties for Exchange Server in the
  profile and on the "Dial-Up Networking" tab.

2. Select the Shiva connection name that was tested in step 1 under "dial using
  the following connection."

3. Type the user name, password, and domain name in the dialog box.

The Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client can be started offline and when either
remote mail/connect or "sync this folder" is selected, ShivaRemote will dial and
transmit necessary information (depending on which option you select).

Possible Error Messages :
-------------------------

  Warning: Your IPX network number changed during connection. IPX services may
  not function properly.

If you receive this error in the Exchange DOS client, simply press the Enter key
and continue.

If you are using the Exchange client for Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups
3.x, the IPX network number assigned to your computer may have changed while you
were connected to the remote access server. This can happen if you dial-in to
two different remote networks in one session without restarting your computer
between connections.

If you are using the Novell NetWare VLMs Version 1.2 or later and ShivaRemote
3.5, you can ignore this error message, and your IPX-dependent software will
function without errors. (Later versions of the VLMs have been designed to
handle this problem correctly.) This warning message can be turned off by
editing the SREMOTE.INI file and changing the following line:

  [Options]
  NotifyIPXAddress=No

If you are not using the NetWare VLMs, or if you are using VLMs prior to Version
1.2, close the Dial-In connection and restart your computer, then dial-in to the
remote network again.

  The MS Exchange directory service could not be opened. A network error has
  occurred. Quit and restart MS Exchange. Microsoft Exchange for MS- DOS ID no:
  5866-80040115.

To resolve this issue, test RPCs over the connection by running "rpings.exe"
(located on the Exchange server CD in the Support directory) on the Exchange
Server and rpingdos.exe on the DOS client machine. If you are loading
dialodi.exe, VLM or NETX must also be loaded, even though you are not connecting
to the LAN.
