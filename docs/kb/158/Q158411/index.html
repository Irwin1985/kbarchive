SUMMARY
=======

All MSN, The Microsoft Network, access phone numbers that provide access to MSN
only (no Internet access) will be deactivated December 1, 1996. This article
provides information about this transition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The demand for Internet-based content and services has increased as the computer
industry has embraced Internet standards. The MSN-only access phone numbers
cannot support Internet connections.

To create a world-class offering on the Internet, Microsoft has decided to focus
MSN in the following countries/regions:

- Australia

- Canada

- France

- Germany

- Japan

- Switzerland

- United Kingdom

- United States of America

Outside of these countries/regions, MSN will not offer localized content or
provide Internet access.

Microsoft has negotiated an arrangement with Internet service providers (ISPs) in
some countries/regions who will offer a competitive Internet access rate to MSN
members who wish to open an account. These ISPs will also provide you with
technical assistance in setting up your software to use MSN with their Internet
service. Preferred ISPs will be available in the following countries/regions:

- Austria

- Belgium

- Denmark

- Finland

- Hong Kong

- Italy

- Korea

- Netherlands

- New Zealand

- Norway

- Portugal

- Spain

- Singapore

- South Africa

- Sweden

- Taiwan

You can access MSN content with the ISP of your choice, whether you live in one
of the above countries/regions or a country/region that does not have preferred
ISPs.

Our goal is to offer a smooth transition to the new Web-based service for our
existing members. We are doing two things to try to make this easier for you:

- Microsoft is creating a new, less expensive, membership plan for members who
  have access to MSN through an ISP. The price will be US$6.95 per month for
  unlimited use of MSN's content (you will be responsible for the ISP charges).
  The content plan will be available for this price anywhere in the world as
  long as you have access to the Internet.

- In addition, MSN will provide three months of this membership at no charge
  (but, again, you will be responsible for ISP charges) to members in affected
  countries/regions who wish to continue their membership.

As long as you have a Content plan with MSN, you can keep your current account
and member ID when using an ISP. You can also continue to send and receive
e-mail using your MSN address.
