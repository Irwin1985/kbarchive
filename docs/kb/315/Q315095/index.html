-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If multiple instances of a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) application
(for example Wbemtest.exe) are configured to repeatedly issue WMI queries
against the same Host Integration Server 2000 (HIS) server, after a while, one
or more of the instances of Wbemtest stops responding.

When this problem occurs, all of the applications that use the HIS WMI provider
will fail to return status information and will not function as expected.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Integration Server 2000 WMI provider encouters a resource deadlock that
causes all current and later WMI queries to stop responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Host Integration Server 2000 Service Pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:
