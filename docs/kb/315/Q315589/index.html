RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order presented.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please see your product documentation

Uninstall the Game
------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  "zoo.exe" (including the quotation marks).

  NOTE: The name of the executable you type in will depend on what game you have
  installed. The executable names match the following games:

  Dungeon Siege = "DungeonSiege.exe"
  Flight Simulator 2002 = "fs2002.exe"
  Train Simulator = "train.exe"

7. In the Look In box, click the hard disk on which you installed the game, and
  then click Find Now.

8. In the list of found files and folders, right-click the game executable file,
  and then click Delete.

If you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes or Yes to all.

Empty the Temp Folder

Cleanup tool. To do this, follow these steps:

Restart Your Computer by Performing a Clean Boot
------------------------------------------------

To perform a clean boot, follow the steps appropriate to your version of
Microsoft Windows.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q310353 How to Perform a Clean Boot in Windows XP

  that is listed next to the selected, unavailable check box for assistance.
