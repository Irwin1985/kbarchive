SUMMARY
=======

Web servers are the most common servers that are attacked by Internet intruders.
To minimize the negative consequences of attack, you need to plan the security
configuration of the Web server prior to implementing the Web server solution.
One of the primary planning considerations is how the Web server processes
permissions and access controls.

There are three common Web server deployment scenarios. These deployment
scenarios include:

- Users access data is located on the Web server only. There are no virtual
  directories that are located on other computers that are accessed by the Web
  server.

- Users access data is located on another computer. Data types that are
  accessed might include Microsoft Access or Microsoft SQL Server databases or
  files that are shared through a remote server file system.

- Users access data is located on other computers by way of an intermediary.
  For example: a server that is running a collection of DCOM components that
  access database or file information on remote servers.

With the Internet Information Services Security What If tool, you can determine
which authentication schemes fit best based on the following factors:

- Browser
- Client operating system
- Intranet or Internet server location
- Version and domain membership of the Internet Information Services (IIS)
  server
- Web authentication method

The security planning tool uses this information to determine which logon type is
required and provides some helpful comments regarding your chosen
configuration.

Install and Use the IIS Security Planning Tools
-----------------------------------------------

Perform the following steps to install and to use the IIS Security Planning
Tool:

1. Download the tool from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=24973
  (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=24973)

2. Open the IISPerms.exe file. In the WinZIP Self-Extractor [IISPerms.exe]
  dialog box, type "c:\IISPerms" (without the quotation marks) in the Unzip to
  Folder text box, and then click Unzip.

3. In Windows Explorer, open the IISPerms folder, and then double-click the
  IISPermissions.htm file.

4. The Internet Information Services Security What If Tool page opens. Configure
  a scenario that matches your chosen Web server and Web client environment.
  After you make your selections, click Check.

5. The tool displays the required logon type for your scenario. There may also
  be a comment that provides more details on your scenario. Under the comment,
  there is a graphical representation of working and non-working
  configurations.

There are many facets to securing a Web server of which designing the
appropriate authentication scheme is just one part. For more information about
Microsoft Web server security, please visit the following Microsoft Web site:

For a detailed explanation about why and how these scenarios work, please refer
