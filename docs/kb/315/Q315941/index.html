7. Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
  the game controller.

  NOTE: Axis 3 is the throttle control, and axis 4 is the rudder control.

8. Click Test to verify that the game controller functions properly.

9. When you finish calibrating and testing the game controller, click OK, and
  then click OK again.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce Hardware Sound Acceleration
----------------------------------

If your sound card cannot properly process game port signals and high-quality
game sounds at the same time, you may be able to work around the issue by
reducing the sound playback quality in the game. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "DXDIAG" (without the quotation marks).

3. Click OK, and then click the Sound tab.

4. Under DirectX Features, move the "Hardware Sound Acceleration Level" two
  notches to the left to Basic.

5. Click Exit.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

  use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows Millennium
Edition (Me)

  a. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

  b. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or
     Systray (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End
     Task.

     If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not
     responding, click End Task again.

  c. Repeat steps a and b to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on
     your computer.

Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows XP

  a. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Windows Task Manager.

Obtain and Install Updated Device Drivers
-----------------------------------------

If your game controller is a USB-only Sidewinder game controller, make sure that
you have installed the version 4.0 software that is specific to your device.

If your game controller is connected to the game port on your computer, download
and install the latest version of the SideWinder Game Controller software. To do
this, see the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/sidewinder/downloads/default.asp

In addition, if your game controller is connected to the game port in your sound
card, contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain
and install the latest version of the sound driver for your sound card.

For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your sound card, click
the appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Configure the Sound Card to Use Only One DMA Channel
----------------------------------------------------

If your game controller is connected to the game port in your sound card, your
game controller may perform better if you configure the sound card to use only
one DMA channel.

NOTE: Some programs cannot run with only one DMA channel. If you experience this
issue, restore your original sound card settings.

To configure a legacy sound card driver on a Microsoft Windows 95/98-based
computer or a native sound card driver on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based
computer to use single-mode DMA, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. On the Devices tab or the Advanced tab, click the plus sign next to Audio
  Devices to expand the branch.

4. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

5. Click Settings.

6. To configure the sound card to use single-mode DMA, see your sound card
  documentation, or do one of the following:

   - Click to select the "Use Single-Mode DMA" check box, click OK until
     Control Panel is displayed again, and then restart the computer.

   - In the "DMA Channel (16-bit)" box, click Disable, click OK until Control
     Panel is displayed again, and then restart the computer.

   - In the High DMA box, click Use DMA, click OK until Control Panel is
     displayed again, and then restart the computer.

  If you cannot use the sound card driver to configure single-mode DMA, click
  Cancel until Control Panel is displayed again, and then proceed to the
  "Disable Force-Feedback Effects" section of this article.

To configure a native sound card driver on a Microsoft Windows 95-based computer
or a Microsoft Windows 98-based computer to use single-mode DMA, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the plus sign next to "Sound, video and game controllers" to expand the
  branch.

5. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

6. Click the Resources tab.

7. Under Resource Type, locate the "Direct Memory Access (DMA)" lines. If you
  see more than one "Direct Memory Access (DMA)" line, configure the sound card
  for single-mode DMA. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Click to clear the Use Automatic Settings check box.

  b. In the Settings Based On box, click a Basic Configuration that uses only
     one DMA channel setting.

     If you see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box, repeat
     this step to select another basic configuration that uses only one DMA
     channel and does not conflict with any other devices.

     If you do not see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box,
     click OK, and then click Yes.

  c. Click Close, and then restart the computer.

  If you see only one "Direct Memory Access (DMA)" line, or if you cannot find a
  basic configuration that uses only one DMA channel, click Cancel, click
  Cancel again, and then proceed to the next method.

Disable Force-Feedback Effects
------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder Force Feedback Pro joystick or SideWinder Force Feedback
Wheel, disable the force-feedback effects. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Click "Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro" or "Microsoft SideWinder
  Force Feedback Wheel".

4. Click Properties.

5. On the Settings tab, drag the Force Feedback slider to the Off position.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

If the issue does not occur while the force-feedback effects are disabled, the
problem may be with the SideWinder Force-Feedback game controller. You may need
to contact Microsoft SideWinder Force-Feedback Technical Support for additional
assistance with troubleshooting your SideWinder Force-Feedback game controller.
