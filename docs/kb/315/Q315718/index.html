-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the base installation of the Systems Management Server (SMS) client, you
may receive the following error message on your Microsoft Windows XP-based
computer:

  Windows File Protection
  Files that required for Windows to run properly have been replaced by
  unrecognized versions. To maintain system stability. Windows must restore the
  original versions of these files.
  Insert your Windows XP Professional CD-ROM now.

The System Event log may contain the following informational Windows File
Protection 64005 events:

  The protected system file snmpthrd.dll was not restored to its original,
  valid version because the Windows File Protection restoration process was
  cancelled by user interaction, user name is smsadmin. The file version of the
  bad file is 1.10.698.0.

  The protected system file snmpcl.dll was not restored to its original, valid
  version because the Windows File Protection restoration process was cancelled
  by user interaction, user name is smsadmin. The file version of the bad file
  is 1.10.698.0

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the WMI SNMP Provider by using the
Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. This process copies the Windows XP
versions of the Snmpcl.dll and Snmpthrd.dll files into the Windows\System32\Wbem
folder. Because these files are a later version than the files that are included
with SMS, the SMS Wbemsdk.exe tool will not try to overwrite those files. With
SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) and later, SMS no longer tries to install these
files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMS Wbemsdk.exe tool contains version 698 of Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI), and the SMS base installation runs Wbemsdk.exe on Windows
XP-based computers that have WMI version 2600. However, before SMS 2.0 SP4,
Wbemsdk.exe would install the Snmpcl.dll and Snmpthrd.dll files before an
evaluation of the WMI version. The installation script was then stopped because
of a later version of WMI already being installed.
