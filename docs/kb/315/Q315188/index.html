The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to switch views while you are flying a plane, Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2002 may stop responding (hang).

NOTE: This behavior can also occur when you attempt to switch between any two
open windows from within Flight Simulator 2002.

To switch views, you select an existing view on the View menu, or point to View
Mode and click a view on the View menu.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you use a Kensington mouse or trackball. This is
due to a conflict between the Kensington MouseWorks program and Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2002.


NOTE: This behavior can also occur when you attempt to click on a control on the
instrument panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the Kensington MouseWorks program. To do this,
follow these steps:

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please see your product documentation
to complete these steps.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click Kensington MouseWorks in the list of installed programs, and then click
  Add/Remove.

4. When you receive a message asking whether you want to completely remove the
  selected application and all of its components, click Yes.

5. On the "Kensington MouseWorks Uninstall Complete" page that appears, click
  Finish.

  NOTE: At this point, the mouse may stop responding, and you may be unable to
  click Finish. In this case, confirm that the "Yes, I want to restart my
  computer now" option is selected (or use the UP ARROW key to select it), and
  then press ENTER.

  The computer restarts.
