The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zoo Tycoon 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Zoo Tycoon, the screen may be black. You may receive an
error message similar to the following:

  Microsoft Zoo Tycoon has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are
  sorry for the inconvenience.

If you click Click Here, a dialog box that contains the following information
about the error opens:

  Error Signature
  AppName: Zoo.exe AppVer: 10.10.0.6 ModName: Zoo.exe
  ModVer: 10.10.0.6 Offset: 0004360a

Or, when you start the game, you may see a blue screen, the program quits, and
then the desktop is displayed again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the program is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps in the order in which they are
presented.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Uninstall Zoo Tycoon
--------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. In the list of installed programs, click "Zoo Tycoon", and then click
  Add/Remove.

4. When you are prompted to uninstall the program, click Yes.

5. When the uninstall process is completed, click Start, point to Find, and then
  click "Files or Folders".

6. In the Named box, type "Zoo Tycoon" including the quotation marks.

  NOTE: If you did not install Zoo Tycoon in the default folder, type the name
  of the folder in which you installed the game.

7. In the "Look in" box, click the hard disk on which Zoo Tycoon was installed,
  and then click Find Now.

8. In the list of found files and folders, right-click the "Zoo Tycoon" folder,
  and then click Delete.

  If you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes or "Yes to all".

Empty the Temp Folder
---------------------

To empty the Temp folder, follow the appropriate steps for your version of
Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 95:

1. Click Start, and then click Shut Down.

2. Click "Restart the Computer in MS-DOS mode", and then click OK.

3. Type the following lines and press ENTER after you type each line:

  cd temp
  del *.tmp
  exit

Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me), or Microsoft Windows 2000:

To empty the Temp folder and the Temporary Internet Files folder, use the Disk
Cleanup tool. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click Disk Cleanup.

2. Click C: (the drive on which Windows is installed), and then click OK.

3. Click to select the "Temporary files" check box.

4. Click OK, and then click Yes to confirm the deletion.

Restart Your Computer with a Clean-Boot Procedure
-------------------------------------------------

Follow the appropriate steps for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Windows Me:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click "Selective startup".

3. Click to clear all of the check boxes under Selective startup.

4. On the Startup tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box.


5. Click OK. When you see the prompt to restart your computer, click Yes. After
  the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

  IMPORTANT: Look closely at the General tab to ensure that the check boxes that
  you cleared are still cleared. If none of the check boxes are selected,
  proceed to the next method. If you see a selected, unavailable check box (it
  appears dimmed and has a check mark in it), your computer is not truly
  "clean-booted" and you may need assistance from the manufacturer of the
  program that is listed next to the selected, unavailable check box.

Windows 98:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click System Information.

2. On the Tools menu, click System Configuration Utility.

3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:

   - Process Config.sys file
   - Process Autoexec.bat file
   - Process Winstart.bat file (if available)
   - Process Win.ini file
   - Load Startup group items

4. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

NOTE: To restore your original Startup options, click Normal Startup on the
General tab in the System Configuration Utility tool.

Windows 95:

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, and then select "Step By Step Confirmation" on the Startup menu.

2. Press Y at each prompt except the following two prompts. At the following two
  prompts, press N:

   - Process your startup device driver (CONFIG.SYS) [Enter=Y, Esc=N]?
   - Process your startup command file (AUTOEXEC.BAT) [Enter=Y,Esc=N]?

3. Disable any antivirus or disk tool programs that are installed on the
  computer. For information about how to disable these programs, see the
  printed or online documentation for the program.

4. Quit all running programs except Windows Explorer and Systray. To do this:

  a. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

  b. Click the program you want to quit, and then click End Task.

  c. If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not
     responding, click End Task again.

  Repeat this step until you have quit all programs except Windows Explorer and
  Systray.

NOTE: To restore your original Startup options, restart the computer normally,
and then enable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer.
For information about how to enable these programs, see the printed or online
documentation for the program.
