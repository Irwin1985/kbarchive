The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001, you cannot select a specific Pushpin set
from a group of sets, and then display it on the map. You are able to do this in
Microsoft Streets and Trips 2000.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a change in the way that Pushpin sets are
handled in Streets and Trips 2001.

Pushpin sets in Streets and Trips 2000 are saved as .stp files, and they are
separate from the map file. In Streets and Trips 2001, Pushpin sets are saved to
the map file. They are components of the map and cannot be separated from it.
This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Create a Different Map for Each Pushpin Set
-----------------------------------------------------

Create a different map for each set of Pushpins that you want to use. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Start Streets and Trips.

2. Click New on the File menu, double-click "New North American Map", and then
  click OK.

  A new map with the default map view is displayed in the map pane.

3. Create the Pushpins that you want for your new map. To do this, use any of
  the following methods:

   - Use the Import Data Wizard to import a specific list of addresses from
     another program such as Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft
     Access to your map. To start the Import Data Wizard, click Import Data on
     the File menu.

     -or-

   - Use the Import Data Wizard to import a Streets and Trips 2000 Pushpin set
     to your map. To start the Import Data Wizard, click Import Data on the
     File menu.

     -or-

   - Create the Pushpin set. To do this, follow these steps:

     a. To create a new Pushpin, click Pushpin on the Drawing toolbar.

     b. Click the exact location on the map where you want to place the
        Pushpin.

     c. In the gray bar of the text balloon, double-click Untitled, and then
        type a title for your Pushpin.

     d. In the white bar of the text balloon, type the text that you want to
        add to the Pushpin note (if any).

     e. Click X in the upper-right corner of the text balloon to close it.

     f. Repeat steps a through e to create the Pushpins that you want to
        display on the map.

The Pushpins that you create are placed in the My Pushpins set by default.

4. Click Save on the File menu.

5. In the Save As dialog box that appears, specify a name and location where you
  want to save your map, and then click Save.

Method 2: Create a Master Map That Contains All Pushpins
--------------------------------------------------------

Create one "master" map that contains all of the Pushpins that you want to use,
and then group the Pushpins into Pushpin sets. When you want to view a specific
set of Pushpins, open the map, remove the Pushpin sets that you do not want to
display on this map, and then save the map with a new name. To do this, follow
these steps:

Create the Master Map:

1. Start Streets &amp; Trips.

2. Create the Pushpins that you want for your master map. To do this, use any of
  the following methods:

   - Use the Import Data Wizard to import addresses from another program such
     as Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Access to your map. To
     start the Import Data Wizard, click Import Data on the File menu.

     -or-

   - Use the Import Data Wizard to import a Streets and Trips 2000 Pushpin set
     to your map. To start the Import Data Wizard, click Import Data on the
     File menu.

     -or-

   - Create the Pushpin set. To do this, follow these steps:

     a. To create a new Pushpin, click Pushpin on the Drawing toolbar.

     b. Click the exact location on the map where you want to place the
        Pushpin.

     c. In the gray bar of the text balloon, double-click Untitled, and then
        type a title for your Pushpin.

     d. In the white bar of the text balloon, type the text that you want to
        add (if any) to the Pushpin note.

     e. Click X in the upper-right corner of the text balloon to close it.

     f. Repeat steps a through e to create the Pushpins that you want to
        display on the map.

The Pushpins that you create are placed in the My Pushpins set by default.

3. Group the Pushpins into the Pushpin sets that you want.

  NOTE: Pushpins that are imported from external files can only be moved into
  empty Pushpin sets or sets that contain Pushpins from the same source.

  On the map, right-click the Pushpin that you want to move, click Properties,
  and then do any of the following:

   - To move a pushpin to an existing Pushpin set, click the data set to which
     you want to move the Pushpin under "Data set name", and then click OK.

     -or-

   - To move a Pushpin to a new data set, click New Data Set, then type a name
     for the new data set, and then click OK twice.

4. Click Save on the File menu.

5. In the Save As dialog box that appears, specify a name and location where you
  want to save your master map, and then click Save.

Create New Maps Based on the Master Map:

When you want to view a particular pushpin set, open the master map, and then
remove the Pushpin sets that you do not want to display on the map. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Start Streets and Trips, and open the master map that you created.

2. Under Pushpins, in the "Legend and Overview" pane, right-click the Pushpin
  set(s) that you want to remove, and then click Delete.

3. Click Save on the File menu.

4. In the Save As dialog box that appears, specify a name and location where you
  want to save your new map, and then click Save.

Method 3: Import a Specific List of Addresses to Your Map
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are importing addresses to your map from another program such as Excel,
create separate worksheets that contain a specific list of addresses for each
Pushpin set that you want to create. You can then use the Import Data Wizard to
import the list of addresses that you want to your map. To start the Import Data
Wizard, click Import Data on the File menu.
