The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, you may see one or more of the
following symptoms:

- The joystick behaves erratically.

- The joystick does not respond.

- The rudder or throttle does not respond.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following troubleshooting methods in the order in
which they are presented. After each method, test to see if the issue is
resolved. If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

NOTE: If you use a Logitech Warrior joystick, connect it to the game port. Do not
connect it to the serial port. The Logitech Warrior does not function properly
with Microsoft DirectX 5.0 or later when it is connected to a serial port.

Verify That Your Operating System Supports Your Game Controller
---------------------------------------------------------------

To enable support for the game port in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, you must install
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) or later. Windows NT 4.0 with SP3 or later
supports most analog game controllers. However, it does not support digital game
controllers.

Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98 support both analog and digital
game controllers. For best performance, verify that the latest version of the
game controller driver for your game controller is installed on your computer.

The following table contains an operating system compatibility list for Microsoft
SideWinder game controllers. The table shows the compatibility for Windows 95,
Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me), Microsoft Windows 2000,
and Microsoft Windows XP:

*** NOTE: To use a hybrid game port and Universal Serial Bus (USB) game
controller with a Windows 95-based computer, you must connect the game
controller to the game port in your computer. Windows 95 does not support USB.

NOTE: Unless otherwise indicated in the preceding table, support for all current
USB game controllers and game port/USB-only SideWinder game controllers is
included in Windows 98, Windows Me, and Windows 2000.

Check the Game Controller Connection to the Game Port
-----------------------------------------------------

If you use a game port game controller, verify that the game controller is
connected directly to the game port in your computer. "Daisy-chained" game
controllers or game port adapters can interfere with communication between the
game port and the game controller.

If you use a USB game controller, verify that the game controller is connected
properly to the USB port in your computer or to a compatible USB hub that is
connected to the USB port in your computer.

NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 does not support daisy-chained game controllers, game port
adapters, or USB game controllers.

Disable the SideWinder Game Device Profiler
-------------------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder game controller, disable the SideWinder Game Device
Profiler or SideWinder Game Controller software. To do this, right-click the
Game Device Profiler icon or the Game Controller Software icon in the status
area on the taskbar, and then click Unload or Disable.

Confirm That Your Game Controller Is Assigned to Controller ID 1
----------------------------------------------------------------

Many games do not recognize game controllers that are not assigned to Controller
ID 1. To verify that your game controller is assigned to Controller ID 1, follow
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. If the game controller that you want to use is not assigned to ID 1, click
  Change.

  If the game controller that you want to use is assigned to ID 1, proceed to
  the "Confirm the Version of SideWinder Game Controller Software" section of
  this article.

5. In the Game Controllers box, click the game controller that you want to use,
  and then click the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW to change the Selected ID value to
  1.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

7. Quit Control Panel.

Confirm the Version of SideWinder Game Controller Software
----------------------------------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder USB-only game controller, verify that SideWinder Game
Controller software version 4.0 is installed on your computer.

If you use a game port-only game controller or a hybrid game port/USB game
controller, verify that one of the following is installed on your computer:
SideWinder Game Device Profiler version 3.02 or earlier, or SideWinder Game
Controller software.

If you use both SideWinder USB-only game controllers and SideWinder game port or
hybrid game port/USB game controllers, make sure that the following are
installed on your computer: SideWinder Game Controller software version 4.0 and
SideWinder Game Controller software version 3.02 or earlier.

The following table lists the SideWinder game controllers that are supported by
each version of SideWinder Game Controller software:

Calibrate the Game Controller
-----------------------------

If you use a digital Microsoft SideWinder game controller with Microsoft
SideWinder Game Device software version 2.0 or later or Microsoft SideWinder
Game Controller software, the software calibrates the game controller
automatically.

To use Microsoft SideWinder Game Device software version 2.0 to test the
calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, and then click OK.

4. Quit Control Panel.

To use Microsoft SideWinder Game Controller software version 3.x or 4.0 to test
the calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the General tab, click the game controller that you want to test in the
  Game Controllers box, and then click Properties.

4. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, click OK, and then click OK again.

5. Quit Control Panel.

If you use an analog game controller, or if you use a Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro
or a Microsoft SideWinder game pad with SideWinder Game Device software version
1.5, you may need to calibrate the game controller manually. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Select the gaming device that you want to calibrate in the Controller column,
  and then click Properties.

4. Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
  the game controller. If you use a SideWinder 3D Pro with SideWinder software
  version 1.0, when you are prompted to press a button on the controller, press
  a button on the joystick, not on the joystick base.

  NOTE: Because of differences among analog game controllers, you may notice a
  certain amount of deviation between the graphic display for the joystick
  position and the actual joystick movement. This is normal and does not affect
  the calibration of the game controller.

5. When you receive the "You have successfully calibrated your device" message,
  click Finish.

6. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your game controller, and then
  click OK.

7. Quit Control Panel.

NOTE: No calibration option is available in SideWinder Game Device software
version 1.5 unless you install Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 with Microsoft
DirectX 5.0.

If you cannot calibrate your game controller, or if your game controller does not
function properly when you test it, Windows may be unable to communicate
properly with the game controller. If this is true, contact the manufacturer of
your game controller for information about how to configure the device correctly
in Windows. You may also need to obtain and install the latest version of the
game controller device driver.

If you calibrate and test the game controller successfully, start Flight
Simulator 2002 to test the game controller in the game. If the issue continues
to occur, calibrate the device in Flight Simulator 2002. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Start Flight Simulator 2002.

2. On the main screen, click Settings.

3. Click Calibrate Joystick.

  NOTE: If Calibrate Joystick is unavailable, click Enable Joystick, and then
  click Calibrate Joystick.

4. In the Game Controller box on the General tab, click the game controller that
  you want to use, and then click Properties.

  NOTE: The procedure may be slightly different, depending on the version of
  your operating system and which version of Microsoft Sidewinder software is
  installed.

5. On the Settings tab, move the sliders to the settings that you want, or click
  Calibrate, and then follow the instructions in the Device Calibration Wizard.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Reset the Default Actions
-------------------------

To reset the default actions assigned to the game controller, follow these
steps:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 2002.

2. On the main screen, click Settings.

3. In the Controls box, click Assignments.

4. On the Buttons/Keys tab, click Reset defaults.

5. On the Joystick Axes tab, click Reset defaults.

6. To check whether the default events are selected for your 4-axis game
  controller, verify that the Axis settings for each event match the settings
  in the following table:

  
  +----------------------------+
  | Event         | Axis       | 
  +----------------------------+
  | Elevator axis | Y          | 
  +----------------------------+
  | Ailerons axis | X          | 
  +----------------------------+
  | Rudder axis   | Z Rotation | 
  +----------------------------+
  | Throttle axis | Slider     | 
  +----------------------------+

  If the default events are not selected, proceed to the "Manually Assign
  Actions" method in part 2 of this article to assign the default events
  manually.

  To view part 2 of this article, click the article number below:

  Q315941 Flight Simulator 2002: Troubleshooting Joystick Problems (Part 2)

  If the default event is assigned to an axis, but the event behaves in reverse
  (for example, up instead of down, or right instead of left), click to select
  or clear the check box under the Reverse column for that axis.

7. Click OK.

Rebuild the Fs2002.cfg File
---------------------------

To rebuild the Fs2002.cfg file, press and hold down CTRL+SHIFT as you start
Flight Simulator and start a new flight. Continue to hold down CTRL+SHIFT until
the game is in Cockpit view.

NOTE: When you rebuild the Fs2002.cfg file, some of your joystick settings may
change.

If your game controller is installed properly and the Devices.cfg file contains
the default settings for your game controller, Flight Simulator 2002 adds the
appropriate entries for your game controller to the Fs2002.cfg file.

The Devices.cfg file contains the following joystick headings:
