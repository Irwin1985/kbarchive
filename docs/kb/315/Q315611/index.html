-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Train Simulator, you may receive an error message
similar to the following:

  Full install requires 0 mb to install.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the drive on which you install the program does not
have enough space for the program.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, free up the proper amount of hard drive space to install
the program. Or, if possible, install the program on a different drive that has
the proper amount of space.

You can use the Disk Cleanup tool to free up space on your hard drive. If this
method does not free up enough space, you may need to uninstall any unwanted
programs.

Run Disk Cleanup
----------------

Use Disk Cleanup to remove Temporary files, Temporary Internet files, and to
empty the Recycle Bin. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click Disk Cleanup.

2. In the Drives box, click the hard disk on which you want to install the
  program, and then click OK.

3. Under "Files to delete", click to select the "Temporary Internet Files" check
  box, the "Recycle Bin" check box, and the "Temporary files" check box, and
  then click OK.

4. Click Yes.

5. When the Disk Cleanup tool is finished, restart the computer, and then
  install the game.

If this method does not free up the space that is needed for a full installation,
proceed to the next method.

Use Custom Installation to Limit Routes
---------------------------------------

To do a custom installation and limit the number of routes that are installed
with the game, follow these steps:

1. Insert the installation CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive, and then follow the
  onscreen instructions until the Default Installation Options page is
  displayed.

2. Click "Customize installation options", and then click the right arrow in the
  lower-right corner of the window.

3. Click Custom, and then click the right arrow in the lower-right corner of the
  window.

4. Click to remove the x in front of the routes that are listed.

  NOTE: The space that is required is listed on the right side of this window.
  As you remove routes, this number decreases. Keep removing routes until it
  shows the amount of space your system has available. The routes that you
  remove are not available in the game.

5. After you select the routes that you want to remove, click the right arrow in
  the lower-right corner of the window, and then follow the onscreen
  instructions for the rest of the installation process.
