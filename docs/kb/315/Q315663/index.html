SUMMARY
=======

An Active Server Pages (ASP) application may make use of Component Object Model
(COM) objects in dynamic link libraries (DLLs). When such an ASP application is
running, the DLL is loaded into memory. While it is loaded in memory, Windows
locks the file so that it cannot be updated. Occasionally, you may need to
update the DLL file as part of development or maintenance processes. This
step-by-step article describes how to update DLL files from an active ASP
application.

Requirements
------------

The following items describe the recommended hardware, software, network
infrastructure, skills and knowledge, and service packs that you need:

- Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or later
- Familiarity with IIS site management, and the creation of in-process DLL COM
  components

Determine if Site is Running In-Process or Out-of-Process
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Run the Internet Service Manager. To do this with Windows NT 4.0 and Internet
  Information Server (IIS) 4.0, click Start, click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack,
  click Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet Service
  Manager. The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) appears.

2. In the left pane, expand the Internet Information Server node.

3. Select the node that corresponds to the name of the computer that hosts IIS.

4. Select the Web site that this computer hosts. By default, each IIS
  installation has one site named Default Web Site, although the site
  administrator may have changed this.

5. Select the virtual directory for the application that contains the DLL.
  Right-click the directory and then click Properties.

6. Locate the Run in separate memory space (isolated process) check box. If this
  check box is selected, the application is running out-of-process. If this
  check box is not selected, the application is running in-process.

Update a DLL in an Out-of-Process Site
--------------------------------------

To update a DLL in a site that is run out-of-process, unload the DLL from memory
by clicking Unload in the Properties dialog box for the site. After you unload
the DLL, the DLL file is no longer locked and may be updated as required. The
new DLL is loaded as soon as the next browser client makes a request on the Web
application that involves the COM component or components of the DLL.

Update a DLL in an In-Process Site
----------------------------------

If the site is running in-process, you can update the DLL by using either the
Control Panel Services applet or a command prompt. Note that you must stop all
of IIS before you can update the DLL.

To update the DLL by using the Control Panel Services applet, follow these
steps:

1. Stop IIS. To do this, click Start, click Settings, click Control Panel, and
  then double-click Services. Select IIS Admin Service and click Stop. When you
  are prompted to stop any extra services, such as the World Wide Web
  Publishing Service, click OK.

2. Update the DLL file.

3. Restart IIS. To do this, click Start, click Settings, click Control Panel,
  and then double-click Services. Select IIS Admin Service and then click
  Start. Select World Wide Web Publishing Service and then click Start.

To update the DLL by using a command prompt, follow these steps:

1. Stop IIS. To do this, open a command prompt window and type "net stop
  iisadmin /y" (without the quotation marks).

2. Update the DLL file.

3. Restart IIS from the command line. To do this, open a command prompt window
  and type the following commands:

  net start iisadmin
  net start w3svc

Troubleshooting
---------------

The net stop iisadmin /y command stops all services that depend on IISAdmin.
These services may include the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) service and
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, depending on your configuration. If these
services are needed, you may need to include the net start msftpsvc and net
start smtpsvc commands to restart the services.
