-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator on a Microsoft
Windows 2000-based computer, the program may appear to stop responding (hang),
or it may take up to 10 minutes to start. This behavior occurs after the Combat
Flight Simulator splash screen is displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when a component of the McAfee antivirus software
McShield is running on your computer. This occurs because of a conflict between
McShield and Combat Flight Simulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, temporarily stop McShield before you start Combat Flight
Simulator. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Quit Combat Flight Simulator, if it is already running on your computer.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Administrative Tools.

4. Double-click Computer Management.

5. In the Computer Management dialog box, double-click Services and
  Applications, and then click Services.

6. In the right pane of the Computer Management dialog box, locate McShield in
  the leftmost column.

7. On the Action menu, click Stop. Service Control dialog box will be displayed
  while Windows is attempting to stop McShield.

8. Start Combat Flight Simulator.

NOTE: This procedure stops McShield until you restart it by using the following
steps, or until you restart your computer. During this time, the automatic virus
scan is disabled and, therefore, your computer may be vulnerable to viruses.

To restart McShield and enable the automatic virus scan after you finish playing
the game, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Administrative Tools.

3. Double-click Computer Management.

4. In the Computer Management window, double-click "Services and Applications",
  and then click Services.

5. Click McShield in the leftmost column of the right pane in the Computer
  Management window.

6. On the Action menu, click Start.
