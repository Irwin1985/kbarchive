SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the differences between Windows for Workgroups Mail and
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

The Workgroup postoffice architecture is similar to the architecture for
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This is so users with connectivity needs beyond
their workgroup can easily upgrade.

The postoffice structure and Windows client are identical except for the
following:

- No Demo files are in the workgroup postoffice. Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
  does include these files.

- There is no spell checker with Windows for Workgroups Mail. The spell checker
  is supplied with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

- The postoffice in Windows for Workgroups does not support connections to
  external postoffices or gateways. For example, a Windows for Workgroups
  postoffice cannot connect to another postoffice or gateway.

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes support for global aliases or network
  group names while Windows for Workgroups Mail does not.

- The default ADMIN.TPL and ADMIN.INF files in Windows for Workgroups Mail are
  created with predefined user information in the workgroup postoffice. For
  example, the user templates included in Windows for Workgroups Mail contain
  template information regarding Phone number #1, Phone number #2, Office,
  Department, and Notes. These must be created separately in Microsoft Mail for
  PC Networks.

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration program not created
  in Windows for Workgroups Mail. In Windows for Workgroups, the administration
  program is accessed via the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client.

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration utility that is
  used to administer and configure the postoffice. The ADMIN.EXE program can be
  used to configure and administer the postoffice from any workstation on the
  network running MS-DOS. In Windows for Workgroups, the administration program
  is accessed via the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client. Only the
  administrator can log on under his or her account and administer the
  postoffice on the workstation only.

- The Mail client included with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
  is designed to work with Microsoft At Work PC Fax. However, At Work Fax is
  not supported with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.
