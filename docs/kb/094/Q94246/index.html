SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft LAN Manager TCP/IP stack has configurable parameters to select the
number of NetBIOS sessions and TCP connections available. The parameters are
configurable because each connection requires MS-DOS memory for buffering data
and memory is often tight. When a TCP connection is closed, there is a short
delay before the same connection can be used again.

This can create an interesting situation for LAN Manager MS-DOS clients using
logon scripts with many TCP connections. If you are already logged on and enter

  " net logon user password /y" (without the quotation marks)

some of the old connections may still be pending when the script attempts to log
you on and establish new ones. In some instances, this can result in errors,
including "DOS error 53".

SYMPTOMS
========

A "DOS error 53" or "bad username or password" error is displayed when you
re-log on, or a long pause may occur when you executing batch files that connect
and disconnect to many resources.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because LAN Manager adheres to RFC 793 and RFC 1122, which
stipulate how TCP connections are to be closed in systems configured with
insufficient TCP connections. This method is best explained by the following
excerpt from RFC 1122, Section 4.2.2.13:

  A TCP connection may terminate in two ways: (1) the normal TCP close sequence
  using a FIN handshake, and (2) an "abort" in which one or more RST segments
  are sent and the connection state is immediately discarded. If a TCP
  connection is closed by the remote site, the local application MUST be
  informed whether it closed normally or was aborted.

The normal TCP close sequence delivers buffered data reliably in both directions.
Because the two directions of a TCP connection are closed independently, it is
possible for a connection to be "half closed," (that is, closed in only one
direction), and a host is permitted to continue sending data in the open
direction on a half-closed connection.

A host MAY implement a "half-duplex" TCP close sequence, so an application that
has called CLOSE cannot continue to read data from the connection. If such a
host issues a CLOSE call while received data is still pending in TCP, or if new
data is received after CLOSE is called, its TCP should send an RST to show that
data was lost.

When a connection is closed actively, it MUST linger in TIME-WAIT state for a
time 2xMSL (maximum segment lifetime). However, it MAY accept a new SYN from the
remote TCP to reopen the connection directly from TIME- WAIT state, if it:

- Assigns its initial sequence number for the new connection to be larger than
  the largest sequence number it used on the previous connection incarnation

and

- Returns to TIME-WAIT state if the SYN turns out to be an old duplicate

RESOLUTION
==========

MS-DOS systems using TCP/IP may need to be configured for extra TCPCONNECTIONS
in the PROTOCOL.INI file to prevent exhausting this resource. Alternatively, to
re-logon you may "net logoff" first, wait 5 seconds, then "net logon".

  The parameter TCPCONNECTIONS defaults to (NBSESSIONS + 1 + NUMSOCKETS +
  NSESSIONS).

  * NBSESSIONS = The number of NetBIOS sessions, defaults to 6.
  * NUMSOCKETS = The number of sockets, only present if Microsoft TCP/IP
  Utilities for LAN Manager are installed, defaults to 8 in 2.1 and 2.1a, 4 in
  2.2. This parameter is set in TCPUTILS.INI.

  * NSESSIONS = The number of telnet connections, only present if Microsoft
  TCP/IP Utilities for LAN Manager are installed, defaults to 2. This parameter
  is set in TCPUTILS.INI.

Thus, systems with the utilities default TCPCONNECTIONS to 17, which is usually
adequate. Systems without the utilities default to 7, which is often too low for
heavy network users.

TCPCONNECTIONS is best adjusted by altering one of the above parameters. In LAN
Manager 2.1, 2.1a, and 2.2, TCPCONNECTIONS itself can be set in PROTOCOL.INI,
but Microsoft may remove it as a configurable parameter in a future version.
Therefore you should alter one of the other parameters and let TCPCONNECTIONS be
determined by the formula.
