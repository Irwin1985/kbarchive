SUMMARY
=======

The Super VideoWindows and TV-VideoWindows video capture cards from New Media
Graphics must be configured to utilize hardware interrupt 10 to work correctly
under Video for Windows. If this interrupt is not selected you will receive the
following error message when you attempt to capture video using the VidCap
utility.

  No frames were captured, confirm that vertical sync interrupts are configured
  and enabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following excerpt is from the release notes provided with Video for
Windows:

==============================================
New Media Graphics Driver
==============================================

This release includes a video capture driver that works with the Microsoft
Video for Windows software.

The Super VideoWindows board is installed through INSTALL.EXE, supplied by
New Media Graphics. Once you've run this program another accessory,
VCONFIG.EXE, is used to configure and adjust the colors for the board. Use
the other supplied accessory, VDEV.EXE, to check the installation.

After you've run these accessories to install the board, use the Control
Panel Drivers option to install the SuperVideo Windows video capture driver
included on this disk. Choose the Add button and select Unlisted Or Updated
Driver to install the correct driver. There is one driver compatible with
all versions of Super VideoWindows and TV-VideoWindows.

Once the driver is installed, you may use the AVI capture program VidCap to
capture frames, sequences of frames, or capture video in real time.

If you have an earlier SVW-ISA card, you may not be able to use the real-
time video capture feature of the VidCap program. See below.

After installation and setup is complete, you may want to check to see that
NMGSVW.DLL and NMGSVW.INI are both in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

Note: The Super VideoWindows board uses INT 10 only. If you want to change
the I/O port address for the card, you must use the Control Panel Driver's
option, the VCONFIG.EXE utility, and then restart the machine.

If you have any problems or questions about the SVW capture driver, please
call the New Media Graphics technical support department at (508) 663-0666.

All Cards
---------

In order to use the AVI Video Sequence capture feature, you must enable the
interrupt jumper on the board. The number and location of the jumper varies
from board to board. Refer to the board specific directions below. Use an
unused jumper block from the I/O address selection jumper to enable the
interrupt.

SVW-ISA, SVW-CM
---------------

The interrupt jumper is labeled JP18 and is located above and to the left
of the edge fingers on the bottom of the card, when looking at the top of
the board.

Note: Some earlier revisions of the Super VideoWindows board may not
support interrupts. These boards are marked REV 2A, REV 2B, or REV 2E. They
can capture single frames, but cannot capture a sequence of frames in real
time.

SVW SL, TV-VideoWindows
-----------------------

The interrupt jumper is labeled JP13, and is located above the shorter row
of the card edge fingers when looking at the top of the board.
