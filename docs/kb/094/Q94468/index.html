The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Netware Global Messaging (NGM) is the update Novell has released to MHS 1.5.
Even though NGM handles messages in a manner similar to MHS, the procedure to
install the Gateway is different.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All gateways that support the Simple Message Format (SMF) 70 Specification are
compatible with NGM. The Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS version 3.0 was written
to this specification. However, because NGM was released after the gateway, the
information in this article was not subject to the normal pre- release testing
and beta cycle procedures which were in place for MHS 1.5.

Chapter 8 of the NGM Administration Manual, titled "SMF Gateways, Non-
Participating, Passive, and Indirectly Accessed Servers," deals with installing
gateways such as the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0. To install the
gateway, follow the procedure on page 8-22 titled "Establishing Connectivity
with Indirectly-Accessible Messaging Servers."

Note the section on GWDEMON, a separate component that must run on a workstation
to support a gateway. GWDEMON is required by any gateway that uses the inpost,
outpost method to submit messages to MHS. GWDEMON acts similarly to the
Connectivity Manager in MHS 1.5. Page 8-24 of the NGM Administration Manual
describes the GWDEMON application.

In the process of defining the SMF Gateway in the New SMF Gateway Information
form (documented on page 8-25 of the NGM manual), the following fields are
equivalent to those in MHS 1.5:

- Gateway NGM Short Name: an 8 letter address, equivalent to the gateway Host
  Name in MHS 1.5

- Command Line: accepts the command line switches documented on page 19 of the
  "Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS Administrator's Guide" for version 3.0.

- SMF Version: Must contain the value 70.

After completing this information, the installation program creates a new set of
directories in the MHS\MAIL\GATES\&lt;GATENAME&gt; directory, where
&lt;GATENAME&gt; is replaced by the gateway host name. This directory contains
five subdirectories, as follows:

IN      Holds messages from Microsoft Mail to NGM

OUT     Holds messages from NGM to Microsoft Mail

IPARCEL Holds attachment files that correspond to messages in the IN
       subdirectory

OPARCEL Holds attachment files that correspond to messages in the OUT
       subdirectory

PUBLIC  Holds the executable files (put INPOST.EXE and OUTPOST.EXE
       here)

After these directories are available, run GWDEMON and Microsoft Mail can
communicate with NGM.
