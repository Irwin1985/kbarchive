The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The LMLogon= setting in the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file determines
functionality in Windows for Workgroups and Workgroup Connections with a LAN
Manager Domain.

Workgroup Connections requires the LMLogon=YES switch for functionality. This is
different from the way Control Panel in Windows for Workgroups adds this switch.
Any modifications made through the Control Panel Network interface within
Windows for Workgroups set the LMLogon value to Zero (0) or one (1).

There is a problem when this setting is equal to "YES" (altered by Workgroup
Connections). The LAN Manager Settings dialog box in the Windows for Workgroups
Control Panel, Network, Networks Options, does not show Log On To LAN Manager
Domain as selected. In other words, the check box appears to not be selected.
However, Windows for Workgroups behaves as if the Log On To LAN Manager Domain
is selected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LAN Manager Settings dialog box in Control Panel, Network, Networks Options,
Settings does not display a check in the box next to Log On To LAN Manager
Domain if LMLogon=YES is specified in the [network] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file. If this box is selected in Control Panel, the SYSTEM.INI setting are
changed to LMLogon=1 and LAN Manager validation is enabled.

It is possible to be logged on and validated by a LAN Manager server that is
password protected and never be prompted for a password. This can happen if you
are using LAN Manager validation and either LMLogon=1 or LMLogon=YES. However if
you are using LMLogon=YES, Control Panel never indicates that LAN Manager has
been loaded. This can make it seem as if Windows for Workgroups is allowing
unsecured access to a secure server. In actuality, you have been properly
validated and the password is part of the password cache.

It is also possible to never type in a password, not even a Windows for
Workgroups password, and have access to a LAN Manager server that is password
protected. In this situation, the Windows for Workgroups password was originally
entered as null (enter key), then password caching was selected, and at some
point the LAN Manager password was typed in and recorded as part of the cache.
With validation turned on and LMLogon=1 or LMLogon=YES, you can gain access to
the server without typing any password. As above, you would receive no
indication that LAN Manager had been loaded if LMLogon=YES.

NOTE: When null is entered as the Windows for Workgroups password, the prompt to
logon to Windows for Workgroups is bypassed.
