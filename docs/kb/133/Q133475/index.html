The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Directory Replicator service fails to start. The Event Viewer logs error
7023 or 7024.

CAUSE
=====

The following errors can result when the registry information fails to properly
register the settings, or from user error when inputting the desired settings in
Server Manager while setting up Directory Replication.

Errors Establishing Import and Export Paths
-------------------------------------------

If you input a nonexistent path (for example, misspell the desired path) when you
establish the Import and Export paths for Directory Replication in the Server
Manager properties setup screen, the following errors appear when you try to
exit the Replication Properties dialog box as the system tries to start the
Directory Replicator service:

  The system cannot find the file specified.

  -or-

  The system cannot find the path specified.

If you then start the Directory Replicator service from the Services in Control
Panel, these same errors are more clearly reported:

  The Directory Replicator service terminated with the following error: Error
  0002: The system cannot find the file specified.

  -or-

  The Directory Replicator service terminated with the following error: Error
  0003: The system cannot find the path specified.

NOTE: Each error is logged in the system log with the following status:

  Event ID: 7023
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: The Directory Replicator service terminated with the following
  error:

  The system cannot find the file specified.

Managed Directory Information Is Deleted or Corrupted
-----------------------------------------------------

If the Managed directory information is deleted or corrupted in the Registry, the
following error occurs when you try change the Managed directory information by
selecting the Manage button, or try to exit the Replication Properties dialog
box as Windows NT tries to start the Directory Replicator service:

  The Data is Invalid

This error is reported more clearly if you try to start the Directory Replicator
service from Services in the Control Panel:

  Stop
  Could not start the Directory Replicator Service on \\&lt;machine name&gt;.
  Error 0013: The Data is Invalid

In short, the data in the Registry no longer matches the data being used when
starting the Replicator Service from within Server manager.

This problem can also occur when you do not stop and restart the Server Manager
applet after making registry entry changes to the specified paths being used for
replication.

NOTE: This error is logged in the system log with the following status:

  Event ID: 7023
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: The Directory Replicator service terminated with the following
  error:

  The data is invalid.

Error Occurs After You Delete Subkeys
-------------------------------------

If you try to correct errors from within the registry by simply deleting the
following subkeys from the System key under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree,
additional errors occur:

  CurrentControlSet
  Services
  Replicator
  Imports
  Exports

If Imports and /r Exports are deleted and or corrupted, the following errors
appear when you try to exit the Replication Properties dialog box as the system
tries to start the Directory Replicator service:

  The Specified Component could not be found in the configuration information.

This error is reported more clearly if you try to start the Directory Replicator
service from Services in the Control Panel:

  Stop
  Could not start the Directory Replicator Service on \\&lt;machine name&gt;.
  Error 2146: The Specified Component could not be found in the configuration
  information

NOTE: This error is logged in the system log with the following status:

  Event ID: 7024
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: The Directory Replicator service terminated with service-
  specific error 2146.

RESOLUTION
==========

To properly correct corruption:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Make sure that Server Manager is not running.

2. Open Control Panel, double-click the Services icon, and set the startup
  parameter for the Replicator service to Manual.

3. Stop the Directory Replicator service on the specified computer.

4. Edit the following HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree Registry entries and then close
  Registry Editor:

  a. In the System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Exports key, delete
     all values. For example, delete Scripts and its string value.

  b. In the System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Imports key, delete
     all values. For example, delete Scripts and its string value.

  c. In the System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Replicator\Parameters key, under
     the value ExportPath, set the string to &lt;drive&gt;:\.(The valid path to
     the directories in question).

  d. In the same key, under the value ImportPath, set the string to
     &lt;drive&gt;:\.(The valid path to the directories in question).

  e. In the same key, delete both the ImportList name and the string value.

5. From the Server Manager Replication Properties setup screen:

  a. Reset the appropriate Export and Import Directories, usually
     &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt35\System32\Repl\Export and
     &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt35\System32\Repl\Import.

  b. Reset the Manage Export and Manage Import Directory options as needed. You
     usually need to add the subdirectory scripts.

  c. Add the appropriate Import Servers and Export Servers to the list boxes.

6. Try to close the Replication Properties Setup Screen. This should start the
  Directory Replicator service on the current computer.

Make sure the Startup account is set as the Replicator, and that it is properly
set up, and that the domain has been synchronized. Replication should begin to
take place.
