SUMMARY
=======

REQTRANS.GLB is the directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) transaction file that
contains the transactions from that postoffice. Each transaction has a
transaction number or sync number associated with it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run REQMAIN -t, a requestor sends out the following:

- A status message with an attachment. The header on the status line reads

  Status report from NET/PO

  The attachment that goes with this message is the DSSERVER.LOG from the
  requestor postoffice. The information from this log is used to update the
  CENTRAL.LOG on the Dir-Sync server (this is why the information in the
  CENTRAL.LOG is always a day behind).

- If there are updates, another message is sent out with an attachment. The
  attachment contains actual transactions. The header from the message reads

  REQTX R=x(was y)....z sent

  The x is the sync number of the last transaction being sent (picked up from
  REQTRANS.GLB). The y is the last acknowledged number picked up from
  REQCONF.GLB. The z is the number of actual transactions being sent this
  cycle, thus, x=y+z.

Having transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB alone does not mean that there are
updates to be sent.

If there are transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB with transaction numbers higher
than the last confirmed REQSYNC number (recorded in REQCONF.GLB), it means that
there are updates to be sent.

If there are transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB with transaction numbers lower than
the last confirmed REQSYNC number (recorded in REQCONF.GLB), they are not deemed
to be new updates because, according to the REQCONF.GLB, these transactions were
sent and even acknowledged by the Dir- Sync server. Typically, this is when you
would get a "No Updates to Send" message even when there are updates.

Initially, there is a zero byte REQTRANS.GLB. As users are added to Dir- Sync,
the transactions are added to REQTRANS.GLB starting with transaction numbers 1,
2 and so on. If the updates are sent to the server and acknowledged by the
server, the requestor processes the acknowledgment during T3, when REQMAIN -r is
run. The REQCONF.GLB is updated, and all transactions in the REQTRANS.GLB with
sequence numbers below the number in the acknowledgment are discarded. A 49 byte
REQTRANS.GLB file is left, and all it contains is the last confirmed REQSYNC
number.
