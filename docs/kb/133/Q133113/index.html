SUMMARY
=======

A Systems Management Server Site Control File is an ASCII text file containing
the complete configuration information for a particular Systems Management
Server Site Server. The Site Configuration Manager uses this file as its
exclusive means of input on how to control the Systems Management Server
Executive, and the rest of the system. Site control files are the primary means
of communication between the Systems Management Server Administrator, the
Hierarchy Manager, and the Site Configuration Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Site control files contain configuration information for a site. The Site Config
Manager makes the site configuration match, if possible, what is requested in
the site control file. In other words, the site control file represents the
desired configuration for a site. The site control files exist in the following
forms:

  ACTUAL (1)
  PROPOSED (2)
  NEWSITE (3)
  TRANSACTIONS (4)
  LOCALTRANSACTIONS (6)

The file type is specified by the first integer field in the file after the
BEGIN_FILE_DEFINITION keyword at the start of every site control file. The
integer type for each is specified above. This document uses the logical names,
not the integer values.

Typically, there will be a site control file named SITECTRL.CT0 in the
SITE.SRV\SITECFG.BOX directory at all times after Setup has completed
installation of the site server. This file is referred to as the master site
control file. This file contains a backup of the most recent site control file
submitted to the Site Configuration Manager. It represents the most recent
proposed configuration for the site. It is present only for backup, error
recovery, and documentation purposes and is not used in processing. It can
usually be used to repair a damaged site configuration. Always make a copy of
this file before doing any examination or editing, and work with the copy if
possible.

Site control files are stored in two ways: as actual files in the
SITE.SRV\SITECFG.BOX and as database images manipulated by the Systems
Management Server Administrator and the Hierarchy Manager at primary sites. The
SiteControl table in the SQL database maintains complete images of site control
files. These are kept in pairs: an ACTUAL and a PROPOSED for each site in the
database. These are referred to as site control images in this article.

The Site Configuration Manager reads all site control files that have a *.CT1
extension and uses these files as a basis for reconfiguring the site. Typically,
these files are PROPOSED files, containing the proposed new configuration for
the site, which may or may not be possible to implement. TRANSACTIONS or
LOCALTRANSACTIONS files can also be used to provide specific, one-time
instructions to the Site Configuration Manager. Actions based on these files may
be acknowledged after they have been performed, depending on the nature of the
action.

The Site Configuration Manager replies using a site control file with a *.CT2
extension. These replies are read by the Hierarchy Manager. These are usually
ACTUAL Site Control Files, but may also be TRANSACTIONS or LOCALTRANSACTIONS
file in some cases (during system shutdown and system upgrades).

The Hierarchy Manager reads all files that have a .CT2 extension. These files are
usually ACTUAL files received from the Site Configuration Manager that contain
the status of the site after having completed the most recent proposed changes.
CT2 files may also arrive from other Hierarchy Managers from sites lower in the
site tree. Hierarchy Managers communicate among each other with .CT2 files to
signal changes in the site hierarchy.

Files of type NEWSITE are used by the Systems Management Server Administrator and
by Setup to instruct the Hierarchy Manager to begin creation of a new site,
either locally or remotely. They remain in the database for emergency recovery
and history purposes, but are not used during normal processing once the site is
operational.

Files of type TRANSACTIONS contain specific instructions and not general
configuration information. They are typically used to instruct other Hierarchy
Managers up the site tree to make a change in the site hierarchy.

Files of type LOCALTRANSACTIONS are used within a site between the Site Config
Manager and the Hierarchy Manager or Setup to upgrade or deinstall a site. The
concept "local" means that the transactions are for use within the site rather
than between sites.

All Site Control files are created and processed in the SITE.SRV\SITECFG.BOX
directory. The .CT1 extension indicates an input file for the Site Configuration
Manager, and a .CT2 extension indicates an input file for the Hierarchy Manager.
