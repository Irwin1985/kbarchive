SUMMARY
=======

This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Plus! for Windows
95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. I enabled the Smooth Edges Of Screen Fonts feature, but I do not see any
  difference. What does this feature do and how can I tell if I am using it?

  A. This feature fills the jagged edges of fonts with pixels of an intermediate
  color to make the edges look smoother. You need a Windows 95 video driver
  using more than 256 colors to use this feature.

  To see if the feature is working, type some large text in Paint and save it.
  Do this again with the Smooth Edges Of Screen Fonts option turned off. Open
  both files and position them so you can see both. On the View menu, point to
  Zoom, then click Large Size. Compare the two documents.

2. Q. I enabled the Show Windows Contents While Dragging feature, but it does
  not work for all programs. Why?

  A. Many programs simulate window dragging by drawing a ghost rectangle and
  then moving the window when the mouse button is released. These programs
  bypass the code that implements the Show Windows Contents While Dragging
  feature and continue to function as they were originally written.

3. Q. I installed animated icons, but they are black and white and do not work.
  Why?

  A. The following requirements must be met for animated icons to work
  correctly:

   - You must be using protected-mode disk drivers.

   - You must be using a Windows 95 video driver that meets certain criteria.
     Not all Windows 95 video drivers support animated icons.

  For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q123334 Requirements for Animated Cursors

4. Q. My Microsoft Plus! screen saver does not display the entire screen. I
  enabled the "Stretch desktop wallpaper to fit the screen" feature but it does
  not help. What is wrong?

  A. Nothing is wrong. The amount of detail displayed depends on the video
  resolution you are using. For example, if you are using a 640 x 480
  resolution, less of the screen is displayed than if you use a 1024 x 768
  resolution. To determine which resolution you are using, follow these steps:

  1. Use the right mouse button to click the desktop, then click Properties on
     the menu that appears.

  2. Click the Settings tab.

  3. Check the Desktop Setting area.

5. Q. When I upgraded my hard disk to DriveSpace 3, the amount of space used on
  my compressed drive increased. Why?

  A. Microsoft Plus! supports storing up to two gigabytes (GB) of data on a
  compressed drive. Earlier versions of DriveSpace and DoubleSpace support
  storing only 512 megabytes (MB). To accomplish this increase in capacity, the
  compressed drive's reported cluster size has been increased from 8K to 32K.

  The smallest file allocation table (FAT) unit is one cluster. On a typical
  hard disk (between 250 and 500 MB), the cluster size is 8K. On such a drive,
  a 1-byte file uses a single cluster, leaving 7999 bytes unused. This unused
  space is called slack space. Moving a 1-byte file from a drive with 8K
  clusters to a drive with 32K clusters results in greater slack space and
  greater reported used disk space. To maintain compatibility, DriveSpace 3
  drives must report the increased slack space.

6. Q. I compressed my hard disk with DriveSpace 3 and now my MS-DOS-based
  programs do not have enough memory to run in MS-DOS mode. How can I get
  enough memory to run these programs?

  A. To support the enhanced compression capabilities in Microsoft Plus!, the
  compression driver uses more conventional memory.

  Microsoft Plus! includes a wizard to help you create a boot disk that does not
  load the real-mode compression driver. To start this wizard, run the
  Nocomp.exe tool from the Program Files\Plus!\System folder.

7. Q. There is a folder on my hard disk called ~MSSETUP.T. Do I need to keep
  this folder?

  A. This folder is used while you are setting up Microsoft Plus!. It is not
  needed after Setup is finished so you can remove it.

8. Q. I ran the Internet Setup Wizard and now I no longer have a local telephone
  number to access The Microsoft Network. Why?

  A. The Microsoft Network uses two sets of telephone access numbers. One set
  provides access to The Microsoft Network, while the other set provides access
  to the Internet and to The Microsoft Network. If you have only one access
  number, your area may not have a number for accessing the Internet and The
  Microsoft Network.

9. Q. Why can I not save the password for my Internet service provider after I
  install Microsoft Plus!?

  A. You cannot save your password if the password cache feature is not
  enabled.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q137361 Save Password Check Box is Unavailable

10. Q. The Internet Setup Wizard replaced the DNS configuration settings on my
  computer. Why?

  A. Windows 95 supports only three DNS entries, so the Internet Setup Wizard
  replaces existing entries as necessary.
