SUMMARY
=======

This article lists frequently asked question about e-mail on The Microsoft
Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

STEPS
TYPE='ORDERED'&gt; - Q. How does someone on the Internet address e-mail to me at my account on The
  Microsoft Network?

  A. Your address is:

  &lt;your member ID&gt;@email.msn.com

  where &lt;your member ID&gt; is your member ID. For example, if your member ID
  was johndoe, your address would be:

  johndoe@email.msn.com

  NOTE: The address is not case sensitive.

- Q. How do I address e-mail?

  A. You have three options:

- Enter an Internet address name listed in your personal address book in the
  To, Cc, or Bcc boxes.

- Type the Internet address directly in the To, Cc, or Bcc boxes using the
  format:

  alias@service.com

  This address is processed as an SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) address,
  which The Microsoft Network supports for Internet mail.

- Enter an Internet address in either the To, Cc, or Bc boxes in either of the
  following formats:

  [INTERNET: alias@service.com]

  The Microsoft Network supports the POP3 format.

  The MSNINET format is guaranteed to be sent over The Microsoft Network because
  this type is unique to The Microsoft Network.

- Q. If I have a problem sending e-mail from The Microsoft Network to other
  addresses, where can I get help?

  A. Go to http://memberservices.msn.com/us. From there you can find Frequently
  Asked Questions, and contact information: e-mail, chat, and phone.

- Q. Can I send attachments with outbound e-mail messages?

  A. Yes. When you send mail from The Microsoft Network over the Internet,
  attachments included in the message are converted automatically to a
  UUENCODED format for transmission. When you receive mail from the Internet
  with UUENCODED attachments, the attachments are automatically converted to a
  standard Microsoft Network attachment.

- Q. Is there a limit on the size of The Microsoft Network e-mail messages
  (including attachments)?

  A. E-mail messages cannot be larger than 3 MB (including attachments). If a
  message is larger, it is sent back to your Inbox with an explanation.

  Note that this measurement is based on the compressed size of the message as
  it is handled by The Microsoft Network. It is therefore possible to send a
  message with a large size as reported by Outlook Express's Outbox folder,
  because the message is not yet compressed. The parts compressed are the
  attachments, objects, and messages inserted using the Message command on the
  Insert menu. The text body is not compressed.

  Internet messages received by The Microsoft Network are also limited to 3 MB.
  (Internet mail is not compressed because attachments are text encoded using
  UUENCODE.) If a message received from the Internet exceeds 3 MB, The
  Microsoft Network sends the appropriate error code to the sending service. It
  is that service's responsibility to inform the sender that the message was
  not sent.

- Q. Is there a quick way to add a person who sent me e-mail to my personal
  address book?

  A. Use the right mouse button to click the name in the From field, and then
  click Add To Personal Address Book on the menu that appears.

- Q. How can different members of my family get different addresses for
  e-mail?

  A. All members of your family will need separate accounts to send and receive
  mail in their own names. To keep the incoming mail separate (with more than
  one user on a computer), you need to set up a separate mail profile for each
  user.

  Your family members can also sign up for free e-mail accounts using the
  Web-based Hotmail e-mail service. For more information about how to use
  Hotmail with MSN, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q185416 Frequently Asked Questions About Hotmail

- Q. If I have more than one profile, can I make Outlook Express prompt me for
  the profile I want to use?

  A. YOu can have multiple identities in Outlok Ecpress. It is possible to have
  a default identity and then switch identities during a session. It is also
  possible to have Outlook Express prompt you for an identity when it opens. To
  do this:

  1. Click File, select Identities, and then click Manage Identities.

  2. Make certain that the check box by Use this identity when starting a program
  is clear, and click Close.

  3. When you exit Outlook Express, be sure to Log Off. Click File and then click
  Exit and Log Off Identity.

  4. If the Outlook Express page is in the right window, you can also click
  Identities in the top right corner and then click Log Off Your_Identity.

  If you do not log off, the identity you were using when you exited will appear
  when you re-start the program.

- Q. Can I read mail from one computer but later retrieve that mail from
  another computer?

  A. Yes. YOu need to leave a copy of your files on the server. Follow these
  steps:

  1. Click Tools, and then Accounts.

  2. Click the Mail tab, select the mail account, and then click Properties.

  3. Click the Advanced tab, check the check box by Leave a copy of messages on
  server, and then click Apply.

  4. Click OK, and then click Close.

- Q. How can I add my signature to an e-mail message?

  A. Follow these steps:

  1. Compose a new mail message and create a signature in the body.

  2. Highlight the signature.

  3. On the Tools menu, click Auto Signature.

- Q. What is the capacity of my mailbox on the MSN mail servers?

1. A. 10 megabytes (regardless of the capacity of the mailbox, messages are
  deleted when they are more than 30 days old).
