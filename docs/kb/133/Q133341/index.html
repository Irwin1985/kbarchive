INTRODUCTION
============

The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) version 2.0 Service
Pack contains three custom controls (.OCX files) that replace the
existing custom controls in your Microsoft ADT directory
(C:\ACCESS\ADT or C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS\ADT). The Service Pack includes
the latest version of the following custom controls:

- Calendar Control (MSACAL20.OCX version 1.0.002 dated 8/21/95)

- Scrollbar Control (MSASB20.OCX version 1.0.002  dated 8/21/95)

- Data Outline Control (OUTL1016.OCX version 1.0.013 dated 8/21/95)

The updated custom controls correct the general protection fault that
may occur if you use the original custom controls in Windows(R) 95 or
Windows NT(TM) version 3.51.

INSTALLATION
============

If they are running, quit the ADT and Microsoft Access, and then copy
the files from the WX1200.exe to your C:\ACCESS\ADT (or C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS\ADT) directory.

&lt;B&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/B&gt;: When you install the updated custom controls, make sure
that you replace the original .OCX files with the newer files. If
you have two versions of the same custom controls in your Microsoft
ADT directory, you may experience problems when you use the custom
controls in Microsoft Access.

After you install the updated custom controls, you should reregister
them and their supporting dynamic link library (OC1016.DLL). To
register a custom control or OC1016.DLL, follow the steps for your
operating system.

For Microsoft Windows 95
------------------------

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. In the Open text box, type a command similar to the following line:

     c:\application\msareg.exe c:\application\control.ocx

  For example, to register the Calendar control, type the following
  line:

     c:\access\adt\msareg.exe c:\access\adt\msacal20.ocx

  To register the custom control's supporting DLL, type the following
  line:

     c:\access\adt\msareg.exe c:\windows\system\oc1016.dll

3. Click OK to run the MSAREG.EXE file and to register the OLE custom
  control.

For Microsoft Windows NT
------------------------

1. In Program Manager or File Manager, click Run on the File menu.

2. In the Command text box, type a command similar to the following
  line:

     c:\application\msareg.exe c:\application\control.ocx

  For example, to register the Calendar control, type the following
  line:

     c:\access\adt\msareg.exe c:\access\adt\msacal20.ocx

  To register the custom control's supporting DLL, type the following
  line:

     c:\access\adt\msareg.exe c:\windows\system\oc1016.dll

3. Click OK to run the MSAREG.EXE file and to register the OLE custom
  control.
