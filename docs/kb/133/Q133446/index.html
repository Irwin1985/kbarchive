-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Presentation Conference feature in Microsoft PowerPoint 97 to
run a slide show from one computer that is in turn viewed on other computers
running on a network. This means the presenter connects his/her computer to each
participant's computer and runs a slide show on all of the computers at the same
time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Supported Features
------------------

You can use many of the standard features of PowerPoint during a Presentation
Conference. The following standard features are supported:

- You can use effects like builds and transitions in your slide show.

- You can use the new Slide Navigator to jump easily from one slide to another.
  You can use effects like blacking the screen or using the annotation tool to
  underscore a particular point as well.

- You can use Meeting Minder. This tool allows you to take notes or minutes
  during the presentation conference, as well as assign action items to the
  meeting participants.

- You can make the most of using interactive hot spots to jump to specific
  slides in your presentation.

Unsupported Features
--------------------

Some PowerPoint slide show features are not supported on audience members'
computers when a Presentation Conference is running. These are:

- Starting shared applications, such as Microsoft Graph.

- Starting OLE applications, such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel.

- Playing embedded multimedia objects, such as .wav, .mid, or .avi files
  (although they do play on the presenter's computer).

Supported Network Protocol
--------------------------

TCP/IP is currently the only network protocol that is supported by the
Presentation Conference feature.
