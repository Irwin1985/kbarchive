SUMMARY
=======

This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Backup for Windows
95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What tape drive units are supported by Microsoft Backup?

  A. Microsoft Backup supports tape drives that attach to the floppy disk drive
  controller and that conform to the QIC-40, 80, or 3010 specification.
  Microsoft Backup also supports Colorado Memory Systems parallel-port tape
  drives. For additional information about supported tape drives, see the "Tape
  drives that are compatible with Backup" topic in Microsoft Backup Help.

  NOTE: QIC-WIDE tapes are not supported by Microsoft Backup. Microsoft Backup
  cannot read from, write to, or format these tapes.

2. Q. Microsoft Backup did not detect my SCSI tape backup drive. Can I configure
  it to work with Microsoft Backup?

  A. SCSI tape drives are not currently supported in Microsoft Backup. For
  additional information about supported tape drives, see the "Tape drives that
  are compatible with Backup" topic in Microsoft Backup Help.

3. Q. Can I use the FC-20 tape controller that came with my tape drive with
  Microsoft Backup?

  A. Microsoft Backup does not support proprietary controller cards for tape
  drives. Similar unsupported controllers include FC-10 and FC-15 controllers
  and controllers from Iomega. For additional information about supported tape
  drives, see the "Tape drives that are compatible with Backup" topic in
  Microsoft Backup Help.

4. Q. Does Microsoft Backup support the new 350 MB tapes?

  A. Yes. Microsoft Backup supports extended-length tapes formatted to the
  QIC-80 specification as long as the tape drive itself supports the tape.
  Please consult your tape drive manufacturer to determine if the tape drive
  supports extended-length tapes.

5. Q. Can Microsoft Backup restore data from backup sets created by third-party
  MS-DOS-based or Windows 3.1-based tape backup programs?

  A. Yes, provided that the third-party tape backup program conforms to the QIC
  standard for implementing compression. Please consult the third-party
  software documentation or manufacturer for information about the
  specification used.

6. Q. Can Microsoft Backup restore data from backup sets created by earlier
  versions of Microsoft Backup?

  A. No. Microsoft Backup in Windows 95 does not support the format used in
  earlier versions of Microsoft Backup.

  For additional information, see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q138135 Restoring Backups Created with Earlier Versions of MS-DOS

7. Q. Does Microsoft Backup include support for incremental backups?

  A. Yes. Microsoft Backup supports creating full and incremental backup sets.
  There is currently no differential backup support in Microsoft Backup.

  To enable incremental backup, click Options on the Microsoft Backup Settings
  menu, then click the Incremental option button on the Backup tab.

8. Q. If I create a full backup set using Microsoft Backup and then remove
  Windows 95, how do I use Microsoft Backup to restore my files?

  A. Microsoft Backup requires Windows 95. You must install at least a minimal
  configuration of Windows 95, including Microsoft Backup. You can then use
  Microsoft Backup to restore all your files.

9. Q. When I restore just one or two files from my backup set, I receive a
  message stating "There may have been an error restoring the registry. Your
  computer may not work properly." Why does this message appear when I have not
  chosen to restore the registry?

  A. This message appears when you restore files from the "Full System
  Backup.set" backup set. This backup set is intended to be used only to
  perform a full system backup or restore. The "Full System Backup.set" backup
  set contains the files necessary to restore your Windows 95 configuration to
  its original state. Keep this backup set in a safe place in case your hard
  disk partition or the Windows folder is damaged. Create separate backup sets
  for backing up other data.

10. Q. How do I get Windows 95 to detect my tape drive? Device Manager does not
  list my tape drive, but it is a supported unit.

  A. Tape drive detection is performed by Microsoft Backup when it loads.
  Microsoft Backup does not rely on the operating system for information about
  tape drive units attached to the system. It is not necessary for your tape
  drive to be listed in Device Manager.
