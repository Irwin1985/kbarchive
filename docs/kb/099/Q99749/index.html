SUMMARY
=======

The CPQC710.BID driver supports disk, tape, and CD-ROM drives with the
integrated 32-bit fast-SCSI-2 controller found on Compaq Prosignia systems and
the 32-bit fast-SCSI-2 controller. The driver comes with Compaq Prosignia and
SYSTEMPRO XLs, but is not included with Microsoft OS/2 1.3 installation disks.
This article explains how to install the driver and adapt HPFS recovery disks
(just in case). This is adapted from a README file on the Compaq OS/2 support
disk.

INSTALLING ON NEW SYSTEMS
-------------------------

1. Make a backup copy of the MS OS/2 1.3 Install A disk using the DISKCOPY
  command.

2. Boot the system using this new backup copy.

3. At the Microsoft Operating System/2 Installation screen, press the ESC key to
  display an OS/2 command prompt.

4. Insert the Compaq OS/2 Support Software disk in drive A.

5. At the OS/2 command prompt type:

  " cpqc710 new" (without the quotation marks)

  Follow the directions and insert the requested diskettes when prompted.

  This command file modifies the backup copy of the MS OS/2 Install A disk by
  copying and expanding the CPQC710.BID file and the BASEDD01.SYS file
  (renaming the existing version BASEDD01.OLD) to the disk's root directory.

6. If the system contains disk controllers other than fast-SCSI-2 controllers
  and the system will be booting from the fast-SCSI-2 controller, rename the
  file CPQC710.BID to BOOTBID.BID on the modified backup copy of the MS OS/2
  Install A disk.

7. Reboot the system with the backup copy of the MS OS/2 Install A disk in drive
  A.

8. Install OS/2.

INSTALLING ON SYSTEMS ALREADY RUNNING MICROSOFT OS/2 1.3
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Insert the Compaq OS/2 Support Software disk in drive A.

2. Change the current directory to the root directory of drive A and type:

  " cpqc710 update" (without the quotation marks)

  This renames the original BASEDD01.SYS as BASEDD01.OLD, so that it is
  available if ever needed again, and copies and expands the CPQC710.BID and
  BASEDD01.SYS Fast-SCSI-2 controller LADDR driver files.

3. Shut down OS/2 and reboot the system to load the new driver.

CREATING AN HPFS RECOVERY DISK 1
--------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Do this as soon as you finish installing MS OS/2 and LAN Manager.

1. After you have completed installation, make a backup copy of the LAN Manager
  HPFS Recovery Disk 1 using the DISKCOPY command.

2. Insert the Compaq OS/2 Support Software diskette in drive A.

3. Change to drive A and type:

  " cpqc710 recovery" (without the quotation marks)

  Follow the directions and insert the requested disks when prompted.

  This command file modifies the backup copy of LAN Manager HPFS Recovery Disk 1
  by expanding and copying CPQC710.BID and a new BASEDD01.SYS file (renaming
  the existing version BASEDD01.OLD) to the root directory of the disk.

4. If the system contains disk controllers other than Fast-SCSI-2 controllers
  and will be booting from the Fast-SCSI-2 controller, rename the file
  CPQC710.BID to BOOTBID.BID on the modified backup copy of the LAN Manager
  HPFS Recovery Disk 1.

USING THE 32-BIT FAST-SCSI-2 CONTROLLER WITH OTHER DISK CONTROLLERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If the fast-SCSI-2 controller is the primary disk controller and the system has
other disk controllers such as ESDI, IDA IAES, or IDE, you must rename the
CPQC710.BID driver to BOOTBID.BID, not simply copy it. Under no circumstances
should both driver names (CPQC710.BID and BOOTBID.BID) appear in the root
directory.

If you are installing onto a new system by creating a modified Install A disk as
described above, you must copy CPQC710.BID to BOOTBID.BID on this modified
Install A disk.
