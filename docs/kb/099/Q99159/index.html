SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Chess is a computerized version of the famous board game chess. The
basic moves of Chess can be learned in a few minutes (after which you can spend
the rest of your life in the rewarding exploration of the finer points of the
game). As a game opens, two armies face off from across the board. The object is
to capture the opposition's king, while protecting your own. The strategy comes
from making the best use of the unique moving abilities of each Chess piece.

The chessboard consists of 64 checkered squares that make up files, ranks, and
diagonals used by the Chess pieces for position and movement. Each square is
identified using conventional abbreviations and either descriptive or algebraic
move notation. You and your opponent start the game with a set of 16 Chess
pieces that are always referred to as white or black, regardless of actual color
variations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Piece Movements
---------------

Each Chess piece has a distinct personality with a unique move. The queen is the
most powerful piece while the weakest is the pawn. The computer assigns a value
of 9 to the queen, 5 to a rook, 3.2 to a bishop, 3 to a knight, and 1 to a pawn.
A capture is made when one piece moves onto the square occupied by an opposing
piece. These capture moves can only be made within the normal patterns of
movement for the piece.

The KING can move one square at a time in any direction to any square that is
safe from attack and unoccupied by one of its own pieces. This creates eight
possible moves.

The QUEEN can move in a straight line across any number of unoccupied squares,
diagonally, vertically, and horizontally.

The ROOK, sometimes called a castle, can move across any number of unoccupied
squares, vertically or horizontally.

The BISHOP can move diagonally across any number of unoccupied squares in a
straight line. The bishop can't change the color of the squares on which it
travels. At the beginning of the game you have one bishop to travel the white
diagonals, and one to travel the black diagonals.

The KNIGHT is the only Chess piece that can jump over other pieces when moving or
capturing. It can move in any direction in an L-shaped configuration: two spaces
forward and then one space to its right or left, or one space forward and two to
its right or left.

The PAWN can only move forward one square at a time and never backward, with two
exceptions: (1) When moving a pawn for the first time, you have the option of
moving it ahead two squares instead of one; and (2) You must move the pawn one
square diagonally to capture. Also, a pawn advanced to the opposite end of the
board is promoted to any piece, except a king or another pawn.

The Basic Rules of Chess
------------------------

- White plays first.

- Move only one Chess piece on your turn (except when castling).

- Only one piece can occupy a square.

- You must move a piece when it is your turn.

- To capture an opponent's Chess piece, move to the square your opponent
  occupies and the computer will remove the opponent's piece from the board.

- Call "check" when you place your opponent's king in jeopardy.

- You must protect your king from check (attack). Use one of the following
  moves to save your king: Capture your king's attacker, move your king away
  from the attack, or block the attack with one of your other pieces.

- You are not obligated to capture a piece unless there is no other way to make
  your move.

- The knight is the only piece who can jump over other Chess pieces to make a
  move or capture.

- The king is never actually captured; instead, he is forced to surrender by
  means of checkmate, at which point the game ends.

- A game can end by resignation when it is obvious that defeat can't be
  avoided.

- A forced mate is the term given to a resignation when certain precise
  material advantages are enjoyed by one side. Traditionally, a forced mate
  ends the game as if it were played to a checkmate conclusion. Examples of
  classical forced mate material advantages include (but aren't limited to):

  1. Two knights and a king versus a lone king.

  2. A queen and a king versus a lone king.

  3. A knight, a bishop, and a king versus a lone king.

  4. Two bishops and a king versus a lone king.

- It is possible to have a draw, or tie, if one of the following conditions
  occur:

  1. Both players agree to a draw.

  2. Neither player has enough Chess pieces to put a king in checkmate.

  3. There is a stalemate.

  4. The exact board positions have been repeated three times.

  5. Neither player has made a capture or moved a pawn during the last 50
     moves.
