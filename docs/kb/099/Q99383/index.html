SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the WIN.INI file settings used by Access Pack for
Windows, version 3.0a. These entries are only added to your WIN.INI file when
you explicitly save setting changes using the Access Utility provided with
Access Pack.

WARNING: Be very careful when you modify WIN.INI file settings; refer to the
Access Pack WININI.WRI file for more information.

To change these settings, choose your settings using the Access Utility, and then
save them using the Save Parameter Changes to Disk command from the File menu.

If you cannot run the Access Utility because of unsupported hardware, you can add
these entries to your WIN.INI file using a text editor, such as Microsoft
Windows Notepad. See the Access Pack WININI.WRI file for more information about
the structure of the WIN.INI file and instructions on making changes.
