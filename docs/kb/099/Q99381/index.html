PRODUCT OVERVIEW

The Microsoft Windows family of products is designed to make computers
easier to use for everyone, including those users with disabilities.
Access Pack for Microsoft Windows is a set of utilities that make it
easier for users with motion-related disabilities to use the keyboard
and mouse. Users who have hearing disabilities can use Access Pack to
configure their system to provide visual feedback, rather than sounds.

Note: A machine with Access Pack installed can be used by those
individuals who require its additional features and those who do not.

Access Pack for Microsoft Windows was developed through a cooperative
effort with the Trace Research and Development (R&amp;D) Center at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison, with funding from the National
Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research.

FEATURES

Access Pack for Microsoft Windows contains the following features that
make Windows systems more accessible for those with motion and
hearing-related disabilities.

These features can be used alone or in combination to best suit your
needs and environment. The features can also be customized to allow
you to be most productive. In addition, once the Access Pack has been
installed, you can access any feature without requiring special
assistance. When all features are turned off, the computer uses its
default configuration, and Access Pack is invisible if you do not
require its functionality.

StickyKeys
----------

Many software programs require you to press two or three keys
simultaneously. This is impossible if you type with a headstick or
mouthstick. StickyKeys allows you to press one key at a time and
instructs Windows to respond as if the keys had been pressed
simultaneously.

SlowKeys
--------

The sensitivity of the keyboard can be a major problem, especially if
you strike keys accidentally. SlowKeys instructs Windows to disregard
keystrokes that are not held down for a certain period of time.

RepeatKeys
----------

Most keyboards allow you to repeat a key just by holding it down. If
you can't lift your fingers off the keyboard quickly enough, this can
result in unintentionally repeated characters. RepeatKeys lets you
adjust the repeat rate or disable it altogether.

BounceKeys
----------

You may "bounce" keys, resulting in double strokes of the same key or
other similar errors. BounceKeys instructs Windows to ignore
unintended keystrokes.

MouseKeys
---------

This feature lets you use the keyboard to control the cursor as a
mouse would. You can thus select menus and commands, and perform other
convenient mouse functions, from the keyboard. MouseKeys also helps to
give you finer control than can a standard mouse can. Note that a
mouse is not required for this feature to work.

ToggleKeys
----------

ToggleKeys provide audio cues (high and low beeps) to tell you whether
a toggle key is active or inactive. It applies to the CAPS LOCK, NUM
LOCK and SCROLL LOCK keys.

SerialKeys
----------

This feature, in conjunction with a communications aid interface
device, allows you to use alternative input devices to control the
computer as if you were using a standard keyboard and mouse.

SoundSentry
-----------

Windows emits a beep when it wants to signal you, but this is not useful
if
you have a hearing impairment or you work in a noisy environment.
SoundSentry tells Windows to send a visual cue, such as a blinking title
bar or screen flash, in addition to a beep. You can then see the message
that may not have been heard.

TimeOut
-------

TimeOut turns off Access Pack's functionality after the system has
been idle for a certain period of time, and returns the system to its
default configuration. This feature is useful on machines shared by
multiple users.

ACCESS PACK AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

With Access Pack for Windows and third-party products that make Windows
accessible to people with visual impairments and Microsoft's documentation
in electronic form, Windows meets recommendations in the Government
Services Administration guidelines relating to software accessibility.
These guidelines were developed in response to section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act. This law was written to ensure accessibility for
government employees with disabilities.

Access Pack for Windows can also help employers accommodate individuals
with disabilities, as required under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
