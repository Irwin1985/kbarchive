The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer, version 1.0, used with:
   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Server and User Setup programs provided with Microsoft Electronic Forms
Designer assume that form users can connect to a network to run the User Setup
program, and that users can access the sample E-forms from a shared location on
the network. Some users, such as those using version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows, may not be able to connect to the network to run User Setup
or to access shared E-forms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you do not connect to the network, you can install the E-form run-time files
and sample E-forms by using the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer disks and
following these steps:

1. Insert Disk 1 of the Electronic Forms Designer into the floppy disk drive of
  the remote machine.

2. From the Windows File Manager, run the SETUP.EXE program from the root
  directory of Disk 1. When the first dialog box appears, choose the Server
  Setup option.

3. In the third dialog box, specify the local Windows directory as the location
  for files (for example, C:\WINDOWS). Follow the prompts to complete Server
  Setup.

4. From the Windows File Manager, run the SETUP.EXE program that Server Setup
  created in the local WINDOWS\EFORMS directory. This adds form commands to
  MSMAIL.EXE and makes the local copies of the sample forms available when you
  are offline from the network.

5. To save disk space, use the Windows File Manager to remove unnecessary files
  created by Server Setup. To do this, delete the WINDOWS\RUNTIME directory
  along with all the files it contains, and delete all files in the
  WINDOWS\EFORMS directory. DO NOT delete the PHONE and ROUTE directories or
  the files they contain, because they allow you to work with the phone and
  routing forms when you are not connected to the network.

6. In step 4 above, User Setup created a SharedExtensionsDir entry in the
  MSMAIL.INI file that references the local Windows directory. If you also need
  access to forms or other Microsoft Mail extensions stored in a shared
  location, copy the custom message declarations in the SHARED.INI file into
  the [Custom Messages] section of the MSMAIL.INI file. In each declaration
  copied to MSMAIL.INI, replace &lt;ExtsDir&gt; with C:\WINDOWS\ and change the
  SharedExtensionsDir entry to reference the shared location on the network.

7. In step 4 above, User Setup created an entry in the Custom Commands section
  of the local MSMAIL.INI file. The entry adds a Select E-Form command to the
  Mail menu. The access key for the Select E-Form command is "S." The Microsoft
  Mail Remote client also uses "S" as the access key for the remote "Settings"
  command. You can change the access key for the Select E-Form command by
  repositioning the ampersand (&amp;) character in the custom command
  declaration.
