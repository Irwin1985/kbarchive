SUMMARY
=======

MemMaker increases your conventional memory by loading device drivers and
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs into upper memory. Sometimes a device
driver or TSR program cannot be loaded into upper memory because of its design.

Since MemMaker is not aware of every device driver or TSR that cannot be loaded
high, your system may stop responding (hang) when you run MemMaker. To recover
from this situation, refer to the section titled "Your computer stops responding
while MemMaker is loading a program or device driver other than EMM386" in
Chapter 6 of the "User's Guide."

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the beta test of MS-DOS 6 Upgrade, Microsoft found several programs that
could not be loaded high. These programs are listed in the MEMMAKER.INF file.

The following device drivers and TSRs cannot be loaded into upper memory and are
not currently listed in the MEMMAKER.INF file:

  Device Driver or TSR    Function
  --------------------------------
  ATDOSHC.SYS             Quantum Hard Card EZ driver
  DEVSWAP                 SuperStor Pro device driver
  DOSCFG.EXE              Iomega OAD driver for Bernoulli drives
  GAI.SYS                 APPIAN Rendition IIe video card device driver
  I82593.DOS              Zenith Data System Z-Note portable computer
                          Windows for Workgroups device driver
  NET                     PC-NFS device driver
  SSTORDRV                SuperStor Pro device driver
  STAT4L.EXE              Hewlett-Packard device driver for HP 4L
  WD80X3.EXE              Wollongong Networking Software device driver
  PRO4.DOS                Proteon ProNet P1347 device driver
  MC.SYS                  Memory Commander TSR
  MCIN.EXE                Memory Commander TSR
  SK                      Older versions (1.x) of SideKick
  HPLANE.DOS              HP Ethertwist EISA device driver
  NETWORK.EXE             Webs Network TSR
  PRO16EUI.SYS            Proteon ProNet 16/4 TokenRing device driver
  NANSI.SYS               ANSI.SYS replacement Supplied with various
                          video cards
  FDCD.SYS                Version 2.01 SCSI driver for NEC CD-ROM drive
                          (currently ships with SoundBlaster compatible
                          Aria sound card).

 ADTSR.EXE                After Dark for DOS version 1.0


WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid having to specifically exclude a device driver or TSR program each time
you run MemMaker, add the filename to the MEMMAKER.INF file. For example, if
GAI.SYS is causing your system to hang, edit the MEMMAKER.INF file with a text
editor (such as MS-DOS Editor) to add the following line:

  *GAI

Device Drivers and TSR Programs Ignored by MemMaker
---------------------------------------------------

The following device drivers and TSR programs are listed in the MEMMAKER.INF file
and therefore are not loaded high:

  *ASPI4DOS
  *AUTOMENU
  *BOOT
  *DOSEDIT
  *DRAGON
  *NDD
  *NETBIOS
  *PROTMAN
  *RP
  *SCREATE
  *SMARTDRV /DOUBLE_BUFFER
  *SMARTDRV /L
  *SSWAP
  *STRETCH
  *VANSI
  *VDEFEND
  *VRESUME
  *VT
