SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 can register callback functions with the
NotifyRegister() application programming interface (API), which is called on
notifications. Callback functions that result in a notification being issued,
however, themselves fail to chain on to other registered callbacks. This causes
negative side-effects to other applications that use NotifyRegister().

MORE INFORMATION
================

NotifyRegister() can install callback functions that are called in response to
events such as the starting and ending of an application, the loading of a
segment, the freeing of a module, and so forth. Only one callback can be
installed per task running in Windows. When more than one task is running, each
can install a notification callback. Multiple callback functions are called by a
chaining mechanism implemented in TOOLHELP when an event occurs. Callback
functions are called in the order they were installed by the tasks. See the
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1 "Programmer's Reference,
Volume 2: Functions" manual for more information on NotifyRegister().

If a callback routine performs an operation that causes another notification to
be issued, then the callback functions are not called in the usual chained
manner. The problem is not that the callback routine isn't handling reentrancy;
rather, NotifyRegister() has not been implemented to handle callbacks that
result in notifications being issued.


For example, a common procedure is to call OutputDebugString() to help debug an
application. However, callback functions installed by NotifyRegister() cannot
use OutputDebugString() because this API call causes the NFY_OUTSTR notification
to be issued. When OutputDebugString() returns, TOOLHELP can't chain on to the
next installed callback function. The result is that only the first callback is
called for the event at which OutputDebugString() was called.

If printing debug messages from the callback routine is desired, call
PostMessage() to inform the application of the event, and call
OutputDebugString() from the application's window procedure instead of calling
it directly from the callback routine. Using PostMessage() is necessary for the
application to perform any operation, not just a call to OutputDebugString(),
which causes a notification event to occur. Incidentally, the documentation
states that "the notification callback function cannot use any Windows function,
with the exception of Tool Helper functions and PostMessage.()"

Having this type of error in an installed NotifyRegister() callback results in
negative side-effects in other applications that use NotifyRegister(). Microsoft
Visual C++ version 1.0 uses TOOLHELP notifications as part of the integrated
development environment debugger. If any application is running that has
installed a callback that causes notifications to be issued, calling
OutputDebugString() for example, Visual C++ will not be able to initiate
debugging an application. Upon starting to debug, Visual C++ displays an error
message in a dialog box stating:

  DEBUG ERROR: Could not load debuggee. Unknown Error in Windows (-22)

Once the application uninstalls the errant callback routine, Visual C++ can debug
without this error.
