Schedule+ on Workstation Without Microsoft Mail Accounts
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Schedule+. You receive the following error message:

  Until you run mail once, you will not be able to use any of the Workgroup
  features of Schedule+. Do you want to use only the personal features of
  Schedule+ now?

2. Choose the OK button.

  NOTE: You may want to create the first account with the name USER and a
  password of PASSWORD. This allows others to know the Microsoft Mail password
  without using anyone's actual password.

3. In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter USER as the user name and
  PASSWORD as the password. Do not select the Remember Password check box. You
  receive the error message

  Your message file could not be found.

4. Choose OK.

5. In the Open Message File dialog box, choose the New button. You receive the
  following message:

  Warning: The existence of multiple message files can result in a loss of
  database integrity. Delete all other message files. Your new message file can
  be found in the C:\&lt;WINDOWS&gt;\MSMAIL.MMF.

6. Choose OK. You receive the following message:

  A new file has been created for you. Your password has been set to 'password'.
  You can change it by using the Change Password command.

7. Choose OK. From the Schedule+ Options menu, choose General Options. Select
  Startup Off-Line and then choose OK.

8. Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

9. Start Schedule+.

10. In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter USER as the user name and
  PASSWORD as the password. You receive the following error message:

  This message file is a backup file. Would you like to make it your primary
  message file?

11. Choose the Yes button. Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

12. Start Schedule+.

13. In the Microsoft Mail Sign In screen, enter a new user's name as the user
  name and PASSWORD as the password.

14. Choose OK. You receive the following error message:

  The local copy of your schedule file could not be accessed in the location
  specified in your SCHDPLUS.INI file.

15. Choose OK.

16. In the Find Local File dialog box, choose OK to accept the filename
  &lt;username&gt;.CAL. You receive the following message:

  A new file has been created for you. Your password has been set to
  'password'. You can change it by using the Change Password command.

17. Choose OK.

  NOTE: The Microsoft Mail message file and the Schedule+ file both have a
  password of PASSWORD. If you leave these passwords both set to PASSWORD,
  users will not need to confirm the Schedule+ password when they start
  Schedule+.

18. To change the Schedule+ password, choose Change Password from the Schedule+
  Options menu. You will be prompted for the current password and the new
  password you want to use.

  NOTE: When the user logs in to Schedule+, he or she needs to use his or her
  Mailbox name and PASSWORD as the password and then enter his or her
  Schedule+ password in the Confirm Password box.

19. Exit and sign out of Schedule+.

20. Repeat steps 12-18 for each additional account.
