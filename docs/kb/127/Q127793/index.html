The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a copy of the text in the DEINSTAL.TXT file that is
included on Disk 1 of the Microsoft Windows Sound System version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Contents of the DEINSTAL.TXT File
---------------------------------

To remove Microsoft Windows Sound System, you must remove the Windows Sound
System files, initialization file entries, and backup files. You may also have
to modify the Windows Registration Database.

Before you remove files and file entries, remove the program groups used by
Windows Sound System. The default program group name for Windows Sound System
programs is Windows Sound System. If you have created program groups with user
names for Voice Pilot, remove them also. If you have added any Windows Sound
System applications to your Windows Startup group, remove those programs from
the Startup group.

Next, exit Microsoft Windows. In Microsoft MS-DOS, remove the files listed and
make the changes noted. Do not attempt to remove files in Windows.

NOTE: Because of the broad range of installations and uses of the Windows Sound
System, not all files will be installed on all computers. In addition, not all
files will be installed in the directories noted. For example, when Windows
Sound System is installed on a computer that is running from a shared Windows
installation on a remote network drive, all the files noted as contained in the
Windows System directory are actually located in the local Windows directory.

REMOVING WINDOWS SOUND SYSTEM FILES
-----------------------------------

To remove the Windows Sound System files:

1. From the Windows directory (for example, from C:\WINDOWS), remove:

       WINDOWSS.GRP
       SNDSYS.INI
       VOICEPIL.INI
       SNDCNTRL.DLL
       SND.HLP
       MCIPLAY.EXE
       MUSICBOX.INI
       MCIOLE.DLL
       CLIPRDR.INI
       SNDSYS.HLP     (Windows Sound System sound board only)
       WSSSB16.HLP    (Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 or 16 ASP
                       audio hardware only)
       WSSSBPRO.HLP   (Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro audio hardware
                       only)

       AUDDRIVE.HLP   (ESS audio hardware only)

CAUTION: The files MCIPLAY.EXE and MCIOLE.DLL may be used by other applications.
Removing these files could hinder these applications' proper functioning.

2. From the Windows System directory (for example, from C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM),
  remove:

       SNDSYS.DRV     (Windows Sound System sound board only)
       VSNDSYS.386    (Windows Sound System sound board only)
       MVMIXER.DRV    (Media Vision audio hardware only)
       MVPROAUD.DRV   (Media Vision audio hardware only)
       OPL3.DRV       (Media Vision audio hardware only)
       VPASD.386      (Media Vision audio hardware only)
       AUDDRIVE.DRV   (ESS audio hardware only)
       VAUDRV.386     (ESS audio hardware only)
       WSSSB16.386    (Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 or 16 ASP audio
                       hardware only)
       WSSSB16.DRV    (Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 or 16 ASP audio
                       hardware only)
       WSSSBPRO.386   (Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro audio hardware
                       only)
       WSSSBPRO.DRV   (Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro audio hardware
                       only)
       MIDIMAP.CFG    (Original file replaced)
       MSMIXMGR.DLL
       SNDEVNTS.DRV
       TS_SOFT.ACM
       TSD.DLL
       IMAADPCM.ACM
       MSACM.DRV
       MSACM.DLL
       MSADPCM.ACM
       CHOO_WIN.HLP
       FIL_WIN.HLP
       MAP_WIN.HLP

CAUTION: The files MSACM.DLL, MSACM.DRV, MSADPCM.ACM, IMAADPCM.ACM, CHOO_WIN.HLP,
FIL_WIN.HLP, MAP_WIN.HLP, and SNDEVNTS.DRV may be used by other applications.
Removing these files could hinder these applications' proper functioning.
3. If you want to restore your MIDIMAP configuration to the state it was in
  before you installed Windows Sound System, in the Windows System directory,
  rename the MIDIMAP.WSS file MIDIMAP.CFG.

4. From the Windows System directory, remove the following backup file:

       MIDIMAP.WSS    (Backup version of MIDIMAP.CFG)

5. From the Microsoft Excel directory (for example, from C:\EXCEL), remove:

       XLRDR.INI

6. From the Microsoft Excel Library directory (for example, from
  C:\EXCEL\LIBRARY), remove:

       PROOF.XLA

7. From the Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows directory (for example, from C:\123WIN),
  remove:

       123RDR.INI

8. Remove all of the files and directories from the directory where the Windows
  Sound System was installed. (The default is C:\SNDSYS.)

In some cases, you may not be able to delete the dictionary (*.DCT) files that
are installed with ProofReader because they are read-only files. To delete them,
start Windows File Manager, and then select all files with the .DCT extension.
Then, from the File menu, choose Delete. File Manager warns you that the files
are "system, hidden, or read-only" and provides you with options. Choose Yes.

REMOVING INITIALIZATION FILE ENTRIES
------------------------------------

Now, remove all entries that Windows Sound System made to initialization (.INI)
files that were not created by Windows Sound System. All of the initialization
files are located in the Windows directory (for example, in C:\WINDOWS). Entries
are listed by file and section.

NOTE: Depending on how you installed Windows Sound System and how you use it,
some of the entries may not be present in the specified files. In addition, if
you did not install Windows Sound System in C:\SNDSYS (the default directory),
substitute the full name of the directory in which you installed Windows Sound
System for C:\SNDSYS in the following entries.

1. 

  
  File:    123W.INI:
  Section: [AUTOLOAD ADDINS]
  Entry:
      123RDR.ADW=C:\SNDSYS, 1, 0, 0

2. 

  File:    123R4.INI:
  Section: [AUTOLOAD ADDINS]
  Entry:
      123RDR.ADW=C:\SNDSYS, 1, 0, 0

3. 

  File: CONTROL.INI:

  NOTE: CONTROL.WSS is a copy of your CONTROL.INI file as it appeared before it
  was modified by the Windows Sound System.

  Section: [drivers.desc]
  Entries:
      sndsys.drv=Microsoft Windows Sound System
      msacm.drv=Microsoft Sound Mapper
      ts_soft.acm=DSP Group TrueSpeech(TM) Software CODEC
      SndEvnts.drv=SoundBits Events Driver
      imaadpcm.acm=Microsoft ACM IMA ADPCM Audio CODEC
      msadpcm.acm=Microsoft ADPCM Audio CODEC

  NOTE: If you have Microsoft SoundBits(TM) installed on your system, do not
  delete the entry for SndEvnts.drv. Some other applications may use ACM.
  Removing the entries for msacm.drv, imaadpcm.acm, and msadpcm.acm could
  hinder these applications' proper functioning.

  Section: [SoundSchemes]
  Entries: ALL

  NOTE: If you have Microsoft SoundBits installed on your system, do not delete
  the entries for Musical Sounds, Hanna Barbera, Hollywood Movies, or Your Old
  Scheme.

  Section: [SoundScheme.Nature] Entries: ALL

  Section: [SoundScheme.Sci-Fi] Entries: ALL

4. File: WIN.INI

   Section: [Extensions]
   Entries:
      WAV=C:\SNDSYS\QRECORD.EXE ^.WAV
      SND=C:\SNDSYS\SNDFINDR.EXE ^.SND
      AIF=C:\SNDSYS\SNDFINDR.EXE ^.AIF
      VOC=C:\SNDSYS\SNDFINDR.EXE ^.VOC
      MID=C:\SNDSYS\SNDFINDR.EXE ^.MID
      RMI=C:\SNDSYS\SNDFINDR.EXE ^.RMI

   Section: [Embedding]
   Entry:
      SoundRec=Sound,Sound,C:\SNDSYS\QRECORD.EXE,picture

  NOTE: To restore Sound Recorder as the OLE server for sound objects, replace
  C:\SNDSYS\QRECORD.EXE with SOUNDREC.EXE. You can also choose the OLE server
  for sound objects from the Windows Sound System Setup program.

   Section: [sounds]
   Entries: If any system events point to Windows Sound System
       sound files, remove the location and name of those
       files. You can either replace them with other sound
       filenames or change them to point to &lt;none&gt; and use
       the Sound Control Panel to assign other sounds to these
       events.  Also remove all entries that point to Voice
       Pilot sounds.  Those entries begin with "VPT" or "VPV."

5. File: SYSTEM.INI

  NOTE: SYSTEM.WSS is a copy of your SYSTEM.INI file as it appeared before it
  was modified by Windows Sound System.

   Section: [boot]
   Entry:
      drivers=msmixmgr.dll SndEvnts.drv

  NOTE: Do not delete or modify any other drivers mentioned in the drivers= line
  in the [boot] section. Do not alter the order of the drivers. If you have
  Microsoft SoundBits installed on your computer, do not delete the entry for
  SndEvnts.drv.

   Section: [drivers]
   Entries:
      WaveMapper=MSACM.DRV
      SndEvnts=SndEvnts.drv
      MSACM.msadpcm=msadpcm.acm
      MSACM.imaadpcm=imaadpcm.acm
      MSACM.trspch=ts_soft.acm

  NOTE: If you have Microsoft SoundBits installed on your system, do not delete
  the entry for SndEvnts.drv. Because other applications may use ACM, removing
  the entries for MSACM could hinder these applications' proper functioning.

MODIFYING THE WINDOWS REGISTRATION DATABASE (REG.DAT)

-----------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Depending on how you installed Windows Sound System and how you use it,
some of the following entries may not be present in the REG.DAT file.

When Windows Sound System was installed, you chose which application to use as
the OLE server for sound objects. By default, this application is Quick
Recorder; therefore, unless you chose another application, Quick Recorder is
registered in the Windows Registration Database as the server for all sound
objects.

When you deinstall Windows Sound System, you must replace Quick Recorder as the
server for OLE sound objects.

To do this:

1. From the Program Manager File menu, choose Run.

2. Type "REGEDIT.EXE /V" (without the quotation marks)

3. From the Search menu, choose Find Key.

4. Type "soundrec" (without the quotation marks) and press Enter. The entry
  "SoundRec = Sound" will be selected.

5. From the Edit menu, choose Delete Key and press OK.

6. From the File menu, choose Save Changes.

7. From the File menu, choose Exit.

8. Repeat steps 1 through 7, substituting SoundFinder for SoundRec in step 4, to
  delete the entry for Sound Finder.

9. Now start the application you will be using as your OLE sound server.
  Normally, this is Windows Sound Recorder, which is in the Accessories group
  in Program Manager.

REMOVING BACKUP FILES

---------------------

From the Windows directory, remove the following backup files:

       CONTROL.WSS    (Backup version of CONTROL.INI)
       SYSTEM.WSS     (Backup version of SYSTEM.INI)
       VOICEPIL.WSS   (Backup version of VOICEPIL.INI)
       WIN.WSS        (Backup version of WIN.INI)

CAUTION: Because you may need these files to restore previous settings, remove
these files as the last step in the deinstallation process.
