SUMMARY
=======

The following is the Baseball 1995 BBLEGAL.TXT file (subscription agreement).

MICROSOFT SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT FOR BASEBALL DAILY 1995
--------------------------------------------------------

In order to subscribe to and use Microsoft's Baseball Daily 1995 on-line service
(the "Service"), you, the "Subscriber," must agree with Microsoft Corporation
("MS") to the following terms and conditions:

1. Required Age:

  Subscriber must be 18 years or older. Subscriber may allow others to use the
  Service through Subscriber's account and password, but Subscriber agrees to
  be solely responsible for all fees associated with their use of Subscriber's
  account.

2. Fees:

  The schedule of fees for use of the Service is reproduced for the Subscriber
  as part of the registration process, and is available under the "Help"
  feature for reference. Subscriber unconditionally promises and agrees to pay
  all fees attributable to Subscriber's account. Subscriber agrees that MS
  shall bill Subscriber all such fees to the credit card Subscriber has
  provided as part of the registration process for the Service. Subscriber
  represents that such credit card account belongs to Subscriber and will be
  valid at all times during which Subscriber uses the Service. If for any
  reason MS is unable to collect fees attributable to Subscriber's account
  through Subscriber's credit card, Subscriber agrees to pay all such fees
  directly to MS upon request. All late payments shall incur a late charge of
  one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month, or the legal maximum, whichever
  is less.

3. Telephone Charges:

  Subscriber is responsible for all telephone service charges incurred by
  Subscriber in using the Service.

4. Use of Information from Service:

  The information provided to Subscriber through Service is intended for
  Subscriber's personal, non-commercial use, and Subscriber agrees to make no
  other uses of such information. To the extent that the information provided
  by the Service is protected by copyright or other proprietary rights,
  Subscriber agrees that all such rights are retained by MS and/or its
  suppliers, and that such information is licensed to Subscriber according to
  the terms of this Agreement and the end user license agreement accompanying
  the Microsoft[ASCII 174] Complete Baseball product. Subscriber may not use
  the Service in connection with any action or activity prohibited by law or
  governmental regulation.

5. Changes to this Agreement:

  MS may, in its sole discretion, make changes to the Service, the fees charged
  for the Service and/or this Agreement upon prior notice to Subscriber. If
  Subscriber does not wish to consent to any such changes, Subscriber's sole
  remedy will be to terminate this Agreement and the use of the Service.

6. Limitation of Warranties:

  The service and all information, software, and other materials provided
  through or in connection with the Service are provided "as is", and MS makes
  no warrantee as to the availability, accuracy or content of information
  provided through or in connection with the Service, or any warranties of
  title, or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular
  purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties so the
  above exclusion may not apply to you. In no event shall MS be liable for any
  damages whatsoever (including without limitation, consequential, incidental,
  or special damages, whether for loss of profits, interruption, loss of
  business information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of
  or inability to use Service, even if MS has been advised of the possibility
  of such damages. In no event shall MS' liability to Subscriber under any
  provision of this agreement exceed the amount actually paid by Subscriber for
  the Service. Some states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of
  liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
  exclusion may not apply to you.

7. Term and Termination:

  This Agreement shall be effective as of the date on which Subscriber consents
  to the terms of this Agreement as provided through the registration process,
  and shall continue until terminated by either MS or Subscriber as follows:

  (a) MS reserves the right to immediately terminate Subscriber's right to
  access to Service in the event that MS, in its sole discretion, determines
  that Subscriber has refused to pay any fees for use of the Service, or if
  Subscriber has otherwise violated any of the terms of this Agreement. Such
  termination by MS shall be effective immediately upon notification to
  Subscriber. Such termination shall be in addition to any other legal remedies
  which may be available to MS. (b) Subscriber may terminate this Agreement at
  any time upon written notice to MS, provided that Subscriber shall be
  responsible for payment of fees incurred by Subscriber prior to such
  termination. (c) This Service is valid only during the 1995 baseball season.
  The Service shall end and this Agreement shall terminate on November 15,
  1995, or later at Microsoft's discretion.

8. No Assignment:

  Subscriber may not assign his or her account without the prior written consent
  of MS.

9. Entire Agreement:

  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning
  the subject matter hereof and supersedes all proposals, oral and written, and
  all negotiations, conversations, and other communications between the
  parties. No modification of this Agreement or waiver of any of its terms will
  be effective against a party specifically acknowledged by such party in
  writing.

10. Controlling Law:

  This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws of the State of
  Washington, and You consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state
  and federal courts sitting in the State of Washington.

11. Severability:

  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent
  jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining
  provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

12. Statistics Files:

  By downloading a copy of the Daily, you receive an ASCII file of statistics.
  These copyrighted files are licensed to you for your personal,
  non-commercial use, and any other use or redistribution of these files is
  expressly prohibited.
