The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Release calls that are made with _ATL_DEBUG_INTERFACES or _ATL_DEBUG_REFCOUNT
defined are not thread-safe. The most common symptom is an access violation (AV)
under the stress of multiple threads (even if they are all STA). The crash may
not occur near any ATL code.

In addition, _QIThunk::Release may access member variables after the object has
been deleted regardless of your threading model. This can lead to unpredictable
behavior, including an access violation. Typically, a crash related to this
occurs inside _QIThunk::Release.

If you experience crashing with _ATL_DEBUG_INTERFACES defined but do not
experience the crashing without it defined, then the crashing behavior may be
caused by one of several ATL 3.0 bugs in the _QIThunk releasing mechanism.

CAUSE
=====

There are two functions that contribute to the thread safety problems:
ATL::CComModule::DeleteNonAddRefThunk and ATL::_QIThunk::Release.

The purpose of the DeleteNonAddRefThunk function is to iterate through the array
of interface thunks and delete all thunks that cannot be AddRef'ed. However,
DeleteNonAddRefThunk does not check whether a thunk is marked as not AddRef'able
before deleting it.

The Release method's problems stem from two sources:

- Release accesses _QIThunk object members after a call to
  InterlockedDecrement. In a multithreaded scenario, another thread could
  decrement the count after the call to InterlockedDecrement and delete the
  _QIThunk object. This might cause an access violation if the first thread
  accesses any class members.

- Release should delete the thunk before allowing the underlying object the
  chance to be deleted, because once the underlying object is deleted, another
  thread can allocate another object and get the same address. The AddThunk
  function can then find the existing thunk (that is about to be deleted) and
  return it, instead of creating a new thunk.

RESOLUTION
==========

Replace ATL::CComModule::DeleteNonAddRefThunk and ATL::_QIThunk::Release in
Atlbase.h with the following:

  void DeleteNonAddRefThunk(IUnknown* pUnk)
  {
      EnterCriticalSection(&amp;m_csObjMap);
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_paThunks-&gt;GetSize(); i++)
      {
          if (m_paThunks-&gt;operator[](i)-&gt;pUnk == pUnk 
              &amp;&amp; m_paThunks-&gt;operator[](i)-&gt;bNonAddRefThunk
              )
          {
              delete m_paThunks-&gt;operator[](i);
              m_paThunks-&gt;RemoveAt(i);
              break;
          }
      }
      LeaveCriticalSection(&amp;m_csObjMap);
  }

  inline ULONG _QIThunk::Release()
  {
      if (bBreak)
          DebugBreak();
      ATLASSERT(m_dwRef &gt; 0);
      IUnknown *r_pUnk           = pUnk;
      bool     r_bNonAddRefThunk = bNonAddRefThunk;
      LPCTSTR  r_lpszClassName   = lpszClassName;
      IID      r_iid             = iid;
      ULONG    r_dwRef           = InterlockedDecrement(&amp;m_dwRef);
      ATLTRACE(_T("%d&lt; "), r_dwRef);
      AtlDumpIID(r_iid, r_lpszClassName, S_OK);
      if (r_dwRef==0 &amp;&amp; !r_bNonAddRefThunk)
          _pModule-&gt;DeleteThunk(this);
      r_pUnk-&gt;Release();
      return r_dwRef;
  }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The _ATL_DEBUG_INTERFACES mechanism can assist you in troubleshooting reference
counting and QueryInterface-related problems in your code.

The _ATL_DEBUG_INTERFACES mechanism does this by returning an object of type
ATL::_QIThunk in place of any interface you request. This object tracks
reference counting for each interface. It does this by intercepting all method
calls.

For any method calls but IUnknown method calls, the _QIThunk object adds no
functionality. For the IUnknown method calls, the _QIThunk object does the
appropriate tracking before passing the call on to the real object.

ATL::_QIThunk::Release must manage the lifetime of the _QIThunk object as well as
allow the underlying object to manage its lifetime.

Most of the _QIThunk lifetime-management-related code is enclosed in a critical
section. This is not possible in _QIThunk::Release because of the call to the
Release method in the underlying object.

The Release method in the underlying object could wait for a second thread to
terminate. If the second thread also requires a Release call or a QueryInterface
call through _QIThunk, a deadlock would result.

This justifies the need to use InterlockedDecrement instead of a critical
section, and also adds a level of complexity to designing a thread-safe
function.
