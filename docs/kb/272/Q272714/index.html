The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a fax message to a 262 area code number and enclose the area code
parentheses, it arrives at the BISCOM Fax EDK gateway with the (262) changed to
an upper case C. This causes the fax message to be undeliverable.

CAUSE
=====

The use of parentheses in the address causes the change. The area code of this
fax address is incorrectly interpreted as an ASCII character. This behavior
occurs for any three digits enclosed in parentheses, where the first digit is a
0, 1, or 2.

Parentheses are used in an X.400 address to portray characters such as the at
sign (@), the exclamation mark (!), or the percent sign (%) in an address.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange version 5.5 service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

This hotfix is included in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article, which
contains information store fixes. Refer to Q248838 for details and latest
version information.

  Q248838 XADM: Exchange Server 5.5 Post-SP3 Information Store Fixes Available

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
