The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, used with:
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Server System Attendant service on a
computer that is running Windows 2000 Server and is a domain controller, you may
receive the following error message

  Error 1069 - The service did not start due to a logon failure

In addition to this message, the following event ID messages may be logged in the
system log in Microsoft Event Viewer:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: Service Control Manager Event Category: None

  Date: 9/1/2000

  -and-

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: Service Control Manager
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 7000
  Date: 9/1/2000
  Time: 3:32:48 PM
  User: N/A
  Computer: &lt;MACHINENAME&gt;
  Description:
  The Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service failed to start due to the
  following error:
  The service did not start due to a logon failure.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Exchange service account does not have Log on as a
Service permissions for this computer. The permissions may have been lost if the
default domain controller policy was lost and re-created, and Exchange is
installed on a domain controller. Typically, domain controller policies are in
the Policies folder that is located at:

  \\&lt;domain&gt;.com\sysvol\&lt;domain&gt;.com.

On some occasions, these policies can become corrupt or missing.

Typically, when policies are lost, you restore them from backup. However, when it
is impossible to restore the policies, you have to re-create the policies
manually. After you re-create the policies, the Exchange service account loses
the special permissions it received when it was installed. These permissions
are:

- Log on as a Service

- Back up Files and Directories

- Act as Part of the Operating System

For additional information about how to re-create policies, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q253268 Group Policy Error Message When Appropriate Sysvol Contents Are
  Missing

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reassign the permissions to the Exchange service account.
To determine the Exchange Service Account:

1. Click Services in Administrative Tools.

2. Double-click "Microsoft Exchange Directory", and then click the Log On tab.

3. The Exchange service account appears in the This Account field.

4. Click Cancel.

To reassign the proper permissions to the service account:

1. Click Start, click Programs, click Administrative Tools, and then click
  Domain Controller Security Policy.

2. Browse to Local Policies, and then click User Rights Assignment.

3. Give the Exchange service account the following permissions:

   - Log on as a Service

   - Back up Files and Directories

   - Act as Part of the Operating System
