-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
- Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Find or Route Planning feature in any of the programs listed at
the beginning of this article, you may receive the following error message:

  C++ Runtime Error...

  Abnormal Program Termination.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- A real mode (16-bit) CD-ROM driver is installed on your computer.

- Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) are damaged or not installed
  properly.

- The program CD-ROM is damaged or dirty.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Clean the CD-ROM
----------------

Clean the CD-ROM. To do this, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently wipe the
silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper
cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the
CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion.

If the issue continues to occur, clean the CD-ROM with a damp cloth or a
commercial CD cleaning solution. Dry the CD-ROM thoroughly before you insert it
into the CD-ROM drive.


If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Inspect the CD-ROM
------------------

Inspect the CD-ROM for visible deformation or scratches. If the disc is damaged,
contact Microsoft Sales at (800) 360-7561 to obtain a replacement CD-ROM. You
can also order it online at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://parts.microsoft.com

NOTE: If the CD-ROM was provided with your computer, you need to contact your
computer manufacturer to obtain a replacement CD-ROM.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Make Sure That You Use a Protected Mode CD-ROM Driver
-----------------------------------------------------

To make sure that you use a protected mode (32-bit) CD-ROM driver for your CD-ROM
drive:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then confirm that the File System entry is
  32-bit.

  If the File System entry states "Some drives are using MS-DOS compatibility",
  you may be using real mode (16-bit) CD-ROM drivers.

  Contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive to obtain an updated, protected
  mode (32-bit) CD-ROM driver for your CD-ROM drive.

4. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.
