The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a

SYMPTOMS
========

On a server that has more than 4,094 simultaneous open connections, the
following events may be logged:

  Event 2019: The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool
  because the pool was empty.

  -and-

  Event 2022: The server was unable to find a free connection 4 times in the
  last 60 seconds.

Although the event error messages indicate that a non-paged pool may be
exhausted, System Monitor usually indicates otherwise.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because some allocations do not work in the server
service. The allocations do not work because a calculation error occurred while
attempting to grow an endpoint connection table. The calculation error causes a
large pool-allocation request that does not work. The allocation does not work
when there are approximately 4,094 simultaneous connections.

==========
