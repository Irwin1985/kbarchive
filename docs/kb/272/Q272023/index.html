The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Metadirectory Services, version 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a copy of the "Known Issues" section from the Microsoft
Metadirectory Services (MMS) 2.2 Release Notes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Known Issues
------------

1. Installer Incorrectly Reports Free Space if Greater than 4 GB

When you install or upgrade to MMS version 2.2, MMS incorrectly reports free
space if a disk is greater than 4 gigabytes (GB). Ignore the value that is
reported, but ensure that you have sufficient disk space to install the product.
We recommend-at a minimum-500 MB of available disk space.

2. Lotus Notes Client Supported

At the present time, Lotus Notes 4.x and 5.01 clients are supported by MMS
version 2.2. Lotus Notes 5.02 and 5.03 clients are incompatible. Install the
5.01 or earlier clients on your MMS Server.

3. Active Directory Management Agent Limitations

The Active Directory management agent has certain limitations. Specifically, the
Active Directory management agent does not support the following operations:

   - Schema synchronization between Active Directory forests.

   - Creation of security groups in Active Directory or synchronization of
     security groups between forests. The Active Directory management agent
     creates security and distribution groups in one forest as universal
     distribution groups in other forests.

   - Synchronization of Windows built-in groups.

   - Active Directory namespace reshaping such as occurs with domain
     migrations.

   - Renaming of an entry in the connector space or in Active Directory when
     the metaverse entry is changed.

   - Moving or renaming of users, contacts, organizational units, and groups
     within Active Directory.

   - Distributed management of distribution groups in different forests such
     that members of a group can be created in any forest.

   - Centralized policy management.

   - Microsoft Exchange version 5.5 to Exchange 2000 interforest migrations.

   - Password synchronization.

   - Cryptographic credential management, such as with e-commerce applications
     that need to publish and synchronize certificates and related credentials
     and attributes between forests to external systems and directories. Some
     certificate information (specifically, userCertificate and
     userSMIMECertificate attributes) can be synchronized. Certificate
     revocation lists and other cryptographic attributes are not synchronized
     however.

   - Management of Windows 2000 system objects. The management of Windows 2000
     computer, printer, and shared folder objects in domains of a forest, and
     the management of system containers (for example, users, system, foreign
     security principals, lost and found, computers, built-in groups, and
     certification authorities) is not supported.

   - Synchronization of security principals that contain /\() in their name
     will fail. Template modification will be required to work around this
     limitation.

Erratta The Active Directory Management Agent Administration Manual suggests that
encryption is available using the Active Directory management agent. Kerberos
sign and seal has been disabled for this release, however, credentials remain
protected. Passwords are safely exchanged with Active Directory, but the session
is not encrypted (as suggested in the Active Directory Management Agent
Administration Manual).

4. Together Administration Management Agent Limitations

   - TAMA does not propagate metaverse renames to connected directories. As a
     result, you need to manually rename accounts in Active Directory instead
     of expecting TAMA and the Active Directory to propagate renames.

   - In MMS version 2.2, TAMA always counts levels from the metaverse boundary
     node. The metaverse boundary node defines how much of the metaverse tree
     structure you might want to reproduce in the connector space. Everything
     below this node is eligible. While you can restrict the number of eligible
     parent entries that are actually reproduced, it is not recommended that
     you do this. Specifically, you should always click All Parents in Maximum
     Number of Levels.

   - 19086 : DS_RC_PARENT_NOT_EXIST Error. When you use TAMA, you might get
     this and parents are missing in connector space. To correct this error,
     reconfigure your TAMA resource and select a metaverse boundary node that
     prunes undesired top-level parent objects.

5. Active Directory Management Agent Requires Reconfiguration to perform
  Microsoft Exchange 2000 Interorganization Synchronization in Conjunction with
  the Exchange X.400 Connector

By default, the Active Directory management agent sets the target address of
contacts in the following order:

   - Use the targetAddress attribute of the metaverse (that is, if it exists).

   - Use the metaverse (SMTP) mail attribute (that is, if it exists) and set
     the target address attribute for the contact in Active Directory using the
     following:

SMTP:$mv.mail

   - Use the metaverse (X.400) textEncodedOrAddress attribute (that is, if it
     exists) and set the target address attribute for the contact in Active
     Directory using the following:

X.400:$mv.textEncodedOrAddress

This causes a problem when you address mail to a contact when the Exchange X.400
connector is being used. If a contact has a proxy address that is of the same
type as the native address type for a particular gateway, Exchange swaps the
address of the mail with the native address type for that gateway before sending
it over. (An exception occurs when a user or contact does not have a proxy
address that fits the gateway. In that case Exchange encapsulates the
recipient's current address inside the address type defined for a gateway.)
However, when trying to send mail over an X.400 gateway, Exchange uses the X.400
proxy address defined on the SMTP contact (even if their target address is SMTP)
because Exchange transports are only capable of sending mail using their native
address conventions. To correct this problem, do the following:

      - If you only use X.400 to interconnect your Exchange organizations or to
        communicate with third party X.400 messaging systems, set the target
        address with X.400:$mv.textEncodedOrAddress and disable the setting of
        the mail attribute as the target address. You can do this by editing
        the following management agent templates: CD Accounts from Connectors
        (that is, crt.st) and Secondary Attribute Flow (that is, secndflow.st).
        To do this, comment out the lines identified by #! to not set a SMTP
        target address on contacts. For example:

if $exists ("$mv.targetAddress") = TRUE 
	   then    
	      $cd.targetAddress = $mv.targetAddress
	   else      
	      #! if $exists ("$mv.mail") = TRUE     
	      #! then
	      #!   $cd.targetAddress = (SMTP:$mv.mail)
	      #! else
	         if $exists ("$mv.textEncodedOrAddress") = TRUE
	         then
	            $cd.targetAddress = (X.400:$mv.textEncodedOrAddress)
	         endif
	      #! endif
	   endif

      - If you plan to use a combination of SMTP and X.400 connectors to
        interconnect your Exchange organizations or to communicate with third
        party X.400 or SMTP messaging systems, do one of the following:

     1. Only set one of the mail (SMTP) or textEncodedOrAddress (X.400) in your
        source management agent; you may have to customize the default
        attribute flow of source Active Directory management agents to do this.
        If this is performed, the Active Directory management agent constructs
        the proper attribute for you automatically.

     2. Write a custom attribute flow script that sets the targetAddress
        attribute of metaverse object based on the system that originated the
        object.

Remember to use one of the following prefix with targetAddress:

      - SMTP:-for SMTP recipients

      - X.400:-for X.400 recipients

      - NOTES:-for Lotus Notes recipients

You do not have to modify the Active Directory management agent CD Accounts from
Connectors (that is, crt.st) and Secondary Attribute Flow (that is,
secndflow.st) templates. These templates appear as follows:

if $exists ("$mv.targetAddress") = TRUE  
  then      
     $cd.targetAddress = $mv.targetAddress
  else      
     if $exists ("$mv.mail") = TRUE      
     then
       $cd.targetAddress = (SMTP:$mv.mail)
     else
        if $exists ("$mv.textEncodedOrAddress") = TRUE
        then
           $cd.targetAddress = (X.400:$mv.textEncodedOrAddress)
        endif
     endif
  endif

For more information please consult Microsoft Exchange 2000 documentation.

6. Miscellaneous Microsoft Exchange 2000 Issues

   - Groups with attribute msExchHideFromAddressLists = True will not
     synchronize.

   - Changing group membership from Hidden to Unhidden when the target object
     already exists generates an error. To allow the group to be created, you
     need to delete the contact that represents the hidden group from all other
     forests before MMS can create the group and its membership.

   - Groups with Hidden membership (that is, nested local groups) synchronize
     as contacts to the target forest. If this contact is added to a group in
     the target forest this membership will not synchronize back to the source
     forest because local groups cannot be a member of other groups. An
     Unwilling to perform update error appears in Active Directory when you try
     to do this.

7. MMS Server Installer Does Not Modify the MMS Active Compass HTML Definition
  Page

The MMS Server installer does not automatically update the MMS Active Compass
HTML definition page on installation if you select an LDAP port that is
different than 389. The same holds true if you change the port number on which
you connect to MMS Server. To set the correct port, edit the
\zoomserv\data\http\activec.htm file on MMS Server and modify the DMServerPort
parameter with the appropriate port number by replacing the default value of
389.

8. Enabling SSL to Set Passwords Using the Active Directory Management Agent

To set passwords in MMS version 2.2, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) must be enabled.

To enable SSL:

  1. Install the Windows 2000 High Encryption Pack (that is, Encpack.exe) on
     the MMS Server that hosts the Active Directory management agent and on any
     Windows 2000 domain controllers with which the Active Directory management
     agent communicates. Encpack.exe installs 128-bit encryption software. For
     more information about where you can get obtain the Windows 2000 High
     Encryption Pack, see

  http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS2000/downloads/recommended/encryption/default.asp

  2. Configure one of the Windows 2000 domain controllers that has 128-bit
     encryption software installed as the enterprise certification authority.
     All MMS clients and servers must obtain their certificates from this
     computer. For information on how to configure a computer as the enterprise
     certification authority, see Windows 2000 Help.

  3. Create a server certificate on each applicable Windows 2000 domain
     controller. Use the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Certificates
     snap-in to create a certificate (for information about how to create
     server certificates, see Windows 2000 Help). In the Certificate Request
     wizard, type the full Domain Name System (DNS) name of the domain
     controller for the certificate name. You must also type the e-mail name.
     In Intended Purpose, enter Server Authentication Certificate. In Key
     Options, under CSP, enter Microsoft RSA Schannel Cryptographic Provider.
     Select the Use local Machine store check box. For all other fields, accept
     the defaults.

  4. Install the certification authority (CA) certificate on each MMS Server
     that communicates with Windows 2000 domain controllers and has server
     certificates installed. For information about how to install CA
     certificates, see Windows 2000 Help.

Note: By default, the CA certificate is not installed in the Trusted Root
Certificates container for the local computer, but it needs to be on the local
computer. If it is not, the MMS Server cannot be able to obtain access to it
when it runs as a server. Make sure you install the CA certificate in this
container.
