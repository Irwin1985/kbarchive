The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Application Center 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article discusses a beta test product not yet released by
Microsoft. Please feel free to familiarize yourself with this
product, test it, and report problems to Microsoft.

This article discusses a Beta release of a Microsoft product. The 
information in this article is provided as-is and is subject to change
without notice.

No formal product support is available from Microsoft for this Beta 
product. For information about obtaining support for a Beta release, 
please see the documentation included with the Beta product files, or 
check the Web location from which you downloaded the release.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Application Center 2000 Beta 2, you may see error
messages in the Application Center Events window with source "Monitoring," Event
ID 8022, and Description "Application Center -". The complete text of the error
message reads as follows:

  The Performance Log consumer could not read the XXX performance counter from
  Performance Data Helper (PDH). The status is NNN.

NOTE: XXX is the Application Center 2000 name of a performance counter and NNN is
typically a system error or an error return code from Performance Data Helper
(PDH).

There may also be a matching error message in the Application Event Log with
Source "Application Center," Category "Monitoring," Event 53, and the following
Description:

  __CLASS: MicrosoftAC_MonPerPDHError
  __SERVER: SSS
  ServerGUID: {GGGG}
  CounterName: XXX
  EventId: 8022
  GUID: {758E0DED-92F7-48D7-BFD4-47BF6D9B2CB7}
  Status: NNN
  TimeGenerated: MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS
  Type: 1
  DisplayName: Monitoring PerfLog PDHError

These error messages may be more frequent when the CPU is heavily loaded or the
server is experiencing low memory conditions.

After this error message occurs, the named counter may no longer be logged,
Health monitor triggers that are based on the counter may no longer work, and it
may not be available for display in the Application Center performance display
window.

This error does not affect the logging or use of the counter by other servers in
the cluster.

CAUSE
=====

Application Center 2000 Beta 2 collects performance information for logging and
display by using threads within the Winmgmt.exe process. This leads to resource
competition with other Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) threads, and
multithreading issues, which may result in corruption of the in-memory PDH
database that is used by the Application Center logging thread.

The 8022 error can also arise from transient conditions that do not cause the
issues described in the "Symptoms" section; in those cases, the named counter
continues to function normally although there may be a gap in the logged data.

RESOLUTION
==========

The design of Application Center 2000 is being changed post Beta 2 to create a
separate logging process for performance counter data, which will eliminate the
multithreading issues and substantially reduce the resource competition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can usually restore counter availability by stopping and restarting the
Windows Management Instrumentation service by using the Microsoft Management
Console (MMC) snap-in Computer Management\Services and Applications\Services.

If stopping and restarting the WMI service doesn't restore the counter to
visibility in the Applications Center Performance window, you may need to
restart the affected server.
The 8020 events may immediately follow 8022 events, naming the same counter. The
8020 events are caused by the same problem that caused the preceding 8022 event.
