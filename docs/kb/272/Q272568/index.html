SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience one or more of the following:

- Your server may lose network connectivity with its clients and report the
  following errors in the event log:

  Event ID: 2020
  Source: Srv
  Description: The server was unable to allocate from the system paged pool
  because the pool was empty.

  -or-

  Event ID: 2019
  Source: Srv
  Description: The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool
  because the pool was empty.

- Your server may stop accepting new user connections through Terminal
  Services. When the user tries to log on to the server that is running
  Terminal Services, the following error message appears:

  User Environment
  Windows cannot logon you because the profile cannot be loaded. Contact your
  network administrator.
  DETAIL - Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested
  service.

  After this error message appears, the user is disconnected from the Terminal
  Services server.

- You receive the following error message when you log on locally to the
  server:

  User Environment
  Windows cannot logon you because the profile cannot be loaded. Contact your
  network administrator.
  DETAIL - Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested
  service.

  Note that you may be allowed to get to the Windows desktop but you cannot work
  normally because the server is running out of memory.

All of these symptoms are alleviated if you restart the server.
