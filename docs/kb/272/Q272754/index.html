SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot microphone-related problems when you
use one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot microphone-related problems, use the following methods in the
order in which they are presented.

Reduce Background Noise
-----------------------

- Reduce background noise, such as talking, children playing and doors
  slamming.

- Use a high-quality microphone similar to the microphone that is included with
  the Deluxe version of the Microsoft Encarta Language Learning program.

Speak into the Microphone Properly
----------------------------------

Speak properly into the microphone and make sure that the microphone is
positioned correctly. Review the documentation that is included with your
microphone to verify the correct position for the microphone.

NOTE: The microphone that is included with Encarta Language Learning - French
Deluxe and Encarta Language Learning - Spanish Deluxe is designed to be
positioned slightly in front of and to the side of your mouth within 3/4 of an
inch.

The white dot on the microphone is to be positioned toward your mouth.

Verify That the Hardware Is Configured Correctly
------------------------------------------------

Verify that the microphone is firmly connected to the microphone jack (some sound
card jacks are marked with pictures) and not the headphone or the speaker jack.

If you cannot determine the correct jack, check the documentation that is
included with your hardware, or contact the hardware manufacturer. For
information about how to contact your hardware manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge

Configure the Microphone Volume
-------------------------------

To configure the microphone volume:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia ("Sounds and Multimedia" in Microsoft Windows
  Millennium or Microsoft Windows 2000).

Windows 98:

Click the button directly under Recording and to the right of the "Preferred
device" box to open up the Master Record window.

Windows Me or Windows 2000:

In the Sound Recording section, click the Volume button.

3. Verify that the Volume slider that is directly below the Mic Balance or
  Microphone Balance slider is at the top and click to clear the Mute check box
  below the Volume slider.

4. Click OK, and then attempt to record a wave audio file again.

Test the Microphone by Using Microsoft Sound Recorder
-----------------------------------------------------

To test the microphone by using Sound Recorder:

1. Run the Sound Recorder tool:

  Windows 95:

  Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Multimedia, and
  then click Sound Recorder.

  Windows 98:

  Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Entertainment,
  and then click Sound Recorder.

2. Click Record (the red circle), and then speak into the microphone.

  If the microphone is plugged into the correct jack, the green line in Sound
  Recorder moves up and down.

  If the green line moves, click Stop, click Rewind, and then click Play to
  listen to your recording. If Sound Recorder works correctly, proceed to the
  next method.

NOTE: To install Sound Recorder:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab, click Multimedia, and then click Details.

3. Click to select the Sound Recorder check box, click OK, and then click OK.

Run the Microphone Setup Wizard
-------------------------------

To run the Microphone Setup Wizard:

1. Start Encarta Language Learning and log in as a student.

2. On the Options menu, click Microphone Wizard.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the wizard.

Check Multimedia Properties
---------------------------

To check multimedia properties:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia or "Sounds and Multimedia".

3. Click the Audio tab.

4. In the Recording or Sound Recording section, make sure that the correct
  device is listed in the "Preferred device" box.

  If you are not sure which device is correct for your computer, consult the
  documentation that is included with your hardware or contact your hardware
  manufacturer to obtain more information.

Check for Alternate Microphone setting
--------------------------------------

setting, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft

  Q270764 ELL: Microphone Wizard Does Not Adjust Volume

Determine if the Sound Card and Driver Support Full-Duplex Audio
----------------------------------------------------------------

If only one person can talk at a time, or if sounds are distorted when two people
talk at the same time, your sound card may not be configured to support
full-duplex audio.

To determine whether your sound card and driver support full-duplex audio:

1. Run the Sound Recorder tool:

  Windows 95:

  Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Multimedia, and
  then click Sound Recorder.

  Windows 98:

  Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Entertainment,
  and then click Sound Recorder.

2. Repeat step 1 to start a second Sound Recorder session.

3. In the first Sound Recorder session, play a wave audio (.wav) file that is at
  least 30 seconds long:

  a. On the File menu, click Open.

  b. In the "Look in" box, browse to a wave audio file that is at least 30
     seconds long.

  c. Click the wave audio file, and then click Open.

4. While the first session of Sound Recorder is playing the wave audio file,
  switch to the second session of Sound Recorder, and then click Record (the
  red circle) to record a new wave audio file.

If you can record a new wave audio file while another wave audio file is playing,
your sound card supports full-duplex audio.

If you cannot record a wave audio file while another wave audio file is playing,
one of the following conditions is true:

- Your sound card or the driver for your sound card does not support
  full-duplex audio.

- Your sound card is not properly configured to support full-duplex audio.
