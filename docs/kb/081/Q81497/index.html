Purpose and Design
------------------

A metafile is a mechanism for storing a graphics device interface (GDI) "picture"
-- a series of GDI functions that are used to draw an image. A metafile consists
of a series of records, each representing a GDI function. When the metafile is
played back, each stored function is executed using its recorded parameters.

In effect, a metafile is a journal of GDI operations, and because all GDI
primitives can be recorded, any image that can be drawn can be stored in a
metafile. Because a metafile is in a standard format, applications can exchange
metafiles and use them for image storage.

The mapping mode of a metafile can be altered during playback. Thus, the image
can be scaled arbitrarily, with every component scaling separately, which
minimizes the loss of information for the image as a whole and which is not
characteristic of bitmaps. In addition, if the image is sparse, a metafile uses
less memory than does a bitmap of the same image.

Because of their device independence and scaling abilities, metafiles are useful
for transferring images between applications, and most applications support the
Clipboard format associated with metafiles (CF_METAFILEPICT). When treated as a
single graphics primitive, a metafile is easy to paste into an application
without that application needing to know about the specific content of the
picture.

Basic Use
---------

Creating a metafile is as simple as calling the CreateMetaFile function. An
application can store a metafile in global memory or to disk; using a memory
metafile is faster, but it does use up memory. The CreateMetaFile function
returns a handle to a metafile Device Context (DC). To record into a metafile
any function that performs an output operation or sets a drawing attribute, use
this handle in place of a normal DC handle when calling that function.

When the desired picture is stored in the metafile DC, the application calls the
CloseMetaFile function. As its name implies, the CloseMetaFile function closes
the metafile DC so that it can no longer be used for recording. The function
returns a handle to a metafile.

Now the metafile is ready for playback. The PlayMetaFile function is the simplest
way to play back a metafile. It accepts a destination DC, which is where the
image is to be drawn, and the metafile itself. In this function, GDI recalls
every stored instruction in the metafile and executes it to the destination DC.
The application can place the image anywhere in the destination DC and scale it
to the desired size by altering the logical coordinate system (see the
following).

When the application is through with the metafile and before terminating, the
application must free GDI memory used by the metafile by means of the
DeleteMetaFile function. If the metafile is stored on disk, the file remains
untouched; only GDI memory associated with the metafile is freed. GDI deletes
all objects created during a metafile playback as soon the playing is complete.

New Capabilities for Metafiles in Windows Version 3.0 and beyond
----------------------------------------------------------------

In Microsoft Windows 3.0, some major improvements increase the practicality of
metafiles. The size restriction on metafiles was essentially removed, and now
their size is limited to 2^32 bytes of information (a DWORD value for the size).
The size of each record is no longer limited to 64K, so large bitmap operations
can now be handled successfully. This size increase would be useless, however,
if the number of objects were still limited by the size of GDI's heap, so the
META_DELETEOBJECT record was added to allow object cleanup during playback.

For the object deletion to work correctly when recording to a metafile, first
deselect the object being deleted. Deleting an object that is currently selected
into a metafiling DC will work, but no META_DELETEOBJECT record is created for
that object. The "stranded" object is deleted when the metafile playback is
complete, but it remains on the system throughout the playback.

Using Device-Independent Bitmaps (DIBs) to store all bitmap information
significantly improves device independence. Using the new DIB-based records, an
application can place color bitmaps in metafiles without losing information for
functions such as BitBlt and StretchBlt. The conversion to a DIB while
recording, and from a DIB during playback, is automatic.

The ability to use a metafile DC as the destination DC of a playback is also new;
a metafile can now be played into another metafile. Thus, you can easily embed
metafile information inside another metafile or copy pieces of one metafile into
another. A word of caution: Windows version 3.0 crashes if you use PlayMetaFile
and the destination DC is a memory-based metafile. This situation is corrected
in Windows version 3.1, and you can use PlayMetaFileRecord for both memory-based
and disk-based metafiles in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1.

Limitations
-----------

Some limitations in GDI APIs do not permit metafiles to be fully functional.
Because Windows version 3.0 lacked a scaling font technology, fonts used in
metafiles did not scale nicely as the metafile was sized. The addition of
TrueType in Windows version 3.1 eliminates this problem. Because no curve
primitive is defined beyond the basic Ellipse functionality, including a complex
curve in a metafile is not possible. Although you can use the Polygon function
to draw a curve, it will not scale smoothly. Regions do not scale at all,
rendering them virtually useless for any sort of complex clipping within a
metafile.

Under Windows version 3.0, when an application passes a handle to a DC,
determining whether the DC is real or a metafile is not possible. Under Windows
version 3.1, GetDeviceCaps(hDC, TECHNOLOGY) correctly identifies a DC as a
metafile DC (return value is DT_METAFILE) when appropriate.

Unfortunately, Windows version 3.0 crashes or returns an incorrect value when
GetDeviceCaps is used with a metafile DC.

Finer Points of Object Scaling
------------------------------

A metafile that is created by an application and then passed to another
application is likely to be scaled. Scaling may alter the desired image in a way
not anticipated by the creating application that does not scale the image. Every
logical measure defined in a logical object is scaled before the object is
realized into physical form.

For a logical object such as pens, the width is transformed from logical to
physical as an x-scalar value. If the metafile is scaled in y but not in x, the
pen width is unchanged. If the metafile is scaled in x but not in y, the pen
width does scale. Thus, using a pen of width 1 in a metafile results in a pen
that is wider (thick and slow) when the metafile is scaled. If a nominal width
pen (width of 1 at all times) is desired, use 0 as the width because it is not
affected by mapping modes. A 0-width pen is drawn as having a width of 1.

Font sizing is more complicated. The two values that scale in a logical font are
the height and the width. Most applications use a width of 0 to define a font,
which results in a physical font with a width that was designed for the given
height. As the metafile is stretched in x, the font remains the same size. As
the metafile is stretched in y, however, the physical font grows bigger and
probably wider. In and of itself, this is not a bad thing, but problems arise
when the metafile makes assumptions about the width of the font by placing the
characters of a text string individually by using ExtTextOut with a width array
or using a TextOut for each character. In either case, the x-placement of each
character scales with the metafile, but the font's width does not necessarily
scale accordingly, which causes characters to overlap or be widely spaced.

The simplest way to overcome this situation is to not place the characters
individually but to use TextOut (or ExtTextOut with no width array) to output
the whole string. The text string remains intact, but its size may change in
relation to the rest of the image when x and y are not scaled identically.
Another possibility is to define the font with a nonzero width so that it scales
in x as well as in y. Doing so in Windows version 3.0 is not wonderful because
its bitmapped fonts do not scale independently in x and y. Scaling a font's
width is possible with TrueType in Windows version 3.1. Unfortunately, anytime a
font's width is scaled, the look of the typeface changes in ways not necessarily
intended by the designers, and a typographically "incorrect" typeface results.

Pitfalls to Avoid with Metafiles
--------------------------------

GDI functions that return data either do not work properly or crash the system if
the DC passed in is a metafile DC. This category of functions includes all Get
functions as well as RectVisible, PtVisible, EnumFonts, EnumObjects, DPtoLP, and
LPtoDP. Any Escape function that involves a data return is recorded in the
metafile but returns no meaningful data. A list of all functions that are
supported for metafiling is in the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
Reference Volume 1," on page 2-42.

A number of functions in the Windows API appear to the naked eye to be GDI
functions with a DC parameter that should be able to be recorded in a metafile;
in reality these are functions of the window manager interface and are not
recorded in a metafile. They are DrawFocusRect, DrawIcon, DrawText,
ExcludeUpdateRgn, FillRect, FrameRect, GrayString, InvertRect, ScrollDC, and
TabbedTextOut. Because a metafile DC is not actually associated with a device,
you cannot use SetDIBits, GetDIBits, and CreateDIBitmap with a metafile DC. You
can use SetDIBitsToDevice and StretchDIBits with a metafile DC as the
destination. CreateCompatibleDC, CreateCompatibleBitmap, and
CreateDiscardableBitmap are not meaningful with a metafile DC.

Calling SelectObject with a metafile DC does not return the previously selected
object in the metafile; it returns either 1 for a successful recording or 0 for
a failed recording. Attempting to use SelectObject with a return of 1 to restore
the previous object does not work and causes a UAE in Windows version 3.0.

Support is limited for regions in metafiles. Regions do not scale properly and
should be avoided.

Metafiles that are created by an application and then passed to another
application should avoid altering the viewport extent in order to be easily
scalable (see below for a discussion of using mapping modes with metafiles).

Metafiles Internals
-------------------

Metafiles have several layers of headers. GDI deals with the METAHEADER
structure, which sits directly before the bits. It is described in the SDK
reference, Volume 2, on page 9-7. The METAFILEPICT structure is associated with
a metafile when it is placed in the Clipboard. Its basic function is to identify
the mapping mode and drawing size of the image, which are helpful for proper
pasting into another application.

Each metafile record consists of two parts, a descriptor and the contents. Both
are defined in the METARECORD structure:

  rdSize         The size of the record in WORDs. For many records, this
                 value is a constant because the number of parameters is
                 not variable. The size is a DWORD value that allows
                 records of more than 64K, a common occurrence with
                 bitmap manipulations.

  rdFunction     Identifies the function being recorded. It can be one
                 of the META_* values defined in WINDOWS.H. That list of
                 values also shows which GDI API functions can actually
                 be recorded in a metafile.

  rdParm[]       The space holder for the function's parameters. The
                 size of this array varies to fit as much memory as is
                 needed.

The SDK reference, Volume 2, for Windows version 3.0 describes the ordering of
parameters for all possible records, detailing those with nonstandard
parameters. This description is on pages 9-7 to 9-28. Those GDI functions with a
fixed number of parameters (that is, those that have no arrays or strings) are
recorded as they are called, with the parameters stored in reverse order from
the function definition. The functions with complex parameters vary in the way
they are stored.

One set of records does more than merely store parameters: the one dealing with
the creation, selection, and deletion of objects. Instead of recording actual
handles, which is not useful for playback, a SelectObject function generates two
records. The first is a creation record (for example, META_CREATEPENINDIRECT).
The second is META_SELECTOBJECT, which has a parameter that is an index into the
object table. This object table is associated with the metafile and grows as
objects are added. Each new object gets a new entry in the table and, hence, an
index into the table. If an object is reselected into a metafile, the
corresponding META_SELECTOBJECT record references the initial object table
entry. When an application calls DeleteObject for an object that was in the
metafile, a META_DELETEOBJECT record is added. It references the entry, and that
entry is marked as open. The next object that is created for the metafile reuses
that entry and its index. Object creation, selection, and deletion depend on
proper ordering during playback to achieve the proper results. For
PlayMetaFileRecord and the EnumMetaFile callback, this handle table becomes a
third component of the metafile. It is used invisibly when PlayMetaFile is
used.

Using Mapping Modes with Metafiles
----------------------------------

The METAFILEPICT structure contains information about the desired size of the
metafile. When an application pastes a metafile, it can use this information to
control the size of the metafile output. For this to work cleanly between
applications, be aware that:

- The metafile is responsible for the window part of the mapping mode.

- The player of the metafile is responsible for the viewport part of the
  mapping mode.

To perform a simple playback of the metafile, the application sets the mapping
mode to the mode specified in the METAFILEPICT structure, sets the viewport
origin to the desired placing of the metafile, and calls PlayMetaFile. How big
is this output image? Because the x-extent and y-extent are given in logical
units based on the specified mapping mode, you can use LPtoDP to calculate the
size of the image in pixels.

If the mapping mode is MM_ANISOTROPIC or MM_ISOTROPIC, sizing is not quite so
simple. Because the x-extent and y-extent of the image are given in MM_HIMETRIC
coordinates, first convert them to pixel values. You can use LPtoDP after
setting the mapping mode to MM_HIMETRIC or use the HORZSIZE/HORZRES and
VERTSIZE/VERTRES ratios (values obtained using GetDeviceCaps) to convert
manually. Before playback, the application needs to set the viewport origin to
the desired location, set the mapping mode to the specified mode, and set the
viewport extents to the values calculated above. A properly created metafile
that uses MM_ANISOTROPIC or MM_ISOTROPIC mapping modes sets the window extent at
the start of the metafile to complete the mapping mode equation. (The viewport
itself is not sufficient; using any of the other mapping modes sets appropriate
values for the window extents.) If no desired extents are provided in the
METAFILEPICT structure, the application doing the playback can arbitrarily
choose a size.

Scaling a metafile that uses MM_ANISOTROPIC or MM_ISOTROPIC is easy -- merely
change the viewport extents to the desired size before playback. The viewport
defines the size of the metafile image. To scale metafiles that use any other
mapping mode, first transform the metafile to use MM_ANISOTROPIC. You don't need
to change the metafile itself, but you do need to change the mapping mode setup
before beginning the playback. Here is some simple code to do this:

     SetMapMode(hDC, lpMetaFilePict-&gt;mm);
     SetMapMode(hDC, MM_ANISOTROPIC);

The first call sets up the viewport and window for the desired mapping mode. The
second changes the mapping mode to be scalable but doesn't change the viewport
and the window information. Thus, the window setting is in line with the mapping
mode of the metafile and the logical coordinates within while leaving the
viewport ready for scaling as desired.

Manipulation during Playback
----------------------------

You don't need to blindly play back metafiles. Windows has a mechanism that
allows an application to inspect every record before it is played, change that
record, or even invent a record of its own. EnumMetaFile calls a callback
routine with every record found in the metafile. The application then calls
PlayMetaFileRecord to play an individual record. In the simplest case, the
information passed to the callback can be sent directly to PlayMetaFileRecord to
simulate PlayMetaFile. In more complicated scenarios, the application can change
the colors of objects or text of a TextOut, omit certain records, or simply add
new records to the playback.

NOTE: Altering the order of object creation, selection, or deletion calls can
adversely affect object management during playback. It is important to keep in
mind how the object table works when manipulating object-based records.

Applications that want to store private information (for retrieval during
playback) in the metafile can do so by calling the Escape function with
MFCOMMENT. The function to be performed does nothing on a regular DC but records
that information in the metafile for a metafile DC. Of course, EnumMetaFile must
be used during playback for the application to see and use it.

NOTE: If the metafile is placed in the Clipboard for transferring to another
application, the record is ignored during normal playback. To ensure that two
commenting applications do not become confused and attempt to interpret the
other's private data, place some kind of signature (in the form of a few
identifier bytes at the start) in the comment.

Metafile Support Functions
--------------------------

The following functions concern metafile management:

  CopyMetaFile     Creates a metafile that is a copy of another
                   metafile.

  GetMetaFile      Retrieves a disk metafile, returning a handle to a
                   metafile.

  GetMetaFileBits  Returns a handle to a global memory block that
                   contains the actual metafile internals. The
                   application can then change, inspect or record the
                   data.

  SetMetaFileBits  Creates a memory metafile using the given metafile
                   data.

Known Problems in Windows Version 3.0
-------------------------------------

The following list identifies problems with metafiles in Windows version 3.0 that
have been corrected in Windows version 3.1:

- Attempting to record the ScaleWindowExt or ScaleViewportExt functions
  occasionally causes crashes in Windows 3.0

- Recording StretchDIBits when using BITMAPCOREHEADER causes crashes in Windows
  3.0. To avoid this problem, convert all DIBs to the BITMAPINFO format.

- Using PlayMetaFile to play into a memory-based metafile causes crashes in
  Windows 3.0. Using disk-based metafiles or using PlayMetaFileRecord cause no
  problems.

- Using EnumMetaFile and causing GDI's heap to get shuffled (by doing extensive
  object manipulation) sometimes results in a crash in Windows 3.0 when the
  enumeration is complete.

- Passing a NULL hDC to EnumMetaFile causes invalid handle selections in
  Windows 3.0.

- If an EnumMetaFile stops, a global selector remains allocated in Windows 3.0.

- A stopped EnumMetaFile does not give the return value of the last callback in
  Windows 3.0.

- CopyMetaFile returns a nonzero value even if it fails a copy from a
  disk-based metafile to a memory-based metafile or vice versa.
  Memory-to-memory and disk-to-disk properly returns an error in Windows 3.0.
