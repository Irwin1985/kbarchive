-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following contains information on the NetWare SHELL.CFG file settings that
apply to Microsoft Windows.

The SHELL.CFG file is a NetWare configuration file used to define configuration
options for the NetWare shell components IPX, NET3/NET4/NET5/NETX, and Net BIOS.
It should be located in the start-up directory of the network shell programs.
Many network installations do not have a SHELL.CFG present by default; in this
case, one may be created by using a non-formatting text editor, such as Windows'
Notepad or the MS-DOS 5.0 Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SHELL.CFG accepts the following options that relate to Windows:

  

  SHOW DOTS=ON/OFF
  ----------------

  The MS-DOS directory entries (.) and (..) represent the current and previous
  directories in the directory tree structure, respectively. NetWare does not
  normally show these directory entries. This can make File Open dialog boxes
  in Windows applications difficult to use because the (..) will not be
  available to easily return to a directory level. The SHOW DOTS=ON option
  allows these entries to appear. However, this new shell functionality is not
  compatible with earlier versions of the NetWare administration utilities
  MAKEUSER and BINDFIX.

  If planning to use SHOW DOTS=ON, make sure these utilities have been updated
  with the new versions supplied in the workstation shell update package.
  Consult your NetWare documentation and/or Novell for more information.

  NOTE: With Novell Netware 3.1.1, the line SHOW DOTS+ON/OFF can be added to the
  NET.CFG file for the same effect.

  FILE HANDLES=
  -------------

  As a default, NetWare allows 40 files to be open simultaneously across the
  network. This default limit can be easily exceeded within a multitasking
  environment such as Windows. If this occurs, errors may occur when starting
  applications or opening files.

  To correct this problem, increase the default number of NetWare file handles
  by using this parameter. FILE HANDLES=60 is recommended.

  NOTE: The new Novell requestor (VLM.EXE) does not use the file handle
  statement in the NET.CFG file. All modifications to the number of file
  handles to be used in the NetWare environment should be made in the
  CONFIG.SYS file.


  NETBIOS BROADCAST COUNT=5

  NETBIOS BROADCAST DELAY=10

  -------------------------------------------------------

  Applications that use Net BIOS communications, especially 3270 network
  terminal emulation packages, require specific timing on Net BIOS broadcasts.
  If problems occur with Net BIOS sessions hanging or locking up, try setting
  these parameters to the recommended values above.

If SHELL.CFG is properly recognized, a verification will appear that these
features are enabled when the NetWare shell loads.

For more information on other SHELL.CFG options, see the "NetWare Supervisor
Reference Guide." Note that some of these options are new and will not be
present in earlier versions of the NetWare documentation.
