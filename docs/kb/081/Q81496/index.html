This article discusses modules, instances, and tasks. It covers the following
topics:

- Definitions of module, instance, and task handles

- Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) functions that deal with these handles

- Exporting and the MakeProcInstance function

- Task switching and yielding

OVERVIEW
--------

The Microsoft Windows graphical environment defines two types of executable
files: applications and dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The code in both types is
normally sharable. Multiple instances of an application or multiple users of a
DLL can share code loaded by the first instance. Most Windows-based applications
and DLLs also contain resources that are sharable in the same manner. When
Windows loads an application or a DLL into memory for the first time, it assigns
a unique identifier, called a module handle, or an hModule, to the shared code
and resources.

When Windows loads an application, it creates a unique execution context for the
application to distinguish it from other running copies of the same application.
This execution context is given an identifier called an instance handle, or an
hInstance. Part of the execution context for an application is its automatic
data segment, where the application's static data, stack, and local heap reside.
Two running copies of an application share code, but each has its own data
segment. DLLs differ from applications in that all instances of a DLL share the
same execution context, and therefore share a common data segment.

Part of the execution context of an application is defined by a set of CPU
registers and a stack. This portion of the execution context (a task context) is
given a special identifier called a task handle, or an hTask. Every loaded
application has its own task handle, but task handles are never associated with
DLLs. Therefore, the automatic data segment of a DLL never contains a stack.

Windows can easily obtain a module handle from an instance handle because an
execution context is always associated with only one module. Because a module
can have more than one running instance, however, obtaining an instance handle
given only the module handle is impossible.

DEALING WITH HMODULE AND HINSTANCE
----------------------------------

Module and instance handles are used inconsistently in the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation. For example, LoadLibrary is
documented to return an hInstance, but FreeLibrary takes an hModule. How can you
free a library if Windows provides no obvious way to convert an hInstance to an
hModule?

A number of the Windows-based application programming interfaces (APIs) that are
documented as accepting only a module handle are defined incorrectly: Most can
take an instance handle or a module handle. FreeLibrary, for example, can accept
either a module handle or an instance handle. The following APIs are documented
incorrectly; the following short descriptions of what the function does are
correct:

  DeviceMode,         Obtain and set printer configuration data. Pass
  ExtDeviceMode       the hModule or the hInstance of a printer driver.
                      (Printer drivers are simply DLLs.)

  FreeLibrary         Identical to FreeModule but is provided for
                      symmetry with LoadLibrary. FreeLibrary accepts
                      either an hModule or an hInstance. Usually only
                      DLLs that are loaded by LoadLibrary are freed with
                      FreeLibrary because implicitly loaded DLLs are
                      freed by Windows when the application using the
                      DLL is terminated.

  FreeModule          Normally called with an hInstance but also takes
                      an hModule. For applications, all instance-
                      specific data associated with the hInstance passed
                      is freed. FreeModule also decrements the usage
                      count of the associated module, and if the usage
                      count becomes 0, the module is freed. For DLLs,
                      the window exit procedure (WEP) is called, and
                      instance-specific data is freed before the module
                      is freed. The FreeModule function should have been
                      named FreeInstance.

  GetModuleFileName   Returns the full path of the executable file (EXE
                      or DLL) for a module. This API takes either an
                      hModule or an hInstance.

  GetModuleHandle     Returns the hModule of a module given the module
                      name or an instance handle. The module name is not
                      always the same as the filename of the file from
                      which the module was loaded. The module name is
                      specified in the module definition file (DEF) when
                      the module is created (NAME and LIBRARY
                      statements). Most, but not all, applications and
                      DLLs specify a module name that is equivalent to
                      its root filename (the filename without the
                      extension). Modules that have different module
                      names and filenames may experience problems when
                      the module is debugged because some debuggers
                      assume they are equivalent. You can use an
                      instance handle in place of the module name by
                      passing the hInstance in the low word and a NULL
                      in the high word of the lpModuleName parameter.

  GetModuleUsage      Returns the usage count of a module. This function
                      accepts either an hModule or an hInstance. The
                      usage count is incremented each time a new
                      instance of the module is loaded, and it is
                      decremented each time an instance is freed.

  GetProcAddress      Obtains the address of a specified function in a
                      module. Either an hModule or an hInstance can be
                      passed to the function.

  LoadLibrary         Loads a DLL. If the DLL is not already loaded,
                      LoadLibrary creates a module and an execution
                      context for it. If the DLL is already loaded,
                      LoadLibrary simply increments the module's usage
                      count (no new execution context is created because
                      all instances of a DLL share the same execution
                      context). In both cases, the function returns the
                      hInstance for the DLL.

  LoadModule          Loads an application. If the application is
                      already loaded, LoadModule increments the module's
                      usage count and creates a new execution context
                      and task context. This function returns the
                      hInstance of the application just started.

  WinExec             Operates exactly the same as LoadModule but is
                      easier to use.

At this point you may be asking, "If an instance handle can be used in place of a
module handle, why have module handles at all? Why not just have instance
handles and be done with it?" Good question. The answer is that it really
doesn't matter. You can just write applications using instance handles rather
than module handles for the functions above. This is good news because instance
handles are much easier to obtain than module handles. For example, calling
GetWindowWord with GWW_HINSTANCE obtains the instance handle of the application
or the DLL that created a window. This instance handle can then be used to
determine the module filename of the application that created the window. No
equivalent way exists to do this using module handles.

Actually, module handles have a real use. Internally, Windows uses module handles
to tag certain resources, such as window classes and hooks, that are associated
with a module and not with a particular instance of a module. These resources
are not freed until the last instance of the module is freed.

Although undocumented in Windows version 3.0, obtaining a module handle from an
instance handle is possible. Calling the GetModuleHandle function with the low
word of the lpModuleName parameter set to an hInstance and the high word of the
same parameter set to NULL returns the module handle of the specified hInstance.
The version 3.1 WINDOWS.H file contains a macro, GetInstanceModule, that does
this for you.

INSTANCE HANDLE API FUNCTIONS
-----------------------------

The following Windows functions deal with instance handles:

  Resource functions:      AccessResource, AllocResource, CreateIcon,
                           FindResource, LoadAccelerators, LoadBitmap,
                           LoadCursor, LoadIcon, LoadMenu, LoadResource,
                           LoadString, SetResourceHandler,
                           SizeofResource

  Window functions:        CreateDialog, CreateDialogParam,
                           CreateDialogIndirect,
                           CreateDialogIndirectParam, CreateWindow,
                           CreateWindowEx, DialogBox, DialogBoxParam,
                           DialogBoxIndirect, DialogBoxIndirectParam

  Class functions:         GetClassInfo, RegisterClass, UnregisterClass

  Miscellaneous functions: GetInstanceData, MakeProcInstance, WinMain

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
------------------

Execution usually enters a module's code through exported entry points. If an
application has multiple instances, the exported entry points must be able to
set the proper data segment upon entry. This applies to all functions that are
the target of a call from another module, such as functions in an application
that Windows calls (dialog procedures, callback functions, and so on). But
exporting alone is not enough to set the proper data segment. For each instance
of the application, these functions need a unique entry point, which can set the
proper data segment and then jump to the "real" function. The MakeProcInstance
function is used for this purpose. It takes a pointer to an exported function
and an instance handle and creates a call thunk. A call thunk is merely a piece
of code that moves the specific instance's data segment value into the AX
register and then jumps to the real function. Exported functions expect the
appropriate data segment value to be passed in the AX register, and move the
value to the DS register in the function prolog. The application uses the
pointer to the call thunk returned by MakeProcInstance in place of the pointer
to the real function in calls such as DialogBox and EnumWindows.

Window procedures do not need call thunks. When an application creates a window,
it supplies an hInstance value on the CreateWindow call. This value is saved
internally, and Windows uses it to set the proper AX value before dispatching
messages to a window procedure. Dialog procedures, on the other hand, are not
real window procedures and do need call thunks.

Exported functions that reside in a DLL also don't require call thunks. Because
all users of a DLL share the same instance, creating call thunks for them is not
necessary.

TASKS
-----

A task can be thought of as a "logical CPU" with its own CS:IP, stack, and
registers. A task can execute code from any number of modules. As execution
enters a module (usually through an exported entry point), the current task
handle remains unchanged, but the function's prolog code sets the proper
execution context, that is, the proper data segment.

Task switching occurs when an application calls a Windows function that gives up
control of the system, a procedure known as yielding. Because Windows is a
nonpreemptive multitasking system, applications must periodically give up
control of the system to allow other applications to run. The following
functions can cause the calling task to yield:

- DialogBox, DialogBoxParam, DialogBoxIndirect, DialogBoxIndirectParam

- DeviceMode, ExtDeviceMode (These can display a dialog box.)

- GetDC (Only if all device contexts [DCs] are in use.)

- GetMessage, PeekMessage, WaitMessage

- MessageBox

- Yield

Along with the functions on this list, any function that sends a message to
another application (such as SendMessage) can cause a temporary task switch
while the target application processes the message. Few Windows functions deal
with tasks. Applications seldom need to obtain or use their task handle.
Usually, task handles are used only for identification. The only functions that
accept or return task handles are GetCurrentTask, EnumTaskWindows, and
PostAppMessage. Enumerating all tasks currently running is not possible, using
the standard Windows functions. Applications that need this information can use
the Toolhelp library, which provides a function for this purpose.

Because DLLs are not instanced under Windows (that is, all instances share the
same DS), creating a server-type DLL that can provide services to multiple
simultaneous clients is not straightforward. The problem is knowing which client
is requesting service at any point. Some DLLs call the GetCurrentTask function
to retrieve the current task's hTask and then tag a data structure or some other
data item with this task handle. Then, each time a request for service is made,
the DLL checks its list of known client task handles with the current task. This
solution has only one flaw. Task handles are actually global handles to an
internal data structure that describes the task. Global handles can be reused.
If one task terminates and another starts, the new task can have the same task
handle as the task just terminated. This is not a problem to a server DLL as
long as the DLL knows that the original task terminated. Even if a client
application is written to disconnect from a server DLL before terminating, an
abnormal termination of the application can still cause the problem just
described. In this case, the server DLL doesn't know the task terminated. Rather
than hacking around this problem, DLLs in this situation can easily use the
Toolhelp notification services to detect when a particular task terminates.
