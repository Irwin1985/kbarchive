The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Certain hardware revisions of the AST Premium/286 computer are required for
proper operation under Microsoft Windows in standard mode, and under enhanced
mode on machines using the FAST BOARD 80386 upgrade. If a system does not have
the proper revisions, the following problems may result.

Standard Mode
-------------

- Keyboard lockup, erratic or slow keyboard input, and system locks when key is
  pressed

- Unrecoverable Application Errors (UAEs) in 3.0; general protection (GP) fault
  error in 3.1

- Network read/write errors

- Video problems

Enhanced Mode
-------------

- Problems using FAST BOARD 80386 upgrade

This article contains detailed technical information on the hardware revisions
required. This information is intended for persons familiar with microcomputer
repair and maintenance. If you do not feel comfortable partially dismantling
your computer, refer this information to a qualified service person. These
problems are not specific to Windows, but occur in other protected-mode
applications such as Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

KEYBOARD PROBLEMS OR UAEs/GP FAULTS IN STANDARD MODE
----------------------------------------------------

To prevent these problems, the following chip revisions are required:

System Board ROM BIOS:
----------------------

AST BIOS - version 2.0
AST Phoenix BIOS - version 3.03

These chips are located at system board locations U10 (odd) and U12 (even). The
AST part numbers are 107000-656 (odd) and 107000-657 (even). They are also
included in the comprehensive AST Premium/286 BIOS Upgrade Kit (see below).

System Board Keyboard Controller
--------------------------------

The Keyboard controller chip (located at system board location U50) should have
AST part number 107000-669 on the chip label. This keyboard controller is also
included in the AST Premium/286 BIOS Upgrade Kit described below.

Keyboard ROM BIOS
-----------------

The Keyboard ROM BIOS (located on the keyboard itself) should be AST part number
107210-008. The proper version of this chip is included in the AST BIOS upgrade
kit (see below).

AST Premium/286 Comprehensive BIOS Upgrade Kit
----------------------------------------------

All of the chip updates specified above are included in the AST BIOS upgrade kit,
which is AST part number 500529-001 (101-key keyboards) or 500529-002 (102-key
keyboards).

NETWORK READ ERRORS IN STANDARD MODE
------------------------------------

Some Premium/286 systems will exhibit network read/write errors, especially
during large data transfers (2MB-6MB in size). Errors displayed by Windows may
include the following:

  Cannot read from device NETWORK

  Cannot write to device NETWORK

  Network Error on drive x:

This problem occurs even at the MS-DOS level outside of Windows, but will happen
more often under Windows because of the large data transfers frequently
requested by the environment.

These symptoms are caused by a problem found in a particular release of the
interrupt controller chips used on some Premium/286 motherboards. The interrupt
controllers are soldered to the motherboard at locations U25 and U26. This
affects Premium/286 motherboard part numbers 202143-004 and 202322-001.

The chips in question are Toshiba 82C59 Interrupt Controllers, release A. They
may be identified by the large letter "T" and the word "JAPAN", followed by an
"xxxxEAI" code (for example, "8822EAI"). If an EAI code is present, these chips
must be replaced by an authorized AST service center.

NOTE: If an AST Premium/286 is used as the server, it must also be inspected for
the proper interrupt controller revision.

If any of the following network cards are used in a Premium/286, there may be
some hardware compatibility issues. Contact AST Technical Support for further
information.

  Novell NE1000
  Western Digital Ethernet
  Gateway Ethernet
  IBM Token Ring

VIDEO PROBLEMS IN STANDARD MODE
-------------------------------

If an AST VGA adapter is used, a VGA card BIOS upgrade may be required for proper
operation. Everex EV-678 display cards may cause compatibility problems. Contact
AST Technical Support for further information.

ENHANCED MODE PROBLEMS USING FAST BOARD 80386 UPGRADE
-----------------------------------------------------

AST Premium/286 machines using this 386 upgrade require AST BIOS version 2.0 or
later to run Windows in enhanced mode. Machines with the earlier AST BIOS or AST
Phoenix BIOS may not be able to run Windows in 386-enhanced mode. The BIOS
upgrades are AST part numbers 107000-656 (odd) and 107000-657 (even), and are
included with the AST BIOS Upgrade Kit described above.
