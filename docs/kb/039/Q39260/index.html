Mixed-language programming with BASIC and FORTRAN may produce an
"L2025: Symbol defined more than once" linker error. The error occurs
even if the /NOE linker switch is used. Possible reasons for this
problem are version-dependent, as described below.

The following are three known problems that make LINK.EXE give an
"L2025: Symbol defined more than once" error when linking compiled
BASIC and FORTRAN. Problem 1 is a software limitation (not a bug), but
Problems 2 and 3 are software problems (bugs) that Microsoft is
researching:

1. LINKing compiled BASIC with the incorrect version of Microsoft
   FORTRAN can cause the L2025 error.

   Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.10
   currently cannot link with any version of FORTRAN (5.00 or earlier),
   but Microsoft is working on a workaround for this limitation.
   BASIC PDS version 7.00 requires Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.00.
   QuickBASIC versions 4.00b and 4.50 and Microsoft BASIC Compiler
   versions 6.00 and 6.00b require Microsoft FORTRAN version 4.10.
   QuickBASIC version 4.00 requires Microsoft FORTRAN version 4.00.

   The following error displays if you LINK the incorrect version of
   Microsoft FORTRAN with compiled BASIC:

      The symbol __FF_MSGBANNER is defined more than once.

   The solution to this problem is to link only the correct versions
   of FORTRAN and compiled BASIC, as listed above.

2. Using math functions such as SIN, COS, and SQRT in the FORTRAN
   subroutine can cause the L2025 linker error. The following linker
   error occurs if a BASIC program compiled with /O is linked with a
   FORTRAN routine that was compiled with the correct version of
   Microsoft FORTRAN compiler:

      __ctrand1 [and __ctrand2]: Symbol defined more that once.

   Compile and LINK the code example farther below as follows to
   duplicate problem #2:

      BC BASIC.BAS, BASIC.OBJ /x/o;
      FL /c FORTRAN.FOR
      LINK BASIC.OBJ+FORTRAN.OBJ, BFTEST.EXE /NOE;

   Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC versions
   4.00b and 4.50 and in Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and
   6.00b (buglist6.00, buglist6.00b). This problem was corrected in
   Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.00
   (fixlist7.00).

3. Using math functions such as SIN, COS, and SQRT in a FORTRAN 5.00
   subroutine linked into a Quick library can cause the L2025 linker
   error in BASIC PDS 7.00 (buglist7.00). This problem does not occur
   when linking into an .EXE program (instead of into a Quick library),
   or when not using FORTRAN math functions in the Quick library.

   Compile and LINK the code example further below as follows to
   duplicate Problem 3 in BASIC PDS 7.00 and FORTRAN 5.00:

      FL /c FORTRAN.FOR
      LINK /Q /NOE /NOD FORTRAN.OBJ+QBX.LIB,,,QBXQLB.LIB LLIBFORE.LIB

    This LINK gives about 28 L2025 errors, such as the following:

       llibfore.lib(dos\crt0dat.asm) : error L2025:: __osversion :
       symbol defined more than once

Code Example for Problems 2 and 3 (Above)
-----------------------------------------

The following is a set of routines that demonstrate Problems 2 and 3
above. Note: If the BASIC program is compiled with QuickBASIC version
 4.50 and the BC /O option is not used, Problem 2 does not occur.

=== BASIC.BAS ===:

   CALL ftest
   END

=== FORTRAN.FOR ===:

        subroutine ftest
        real a,b,c,d,e,p,q,r,s,t
        c = sin(d)
        p = p/e**5
        q = sqrt(r * r + s * s + t * t)
        return
        end
