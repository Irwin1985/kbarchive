SUMMARY
=======

The sample program EXTDEV2 demonstrates the correct method for calling
ExtDeviceMode() to change the current printer's orientation to landscape. The
sample code can easily be modified to change other printer settings such as
paper size and print quality. This article discusses the steps necessary for
using ExtDeviceMode() properly and includes the GetPrinterDC() function, which
is used to change paper orientation in the sample.

EXTDEV2 is based on the PRNTFILE sample from the Windows SDK versions 3.0 and
3.1. EXTDEV2 also corrects a minor bug in the PRNTFILE sample. For additional
information about that bug, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Beginning with Windows version 3.0, many printer drivers implement a convention
for controlling print settings on a job-by-job basis, without requiring user
intervention via a dialog box. This is accomplished via the ExtDeviceMode()
function as described in Chapter 17 of the Microsoft Windows SDK "Guide to
Programming" for both versions 3.0 and 3.1. The DeviceCapabilities() function,
also introduced in Windows 3.0, provides information about the print settings
supported by a given driver. As of Windows version 3.1, changes to printer
settings are allowed on a page-by-page basis via the use of the ResetDC() API.

ExtDeviceMode() and DeviceCapabilities() are supplied by the printer drivers
rather than GDI. Because not all drivers support these functions, applications
must ensure that the driver supports these functions before attempting to use
them.

Because of the Universal Printer Driver (UNIDRV), almost all Windows 3.1 printer
drivers support these functions. The HP Plotter driver (HPPLOT.DRV) is a notable
exception. The only way to change the settings on the HP Plotter is to display
the driver's print setup dialog box, which is accomplished by calling the
driver's DeviceMode function.

Correct usage of ExtDeviceMode() and DeviceCapabilities() to query and/or modify
printer settings is a multistep process that is not fully explained in the SDK
documentation.

Because these functions reside in the printer driver rather than GDI,
applications must first get a handle to the driver, typically by calling
LoadLibrary(), and then use GetProcAddress() to get the address of the driver's
ExtDeviceMode() and/or DeviceCapabilities() functions. If GetProcAddress()
returns NULL for either of these functions, then that function is not supported
by the driver.

Furthermore, because ExtDeviceMode() and DeviceCapabilities() are not Windows
APIs, they are not prototyped in WINDOWS.H. Instead, function pointer types are
defined for both of these functions in PRINT.H included in the Windows 3.1 SDK
and in DRIVINIT.H included in the Windows 3.0 SDK. Use LPFNDEVMODE for
ExtDeviceMode(); use LPFNDEVCAPS for DeviceCapabilities(). Using these types is
important for compiler type-checking and ensures that the correct arguments are
passed on the stack. Not using these types (for example, using FARPROC) can lead
to general protection (GP) faults in some circumstances.

PRINT.H (or DRIVINIT.H) also defines the device-independent part of the DEVMODE
structure used for manipulating printer settings. Note that the DEVMODE
structure actually used by a printer driver contains the device-independent part
followed by a driver-specific part that varies in size and content with each
driver and driver version.

Because of this driver-dependence, it is very important for applications to query
the driver for the correct size of the DEVMODE structure before allocating a
buffer for it.

The following code fragment loads a printer driver, calls ExtDeviceMode() (if
supported) to get the full DEVMODE size, and allocates a buffer for the full
DEVMODE structure:

     #include &lt;print.h&gt;            // Formerly DRIVINIT.H in 3.0

     HINSTANCE hDriver;            // Handle to driver
     LPFNDEVMODE ExtDeviceMode;    // Function pointer variable
     PDEVMODE pdm;                 // Pointer to DEVMODE struct
     int nSize;                    // Size of printer's DEVMODE struct

     hDriver = LoadLibrary(szDriver);
     if (hDriver &lt; HINSTANCE_ERROR)

       return;                     // Error

     ExtDeviceMode = (LPFNDEVMODE) GetProcAddress(hDriver, "EXTDEVICEMODE");
     if (!ExtDeviceMode)

       {
       FreeLibrary(hDriver);       // ExtDeviceMode() not supported
       return;
       }

     // Get size of DEVMODE
     nSize = ExtDeviceMode(hWnd, hDriver, NULL, szDevice, szPort,
                           NULL, NULL, 0);

     // Allocate buffer for DEVMODE
     pdm = (PDEVMODE) LocalAlloc(LPTR, nSize);  // check for failure!

Often, it is desirable to query the driver for the current printer settings. This
can be accomplished by allocating a buffer for the DEVMODE structure as above,
and then calling ExtDeviceMode() a second time, passing the address of the
output buffer and using the DM_OUT_BUFFER flag (also known as DM_COPY). For
example:

    ExtDeviceMode(hWnd, hDriver, pdm, szDevice, szPort, NULL, NULL, DM_COPY);

Once the current settings are obtained, applications should use the dmFields
member of the DEVMODE structure to determine which of the subsequent DEVMODE
fields were initialized by the driver. Only fields with the corresponding bit
set in dmFields should be used by the application; other fields are not
supported by the driver.

To change printer settings, the application should not only change the
appropriate fields of DEVMODE, but also indicate which fields were changed by
setting the corresponding bits in dmFields. For example, the following code
fragment sets landscape printing:

     DWORD dwFields;

     ...

     dwFields = pdm-&gt;dmFields;     // Save this
     pdm-&gt;dmFields = 0             // We haven't changed anything yet

     if (dwFields &amp; DM_ORIENTATION)

       {
       pdm-&gt;dmFields |= DM_ORIENTATION;
       pdm-&gt;dmOrientation = DMORIENT_LANDSCAPE;
       }

     // Continue changing other settings

A driver may support modifying a certain DEVMODE field without supporting all of
the available settings for that field. For example, an application cannot use
ExtDeviceMode() to switch to Executive paper if the printer only supports
Letter, Legal, and A4 paper sizes. Applications should use DeviceCapabilities()
to query the driver for this type of information. For an example of using
DeviceCapabilities(), please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q81245 DeviceCapabilities() Function Sample Code


When the application is done modifying DEVMODE, it is necessary to call
ExtDeviceMode() again to allow the driver to merge the new settings and to
update the driver-dependent part of the DEVMODE structure if necessary. This is
done by providing both an input and an output DEVMODE (a single buffer can be
used) and by using both the DM_OUT_BUFFER and DM_IN_BUFFER (also known as
DM_COPY and DM_MODIFY) flags.

     ExtDeviceMode(hWnd, hDriver, pdm, szDevice, szPort,

                   pdm, NULL, DM_IN_BUFFER|DM_OUT_BUFFER);

DEVMODE is now ready for use in CreateDC() or ResetDC() for printing.

Changes made to printer settings in this manner are specific to the particular
print job. It is also possible to change the system-wide default settings for a
printer by using DM_OUT_DEFAULT (also known as DM_UPDATE) in addition to
DM_IN_BUFFER and DM_OUT_BUFFER in the final call to ExtDeviceMode() above.
However, this is discouraged. It is more appropriate for the user to make
changes to default settings through the Control Panel.

The following function from the EXTDEV2 sample demonstrates the above method for
changing the printer orientation to landscape:

         FreeLibrary(hDriver);

      return NULL;

     } // end GetPrinterDC

There are some common variations to the above method when calling
ExtDeviceMode(). For example, if you just want to create a printer HDC using the
current printer settings, you only need to call ExtDeviceMode() twice, as
described above. The first call is to get the size of the full DEVMODE and the
second call is to get the current printer settings. You then just pass the
initialized LPDEVMODE to CreateDC.

ExtDeviceMode() can also be used to display the printer driver's setup dialog
box. Note that this dialog box is driver-specific, and may be slightly different
than the common dialog box's (COMMDLG.dll) setup dialog box, which is displayed
by calling the PrintDlg function.

To display the driver's setup dialog box with the current printer settings, you
only need to call ExtDeviceMode() twice as describe above but with one minor
change. On the second call to ExtDeviceMode(), use the flags DM_IN_PROMPT |
DM_OUT_BUFFER (also known as DM_PROMPT | DM_COPY). The DM_IN_PROMPT flag
displays the dialog box and the DM_OUT_BUFFER flag copies the settings from the
dialog box into the LPDEVMODE.

You can also display the driver's setup dialog box and change which dialog box
controls are selected when the dialog box is displayed. For example, if you want
to display the printer driver's setup dialog box but have the dialog box
displayed with the landscape control selected, use the above approach with one
minor change. On the third call to ExtDeviceMode(), specify the flags
