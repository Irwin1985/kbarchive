SUMMARY
=======

When debugging a function with FORTRAN PowerStation, it can be useful to view
the return value of the function. In FORTRAN, this variable has the same name as
the function. Because of this, typing the name of this variable into the Watch
window displays the address of the function, not the return value. This article
details how to view the return value inside the function. Note that the main
text of this article discusses only the default FORTRAN calling conventions; the
article does not cover C VARARGS or other such function calling conventions. If
you want to use these conventions, a method for viewing the return variable is
discussed at the end of this article.

NOTE: In Fortran PowerStation 4.0 it is now possible to view a function's return
value in the watch window. When you type in the name of the function in the
watch window, instead of the function's address you get the actual function
return value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

First, consider an INTEGER function. After stepping into the function and
stepping past the function prolog (the first line of the function--in mixed
mode, the series of PUSH instructions), the base register EBP points to the
start of storage for the return value. Because this is stack-based storage, the
memory address for an integer return value would have address EBP-4. Once the
function is completed, the return value is stored in the EAX register where the
function caller can view it.

As an example, build a program with an INTEGER*4 FUNCTION, and step into the
function. If you step past the prolog and type "EBP-4,x" in the Watch window,
you will see the hexadecimal address of the local storage for the return value.
To view the actual value, bring up the memory window at the given address, using
INTEGER*4 formatting. The value next to the address is the actual current value
of the function's return value. You can view this throughout the function call.
Upon return to the caller, you can see the return value in the EAX field in the
Registers window. Note that this will be the hexadecimal representation of the
integer.

If you want to view the actual value, you can use the Watch window to convert
this for you. For example, if the EAX register reads FFFFFFFF, type in
"#ffffffff,d" to display a hexadecimal # in decimal form. The actual value, -1,
will be printed.

For all INTEGER functions, the return value is stored in EBP-4, regardless of the
size of the integer. For INTEGER*2 functions, the value is returned to the
caller in the AX register, the low-order word of the EAX register. For INTEGER*1
functions, the caller receives the value in AL, the low-order byte of EAX.

LOGICAL variables work exactly the same as INTEGER variables of the same size.
Use the same method, with the memory window formatted to view the type of the
function. CHARACTER (BYTE) variables work exactly the same as INTEGER*1 values.

REAL values are handled slightly differently. For REAL*4 variables, the return
value is again stored at EBP-4. To return the value to the function, however,
the value is pushed onto the floating-point stack. This stack is viewable from
the Registers window. When you step out of the function, the value is moved onto
the stack. Upon return from the function call, the caller then pops this value
off the stack. By viewing the changed (highlighted) elements in the FP stack,
you can see the returned value. REAL*8 values are also returned to the caller on
the FP stack, but the local storage within the function is at EBP-8. Again, use
the memory window to format the values at these addresses in order to see the
actual return value.

COMPLEX numbers work somewhat differently. They are handled as structures of two
REAL numbers. When a structure is to be returned from a function, the caller
allocates space in its current stack for the structure. A pointer to this
location is pushed onto the stack as part of the function call. In the function,
this pointer is stored at location EBP+8. You can find the pointer value stored
here by viewing location EBP+8 in the memory window. The first 4 bytes here are
the address. Note that the address is stored in the processor's internal byte
ordering. For example, if the 4 bytes read as 98 FF 14 00, the actual address
would be #0014FF98. You can then enter this address into the memory window and
view the bytes in the string. Upon return from the function, the value will be
in this location, and the value will be copied from this temporary storage to
the variable that receives the return value.

The same method is also used for all STRUCTURE types. Note that to see the actual
elements in the structure formatted in their base type, you must change the
formatting of the memory window and find the offset of the structure member in
the structure. In this case, it may be easier to view the structure in BYTE
format, and do the appropriate translations by hand. This process can also help
you to determine the size requirements of your structures, and view the
underlying memory usage of your program.

Finally, CHARACTER return values are dealt with in the same way as COMPLEX and
STRUCTURE arguments. A buffer is pointed to by EBP+8, which is used to store the
CHARACTER data. Note that at EBP+12 you can also see the value of an INTEGER*4
value, which indicates the size of the CHARACTER value. This can be useful in
tracking problems with large CHARACTER variables.

If you want to view the return value from a function that does not use the
standard FORTRAN calling convention, you can use the Mixed Source/Assembly mode
to determine the value that is being used to store the return value. Find a line
of code that sets the return value. The last few assembly instructions for this
line will be the code that stores the value. The address used to store the
return value can then be found and entered into the memory window, just as it
was done in the previous examples.
