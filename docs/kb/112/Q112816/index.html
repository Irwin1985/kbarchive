SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to locate adapter RAM and ROM addresses in the upper
memory area (UMA) by using the Microsoft Diagnostic (MSD) utility and/or
excluding memory ranges on the EMM386.EXE line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UMA, which is between 640K and 1024K, is primarily reserved for RAM and ROM
on hardware devices. The UMA is also used by EMM386.EXE to load device drivers
and terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs into available addresses in the
UMA. Conflicts can result when either of the following occur:

- Two or more hardware devices are trying to use the same memory address in the
  UMA.

-or-

- EMM386.EXE is unable to detect whether an address is in use by a hardware
  device and loads a TSR program or device driver into that address.

To determine which of the above is causing the problem, edit your EMM386.EXE line
in the CONFIG.SYS file to read as follows:

  device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems x=a000-f7ff

Reboot the computer. If the problem still occurs, it may be caused by multiple
hardware devices using the same memory address. In such cases, you must consult
your hardware documentation or manufacturer for information on resolving the
conflict.

If the problem does not occur, it is most likely being caused by a conflict with
EMM386.EXE and a hardware device in the UMA. To resolve this type of conflict,
you must identify which upper memory addresses are being used by hardware and
then exclude these addresses using the EMM386.EXE device line in the CONFIG.SYS
file. The Microsoft Diagnostic (MSD) utility can be used to identify upper
memory blocks (UMBs) in use by hardware. To do this:

1. Reboot the computer and perform a "clean boot" by pressing F5 once when the
  message "Starting MS-DOS..." appears.

2. Type "msd" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, and
  press M to select Memory. Using the legend at the top of the screen, locate
  the area(s) marked as RAM and/or ROM, and make a note of the starting and
  ending addresses of this area(s). This is the area(s) that needs to be
  excluded using the EMM386.EXE device line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

3. Open the CONFIG.SYS file and add the exclusion(s) to the EMM386.EXE line (for
  example, X=C000-C7FF X=D800-DBFF), and restart the computer.

If memory conflicts exist after you complete the above procedure, there may be
some adapter RAM and/or ROM addresses that MSD is unable to correctly detect.
Use the following technique to help isolate the conflicting memory region.

1. Verify that the problem is being caused by a conflict in the UMA by editing
  the CONFIG.SYS file and specifying the following parameters on the EMM386.EXE
  device line:

  a. NOEMS

  b. X=A000-F7FF

  c. Remove any other X= or I= parameters

  d. Remove the HIGHSCAN parameter, if present

  A sample line might read as follows:

     device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems x=a000-f7ff

2. Save the changes and restart the computer. If the problem goes away, continue
  with the steps below. If the problem still occurs, it is not being caused by
  a conflict in the UMA, and you need to perform other troubleshooting to
  determine the cause of the problem. For more information on troubleshooting
  EMM386.EXE, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  emm386.exe and troubleshooting and notr

3. If the problem is corrected by using X=A000-F7FF, edit the CONFIG.SYS file
  and shrink the excluded range by changing the parameter to X=C000-F7FF. Save
  the file and restart the computer. If the problem does not recur, proceed to
  the next step.

  If the problem does recur, the conflict may be in either the A000 or B000
  range. To verify this, change the X=C000-F7FF parameter to X=A000-BFFF and
  restart the computer. If this corrects the problem, you can further narrow
  the range by changing the parameter to X=A000-AFFF. If the problem still
  exists, try X=B000-BFFF. Once you have narrowed the problem down to a
  specific range (B000-BFFF), you may be able to narrow it down to half of the
  range. To do this, try excluding either the first half (X=B000-B7FF) or the
  second half (X=B800-BFFF) of the range. If neither of these work, you must
  leave the whole range excluded (X=B000-BFFF).

4. If specifying X=C000-F7FF does not cause the problem to recur, open the
  CONFIG.SYS file and shrink the range further to X=D000-F7FF. Restart the
  computer and see if the problem recurs. If not, shrink the range further to
  X=E000-F7FF. Repeat this process until the problem recurs.

5. When the problem recurs, edit the CONFIG.SYS file to change the first number
  in the range back to what it had been and decrease the second number in the
  range. For example, if X=D000-F7FF worked correctly, but X=E000-F7FF did not,
  change the first number back to D000 and decrease the second number, so the
  range reads X=D000-EFFF. If that works, decrease the second number again
  (X=D000-DFFF). Once you have narrowed the problem down to a specific range
  (for example, D000-DFFF), you may be able to narrow it down to half of the
  range. To do this, try excluding either the first half (X=D000-D7FF) or the
  second half (X=D800-DFFF). If neither of these work, you must leave the whole
  range excluded (X=D000-DFFF).

Notes
-----

- If you have several hardware devices in your system using upper memory
  addresses, you may need to exclude more than one range. For example, you
  might list X=C000-C7FF X=E000-EFFF on the EMM386.EXE line.

- If may be possible to narrow an exclusion to a smaller portion of a range
  (for example, X=C000-C3FF or X=C400-C7FF or X=C800-CBFF or X=CC00-CFFF.)

The MSD utility contains a memory map that may be helpful in understanding how
the upper memory ranges are divided and defined. To view the memory map, type
"msd" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt and then choose
M for Memory.
