-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Every Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) should include a termination function
called as a Windows Exit Procedure (WEP) to perform general purpose cleanup
operations when Windows unloads a DLL from memory. Under Windows version 3.0,
WEPs are not implemented properly; however, under Windows version 3.1, the
design of WEPs is enhanced to perform cleanup operations. Also, Microsoft C/C++
versions 7.0 and later provide a default WEP for DLLs in the standard C run-time
libraries. This article discusses some issues that relate to WEPs in the various
Windows environments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As mentioned earlier, every Windows DLL typically includes a Windows Exit
Procedure (WEP), which should be the last function called in the last reference
to a DLL before the DLL is removed from memory.

WEPs under Windows Version 3.0
------------------------------

WEPs were introduced in Windows version 3.0 to allow each DLL that hooked
interrupts and/or modified I/O ports to clean up when the DLL was unloaded.
However, because the initial implementation is flawed and the limitations not
well documented, the use of WEPs in Windows version 3.0 is very much limited.


WEPs Under Windows Version 3.1
------------------------------

Here are some general rules in building WEPs:

- All DLLs must have a WEP. Even if the WEP does not do anything, the WEP must
  still be defined. An exception to this rule is when you are using any of the
  C/C++ compilers from Microsoft. This exception is discussed in a later
  section of this article.

- A WEP must be declared as a FAR PASCAL function.

- A WEP must be exported by listing it in the EXPORTS section of the DLL's DEF
  file. The RESIDENTNAME keyword and any ordinal reference must be associated
  with it (so that Windows can find the WEP routine, even when there is little
  available memory, without loading anything from disk). For example:

     EXPORTS
       WEP     @1     RESIDENTNAME

  NOTE: It is not necessary to use 1 as the ordinal reference; any number can be
  used.

Changes to WEPs Under Windows Version 3.1
-----------------------------------------

Several changes were made to the implementation of WEPs under Windows version
3.1. The following comprehensive list of changes compares the implementation in
Windows 3.0 to that in Windows 3.1:

- In Windows version 3.0, the WEP is called on a very small stack located in
  the Windows Kernel module, which will overflow if the WEP function calls
  Windows APIs and MS-DOS functions. The reason for this is that the WEP was
  originally designed to allow a DLL that hooked an interrupt to unhook it
  before termination, and not as a general purpose cleanup routine. The small
  Kernel stack was enough to unhook an interrupt, however.

  In Windows version 3.1, the WEP is called on a 4K stack in Kernel, which
  provides enough room to call Windows APIs and MS-DOS functions, and perform
  any cleanup operation.

- In Windows version 3.0, if a DLL uses another DLL (which is implicitly
  referenced), the DLL's WEP function can be called after the associated DLL is
  freed. If the segment that contains the WEP is discarded while containing
  references to the associated DLL, the system crashes when the WEP's segment
  is reloaded. This happens when Windows attempts to fix up the external
  references to the already freed DLL. The fix for this problem was to keep the
  WEP routine in a FIXED segment.

  In Windows version 3.1, all affected WEPs are called before any DLLs are freed
  or discarded. Thus, WEPs can reside in discardable segments in DLLs written
  explicitly for Windows version 3.1.

- For the same reason mentioned above, in Windows version 3.1, a WEP can also
  call functions in other DLLs. The caveat here is that a DLL must not rely on
  library unload order on its own implicitly link DLLs. The Windows loader may
  have unloaded your DLL making the function call result in a general
  protection (GP) fault. The safe functions to call are any that reside in the
  core libraries such as USER, KERNEL, and GDI.

- In Windows version 3.0, under some low memory situations, the WEP can be
  called before the library initialization routine has been called.

  In Windows version 3.1, Windows calls a WEP only if the library entry point
  function has been called. The WEP code, for DLLs written specifically for
  Windows version 3.1, no longer needs to track this itself.

- In Windows version 3.0, under some low memory situations, the WEP can be
  called before the library's DGROUP has been created.

  Windows version 3.1 ensures that the automatic data segment is allocated
  before the WEP is called. The WEP code can assume that DS is valid and that
  it contains the selector to the DLL's data segment.

- Under rare circumstances, the WEP for a DLL can be called more than once in
  Windows version 3.0. In Windows version 3.1, the WEP is never called more
  than once.

- In Windows version 3.0, the USER module is notified that a DLL is freed
  before the WEP is called. Thus, any resources, such as registered classes,
  are freed by the USER module before the WEP is called. In Windows 3.1, USER
  is notified after the WEP is called.

- Because the Microsoft Windows version 3.0 SDK documentation is unclear
  concerning the return value from a WEP, the WEP code in some existing DLLs
  does not do a RETF 2. Windows version 3.1 saves and restores the value of SP
  around the call to the WEP.

WEPs Under Microsoft C/C++ Versions 7.0 and Later
-------------------------------------------------

As mentioned earlier, beginning with Microsoft C/C++, the standard C run- time
libraries that support DLLs for Windows (xDLLCyW.LIB) contain a default Windows
exit procedure WEP(), a default entry-point procedure LibEntry() in the
LIBENTRY.OBJ file, and a default library initialization procedure LibMain().
Therefore, if you link to one of the C run-time libraries provided with
Microsoft C/C++ versions 7.0 and later, you no longer need to provide your own
WEP() or LibMain() routine or link to a LIBENTRY.OBJ file.

The LibEntry() procedure in the DLL C run-time libraries performs all the
necessary initialization required by the WEPs they contain. The LibEntry()
procedure in the default LIBENTRY.OBJ file will call a default LibMain()
procedure. The default LibMain() procedure returns and does nothing useful.
Remember that no initialization will be done if you use the default LibMain().
However, your DLL could define its own LibMain() function so as to perform any
type of additional initialization processing that it needs (for example,
registering custom control classes or allocate global memory, and so forth). In
such a case, the LibMain() in your DLL will be called instead of the default
LibMain() in the run-time library.

To use the default run-time library's LibEntry() procedure, just do not link to a
LIBENTRY.OBJ file. To use the default run-time library's LibMain() function, do
not provide a LibMain() function in your DLL.

Similarly, the C run-time libraries call a default version of the WEP function at
the time a DLL needs to be unloaded from memory. The source code for the default
WEP routine is included in a file called WEP.ASM in the SOURCE\STARTUP\WIN
directory of Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 or later. This default WEP routine just
returns and does nothing useful [other than performing some C exit processing by
calling _cexit()].

To use the default run-time library's WEP routine, just include the following
lines in the .DEF file:

  SEGMENTS 'WEP_TEXT' FIXED PRELOAD
  EXPORTS
      WEP @1 RESIDENTNAME

Because the WEP's code is very small, making the WEP_TEXT segment fixed in memory
should not adversely impact Windows's performance.

However, in certain cases there is a need to link into your own WEP routine
instead of the default WEP routine provided by the Microsoft C/C++ compiler.
This is possible, because the default WEP calls an optional user termination
function _WEP. Therefore, to add your own processing to the default WEP
function, add a _WEP function as follows:

     int FAR PASCAL _WEP (int ExitCode)
     {
       // 
       // Include exit cleanup code here
       // 
       return ExitCode;
     }

NOTE: Unlike the default WEP routine, the name of your routine must begin with a
leading underscore. If a _WEP routine is not provided in a DLL, the default WEP
routine will call the default _WEP routine, which simply returns a 1. In the
case where you define your own _WEP routine, LINK.EXE will resolve references to
_WEP to your _WEP instead of the default _WEP that exists in the DLL C run-time
library (as long as you put the object file that contains your _WEP to the left
of the DLL run-time library in the LINK command line).

NOTE: The default WEP routine provided by the run-time libraries assumes
protected-mode operation only because it calls the LAR instruction in its source
code, which is a protected-mode instruction only, and therefore will not work in
real mode (for example, under Windows 3.0).

NOTE: The default WEP provided by the Microsoft C/C++ run-time libraries calls a
routine in WIN87EM.DLL, which is the Windows 80x87 floating-point emulation
library. Under certain situations, the WIN87EM library might have been unloaded
from memory by the time the default WEP routine is called. If this causes
problems, copying WIN87EM.DLL to WIN87EM.EXE and placing it on the LOAD= line of
WIN.INI will ensure the usage count of WIN87EM will never reach zero.

NOTE: Avoid making recursive calls or calling MS-DOS functions or using file I/O
in the _WEP routine, if you provide one in the DLL.

NOTE: Because the initialization and termination operations performed by the
LibEntry and WEP functions in the C run-time libraries are correlated, you
should use them both, or neither. If you use your own WEP, then you should link
to LIBENTRY.OBJ; if you use the C run-time library's WEP, you should use its
LibEntry as well.

Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 or later.
