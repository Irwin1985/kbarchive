SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the style of a secondary window in a Viewer
title. Changing the style of a secondary window allows you to remove the
minimize button, remove the caption bar, and so on. You must write a
dynamic-link library (DLL) in C to change the style of a secondary window in a
Viewer title.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The style of Viewer's main window can be changed using the Windows
SetWindowLong() function. The prototype for SetWindowLong() is

  LONG SetWindowLong (HWND hwnd, int nOffset, LONG nVal)

where hwnd is the handle of the secondary window, nOffset is the offset of the
value to change, and nVal is the new value for the offset. Further documentation
for the SetWindowLong() function can be found in the documentation for the
Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK).

Perform the following two steps to get the first parameter [which will be the
handle (hwnd) to your secondary window]:

1. Make sure that secondary window has the input focus. You can use the
  FocusWindow() Viewer command to accomplish this.

2. Use the Windows application programming interface (API) function GetParent()
  to extract the correct handle from the hwndContext variable. The hwndContext
  variable is documented on page 5-8 of the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer
  "Technical Reference."

  NOTE

  : hwndContext is a 32-bit value. Therefore, you will need to use the LOWORD()
  function to extract the 16-bit window handle. In your DLL, you should write
  the following function:

        HWND FAR PASCAL __export GetSecondaryHandle (DWORD hwnd)
        {
           return GetParent (LOWORD(hwnd));
        }

The second parameter, nOffset, should be set to -16 (which is the value of the
Windows constant GWL_STYLE) to change the window style.

The possible values for the third parameter, nVal, are combinations of the
following:

  WS_CLIPSIBLINGS      0x04000000
  WS_CLIPCHILDREN      0x02000000
  WS_VISIBLE           0x10000000
  WS_DISABLED          0x08000000
  WS_MINIMIZE          0x20000000
  WS_MAXIMIZE          0x01000000
  WS_CAPTION           0x00C00000
  WS_BORDER            0x00800000
  WS_DLGFRAME          0x00400000
  WS_VSCROLL           0x00200000
  WS_HSCROLL           0x00100000
  WS_SYSMENU           0x00080000
  WS_THICKFRAME        0x00040000
  WS_MINIMIZEBOX       0x00020000
  WS_MAXIMIZEBOX       0x00010000

These values are combined simply by or'ing them together with the bitwise OR
operator ("|"). Each call to SetWindowLong() completely replaces the previous
styles for the window with the new styles specified in the nVal parameter.

By default, the main Viewer window has the styles WS_VISIBLE, WS_CLIPSIBLINGS,
WS_CLIPCHILDREN, WS_CAPTION, WS_SYSMENU, WS_THICKFRAME, WS_MINIMIZEBOX, and
WS_MAXIMIZEBOX (that is, nVal=0x16CF0000).

NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you always include the WS_VISIBLE,
WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, and WS_CLIPCHILDREN styles in the new value. This means the
value of nVal would always be at least 0x16000000.

To use SetWindowLong() and GetSecondaryHandle() from Viewer, these functions must
be registered in the [CONFIG] section of the .MVP file as follows

     RegisterRoutine ("user", "SetWindowLong", "uiU")
     RegisterRoutine ("mydll", "GetSecondaryHandle()", "u=U")

where mydll is the name of your .DLL file.

SetWindowLong() can then be called from anywhere within the title with
GetSecondaryHandle(hwndContext) as the first parameter, -16 as the second
parameter, and the appropriate new style value in the third parameter.

To cause the main window frame to be redrawn immediately after the change to its
style, you may need to call the Windows function SetWindowPos(), which is
registered in the [CONFIG] section as follows:

     RegisterRoutine ("user", "SetWindowPos", "uuiiiiu")

SetWindowPos() can then be called from anywhere within the title as follows:

     SetWindowPos (GetSecondaryHandle (hwndContext), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 39)

NOTE: The SetWindowPos() call above is equivalent to the following function call
using the Windows constants defined in the WINDOWS.H header file from the
Windows SDK:

     SetWindowPos (hwndApp, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  SWP_DRAWFRAME  |
                                            SWP_NOMOVE     |
                                            SWP_NOSIZE     |
                                            SWP_NOZORDER)

Sample
------

To use a topic entry command to remove the maximize box from a secondary window
called MyWindow, the SetWindowLong() call in the topic entry command code
resembles the following:

     FocusWindow (MyWindow);
     SetWindowLong (GetSecondaryHandle (hwndContext), -16, 0x16CE0000);
     SetWindowPos (GetSecondaryHandle (hwndContext), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 39);

Style Reference
---------------

The following list describes the styles mentioned above:

WS_BORDER         Creates a window that has a border.

WS_CAPTION        Creates a window that has a title bar (implies the
                 WS_BORDER style). This style cannot be used with the
                 WS_DLGFRAME style.

WS_CLIPCHILDREN   Excludes the area occupied by child windows when drawing
                 within the parent window. Used when creating the parent
                 window.

WS_CLIPSIBLINGS   Clips child windows relative to each other; that is, when
                 a particular child window receives a paint message, the
                 WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style clips all other overlapped child
                 windows out of the region of the child window to be
                 updated. (If WS_CLIPSIBLINGS is not specified and child
                 windows overlap, it is possible, when drawing within the
                 client area of a child window, to draw within the client
                 area of a neighboring child window.) For use with the
                 WS_CHILD style only.

WS_DISABLED       Creates a window that is initially disabled.

WS_DLGFRAME       Creates a window with a double border but no title.

WS_HSCROLL        Creates a window that has a horizontal scroll bar.

WS_MAXIMIZE       Creates a window of maximum size.

WS_MAXIMIZEBOX    Creates a window that has a Maximize button.

WS_MINIMIZE       Creates a window that is initially minimized. For use
                 with the WS_OVERLAPPED style only.

WS_MINIMIZEBOX    Creates a window that has a Minimize button.

WS_SYSMENU        Creates a window that has a System Menu box in its title
                 bar. Used only for windows with title bars.

WS_THICKFRAME     Creates a window with a thick frame that can be used to
                 size the window.

WS_VISIBLE        Creates a window that is initially visible. This applies
                 to overlapped, child, and pop-up windows. For overlapped
                 windows, the y parameter is used as a ShowWindow()
                 function parameter.

WS_VSCROLL        Creates a window that has a vertical scroll bar.

NOTE: You can determine the current styles of the main Viewer window using the
Spy utility that shipped with the Windows SDK. Choose Window from Spy's Window
menu. Then position the cursor over the main Viewer window. Spy will display the
style of the window in the last line of the Spy Window dialog box.
