Last Modified: 17-DEC-1990

The Microsoft Library Utility (LIB.EXE) version 3.17 is available to
registered users of Microsoft language products who are experiencing
difficulty creating libraries with older versions of LIB due to
capacity limits. If you are the registered owner of a Microsoft
language product, you may obtain LIB 3.17 as an application note from
Microsoft Product Support Services by calling (206) 637-7096.

LIB 3.17 can also be found in the Software/Data Library by searching
on the keyword SS0329, the Q number of this article, or S12776. SS0329
was archived using the PKware file-compression utility.

Older versions of the Microsoft Library Manager are somewhat limited
as far as the size of a library that can be created or the number of
modules or symbols that a library can contain. These limits are not
specific because the actual limits for any particular library are the
result of a combination of factors including the number of modules,
the number of symbols, the page size used, and the order in which
items are added to the library.

One indication of a library capacity problem is if a previously usable
library suddenly causes the linker to generate the error message
"L1101: invalid object module" after some additions to the library.

Newer versions of LIB, such as version 3.17, have improved capacity
over the earlier versions. Thus, libraries with a greater number of
object modules, and/or a greater overall size, should be possible,
even though the exact limits are still specific to each particular
library.

No documentation for the Library Manager is supplied with the
application note because its usage and commands are identical to
previous versions. Any questions concerning the usage, command syntax,
or options for this version can be addressed by referring to existing
LIB documentation.
