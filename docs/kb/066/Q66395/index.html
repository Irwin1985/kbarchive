SUMMARY
=======

WINSET2 is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that contains the source
code necessary to create a Windows-based application installation program. This
program does the following:

1. Prompts the user for a directory into which to install the application.

2. Checks for available disk space.

3. Creates directories as needed.

4. Copies the files from the installation source (the program will expand
  compressed files during the copy process, if necessary).

5. Adds icons to a Program Manager group if the Program Manager is the current
  shell program.

This program does not detect system hardware, and is designed to install
applications on an already existing Windows system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Winset2.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/sample93/3.1/W31/EN-US/WINSET2.EXE)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The WINSET2 file contains an internal directory structure. The PKware file
extraction utility has a -D option switch that creates the corresponding
directory structure on the destination disk.

The following files are part of WINSET2:

BINCODE Directory

  BINCODE : Debug build NMAKE file (Microsoft C version 6.0)
  BINCODE.C : BINXZ main code
  BINCODE.DEF : DEF file for BINXZ
  BINCODE.DLG : Dialog templates
  BINCODE.H : BINXZ header file
  BINCODE.ICO : Setup icon
  BINCODE.MAK : Debug build MAKE file (Microsoft C version 5.1)
  BINCODE.RC : Resource template
  BINCODE1.H : BINXZ header file (describes resources)
  BINRET : Retail build NMAKE file (Microsoft C version 6.0)
  BINRET.MAK : Retail build MAKE file (Microsoft C version 5.1)
  DIALOGS.C : Dialog box routines
  DOS.ASM : Low-level MS-DOS routines in ASM
  EXPAND.LRG : File decompression module, large model
  EXPAND.MED : File decompression module, medium model
  EXPAND.SML : File decompression module, small model
  GASGAUGE.C : Gas gauge code file
  GASGAUGE.H : Gas gauge header file
  IO.C : Low-level MS-DOS routines in C
  PARSE.C : INF file parser
  PROGDDE.C : Program Manager dynamic-data exchange (DDE) routines
  SETUP.INF : Sample SETUP.INF file

NOTE: Due to U.S. Government rules regarding the exporting of encryption
technologies, EXPAND.C cannot be distributed.

COMPEPND Directory

  COMPRESS.EXE: MS-DOS-based file compressor
  EXPAND.EXE : MS-DOS-based file uncompressor

NOTE: It is a good idea to provide the EXPAND utility with the installed
application. This allows users to access the files on the distribution disks.

SETUP Directory

  SETUP : NMAKE file (Microsoft C version 6.0)
  SETUP.C : Setup stub loader source
  SETUP.DEF : DEF file
  SETUP.MAK : MAKE file (Microsoft C version 5.1)

The following tools are required to build and use WINSET2:

- Windows Software Development Kit version 3.0 or later

- Windows version 3.0 or later

- Microsoft C version 6.0 or later

- Microsoft Macro Assembler version 5.1 or later

- MS-DOS version 3.1 or later

The Contents of a Release Setup Disk
------------------------------------

The Setup program has two components, SETUP.EXE and BINXZ.EXE. Setup spawns
BINXZ, which actually performs the installation. If Setup determines that it is
running from a floppy disk, it will copy BINXZ to the Windows directory on the
user's hard disk. BINXZ will run itself from the hard disk and delete itself
when done. (BINXZ deletes itself only if it is copied by Setup. If the file is
already on the hard disk, it will remain.)

Because Setup copies BINXZ to the hard disk, the program can use traditional
Windows programming methods (using movable, discardable segments) and still
allow the user to change disks in Drive A without disrupting the process.

The first disk must contain files as follows:

  A:\SETUP.EXE
  A:\SETUP.INF
  A:\BIN\BINXZ.EXE

If Setup will be run from a hard disk or from a network, preserve the contents of
the BIN directory. Setup will run from a network or a hard disk.

All files involved with the installation must be in subdirectories of the "root"
installation directory. This is done to prevent the user from running the
application(s) directly from the Setup disk.

The Contents of an Example Sample Disk
--------------------------------------

  A:\SETUP.EXE
  A:\SETUP.INF
  A:\BIN\BINXZ.EXE
  A:\BIN\SOL.EXE
  A:\BIN\REVERSI.EXE
  A:\DLL\SOL.DLL
  A:\DLL\REVERSI.DLL
  A:\HLP\SOL.HLP
  A:\HLP\README.TXT

The SOL.* files comprise one application. The user has the option to install
these files. The REVERSI.* files comprise a second application. The user has the
option to install these files. The README.TXT file is required; the user does
not have the option to omit installing this file.

Setup shields the user from manually selecting SOL.EXE, SOL.DLL, and SOL.HLP.
Instead, the user chooses "Solitaire Game" and the system does the necessary
mapping to install the following three files:

  \BIN\SOL.EXE
  \DLL\SOL.DLL
  \HLP\SOL.HLP

The "nn" field in the [apps] section of SETUP.INF provides the mechanism to do
this. Arbitrarily choose one of the three files, for example SOL.EXE, to be the
"main" file. The other two files are marked to depend on the main file. When the
user chooses to install the main file, Setup copies all three files to the hard
disk. In this example, the "nn" field for SOL.EXE would be 02, to indicate that
the next two files depend on SOL. These files must be listed sequentially in the
SETUP.INF file.

When the Solitaire application is installed, Setup can create an icon for it in
the Program Manager. Each icon must reside in a group. Because an application
cannot request the list of active groups from the Program Manager using
dynamic-data exchange (DDE), the Setup program always creates a new group. The
following lines in SETUP.INF define a group called "A":

   [progman]
      "A","Solitaire Application","SOL.GRP"

The "Ic" field in the [apps] section specifies the group where the icon will be
placed. "IA" places the SOL.EXE icon into group "A."

Because the user has the option to install SOL.EXE, the "D" flag in the [apps]
section is also specified. In the "complex" version of Setup, this flag adds the
application to the Select list box and allows the user to choose to install the
application.

Each file must be associated with three of strings: the icon title, the
application's description (often the same as the icon title), and a comment
string (approximately 70 characters long). These fields are appended to the
description of SOL.EXE in the [apps] section. Finally, the sizes of SOL.EXE,
SOL.DLL, and SOL.HLP sum to 70 kilobytes. This is indicated by the "70" size
field at the end of the description.

The Solitaire entry in [apps] section of SETUP.INF will resemble the following:

  "0","02DIA","0","BIN","SOL.EXE","Solitaire","Solitaire","The most _
  tested application ever!","70"
  "0","",     "0","DLL","SOL.DLL"
  "0","",     "0","HLP","SOL.HLP"

For an uncompressed file, the line in the [apps] section is as follows:

   X   flags   Y    Z   filename  icon title app title
   v  /     \  v  /   \ /       \ /       \  /        \ 
  "0","02DIA","0","BIN","SOL.EXE","Solitaire","Solitaire","The most _
  tested application ever!","70"
                         \  / 
                         size

  The "X" field contains the source disk number.
  The "Y" field contains the destination directory number.
  The "Z" field contains the source and destination directory names.

A compressed file is very similar, adding a "C" to the flags field, as follows:

  "0","C02DIA","0","BIN","SOL.EXE","Solitaire","Solitaire","The most _
  tested application ever!","70"

The information for REVERSI.EXE is similar to that used above. However, because
REVERSI does not receive a Program Manager icon, the "IA" flag is not
specified.

Because the README.TXT file is required, its line resembles the following:

  "0","R","0","HLP","README.TXT","Read Me","Read Me","","1"

The Remainder of the SETUP.INF File
-----------------------------------

There are three other sections in the INF file: [setup], [disks], and
[directories]. The following sections provide some tips regarding these
sections.

The [setup] section provides additional information about the Setup program.

"PACKAGENAME","Solitaire"
  SETUP refers to the application it is installing by using the
  PACKAGENAME variable. This variable should contain the name of the
  product as it is listed on the packaging.

"CAPTIONNAME","Solitaire Setup"
  This caption is used by the Setup program in all of its dialogs.
  This variable usually contains the PACKAGENAME followed by "Setup."

The [disks] section provides information about the Setup source disks.

"0","A:\","SOL Setup Disk #1"
  This line indicates that disk #0 is called "SOL Setup Disk #1," and
  that it will be located in Drive A, by default. If Setup cannot
  find any files, it will also check the directory from which Setup
  was run (a network drive, a hard disk, or Drive B, as
  appropriate). After searching this drive, if Setup is still unable
  to find the file, it will prompt the user to insert "SOL Setup Disk
  #1."

The [directories] section provides information about the destination
directories.

"0","C:\SOL","Solitaire App Dir"
  This line specifies the "main" directory. This line must be present
  in the SETUP.INF file. This directory is presented as the default
  when Setup prompts the user where files should be installed. This
  must be directory "0."

"A","\CHILD1","Solitaire Directory Child 1"
  Setup builds child directories from the "main" directory. Valid
  child directory names are "A"-"Z."

Comments about the Source Code
------------------------------

The Setup program is designed to provide the maximum flexibility with minimum
modifications to the source code. However, many applications require special
functionality and some features that this code does not provide. Some useful
features that this code does not provide include the following:

- Modifying the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, or profile (INI) files. The code to
  implement this functionality can be modeled on the code in PARSE.C, which
  retrieves information from the SETUP.INF file. The process of adding a new
  data structure to the SETUP.INF file for this additional data should be quite
  straightforward.

- Determining system hardware. Setup is meant to be run on an installed copy of
  Windows. It does not install Windows. Therefore, standard Windows calls such
  as the GetSystemMetrics function should be used to determine the system
  hardware.
