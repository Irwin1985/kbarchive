SUMMARY
=======

Far pointers to data can be used in calls to the C Run-time library routines
written using the medium model. This is often necessary because many
Windows-based applications are written using the medium model, but must pass far
data pointers to the medium model C run-time library routines. Unless
precautions are taken, passing far pointers to medium model C Run-time routines
will fail.

To use far pointers in calls to medium model C Run-time routines, the
model-independent version of the C Run-time functions must be explicitly
specified. A model-independent version of a C Run-time function requires
specification of the size of the data pointers required (NEAR or FAR) for both
function parameters and return values.

Not all C Run-time routines have model-independent versions. To determine if a
routine has a model-independent version, please consult the header file
associated with the routine or the C Run-time source manual.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an application is compiled using the medium memory model, the C compiler
assumes that the application will have one data segment and multiple code
segments. Because the application has only one data segment, all pointers to
data are assumed to be near pointers. Therefore, when the compiler encounters a
C Run-time function in the source code, it automatically assumes that any
pointer parameters contain near pointers. The compiler uses the appropriate
medium model declaration for the run-time functions. This is appropriate for
NEAR data items, but many Windows API functions require or return FAR pointers,
such as GlobalLock().

To override the compiler's assumptions specify the model-independent version of
the desired routine in the application source code. The header file associated
with the routine or the C Run-time source manual can be used to determine which
C Run-time routines have model-independent versions. Typically, the
model-independent versions of C Run-time functions are preceded by an "_n" or an
"_f". For example, strdup(), a memory model-dependent function, has two
model-independent derivatives: _nstrdup() for NEAR pointers and _fstrdup() for
FAR pointers.

When using the model-independent versions of the C Run-time routines, the
compiler will not assume that the application's data is near. Thus, far pointers
can be used in medium model applications where near pointers would normally be
used.

Unfortunately, not all C Run-time routines offer this flexibility. If the routine
does not have a model-independent version, two options are available:

1. Write a model-independent routine that offers the same functionality as the C
  Run-time routine.

2. Copy the data into the default data segment so that near pointers, and the
  standard C Run-time routines, can be used.

One C Run-time routine that demonstrates model independence is strncpy(). If the
application source code includes a line similar to the following

     Char_ptr = strncpy(String1, Const_String2, Count);

the compiler will use the default declaration for the routine. That declaration
is found in the header file and resembles the following:

     char *strncpy(char *string1, const char *string2, size_t);

In this situation, the data must be in the default data segment because the
routine will use the DS register when referencing both strings.

In the same medium model applications, if one or both of the strings are in a
data segment other than the default data segment, modify the same source line as
follows:

     Char_ptr = _fstrncpy(String1, Const_String2, Count);

In this case, the compiler will use the following function declaration

     char _far * _far _fstrncpy(char _far *string1,
                                const char _far*strings,
                                size_t count);

and the application will then properly access the data in the far segments.

NOTE: When using the same C Run-time routine in a large model application, the
default function declaration will be the model-independent version. Thus, in the
example above, the compiler will replace the call to strncpy() with an
appropriate call to _fstrncpy().
