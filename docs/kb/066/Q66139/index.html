The ISAMIO.EXE utility can extract the data from an ISAM table into an
ASCII text file by using the /E switch. However, the ISAMIO.EXE
utility cannot completely extract aggregate items in a table.
Aggregate items are items in the TYPE record that are not simple
types. Simple types are INTEGER, LONG, CURRENCY, DOUBLE, and STRING.
Aggregate types are items such as nested TYPEs or an array in the
TYPE. This is not a problem with the ISAMIO.EXE utility, but is a
result of the way in which the ISAM engine stores aggregate types in
the table and in the data dictionary. This article also describes two
ways to view a database's data dictionary.

This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) version 7.00 for MS-DOS and version 7.10 for MS-DOS and
MS OS/2.

This behavior of ISAMIO results from the way in which the ISAM engine
stores an aggregate item in the database. For an aggregate type, it
calculates the size of the whole aggregate item, and then inserts an
entry in the data dictionary describing it as a binary object of that
many bytes. For example, consider the following TYPE:

TYPE nested ' This gets nested in the TYPE below.
    junk1 AS DOUBLE
    junk2 AS STRING * 7
END TYPE

TYPE record
   key1 AS STRING * 20
   key2 AS nested
   key3 AS INTEGER
   key4(5) AS INTEGER
   key5 AS LONG
   key6(4)  AS DOUBLE
   key7 AS DOUBLE
   key8 AS CURRENCY
END TYPE

If you create a table in a database with this TYPE, the ISAM engine
will put entries in the data dictionary saying that key2, key4, and
key6 are "binary" objects of a certain size. Thus, when ISAMIO later
tries to extract these items, it cannot determine what their original
data types were; it only knows how big they were. Therefore, ISAMIO
extracts these binary objects as a string (usually full of graphics
characters).

You can show what is in a database's data dictionary in two ways, as
described in the following:

1. ISAMIO can access the data dictionary. When you run ISAMIO to
   extract a database as a text file, you can specify a &lt;specfile&gt;
   parameter. For example, to extract the table called "test" in a
   database called "test.mdb" made with the above TYPEs, you use the
   following line:

      ISAMIO /E data.txt test.mdb test specfile.txt /C

   After this, DATA.TXT contains the output data. While it's
   extracting, ISAMIO takes the information in the data dictionary and
   builds "SPECFILE.TXT". Note that SPECFILE.TXT doesn't have to exist
   before you run ISAMIO. After running ISAMIO, this specfile will
   describe the data items in the ASCII text file just created. For
   instance, for the TYPE example above, the specfile created is as
   follows:

      variabletext,20,key1
      binary,,key2
      integer,,key3
      binary,,key4
      long,,key5
      binary,,key6
      double,,key7
      currency,,key8

   This clearly shows key2, key4, and key4 are seen as binary objects
   by ISAMIO.EXE.

2. The second way to examine the data dictionary is to run the
   ISAMPACK.EXE utility. If you redirect the output from ISAMPACK into
   a file, you will have a record of the database's contents. For
   instance, use the following:

      ISAMPACK test.mdb &gt; report.dat

   This creates a file called REPORT.DAT, which (among other things)
   has a description of the structure of each table in the database.
   The structure of the tables is determined by what is in the data
   dictionary. For the table discussed above, a part of REPORT.DAT
   will contain the following:

      Column Name               Column Type         Maximum Size
      -----------               -----------         ------------

      key1                      VarText             20
      key2                      Binary              64K
      key3                      Integer             2
      key4                      Binary              64K
      key5                      Long                4
      key6                      Binary              64K
      key7                      Double              8
      key8                      Currency            8

   Again, this shows that the data dictionary describes aggregate
   objects as being "binary".

Code Example
------------

To build the code example described above, you can use the following
program. To run this program in QBX.EXE, you must first load the
PROISAMD.EXE TSR. To compile and run the program, use the following:

   BC test.bas ;
   LINK test ;

DEFINT A-Z
TYPE nested
    junk1 AS DOUBLE
    junk2 AS STRING * 7
END TYPE

TYPE record
   key1 AS STRING * 20
   key2 AS nested
   key3 AS INTEGER
   key4(5) AS INTEGER
   key5 AS LONG
   key6(4)  AS DOUBLE
   key7 AS DOUBLE
   key8 AS CURRENCY
END TYPE

DIM Record1 AS record, Record2 AS record, Record3 AS record
' Code part.

OPEN "test.mdb" FOR ISAM record "test" AS #1
'SETINDEX #1, "testindex"

FOR i = 1 TO 20
   PRINT "***********************************"
   PRINT "*       Get a new record          *"
   PRINT "***********************************"

   INPUT "Input a STRING * 20: ", Record1.key1
   INPUT "Input a DOUBLE: ", Record1.key2.junk1
   INPUT "Input a STRING * 7: ", Record1.key2.junk2
   INPUT "Input an INTEGER: ", Record1.key3
   FOR j = 1 TO 5
     INPUT "Input an INTEGER: ", Record1.key4(j)
   NEXT
   INPUT "Input a LONG: ", Record1.key5
   FOR j = 1 TO 4
     INPUT "Input an INTEGER: ", Record1.key6(j)
   NEXT
   INPUT "Input a DOUBLE: ", Record1.key7
   INPUT "Input a CURRENCY: ", curr1
   INSERT #1, Record1
NEXT
CLOSE
END
