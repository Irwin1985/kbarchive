SUMMARY
=======

The following is the Windows Productivity Pack README.DOC file.

NOTES ON MICROSOFT PRODUCTIVITY PACK FOR WINDOWS
------------------------------------------------

*  Installing and running Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows

*  Problems running Setup in real mode in Windows version 3.0

*  Compressed files on the Setup disks

*  Using the Learning Windows tutorial

INSTALLING AND RUNNING MICROSOFT PRODUCTIVITY PACK FOR WINDOWS
--------------------------------------------------------------

Set Up &amp; Learn
--------------

Start by setting up Microsoft Productivity Pack for Windows on your
computer's hard disk.

Caution: Do not try to set up Learning Windows while using Windows.
You must quit Windows before using Setup.

1. Turn on your computer.

2. When you see the DOS prompt on the screen (C&gt;, for example),
  insert the disk labeled Disk 1-Setup into Drive A.

3. To change from Drive C to Drive A, type "a:" (without the quotation
  marks) and then press the ENTER key.

4. At the DOS prompt (A&gt;, for example), type "setup" (without the
  quotation marks) and then press the ENTER key. Follow the
  instructions on your screen to complete set up.

Now Begin Learning
------------------

Learning Windows, an online tutorial, makes it fun to become a Windows
user. Start the tutorial by double-clicking the open book icon in the
Productivity Pack group window. After reading the welcome screen of
the tutorial, click the Getting Started box.

If you haven't used a computer before, begin with lesson one,
"Introducing Windows," and complete each lesson in order.

If you have used a computer before, be sure to read, "Getting the most
from this tutorial" to find out how to tailor this tutorial to your
needs.

You can complete an entire lesson, watch only the demo, do the
practice, or skip straight to the summary. Click the tutorial controls
in the lower right-hand corner of the screen to move around easily
within a lesson.

Solve &amp; Improve
---------------

Got a problem?

If you have a problem using Windows with your printer, your network,
or an application, you might find the answer to your problem in Quick
Troubleshooter. Double-click the target icon in the Productivity Pack
group window to start Quick Troubleshooter.

Want to be a Windows wizard?

Working Smarter opens new windows to productivity with tips for
working faster, managing information more efficiently, fine-tuning
your equipment, printing more efficiently, and personalizing Windows
to suit your work style. Double-click the owl icon in the Productivity
Pack group window to start Working Smarter.

PROBLEMS RUNNING SETUP IN REAL MODE IN WINDOWS VERSION 3.0
----------------------------------------------------------

If you run Windows version 3.0 in real mode, you may see the message
"Cannot open program group file" while Setup is trying to install
groups into Program Manager.

To continue installing Productivity Pack, exit the Setup program and
delete some of the groups in Program Manager. Then run Setup again.

COMPRESSED FILES ON THE SETUP DISKS
-----------------------------------

Most of the files on the Setup disks are compressed. These files
are not usable until they are expanded and copied to your hard
disk by Setup. The compressed files have file extensions that
end with $.

USING THE LEARNING WINDOWS TUTORIAL
-----------------------------------

This section describes some problems you might have running the
Learning Windows tutorial.

TSRs
----

Terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) interfere with Learning
Windows. You should not activate a TSR while running Learning Windows.

386 Enhanced-Mode Application Shortcut Keys
-------------------------------------------

386 enhanced-mode application shortcut keys can interfere with
Learning Windows. You should not switch to a non-Windows application
by pressing an application shortcut key while running Learning
Windows.

Toshiba T-5100 Laptop Computer
------------------------------

If you start Learning Windows on a Toshiba T-5100 laptop, and cannot
see any instructions on the screen, try changing your display driver
from EGA (the suggested driver) to COMPAQ Portable Plasma. This driver
will not work properly in 386 enhanced mode, so you must start Windows
in real mode or standard mode.

To start Windows in real mode or standard mode:

1. Quit Windows.

2. At the DOS prompt, type one of the following:

     Type This       To Run in this Mode
     ---------       -------------------

     win /r          real mode
     win /s          standard mode

3. Press ENTER.
