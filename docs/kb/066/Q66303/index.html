Due to printing problems and proofing oversight, there are several
documentation errors, shown in detail below, in Chapter 16 of the
"Microsoft C Advanced Programming Techniques" manual that shipped with
C version 6.00 and 6.00a. These errors can cause various problems if
you are attempting to learn how to use C 6.00 to develop OS/2
applications. Some examples of the problems are as follows:

1. Sample code fails to compile.

2. Sample application fails to function correctly.

3. Running a sample application causes SYS2070 error (Unable to Demand
   Load application segment xxxxx) from the operating system.

The following are documentation errors occurring in Chapter 16 of the
"Microsoft C Advanced Programming Techniques" manual, and their
corrections:

1. Page 404; example at top of page:

      #pragma stack_check(off)

   Should be as follows:

      #pragma check_stack(off)

   Program will not compile as is.

2. Page 404; example at top of page:

      "while (s = TargetBuff)" and "while (d = TargetBuff)"

   Both should be changed to the following:

      "while (s &gt;= TargetBuff)" and "while (d &gt;= TargetBuff)"

   The sample program will not function correctly as is.

3. Page 402; middle of page (details of /ML and /MD switch).
   Page 404; bottom of page.
   Page 410; bottom of page.
   Page 412; top of page (in the paragraph at the top).
   Page 412; bottom of page (in the example).

   All define switches to the compiler should have underscores instead
   of spaces (that is, /D MT should be /D_MT, and /D DLL should be /D_DLL.

   Without this, the correct sections of the include files will not
   be used. Symptoms include incorrect program operation and link
   failure (especially obvious with floating-point math functions).

4. Page 407; top of page.
   Page 411; bottom of page (end of Step 3).
   Page 412; bottom of page.

      All the link lines should include /NOI.

   Without this, the programs that use run-time in a DLL will likely
   fail at run-time due to name mismatch. In the SYS2070 error
   message from the OS, the function name will probably be uppercase
   with a leading underscore. The actual function name is probably
   mixed case.

5. Page 411; top of page (end of Step 2).

   This step defines the building of the .DEF file for the
   application-specific DLL. The .DEF file should also include "DATA
   MULTIPLE." This fact was mentioned on Page 398.

   If this is not done, the program will likely run correctly until a
   second process attempts to gain access to the DLL. At that time,
   the second process will likely overwrite the run-time instance data
   from the first process.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
