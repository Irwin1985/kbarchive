Dear BASIC Professional Development System Customer:

Thank you for your letter concerning the BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS). Although we are unable to respond to your
technical questions by letter, we do forward your letters to our BASIC
PDS development team. This procedure provides developers with customer
feedback, which will in turn make Microsoft's products even better.
Now that we can no longer respond to letters (unless solicited by
Microsoft), we are providing the following new service:

Our toll-line number, (206) 637-7096, is available Monday through
Friday (except holidays), 8 AM to 5 PM Pacific Standard Time, and is
designed to answer questions about set up and installation procedures,
problem reports, and documentation errors. We also address most
programming, code debugging, and problem solving issues.

We are also offering a 900-number service to provide a higher quality
of service, extended hours, and a shorter waiting time. To access
"OnCall(TM) for BASIC," call (900) 896-9999. The cost is $2 per

recommend you be at your computer and have your BASIC Professional
Development System reference manuals and disks handy when you call.

There are many supplemental sources of information relating to the
BASIC languages, including reference guides and books published by
Microsoft Press, or you can contact our "OnCall for BASIC" service at
(900) 896-9999. Support is also available electronically through
Microsoft OnLine and CompuServe. One of the features of these services
is to provide access to the Microsoft Knowledge Base. The Microsoft
