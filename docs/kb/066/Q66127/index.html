Problem:

I want to implement my own pointer checking routine. If the psp
(program segment prefix) is set up in the lowest segment of available
memory, then I should be able to use _psp as the lower bounds for
legal pointer segments. However, if I write a program that compares
_psp with pointer segments returned by malloc(), I get back segment
values less than _psp.

Response:

When DOS loads an .EXE or .COM file, the psp is set up in the lowest
segment of the largest contiguous block of available memory. There may
be other blocks of available memory below the location of the psp;
these blocks of memory are usually fairly small. If DOS returns one of
these segments, when pointer checking is implemented with the /Zr
option (available only with the /qc compiler option), the segment is
simply discarded and DOS is called again. This process is repeated
until a segment value greater than _psp is returned.

You can implement a similar routine in any C program by making calls
to a function, as demonstrated below, rather than making calls
directly to malloc(). However, the start-up code still will make calls
to malloc() directly for environment and argument space. Thus, the
pointer segments for the environment and arguments may still be less
than _psp. Further, it should be noted that this routine does not
implement pointer checking; it only enables programmers to implement
their own pointer checking by comparing segment values against _psp.

Another method of getting only pointer segments greater than _psp is
to modify the start-up code so that the value of _psp is stored at
_aseglo. This is the actual location used to store the lower segment
limit when pointer checking is implemented. The code to check the
segment returned by DOS against this location, and to call DOS again
if necessary, is already implemented. If it is necessary to have
pointer segments for the environment and argument variables greater
than _psp, a similar assignment can be used to modify the start-up
code. If this assignment is done before the space for these variables
is allocated in the start-up code, they will have segment values
greater than _psp. However, you should be aware that Microsoft can
make no guarantees about the implementation of this feature in any
future releases.

If a call to malloc() requires a new segment to be allocated from the
operating system, the call to DOS will be made requesting only the
amount of memory required by the malloc(). In subsequent calls,
requests are made for 8K blocks of memory until no more memory is
available from that segment. Since the blocks of memory below the psp
are small, they may not be allocated during the first calls to
malloc(). Thus, you cannot be sure exactly when these blocks of memory
will be allocated.

Code Example
------------

void * _new_malloc (size_t size)
  {
  void * temp_ptr;
  temp_ptr= malloc (size);
  while ((temp_ptr != NULL) &amp;&amp; (FP_SEG(temp_ptr) &lt; _psp))
    temp_ptr= malloc (size);
  return temp_ptr;
  }
