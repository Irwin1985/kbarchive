SUMMARY
=======

ListHorz.exe and ListHscr.exe demonstrate how to fully control the horizontal
scroll bar on a list box. This information is also available in Tips.hlp, which
is included with Microsoft Visual C/C++. ListHorz.exe and ListHscr.exe contain a
set of horizontal scroll bar support functions that maintain the extents of all
strings in the list box and change the scrollable list box extent as required.
Additional details on these samples are found in the Sample Code section of this
article.

ListHorz.exe contains a complete sample application demonstrating a list box with
a horizontal scroll bar. The necessary support functions are contained in a C
module that can be compiled and linked to any Windows-based application.

ListHscr.exe contains the complete sources for a DLL that contains the necessary
list box support functions. These functions are exactly the same as those in
ListHorz.exe. Included in this archive is an application that uses the services
of the DLL to perform the same functions as the application in ListHorz.exe.

Windows Support for Horizontal Scroll Bar in a List Box
-------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 is the first version that recognizes the WS_HSCROLL
window style for list boxes. This style adds a horizontal scroll bar to the list
box. However, the scroll bar does not appear automatically when a string that is
too long to display in a list box is added to that list box. Similarly, when the
last string longer than the list box is removed, Windows will not hide the
scroll bar. This behavior is different from that of the vertical scroll bar of a
list box, which is added and removed as needed.

An application must maintain the width, in pixels, of each string in the list
box. The LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT list box message controls both the scrolling
range and the visibility of a horizontal scroll bar. In this article, the term
"extent" is defined to be the width of an object in screen pixels. Each string
has an extent as does the list box itself.

The other sections of this article provide more detailed information about
special considerations that must occur when dealing with horizontal scroll bars
in list boxes.

New List Box Messages:

LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT and LB_GETHORIZONTALEXTENT
-------------------------------------------------

Two messages have been added to Windows 3.0 to support horizontal scroll bars in
list boxes:

  Message                 Description
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT  Sets the width in pixels by which a list
                          box can be scrolled to the value of wParam
                          in the message.

  LB_GETHORIZONTALEXTENT  Retrieves the width in pixels by which a
                          list box can be scrolled.

By default, the horizontal scroll bar extent of a list box is 0 (zero). Because 0
is less than the width of the list box client area, Windows will not add a
scroll bar to the window until the scroll bar extent is changed to a value
larger than the list box extent.

However, the LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT message does not affect the visibility of a
horizontal scroll bar. If a scroll bar is visible, sending this message with a
small extent specified will not remove it. Likewise, if a scroll bar is not
present, sending this message with a large extent will not create one.

The next two sections of this article explain how to add and remove a horizontal
scroll bar as strings are added and deleted. The major point is that Windows
will only show or hide the scroll bar when a string is added, inserted, or
deleted.

Making the Scroll Bar Visible When Adding or Inserting a String:

When a string with an extent larger than the width of the list box is to be
added, an application must send the LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT message before
sending an LB_ADDSTRING or LB_INSERTSTRING message.

During the process of adding or inserting a string, Windows compares the
horizontal scroll bar extent stored in the list box to the width of the list box
client area. If the client area extent is smaller than the scroll bar extent,
the scroll bar is made visible the next time the list box is drawn.

The client area width of the list box does not include the width of the vertical
scroll bar, if it is visible. Consider a list box without a vertical scroll bar,
that is filled with strings. Each of these strings is slightly narrower than the
list box. When another string is added, and the vertical scroll bar is caused to
appear, Windows discovers that the horizontal scroll bar extent is now greater
than the width of the list box, and adds a horizontal scroll bar.

If the scroll bar extent is less than the width of the client area of the list
box, the status of the scroll bar remains unchanged.

If the list box is not drawn after the string is added, the scroll bar will not
appear. Therefore, if the WM_SETREDRAW message is used to turn redraw off,
adding a string will not show the horizontal scroll bar until the list box is
redrawn.

Hiding the Scroll Bar When Deleting a String:

Windows only removes the horizontal scroll bar during the processing of an
LB_DELETESTRING message. Therefore, if the string to be deleted is the longest
in the list box, the horizontal scroll bar extent must be changed to the next
smaller extent value before that string is deleted. After the string is deleted,
Windows compares the stored scroll bar extent to the width of the client area of
the list box, and if the extent is smaller, the scroll bar is removed.

If the list box is not drawn after the string is deleted, the scroll bar will not
disappear. Therefore, if the WM_SETREDRAW message is used to turn redraw off,
deleting a string will not remove the horizontal scroll bar until the list box
is redrawn.

However, if the list box is scrolled to the right by as little as one pixel, the
scroll bar will remain visible, regardless of the extent that is set. This is
done so that the user can always scroll back to the extreme left. If the scroll
bar was removed, the list box might be left in a state where it is scrolled to
the right by some amount without any way to scroll back completely to the left.

To work around this problem, always scroll the list box to the extreme left
before deleting the longest string. If a shorter string is deleted, the extent
will remain the same and the horizontal scroll bar will not be affected anyway.
Only scroll the list box if the longest string is being deleted.

The list box can be scrolled either completely to the left (in the case where a
long string still exists in the list box) or just enough so that the next
longest string is visible, assuming that the list box requires a scroll bar. The
sample code in the Software Library (described above) always scrolls the list
box completely left, using the WM_HSCROLL message, as follows:

  SendMessage(hList, WM_HSCROLL, SB_TOP, 0L);

The LB_RESETCONTENT message does not affect the state of the horizontal scroll
bar even though all strings in the list box are deleted. Before an
LB_RESETCONTENT message is sent, an application must perform the following
steps:

1. Send a LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT message with an extent of 0 (zero).

2. Send a WM_HSCROLL message to scroll the list box completely to the left. This
  method is given above.

3. Send an LB_DELETESTRING message with an index of 0 (zero). This will delete
  the first string, if there is one, and will also remove the scroll bar.

If any strings are present in the list box, the first is removed by the
LB_DELETESTRING message and the scroll bar is removed, because the extent has
been set to zero. The LB_RESETCONTENT message will then remove the remaining
strings. If there are no strings in the list box, the LB_DELETESTRING message
will return an error. However, because there are no strings in the list box,
there should be no scroll bar in the first place.

Calculating Horizontal Extents of Strings:

The previous discussion mentions the extents of strings, but provides no methods
for determining these values.

Pixel extents of strings are calculated by the GetTextExtent function. This is a
GDI call that sums the pixel width of each character in a string using the font
that is currently selected into a display context represented by an hDC.

If lpString holds a representative string and hWndListBox is the window handle to
the list box, the following steps are required to determine the size of each
string:

1. Declare the following variables:

        DWORD       dwExtent;
        HDC         hDCListBox;
        HFONT       hFontOld, hFontNew;
        TEXTMETRICS tm;

2. Use GetDC to retrieve the handle to the display context for the list box and
  store it in hDCListBox:

  hDCListBox = GetDC(hWndListBox);

3. Send the list box a WM_GETFONT message to retrieve the handle to the font
  that the list box is using, and store this handle in hFontNew:

  hFontNew = SendMessage(hWndListBox, WM_GETFONT, NULL, NULL);

4. Use SelectObject to select the font into the display context. Retain the
  return value from the SelectObject call in hFontOld:

  hFontOld = SelectObject(hDCListBox, hFontNew);

5. Call GetTextMetrics to get additional information about the font being used:

  GetTextMetrics(hDC, (LPTEXTMETRIC)&amp;tm);

6. For each string, the value of the extent to be used is calculated as follows:

  dwExtent = GetTextExtent(hDCListBox, lpString, strlen(lpString))
               + tm.tmAveCharWidth;

7. After all the extents have been calculated, select the old font back into
  hDCListBox and then release it:

  SelectObject(hDCListBox, hFontOld);
        ReleaseDC(hWndListBox, hDCListBox);

There is a reason for step 5 and adding the additional width to the string in
step 6 above. If the largest value returned by GetTextExtent is used as the
parameter in the LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT message, the longest string will not
show completely when the list box is scrolled completely to the right. A few
pixels are clipped by the right border on the list box.

The tmAveCharWidth field in the TEXTMETRIC structure provides a consistent number
of pixels to add to the length of the string, no matter what font is presently
in use. This buffer space keeps the strings from being clipped.

As a side note, the value of tmAveCharWidth is the number of pixels by which the
list box is scrolled horizontally when the scroll bar arrows are clicked. If a
fixed pitch font is used, the list box is scrolled horizontally by one character
for each click.

Maintenance of All Extents in List Box:

Many possible methods can be used to maintain a list of the extents of the
strings in the list box. One of the most convenient methods is to use property
lists, as shown in the sample code.

Every window has a property list associated with it. Each property is a string
and an associated data handle. A window stores and retrieves each data handle
using the string that labels the handle.

A sorted list of the extents for strings in the list box can be saved in a local
or global memory object. This allows each window to keep its own list and does
not require that the application maintain a mapping from the list box to the
data handle itself. The list of extents should be sorted in descending order, so
that the first extent in the list is that of the longest string in the list box.
Keeping this list sorted also allows the application to use a binary search to
find an extent in the list when one is being inserted or deleted.

When a new string is added, insert that string's extent into the list,
maintaining the sorted order. If the new extent is placed at the top of the
list, send an LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT message to the list box specifying the new
extent. Do not send the message for an extent that is not the largest.

When a string is deleted, remove that string's extent from the list. If the
extent is the first in the list, then that string is the longest in the list
box. In this case, send an LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT to the list box specifying the
next largest extent in the list. If a smaller string is deleted, do not send the
message.

When an LB_RESETCONTENT message is used, clear the entire list of extents. Send
an LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT message specifying an extent of 0 (zero), followed by
an LB_DELETESTRING as outlined in the last part of the section above titled
"Hiding the Scroll Bar When Deleting a String."

Sample Code:

As mentioned above, there are two archives in the Microsoft Software Library:
LISTHORZ and LISTHSCR. Each of these samples provides five support functions
that greatly facilitate the maintenance of horizontal scroll bars in list
boxes.

In LISTHORZ, these functions are found in the file LISTHELP.C. This file can be
compiled separately and linked into an application.

LISTHSCR contains the source files for a DLL that provides these five support
functions. The C file for the DLL is exactly the same as in LISTHORZ, except
that its name has changed. This archive also includes a LISTHORZ program that
uses the services of the DLL to perform the same functions as the program in the
other archive. The file LISTHAPI.H is the include file containing prototypes of
the functions exported by the DLL. Also included is an import library,
LISTHSCR.LIB, that is generated by the makefile.

The DLL is most useful because it can support horizontal scroll bars in any
number of list boxes in any number of applications.

The remainder of this article documents the support functions:

  BOOL FInitListboxExtents(HWND hList)

Allocates local memory to store a list of string extents for the list box
identified by hList. The handle to this local memory is saved in the property
list of the list box. This function should be called after the list box is
created, such as during WM_INITDIALOG processing.

  Parameters: hList HWND Handle to the list box that will use a horizontal
  scroll bar. Return Value: BOOL TRUE if there are no errors, FALSE if memory
  could not be allocated. BOOL FFreeListboxExtents(HWND hList)

Frees the memory allocated for the extent list of the list box identified by
hList. The property that stores the memory handle set by FInitListboxExtents is
removed. This function should be called when the list box is being destroyed.

  Parameters: hList HWND Handle to the list box that was previously used with
  FInitListboxExtents Return Value: BOOL TRUE if there are no errors, FALSE if
  memory could not be freed, in which case the property is not removed.

  void ResetListboxExtents(HWND hList)

Removes all previously saved extents in the extent list. This is accomplished by
calling FFreeListboxExtents and FInitListboxExtents in succession. The
horizontal extent of the list box is set to 0 (zero) and any horizontal scroll
bar is removed. This function should be called before an LB_RESETCONTENT message
is sent to the list box.

  Parameters: hList HWND Handle to the list box that will be reset. Return
  Value: none

  WORD WAddExtentEntry(HWND hList, LPSTR psz)

Adds an extent entry into the list box's extent list. The extent added is that of
the string pointed to by psz using the current font in the list box. If the
extent added is larger than any other in the extent list, an
LB_SETHORIZONTALEXTENT message is sent to the list box with this new extent.

This function must be called before the string is added to the list box with
LB_ADDSTRING or LB_INSERTSTRING.

  Parameters: hList HWND Handle to the list box to which the string is to be
  added. psz LPSTR Pointer to string that is to be added. This function must be
  called before the string is added so that the horizontal scroll bar will be
  properly maintained. Return Value: WORD One of these three values: 0 if the
  string added was not the longest string in the list box and the visibility of
  the horizontal scroll bar did not change. The extent of the string added, if
  the added string was the longest and the visibility of the scroll bar may
  have changed. -1 for an error.

  WORD WRemoveExtentEntry(HWND hList, WORD iSel)

Removes the extent entry of the string identified by index iSel in the list box.
If the string to be removed is the longest in the list box, the list box is
scrolled completely to the left and the horizontal extent is set to that of the
next longest string.

This function must be called before an LB_DELETESTRING message is sent to the
list box.

  Parameters: hList HWND Handle to the list box from which a string is to be
  removed. iSel WORD Index of the string to be removed. Return Value: WORD One
  of these three values: 0 if the string removed was not the longest in the
  list box and the visibility of the horizontal scroll bar did not change The
  extent of the string deleted, if the deleted string was the longest and the
  visibility of the scroll bar may have changed. -1 for an error.
