-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the SNA Server OLE DB Provider for DB2 from an Active Server Page
(ASP), Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) may stop responding (hang) or
may terminate without generating any errors.

This problem is most likely to occur on systems that are under stress or heavy
load when multiple clients are trying to access the ASP and therefore the host
by way of the OLE DB Provider. In addition, multi-processor systems may be more
likely to experience the problem.

CAUSE
=====

The OLE DB Provider for DB2 does not protect the statement list on the agent
(Db2serv.exe), which is used for communicating with the host system. The problem
described here may occur when two or more clients try to access the same
statement list.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+------------------------------------+
| File name    | Date       | Time   | 
+------------------------------------+
| Db2oledb.dll | 12/08/2000 | 1:20AM | 
+------------------------------------+
| Db2serv.exe  | 12/08/2000 | 1:19AM | 
+------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) and 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4).
