-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) contains a Server for NFS component. When the
Server for NFS component is installed and the service is running, the properties
dialog box for a folder in Windows Explorer contains an NFS Sharing tab. The
options on the NFS Sharing tab allow the administrator to export the volume by
using the Server for NFS component.

If a program opens the Kernel-mode component of the Server for NFS component, and
a user then stops and restarts the Server for NFS component, the NFS Sharing tab
may disappear from the Windows Explorer property dialog box.

If you run Performance Monitor and add counters, Performance Monitor opens a
handle to every object from which it can collect counters, even if the counters
for that object were not requested.


CAUSE
=====

Performance Monitor has an open handle to the kernel component of the NFS
server. Even if you issue a command to stop the NFS server, the Kernel-mode
portion of the NFS Server component never stops. It is in a STOP_PENDING state.
After Performance Monitor closes its handle, the kernel component of the NFS
Server service can stop.

The User-mode portion of the Server for NFS service does not pay attention to the
state of the Kernel-mode component. If the Kernel-mode portion is not in a
stopped state, the User-mode portion assumes that the Kernel-mode portion is
running.
