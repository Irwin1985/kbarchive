SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Millennium Edition (Me) are
flexible on custom, user-defined page sizes. However, on systems that are
running Windows NT and Windows 2000, you must define all page sizes as a form
before you can use them. This article describes how to print custom page sizes
on Windows NT and Windows 2000 and includes a code sample that demonstrates how
to add, select, and delete custom forms.

NOTE: Because of the behavior of the Visual Basic 5.0 Printer object, the changes
to the DEVMODE that are made by the call to ResetDC has no effect. Thus, the
code sample in this article does not work from Visual Basic 5.0.

This article is divided into the following sections:

- DEVMODE Members That Define or Select Page Size
- How to Programmatically Select a Form
- Form Sources and Functions
- Steps to Add a Local Print Driver for a Network Printer
- Step-by-Step Example

MORE INFORMATION
================

DEVMODE Members That Define or Select Page Size:

Printer drivers store their default settings in a structure called the DEVMODE.
When you define or select a page size, four members of this structure may be
involved:

- dmPaperSize
- dmPaperLength
- dmPaperWidth
- dmFormName

The dmPaperLength and dmPaperWidth members contain values on all operating
systems, but they can only be used to select or define a size on systems that
are running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me. The dmFormName member is only
valid for systems that are running Windows NT or Windows 2000. The dmPaperSize
member can be used on any 32-bit Windows operating system, as long as the value
that is assigned to it corresponds to a size or form that is defined on that
system.

Thus, on systems that are running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me, you can
define custom page sizes by height (length) and width or by a predefined paper
size. Windows NT-based or Windows 2000-based systems only use defined forms for
page sizes, which you can select in one of two ways: set dmFormName or assign a
valid "constant" value to dmPaperSize.

To use a particular paper size on Windows NT or Windows 2000, you must define a
form for it. The Visual Basic Printer object has PageSize, Height, and Width
properties that expose the dmPaperSize, dmPaperLength, and dmPaperWidth members
of the DEVMODE. However, the Printer object does not expose a way to select a
form by name, nor does it have a method to add a custom form at run time. We
must use the Win32 application programming interface (API) to create a custom
form and/or select a form by name.

How to Programmatically Select a Form:

This article uses the EnumForms basic process to list all forms that are
supported for the current printer and to check the height and width of each
form. If the specified size is found, it is selected. If it is not found, the
code adds the form and then selects it.

There are three ways to programmatically select a form:

- Retrieve the printer's DEVMODE structure, set the dmFormName member, and use
  the ResetDC function to set this form as the current form for the Device
  Context (DC) of the printer. When this form is selected for the DC, it is
  only selected for the calling process and does not change the driver's
  default setting. This does not require any special permissions. This method
  is preferred for applications that change a printer's settings.

- Call the SetForm function to change the default form for the printer driver.
  This method requires full access permissions to the driver. When the default
  form is changed, it affects every application that uses this driver to print.
  If this is a network printer, most users do not have the necessary
  permissions to make this call.

- Assign the system-defined value for the custom form to Printer.PaperSize.

Only the first method is demonstrated in this article's sample code; the sample
does not demonstrate the call to SetForm or the value assignment to
Printer.PaperSize. The sample captures the system-assigned value of the new
custom form by returning the value of its ordinal position in the list that
EnumForms returns. Note that this only works for custom forms. Predefined forms
have constant values assigned to them that do not correspond to their ordinal
position in this list.

When you use the AddForm function to add your custom form, the form is given its
own number, if available, which then remains consistent across all printers that
use the form. In this case, the form is defined and given a "constant" value for
the current system. You can then assign this value to Printer.PaperSize to
select it. However, because the number assignment is simply one more than the
number of forms that is listed for the current printer when the form was added,
this number may not be available because a predefined form is already using that
number. Therefore, it is not recommended that you use this value to select a
form, and this value is not demonstrated here. If you use this number
assignment, and the value for it is unavailable, it will either select the wrong
form or raise run-time error 380: "Invalid Property Value."

Form Sources and Functions:

Most forms are defined by the operating system and are available to all local
printers. However, forms for network printers are defined on the printer server.
Some forms may be defined specifically for a given printer driver and only
appear in the list for that driver. Another source for forms is custom-defined
or user-defined forms, which can be created manually or through code and are
available to all local printers on the system. Both printer-specific and
user-defined forms are stored in the registry.

The sample in this article uses a few function calls that are related to forms.
Briefly, the key functions are as follows:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Function   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| EnumForms  | Returns information about all of the forms that are supported for the current printer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| AddForm    | Adds a custom form to the system. The data on this form is stored in the registry. Thus, custom forms are available for all printers, not just the printer that was current when the form was added. The numeric value that the system assigns to this form is simply one number higher than the number of forms that EnumForms returns for the current printer. You must have full rights to the driver to call this function. If you cannot add a form manually, this function call also fails for you. For this reason, you usually cannot use this function on network printers. | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DeleteForm | Removes a custom form. However, this function does not delete the standard forms that the operating system defines and returns error code 87 if this is attempted. This function also requires the same rights as AddForm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Although the sample does not use the following functions, it does include the
Declares for these functions:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Function | Description                                                                                                                                        | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GetForm  | Retrieves information about a specific form.                                                                                                       | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SetForm  | Sets the default form information for the specified printer. This function requires full rights, just as changing any printer driver setting does. | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

It must be emphasized that some of these functions require Full Control
permissions on the printer. Therefore, the SetForm, AddForm, and DeleteForm
functions almost never work for printers that are installed as "network
printers." This is because the drivers for network printers are not installed
locally but reside on the printer server, and your User account is unlikely to
have Administrator rights on the printer server. This differs from systems that
are running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me, in which all printer drivers
(even network printers) are always installed locally. However, you can install
network printers as local printers in Windows NT or Windows 2000 and set the
Port to the printer queue. Then you can use these functions to make changes
without affecting other users who share the printer.

Steps to Add a Local Printer Driver for a Network Printer:

1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Printers. Double-click
  Add Printer to start the Add Printer Wizard.

2. When prompted, make sure that you click Local printer or My Computer and NOT
  Network printer. Although you will connect to a network printer, you want to
  use a driver on My Computer. Click Next to continue.

3. On Windows NT, click Add Port. On Windows 2000, click Create a new port.

4. In the drop-down list box, click Local Port. On Windows NT, click New Port.
  On Windows 2000, click Next, and you are prompted for a Port Name.

5. Type the location of the printer on the network. For example:

  "\\printserver\printername" (without the quotation marks)

  where you use the exact path name to the printer.

6. Click OK, and complete the wizard.

If you change the printer properties for the active printer, you still affect all
applications that use that printer, but only for the local system.

IMPORTANT When you use custom page sizes, the behavior differs between Laser or
Ink Jet printers and Dot Matrix or impact printers. Obviously, no printer
accepts a page size that is wider than it can physically accommodate. But
printers that use continuous feed paper can be flexible on page sizes because
they print one line at a time. Alternately, Laser and Ink Jet printers print one
page at a time. Thus, for example, when you print to a Dot Matrix printer (which
uses continuous feed paper), you can easily see the page length during a form
feed because the printer advances to the place where it expects the top of the
next page to start, regardless of the physical size of the paper that it is
using. On Laser and Ink Jet printers, a form feed always ejects a full physical
page regardless of the page size it expects. Also, on most Laser printers, the
display reads "Load Custom" (or similar) when you ask the printer to print on a
user-defined page size.

Step-by-Step Example:

1. Set a local printer as the default printer. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

  b. Right-click the icon for a local printer, and then click "Set as default".

2. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

3. Add three CommandButtons and a ListBox control to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into the module of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
  Dim FormName As String

  FormName = "MyCustomForm"   ' Use special, user-defined form.
  UseForm FormName
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
  Dim FormName As String

  ' Get FormName from the ListBox.
  On Error GoTo ListBoxERR    ' Trap for no selection.
  FormName = Mid(List1.Text, 1, InStr(1, List1.Text, " -") - 1)
  On Error GoTo 0             ' Turn off Error trap.

  UseForm FormName

  Exit Sub
  ListBoxERR:
  MsgBox "Select a printer from the ListBox before using this option.", _
     vbExclamation
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command3_Click()
  Dim RetVal As Long
  Dim PrinterHandle As Long   ' Handle to printer
  Dim PrinterName As String
  Dim FormName As String
  Dim Continue As Long

  ' Delete form that is selected in ListBox.
  PrinterName = Printer.DeviceName  ' Current printer
  If OpenPrinter(PrinterName, PrinterHandle, 0&amp;) Then

      On Error GoTo ListBoxERR    ' Trap for no selection.
      FormName = Mid(List1.Text, 1, InStr(1, List1.Text, " -") - 1)
      On Error GoTo 0             ' Turn off Error trap.
      
      Continue = MsgBox("Are you sure you want to permanently remove " &amp; _
                 FormName &amp; " from " &amp; PrinterName &amp; "?", vbYesNo)
      If Continue = vbYes Then
          RetVal = DeleteForm(PrinterHandle, FormName &amp; Chr(0))
          If RetVal &lt;&gt; 0 Then ' DeleteForm succeeded.
              List1.Clear     ' Reflect the deletion in the ListBox.
              Form_Load       ' Rebuild the list.
              MsgBox FormName &amp; " deleted!", vbInformation, "Success!"
          Else
              MsgBox FormName &amp; " not deleted!" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
                 "Error code: " &amp; Err.LastDllError, vbInformation, "Failure!"
          End If
      End If
      ClosePrinter (PrinterHandle)
  End If

  Exit Sub
  ListBoxERR:
  MsgBox "Select a printer from the ListBox before using this option.", _
     vbExclamation
  ClosePrinter (PrinterHandle)
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
  Dim NumForms As Long, I As Long
  Dim FI1 As FORM_INFO_1
  Dim aFI1() As FORM_INFO_1           ' Working FI1 array
  Dim Temp() As Byte                  ' Temp FI1 array
  Dim BytesNeeded As Long
  Dim PrinterName As String           ' Current printer

  Dim RetVal As Long
  Dim FormSize As SIZEL               ' Size of desired form

  PrinterName = Printer.DeviceName    ' Current printer
  If OpenPrinter(PrinterName, PrinterHandle, 0&amp;) Then
      With FormSize   ' Desired page size
          .cx = 214000
          .cy = 216000
      End With
      ReDim aFI1(1)
      RetVal = EnumForms(PrinterHandle, 1, aFI1(0), 0&amp;, BytesNeeded, _
               NumForms)
      ReDim Temp(BytesNeeded)
      ReDim aFI1(BytesNeeded / Len(FI1))
      RetVal = EnumForms(PrinterHandle, 1, Temp(0), BytesNeeded, _
               BytesNeeded, NumForms)
      Call CopyMemory(aFI1(0), Temp(0), BytesNeeded)
      For I = 0 To NumForms - 1
          With aFI1(I)
              ' List name and size including the count (index).
              FormItem = PtrCtoVbString(.pName) &amp; " - " &amp; .Size.cx / 1000 &amp; _
                 " mm X " &amp; .Size.cy / 1000 &amp; " mm   (" &amp; I + 1 &amp; ")"
              List1.AddItem FormItem
          End With
      Next I
      ClosePrinter (PrinterHandle)
  End If
  End Sub

  Private Sub UseForm(FormName As String)
  Dim RetVal As Integer

  RetVal = SelectForm(FormName, Me.hwnd)
  Select Case RetVal
      Case FORM_NOT_SELECTED   ' 0
          ' Selection failed!
          MsgBox "Unable to retrieve From name", vbExclamation, _
             "Operation halted!"
      Case FORM_SELECTED   ' 1
          ' Selection succeeded!
          PrintTest     ' Comment this line to avoid printing
      Case FORM_ADDED   ' 2
          ' Form added and selected.
          List1.Clear   ' Reflect the addition in the ListBox
          Form_Load     ' by rebuilding the list.
  End Select
  End Sub

5. From the Project menu, add a new Module, Module1.

7. Run the project. The ListBox shows all of the forms that the current printer
  supports.

8. Click Command1. This adds "MyCustomForm - 214 mm X 216 mm (xxx)" to the end
  of the list, where "xxx" is the number that is assigned to the new form.

9. Click a form in the ListBox, and then click Command2. This prints a test page
  to the current printer using the selected form.

10. Click the new custom form in the ListBox, and then click Command3. You are
  prompted to confirm the deletion of the form. If you click Yes, it removes
  the custom form. If you try this with a predefined form, it raises error 87
  because only custom forms can be deleted.
