-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the most important features of the Microsoft Exchange
Server message transfer agent (MTA) database and their relationship to each
other. This information is useful to complete successful MTA disaster recovery.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MTA is made up of a service, static files, and a flat file database. The
service is displayed as "Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent" in the
Services tool. In Task Manager, the service is displayed as "Emsmta.exe". The
following registry hive stores many of the settings for the MTA:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA

The MTA static files tell the MTA how to handle various message formats and
communication methods. These files also include the configuration files, logs,
and event messages. These files are called "static" because they do not change
during normal operation of the MTA. These files are periodically updated with
service packs and hotfixes, and they should never be modified or deleted. The
following registry hive contains the location of the static files:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\MTA
  Run Directory

The following registry hive contains the MTA database location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\MTA
  database path

The MTA database is made up of core files (which are required for starting the
MTA), queue files, and message files. All MTA database files have a file name
pattern of DB&lt;nnnnnn&gt;.DAT, where &lt;nnnnnn&gt; is a hexadecimal number.

The first 38 database files (Db000001.dat to Db000026.dat) are the core database
files. They are core files because the MTA does not start if these files are not
present, or if one or more of these files is corrupted.

NOTE: To determine if the core database files have been corrupted, check the file
size. If the file is 0 bytes in size, it has been corrupted.

The core database files have not changed since Exchange Server 5.5 was shipped;
therefore, you can replace these files in a disaster recovery scenario by
copying the same files from the Exchange Server installation CD-ROM. These files
are located in the following folders:

- &lt;CD_Drive&gt;:\Server\Setup\i386\Bootenv (for Intel platforms)

- &lt;CD_Drive&gt;:\Server\Setup\Alpha\Bootenv (for Alpha platforms)

Queue files are MTA database files that represent a queue, such as a queue to the
Internet Mail Service. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program,
each MTA has a queue for the local private information store (MDB), the local
public information store (MDB), all location connectors or gateways, and for
each server in the local site. These are all outbound queues. When you use
Performance Monitor, the MTA Work Queue is also displayed. This queue is the
only inbound queue. The MTA Work Queue manages all inbound messages that have
not been routed to an outbound queue. The MTA Work Queue also manages
distribution list expansion, and delayed delivery messages.

The Exchange Server MTA makes a distinction between secured and non-secured
outbound queues. Non-secured queues exist only in memory when the MTA is
running. Messages queued to a non-secured queue may be rerouted if the connector
or server to which it is queued is not accepting delivery. Examples of
non-secured queues are:

- X.400 Connector

- Site Connector

- Dynamic Remote Access Server (RAS) Connector

- Private MDB

- Public MDB

When the MTA is shut down, it retains no knowledge of the non-secured queues;
therefore messages that are routed to non-secured queues must be reevaluated for
routing when the MTA starts again.

Alternatively, secured queues are represented as files in the MTA database. After
messages are routed to a secured queue, they are not rerouted by the MTA. In
fact, the MTA considers messages routed to secured queues as successfully
delivered. Even if you shut down the MTA and restart it, you cannot force the
MTA to reevaluate messages that have been queued to a secured queue. Examples of
secured queues are:

- Internet Mail Service

- MS Mail Connector

- Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail

- Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes

- Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise

- Microsoft Exchange Connector for SNADS

- Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OfficeVision/VM (PROFS)

- MS Mail Directory Synchronization (DXA)

- Third-party Exchange Development Kit (EDK) gateways such as Pager Connectors
  and FAX Connectors

Finally, most of the rest of the files in the MTA database are messages.

How to Identify  Secured Queues
-------------------------------

To identify .dat files that are secured queues, run the following command:

  mtacheck /v /f mtacheck.log

After you run this command, open Mtacheck.log, and look for mention of queues at
the beginning of the log. The following text is an example of an Mtacheck.log
file:

  

  Checking queue XAPIWRKQ (id 01000020)

  Checking queue OOFINFOQ (id 01000025)

  Checking queue REFDATQ (id 01000026)

  Checking queue MTAWORKQ (id 01000027)

  Checking queue /O=ORG/OU=SITE/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=MS MAIL CONNECTOR 
  (EXSERV1) (id 0100002C)

  Checking queue /O=ORG/OU=SITE/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=EXSERV1/CN=MICROSOFT 
  DXA (id 0100002F)

  Checking queue /O=ORG/OU=SITE/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=INTERNET MAIL 
  CONNECTOR (EXSERV1) (id 0100002D)

  Database clean, no errors detected.

In this example, there are three secured queues:

- One for the MS Mail Connector (0100002C)

- One for MS Mail Directory Synchronization (0100002F)

- One for the Internet Mail Service (0100002D)

You can change the queue identification numbers to .dat file names by changing
the "01" to "DB", and then adding ".dat" to the end of the queue ID number. For
example, the Internet Mail Service queue is a file named "Db00002D.dat". In this
example, you can also see that Db000027.dat is the MTA Work Queue.

The Db000001.dat file has special significance. This file represents a queue that
has knowledge of all the queues, both secure and non-secure, on this MTA. You
should be careful to preserve the Db000001.dat file because if you lose this
file, all messages in the secured queues may be lost.

Relationship of Files in the MTA Database
-----------------------------------------

- Db000001.dat is the "Super queue", or the "Queue of queues". It keeps track
  of the queue ID numbers for all queues in the MTA database, including
  standard queues (XAPIWRKQ, OOFINFOQ, REFDATQ, and MTAWORKQ) and secured
  queues.

- Secured queues are assigned a unique queue ID number the first time the MTA
  is started (or the first time you run MTACHECK) after you configure an EDK
  gateway (for example, Internet Mail Connector (IMC), MS Mail Connector, DXA,
  cc:Mail Connector, GroupWise Connector, Notes Connector, SNADS Connector,
  PROFS Connector, Pager, Fax, and so on). This queue ID number and its
  associated queue file (Db0000xx.dat) persist even when the MTA is shut down.

- All messages routed to secured queues keep a record of which queue they have
  been routed to. This record is in the form of the queue ID number for the
  secured queue. For this reason, you can use the mtacheck /v command to find
  out which queue the individual messages are on.

- After a message has been routed to a secured queue, the MTA considers the
  message successfully routed and it does not try to reroute the message.
  Therefore, if the MTA is stopped and restarted, it does not reevaluate the
  routing for messages that have previously been routed to secured queues.

Based on the information in this section, in a disaster recovery scenario the
following rules apply:

- If a secured queue file is deleted, but the Super queue remains intact, and
  you can run MTACHECK to re-create the secured queue. When you do so, no data
  loss occurs, because all messages that are previously routed to the secured
  queue still point to the old secured queue file (which has now been
  regenerated).

  NOTE: When MTA files are deleted, you may have unexpected results. Therefore,
  always back up the MTA database before you work on it.

- If the Super queue is deleted, regardless of whether the secured queues have
  been deleted or not, data loss likely occurs. When a new Super queue is
  created (for example, you restore it from the Bootenv folder from the
  Exchange Server CD-ROM), the next time you start the MTA, or run MTACHECK,
  new secured queue ID numbers may be generated that may differ from the
  previous secured queue ID numbers. These new secured queue ID numbers render
  the previous secured queue ID numbers invalid. Therefore, a message that has
  been routed to the previous secured queue is no longer deliverable because
  the queue that the message should be on no longer exists, and the MTA does
  not reroute or reevaluate the routing for those messages.
