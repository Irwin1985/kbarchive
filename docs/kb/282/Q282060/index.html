SUMMARY
=======

When you use Internet Information Services to host Web sites, it is important to
protect the server from unknown, and potentially malicious, users. This article
provides references to use in this vital task.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most comprehensive information on securing Web applications is available
in:

  Designing Secure Web-Based Applications for Microsoft&lt;AE&gt; Windows 2000
  http://mspress.microsoft.com/books/4293.htm
  ISBN: 0-735-60995-0
  Authors: Michael Howard, Richard Waymire, Marc Levy
  Publisher: Microsoft Press, July 2000

The following references are available online from the Microsoft TechNet Web
site:

As a best practice, Microsoft recommends installing the latest service pack and
security updates for IIS, as well as any other components running on the web
server. Although many customers utilize the online Security Bulletin Search as a
reference for what hotfixes to apply for a given Product and Service Pack
choice, the information provided by that tool does not take into account
cumulative rollups (it shows all updates released after the specified Service
Pack). For that reason, Microsoft recommends that customers using IIS determine
the required updates using the HFNetChk tool, which is available in the
following article:

  Q303215 Microsoft Network Security Hotfix Checker (Hfnetchk.exe) Tool Is
  Available

Once the latest Service Pack and all of the latest product updates (hotfixes)
have been applied, system level security should be applied to the web server.


The IIS Lockdown Wizard provides a "wizard" interface to configure many of the
security recommendations that are published in the Secure Internet Information
Services 5 Checklist and the Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 Security
Checklist. Both the IIS Lockdown Wizard and UrlScan (Q307608), an ISAPI filter
that can be used to block malicious web requests, are part of the Microsoft
Security Toolkit which can be obtained from the following location:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/stkintro.asp

Microsoft is committed to providing applications that can be used to keep our
customers' information secure, and maintains an Internet site dedicated to
security-related topics for Microsoft products. The Microsoft Security web site
is available at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/security/

In addition to visiting the Microsoft Security web site on a regular basis,
Microsoft recommends that customers stay up to date with the latest Security
Bulletins, by subscribing to the Microsoft Security Notification Service at the
Web site listed below:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/notify.asp

Microsoft provides free online services for determining when updates are
required, such the Critical Update Notification which is available from the
Windows Update (WU) Web site, as well as the Microsoft Personal Security Advisor
(MPSA) which can be used to determine vulnerabilities on the system running the
utility, but it is not recommended that the WU and MPSA utilities be used as the
only guidance for the latest updates. HFNetChk is the only tool which provides
comprehensive updates for service-level applications such as IIS.

which can prevent proper serving of content. The following Microsoft Knowledge
