-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The behavior to restrict Address Book views may change after you apply Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 4 in an organization in which the heuristic bit was
changed to restrict permissions to Address Book views as described in the
following post Service Pack 3 Microsoft Knowledge Base Article:

  Q248398 XADM: Restricting Permission to Address Book Views

If you apply Service Pack 4 (SP4) to a computer running Service Pack 3 (SP3) with
no post SP3 hotfixes installed, the heuristics bit is not set. Nevertheless, the
default behavior is as described in the More Information section below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The change in the behavior to restrict Address Book views is to ensure that, by
default, the permission on the Address Book views object is not inherited by the
site naming context.

The meaning of the heuristic bit is actually reversed in Service Pack 4 from any
earlier fixes, to accommodate this request.

In more detail, if the bit is set to 1, the Address Book Views object inherits
permissions from the site naming context. If the heuristic bit is 0 or is not
set, the Address Book Views object does not inherit any permissions and is
locked down to the service account unless a security descriptor has already been
stamped on the Address Book Views object.

Furthermore, if you set the heuristic bit to 1 after you apply the post Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 Dsamain.exe fixes that are described in Knowledge Base
article Q248398, to lock down the permissions to either a service account or
security descriptor, notice that the heuristic bit is changed back to 0 after
you apply Service Pack 4.

The behavior to restrict Address Book views first changed in the post Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 version of the Dsamain.exe file (version
5.5.2652.11).

The version of the Dsamain.exe file that is included in Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 4 is 5.5.2653.17.
