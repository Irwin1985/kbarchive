SUMMARY
=======

This article describes information to consider and best practices to implement
when you reset an Exchange mailbox database.

This article contains the following sections:

- Overview

- Offline Folders

- Inbox Rules

- Folder Permissions

- Personal Forms and Custom Views

- Outlook Address Book Service

- Best Practices

MORE INFORMATION
================

Overview
--------

To "wipe", or reset, an Exchange information store database, stop the Information
Store service, delete the entire database and all the log files, and then
restart the Information Store service. At this point, new database files are
created. User accounts are unaffected by this procedure, but when users log on
again, all of the users' server-based information is gone. In addition to
mailbox data, a private information store can contain message delivery queues
for several different connectors, including the Internet Mail Service. If you
reset the information store while messages are in transit in these queues, the
messages are lost.

There are typically two scenarios in which you might want to reset the
information store:

- To help you with troubleshooting, in situations where you suspect that a
  symptom is caused by a problem in the current database. In this situation,
  all of the database folders (usually in the Mdbdata folder) on all of the
  drives are renamed, and empty database folders are created in their place, to
  force the creation of a new database. When you use this procedure, first
  disable all of the connectors, including the message transfer agent (MTA), to
  prevent new items from being delivered to the test database. After you finish
  troubleshooting, you can rename the folders to restore the original database
  to service.

- As part of a "restore service now, restore data later" disaster-recovery
  strategy. If a database has been damaged or displays other symptoms that make
  that database unusable in production, you can reset the information store so
  that clients can immediately log on and send and receive new mail. You can
  begin recovery efforts for the problem database on a separate server at the
  same time.

  Typically, the Exmerge utility is used as part of a "restore service now,
  restore data later" recovery strategy. An administrator can use Exmerge to
  automatically copy all of the messages from one database to matching
  mailboxes in another database.

  An Exchange mailbox contains more data than the visible messages and items.
  This additional "metadata" includes:

   - Offline folders (.ost) file encryption keys

   - Rules

   - All folder permissions, which include delegate permissions

   - Personal forms

   - Custom folder views

  Although Exmerge is a very reliable utility for copying user messages, Exmerge
  cannot recover certain mailbox metadata. The version of Exmerge that is
  current as of the publication of this article can extract and import user
  messages and items, as well as folder permissions and rules, but cannot
  extract and import most custom views or personal forms. Note also that before
  you can use Exmerge to import data to a reset information store on a
  pre-Exchange 2000 server, either each user must log on once, or an
  administrator must send a message to each user on the server. Either of these
  operations forces the creation of a new mailbox in the new database. This
  step is not necessary when using ExMerge version 6.0 against an Exchange 2000
  server.

The rest of this article describes how the loss of various kinds of mailbox
metadata can impact an organization, and provides suggestions for how to restore
or re-create that mailbox metadata.

The strategies for preserving or recovering mailbox metadata that are described
in this article require manual intervention on a mailbox-by-mailbox basis. It is
labor-intensive to implement these strategies; therefore, they are not suitable
as a general strategy for preserving all metadata. These suggestions are not a
substitute for making and restoring online backups of your Exchange databases.

Offline Folders
---------------

Exchange supports both Online and Offline client connection modes. In Online
mode, the client is connected directly to the Exchange computer's information
store database, and all of the changes that the client makes are immediately
written to that database. In Offline mode, changes that the client makes are
stored in the offline folders (.ost) file on the client workstation. When the
client next connects to the server, the changes are synchronized between the
offline and online information stores.

The .ost file is similar to a personal folders (.pst) file, but the .ost file is
automatically encrypted. The encryption key is stored in two places: in the
mailbox on the Exchange computer and in a local Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) profile that is configured on the client
workstation. If the key is lost from both locations, the .ost file is
unreadable. When a client connects in Online mode, the key in the profile is
checked against the key in the information store database. If the keys differ,
the client copy of the key is overwritten with the key from the information
store, and a new .ost file is automatically generated on the client workstation.
When you reset an information store database, a new offline key is generated in
each new mailbox; therefore, the current .ost file becomes unreadable at the
beginning of the first successful online connection. Any changes that are made
before the synchronization of the current .ost file are not uploaded.

The current .ost file remains readable as long as the client opens Microsoft
Outlook only in Offline mode; however, users who are working offline are usually
not aware that a server reset has taken place until the users try to connect to
the server again.

After you reset an Exchange information store, offline clients receive the
following error message during the first successful connection attempt:

  The location the messages are delivered to has changed for this user profile.
  To complete this operation, you may need to copy the contents of the old
  Outlook folders to the new Outlook folders. For information about how to
  complete the change of your mail delivery location, see Microsoft Outlook
  Help. Some of the shortcuts on the Outlook Bar may no longer work. Do you
  want Outlook to recreate your shortcuts? All shortcuts you have created will
  be removed.

By the time that the client receives this error message, it is too late to
salvage the old key from the profile; the connection has already replaced the
old key with a new key.

You can use one of the following strategies to recover from this situation:

- Back up the profile key beforehand.

- Recover the key from the original database after you repair or recover the
  database.

Backing Up the Profile Key:

You can back up client profiles by using Microsoft Windows Resource Kit
utilities, such as Reg.exe, Regdmp.exe, and Regini.exe (you can configure these
utilities to run automatically in a logon script). Regedit.exe is available on
every Windows workstation, and you can use Regedit.exe to manually back up
profiles.

Each user who logs on to a computer has a separate set of profiles. If you are
logged on to the computer as a particular user, you can find the profiles in the
system registry at one of the following locations, depending on the operating
system that you are using:

- Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, and Microsoft Windows Millennium
  Edition (Me):

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles

- Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 2000:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
  Messaging Subsystem\Profiles

You can use Regedit.exe to export any profile that is listed, or even the entire
Profiles key. To do this, click the key that you want to export, and then click
Export Registry File on the Registry menu. If you choose a name with a .reg file
name extension for the exported file, you can re-import the file into the
registry by double-clicking the file in Windows Explorer.

You can merge a profile from one computer or user back into the registry of
another computer or user; in other words, you can take the .ost file from one
computer and read that .ost file on another computer. To do this, restore the
profile to a computer that is running the same operating system family as the
computer from which the profile was taken, and place the .ost file in the same
file path that was used on the original computer.

NOTE: You can edit the .ost path in the profile if necessary. To do this, use
Regedit.exe to visually scan the values and data in the profile to determine
where you need to change the path.

Another backup option is to create an additional profile that uses the same .ost
file, but is configured only for offline use. Do not used this option as a
substitute for backing up the original profile, but this option might be useful
for more sophisticated mobile users who want to configure a backup for
themselves. This option gives such users a "second chance" to log on to the .ost
file offline after an attempt to connect to the server.

NOTE: If you are using the Profile Creation Wizard, use the "Manually configure
information services" option.

To create an additional backup profile:

1. Note the name and path of the currently configured .ost file in the profile
  that you normally use; in Outlook 2000, click Services on the Tools menu, and
  then open the properties of the Exchange Server service. Click the Advanced
  tab, and then click Offline Folder File Settings to view the .ost file path
  and name.

2. Configure Outlook to prompt for the name of a profile when Outlook starts; in
  Outlook 2000, click Options on the Tools menu, click Mail Services, and then
  click "Prompt for a profile to be used".

3. Create a new profile named Offline-Do Not Sync.

4. Add Exchange Server as a service.

5. In the General properties for the service, click "Manually control connection
  state", and then click to select the "Choose connection type when starting"
  check box. Set the default connection state to work offline.

6. In the Advanced properties for the service, click Offline Folder File
  Settings to open the .ost configuration dialog box. Locate the name of the
  .ost file that is configured for the main profile, and select that .ost file.
  Click OK, and make sure that the Enable Offline Use check box is selected.

7. Start Outlook again, and then click the Offline-Do Not Sync profile. When you
  are prompted to either connect or work offline, click Connect. You must
  connect once by using the profile to add the encryption key to the profile.

8. After Outlook starts, click Options on the Tools menu, click Mail Services,
  and then disable any automatic synchronization options, including the option
  to synchronize on exit. You may also want to click Services on the Tools
  menu, and then click to clear the "Choose connection type when starting"
  check box to configure the profile to always open Outlook in Offline mode.

Recovering the Key from the Original Database:

If no backup of the profile exists, you can still recover the .ost encryption key
from the original database. Any .ost file that is configured for use with the
original mailbox uses the same encryption key; therefore, you can configure
profiles for offline use from a recovery server, and send those profiles to
users for use on their own workstations. You do not have to make the original
.ost file available to the recovery server, although you may do so if you want
to. To recover the original .ost file encryption key from the original database
from a recovery server:

1. Determine the path and name of the .ost file on the user's computer. Although
  this step is not essential, it makes the recovery process simpler for the
  user. If you skip this step, the user must edit the path to the .ost file
  that is stored in the profile by using Regedit.exe.

2. Configure a profile that is similar to the profile that is described in the
  "Backing Up the Profile Key" section of this article. Configure the profile
  to point to an .ost file that is in the same path and has the same name as
  the user's original .ost file.

3. Use Regedit.exe to export this profile from the recovery server's registry,
  and deliver the export file to the user. The user can then merge the file
  into the registry of the user's computer, by either double-clicking the file
  or typing the file name at a command prompt. Either you or the user may need
  to configure the user's computer to prompt for a profile when Outlook starts
  to make the profile available.

4. After the user gains access to the original .ost file, you can add a .pst
  file to the offline profile (by clicking New on the File menu, and then
  clicking Personal Folders), and you can drag any information that the user
  wants to preserve to the .pst file. The user can open the .pst file in an
  online profile (by clicking Open on the File menu, and then clicking Personal
  Folders). Carefully note the path in which the .pst file is created so that
  you can easily find the .pst file again when you adding the .pst file to a
  different profile. If you use the online profile, you can drag items from the
  .pst file to the online information store.

Inbox Rules
-----------

Users must manually edit all rules that copy or move items between folders after
you reset an information store database. Rules reference underlying folder IDs,
not just the folder display names. These IDs are not the same between different
databases, even if the folder names are identical. The logic and syntax of each
rule survives intact, but users must edit each rule to point to the correct
folders. This issue occurs even if a user makes a backup of the rules before a
database is reset.

The Exmerge utility can copy rules from one database to another (if you set the
Exmerge option to copy associated folder data), but most merged rules still
require that each user manually edit the rules.

Folder Permissions
------------------

When delegate permissions are granted, the name of the delegate is stored in the
Exchange directory, but the permissions that are actually granted are stored in
individual folders in the mailbox of the user who granted those delegate
permissions. After you reset an information store, the names of previously
defined delegates are still visible on the delegates page, but all of the
permissions that were granted to delegates are lost.

The Exmerge utility can restore all of the permissions that previously existed on
all of the folders, regardless of the folder ID changes. When you copy
permissions from one database to another by using the Exmerge utility, the
permissions in the source database completely overwrite the permissions in the
target database for every folder; any permissions that users might have recently
configured in the new database are lost.

You can easily copy folder permissions from one database or .pst file to another
by using various means, including the use of a drag-and-drop procedure on
folders in Outlook. The Exmerge utility is usually the best choice for restoring
all folder permissions.

Personal Forms and Custom Views
-------------------------------

By default, personal forms and custom views are not stored in specific folders,
but are associated with the mailbox as a whole. Rules and permissions are always
stored in specific folders; that is why you can use the recover associated
folder data option in the Exmerge utility to recover rules and permissions.

To force personal forms and custom views to be stored as associated folder data:

- For personal forms, associate the form with a specific folder; open the
  properties for a folder, and then click the Forms tab. Click Manage, and then
  copy the form from a library to the folder.

- For custom views, when you create a view, mark the view as "Can be used on
  this folder", instead of "all folders".

Users can also back up personal forms in advance by saving them as .oft (Outlook
form template) files. Have the user open a form by pointing to Forms on the
Tools menu, clicking "Design a Form", and then click Save As. Users can use the
"User Template in File System" option in the Choose Form dialog box to gain
access to forms that have been backed up. Users can re-imported forms into
Outlook by opening a form, clicking Design This Form, and then re-publishing the
form to the appropriate library. An Exchange administrator can also export and
recover forms from the original information store database by using the same
method.

It is slightly more complicated to recover custom views from the original
database. To back up or transport a custom view, you must generate a copy of the
view for use in a single folder. You can do this in Outlook by clicking View,
and then clicking Define Views to open the Define Views dialog box.

NOTE: You cannot change the folder setting for a view after creation, except by
using the Copy option.

Then you must copy the entire folder to which the view is attached (not just the
folder contents) to a .pst file. You can then add the .pst file to the user's
profile, and copy the view again to restore it to the user's new mailbox.

Users who create complex custom views may want to back up those custom views by
associating copies of their views with a folder in a .pst file.

Outlook Address Book Service
----------------------------

Most Outlook users have an Outlook Address Book service that is configured along
with the Exchange Server service. Because of this, personal Contacts folders can
be treated as part of the global address list to check names and auto-complete
information. The link between this service and all Contacts folders is broken
when you reset the information store. Users first notice this problem either
because automatic name checking does not work, or because the auto-complete
feature no longer finds names from Contacts before suggesting names from the
global address list. To resolve this issue, the user must remove the service,
and then add the service to the profile again.

NOTE: The user cannot simply delete Contacts folders from the service properties;
the user must delete and then create the entire service again.

Instruct users to perform the following procedure to reset the Outlook Address
Book service:

1. Start Outlook, and then click Services on the Tools menu.

2. Click the Outlook Address Book service, and then click Remove.

3. Click Add, click Outlook Address Book under "Available information services",
  and then click OK to add the Outlook Address Book service again. At this
  point, if you examine the service properties, no Contacts folders are
  associated with the service.

4. Quit and log off from Outlook, and then start Outlook again.

5. Examine the Outlook Address Book service properties to ensure that all of the
  Contacts folders that you expect to be listed are listed (for most users,
  only a single folder should be listed). If any expected folder is not listed,
  open the properties of that folder, click the Outlook Address Book tab, and
  then click the "Show this folder as an e-mail address book" check box. Quit
  Outlook, and then start Outlook again.

6. If you previously set Contacts folders to be searched before the global
  address list is searched, click Services on the Tools menu, and then verify
  that the search order on the Addresses tab is correct.

Best Practices
--------------

- One way to restore all of the metadata after you reset an information store
  is to put the original database back into production after you successfully
  repair or recover the original database and there are no questions about the
  database's viability. To do this, swap databases between a recovery server
  and a production server, and then use the Exmerge utility against the reset
  database (which is now running on the recovery server) to merge the reset
  database's data back into the original database. Contact Microsoft Product
  Support Services (PSS) if you want detailed information about how to swap
  databases between a recovery server and a production server.


  Be aware that if you swap the original database back in, metadata that is
  associated with the new database is affected. The most troublesome problem
  that might occur is that new .ost files that are created after the reset
  might become obsolete. A third .ost file might be created. Although this new
  .ost file shares the encryption key with the original .ost file, if you want
  profiles to use the original .ost file, you must still manually reset
  profiles to use the original .ost file.

- Before a problem occurs, you may want to generate a list of very important
  users (a VIP list) and define procedures to restore users on the list. You
  can run multiple copies of the Exmerge utility at the same time, even on the
  same computer; therefore, you can restore multiple groups of users in series
  or in parallel as necessary.

  NOTE: If you run multiple copies of the Exmerge utility on a single computer,
  refer to the Exmerge utility documentation for information about redirecting
  the Exmerge log file for each instance. The log file contains critical data
  that you need to troubleshoot any problems that might occur during the
  process.

  You can also schedule the Exmerge utility to run regularly against specific
  mailboxes and perform incremental backups of a mailbox's contents to a single
  .pst file. Although this backup method might not be feasible for a large
  number of users, if you perform this type of "brick" level backup, it can
  help you restore data even more quickly for critical users or folders. Refer
  to the Exmerge utility documentation for information about backup
  scheduling.

  Users who have defined delegate permissions (and their delegates) are often
  good candidates for a VIP list, because users who have defined delegate
  permissions are often executive users who have granted access to assistants.
  You can use the following .csv file export header to quickly determine which
  users have granted delegate permissions in your organization, and to whom
  those delegate permissions have been granted:

  Obj-Class,Display-Name,Public-Delegates,Public-Delegates-BL,Obj-Dist-Name

  To use the preceding header, copy and paste the header to the first line of a
  plain text file. Then use the Exchange Administrator program to export all of
  the mailboxes by using the text file that you created as the export target.

  If a user has delegated permissions to a mailbox, that user's object has a
  Public-Delegates property. If someone has granted a user permissions to
  another mailbox, that user has a Public-Delegates-BL property. Delegate
  permissions are listed by distinguished name, not by display name. If it is
  not obvious which user is referenced by a distinguished name, search the
  Obj-Dist-Name column to make the correlation.

  In Exchange 2000, you must search Active Directory to determine delegate
  information. You can use the Ldifde.exe utility to simplify this search:

  LDIFDE.EXE -F DELEGATES.TXT -D "DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM"
  -L NAME,PUBLICDELEGATES,PUBLICDELEGATESBL
  -R "(|(PUBLICDELEGATES=*)(PUBLICDELEGATESBL))"

  NOTE: The preceding command is a single line, it is wrapped for readability.

  The preceding command exports a list of all of the objects in the domain that
  have assigned delegates or are an assigned delegate. The command ignores all
  other objects. If the command returns no objects at all, assign delegate
  permissions to a mailbox and try it again. If nothing is returned, there
  might be a typographical error in the command, or the domain name might be
  wrong.

  NOTE: The Ldifde utility runs only on Microsoft Windows 2000. If you have a
  Windows 2000-based computer, you can run the Ldifde utility against an
  Exchange Server 5.5 computer on which LDAP has been enabled. This gives you
  an Exchange 2000-style filtered list of those users who are participating in
  delegation. Use a command that is similar to the following:

  LDIFDE.EXE -F DELEGATES.TXT -S EXCHANGE55SERVER
  -L DISPLAY-NAME,PUBLIC-DELEGATES,PUBLIC-DELEGATES-BL
  -R "(|(PUBLIC-DELEGATES=*)(PUBLIC-DELEGATES-BL=*))"

- When run against pre-Exchange 2000 servers, the list of mailboxes that the
  Exmerge utility can work with is taken directly from the information store,
  not from the directory. A mailbox entry is not created in the information
  store until the owner logs on for the first time, or until a message is sent
  to the owner. Send a message to all of the users on a server before you
  attempt to re-import data by using the Exmerge utility. When ExMerge version
  6 is run against an Exchange 2000 server, the list of mailboxes that the
  ExMerge utility can work with is taken directly from the Active Directory and
  not the Information Store.


  You can use the message that you send to ensure that all of the mailboxes are
  generated to inform users about the current situation and set the users'
  expectations about recovery (make sure that you do not set expectations for
  recovery too high). This message might include information about:

   - What occurred, and why you chose to start the server with a blank
     database.

   - When to expect progress updates.

   - Recovery efforts and time frames.

   - How to check and reset delegate permissions.

   - How to report problems and make special requests (such as requests to
     restore personal forms).

   - How to repair rules after they are restored.

   - What not to do (for example, if you intend to restore rules, tell users
     not to re-create them; if you intend to swap the original database back
     into service, tell users that any changes that they make to rules, forms,
     views and .ost files may be reversed after you recover the previous
     database).

   - How to reset the Outlook Address Book service.

  A properly worded message after you reset an information store can greatly
  reduce the work load for help desk resources and can help to prioritize your
  recovery efforts.

- You can use the Exmerge utility to export and import only the folders that
  you specify; therefore, you can restore information in the order of that
  information's importance. For example, the folders that are the most critical
  to user productivity are often the Calendar, Contacts, Notes, and Tasks
  folders. You can set the Exmerge utility to process only these folders on the
  first pass, set Exmerge to restore the Inbox on the next pass, and then set
  Exmerge to restore all of the other folders except the Deleted Items folder,
  which can wait until the last step of the restoration process. You add very
  little time to the overall length of the restoration process by restoring
  data with this method.

- It is important that you keep close watch on the information store
  transaction log files when you restore information by using the Exmerge
  utility. In essence, you are re-delivering all of the messages that are
  restored, and this is reflected in the number of log files that are
  generated. You can view the transaction log file location by using the
  following command:

  d:\exchsrvr\bin\perfwiz.exe -r

  NOTE: Running Perfwiz.exe without the -r switch prompts you to shut down all
  of the Exchange services before you can view the file locations.

- Investigate the effects of an information store reset on add-on services in a
  laboratory environment. For example, how does a reset affect the users of a
  PocketPC calendar synchronization program? Do you need to do anything to
  enable such users to continue to synchronize after a reset? Does a backup
  utility that requires the use of an Exchange mailbox still function after you
  reset the database?
