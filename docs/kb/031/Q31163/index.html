The dedicated-cursor (arrow) keys on the Toshiba T1200 laptop computer
(and probably on other Toshiba laptop computers that have
dedicated-cursor keys) may not highlight text in the QB.EXE editor in
Microsoft QuickBASIC version 4.00, 4.00b, or 4.50 or in Microsoft
BASIC Compiler version 6.00 or 6.00b. Some key combinations, different
than those normal for an IBM, may be possible to use for selecting
text on Toshiba laptop computers.

The Toshiba laptop computers are not included in the list of systems
on which Microsoft has tested QuickBASIC, and we make no claims for
compatibility with Toshiba laptop computers.

Because the keyboard supplied with the Toshiba T1200 is not identical
to an IBM keyboard, you must use a different sequence of keystrokes to
highlight text in the QuickBASIC editor.

Instead of using the SHIFT+&lt;arrow key&gt; combination, which is used to
highlight text on an IBM machine, you must use the Toshiba special
FUNCTION key in conjunction with the SHIFT key and the appropriate key
from the numeric keypad. For example, to move the cursor down and
highlight text, use the following key combination:

   FUNCTION+SHIFT+Keypad 2

These key combinations work correctly only for the T1200-series
computers, which use the special Toshiba 101-key-style keyboards. In
addition, a customer with a Toshiba T5100 Laptop 386 reported that
pressing FUNCTION+SHIFT+K (where the K key has numeral 2 on its
horizontal face) also highlights text. These combinations do not work
for other Toshiba laptop computers with smaller keyboards. One
customer reported that the combinations work for Sharp 4501 and 4503
Portables.

One customer reported that another way to select text on the Toshiba
T1200 (or T1000) laptop is to use SHIFT+CTRL+&lt;A, S, D, F, E, or X&gt;.
The A and F let you select words in the left and right direction
respectively; the S and D let you select single characters in the left
and right direction respectively; the E and X let you select lines up
or down respectively. Microsoft has not confirmed or tested this
information.

It has been reported that a Toshiba T3100 had to use an add-on keypad,
with NUM LOCK activated, to select text. The Toshiba T3100 comes
standard with dedicated cursor keys that, the report says, will not
select text. According to another report, SHIFT+CTRL+&lt;A, S, D, F, E,
or X&gt; successfully selects text on a T3100e laptop, which has a gas
plasma display. Microsoft has not confirmed this information.

Another customer reported that on the Toshiba 1000, you can run the
SETUP10 program, supplied by Toshiba, to configure for a 101-key
keyboard. After this program is run, pressing FUNCTION+NUM LOCK
toggles on or off the arrow keys' ability to highlight text. You don't
need to hold down the SHIFT key while selecting text with the arrow
keys when highlighting mode is on. Press FUNCTION+NUM LOCK again to
toggle off the highlighting mode. Microsoft has not confirmed this
information.
