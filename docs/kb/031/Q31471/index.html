When you choose the Print option from the QuickBASIC editor's File
menu to print the source listing of a QuickBASIC program that uses the
REM $INCLUDE metacommand, blank lines are appended to the end of the
printed listing. The number of blank lines added corresponds to the
number of lines in the included file.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QB.EXE in QuickBASIC
Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and in the QB.EXE in Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and OS/2 (buglist6.00,
buglist6.00b). This problem has been corrected in the QBX.EXE of the
Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 7.00 (fixlist7.00).

The following are two ways to view this problem:

1. Load only the program module that contains the REM $INCLUDE
   statement into the editor; do not load the included file. Next,
   select the Print...Current Module option from the File menu.

   In addition to the printing of the program, there will be blank
   lines added to the end of the listing, one blank line for each line
   in the include file.

2. The same problem occurs if the include file is also loaded.
   Multiple blank lines will be inserted between the printout of the
   program module and the include file. In this case, the option
   Print...All modules is selected from the File menu.

In either of these two cases, if the included lines are being viewed
(i.e., the option Included Lines has been chosen from the View menu),
the files are printed without the insertion of blank lines. Results of
testing with previous versions indicate that blank lines are not
inserted when the program is printed from the QuickBASIC Version 2.00
or 3.00 editor.

As a workaround, invoke the Included Lines option from the View menu
prior to printing. The following is a code example:

   ' Program TEST.BAS
   REM
   REM
   REM
   REM $INCLUDE: 'TEST.INC'
   REM
   PRINT "all done"

   ' This is the included file TEST.INC

   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
   PRINT "in the include file"
