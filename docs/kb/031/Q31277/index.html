The LOCK statement should lock entire files, certain records within a
random access file, or certain bytes within a binary access file.

The LOCK statement successfully locks records within a random access
file. However, if certain bytes within a binary access file are
locked, the whole file is locked as well. This causes a "Permission
denied" error when trying to access any part of the binary access
file.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC Versions
4.00 and 4.00b and in Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b
for MS-DOS and OS/2 (buglist6.00, buglist6.00b). This problem was
corrected in QuickBASIC Version 4.50 and in the Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Version 7.00 (fixlist7.00).

To work around this problem, open binary files as random files with a
buffer size of 1 (OPEN X$ FOR RANDOM LEN=1).

Note: QuickBASIC Versions 3.00 and earlier do not offer binary access
files; they offer only random and sequential access files.

The following code example demonstrates the problem:

' The DOS 3.x SHARE.EXE utility must be executed before running this
' program. The following program creates a random file and a binary
' file. It opens each file under two different numbers. A record in
' the random file can be locked successfully, but the binary file is
' completely locked.

OPEN "test4" FOR RANDOM AS #2 LEN = 11  'Open same file as #3 and #2.
OPEN "test4" FOR RANDOM AS #3 LEN = 11
OPEN "test5" FOR BINARY AS #1  'Open the same file as #1 and as #4.
OPEN "test5" FOR BINARY AS #4
FIELD #3, 6 AS lastname$, 5 AS firstname$
FIELD #2, 6 AS lastname$, 5 AS firstname$
LOCK #2, 1                      'Lock a record in #2, but not #3.
LOCK #1, 30 TO 32               'Lock some bytes in #1, not in #4.
'
a$ = "Like as the waves make toward the pebbled shore" '
b$ = "So do our minutes hasten to their end."

'
PUT #1, , a$                         'Put some lines into "test5".
PUT #1, , b$
LSET lastname$ = "Martin"            'Put some stuff into "test4".
LSET firstname$ = "Steve"
PUT #2, 1
LSET lastname$ = "Henry"
LSET firstname$ = "John"
PUT #2, 2
GET #2, 2                             'Gets both records OK as #2.
PRINT firstname$; lastname$
GET #2, 1
PRINT firstname$; lastname$

GET #3, 2                             'Can get this record OK as #3.
PRINT firstname$; lastname$
'GET #3, 1                    'This record is properly locked to #3.
'PRINT firstname$; lastname$
'The following gives "Permission denied" if any part is locked by #1:
a$ = INPUT$(4, #4)
PRINT a$
UNLOCK #1, 30 TO 32
UNLOCK #2, 1
CLOSE
