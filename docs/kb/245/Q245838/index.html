The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When a server monitor detects that a monitored service is not running, and the
action specified on the Actions tab of the monitor is "Restart the computer,"
the monitored server restarts after the amount of time specified in the Restart
delay space. During this time, a System Shutdown window opens on the monitored
server and counts down the time until the server restarts.

While there appears to be no way to stop the server from restarting, you can stop
the server from restarting by doing one of the methods described in the "More
Information" section.

NOTE: With these methods, the System Shutdown window continues to count down to
zero, but after it reaches zero, it disappears and the computer will not
restart.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OPTION 1: Stop the Server Monitor
---------------------------------

If you stop the server monitor on the server that initiated the shutdown, the
monitored server will not be restarted when the countdown reaches zero.

You can tell which server initiated the shutdown by looking in the System
Shutdown window on the monitored server. The window contains the following
text:

  This shutdown was initiated by &lt;Domain&gt;\&lt;ServerName&gt;

OPTION 2: Restart the Monitored Services
----------------------------------------

If all of the monitored services are restarted before the countdown reaches zero,
the server will not be restarted. If you can't start one of the monitored
services, this method obviously won't work.

By default, the monitored services are the Exchange Server directory, information
store, and message transfer agent. If any other services were added to the
server monitor, you must restart them as well.

OPTION 3: Disable and Stop the System Attendant
-----------------------------------------------

If you disable the system attendant on the monitored server and stop it, the
computer is not restarted when the countdown reaches zero. Be sure to set the
system attendant to disabled before stopping it. If you stop the system
attendant on the monitored server without disabling it, the server that
initiated the shutdown will try to restart the system attendant.

During a planned outage, you can suspend server monitors by running the following
command:

  "\exchsrvr\bin\admin.exe /t nr" (without the quotation marks)

More information about server monitors can be found in Chapter 3, "Monitoring
Your Organization," of the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Maintenance and
Troubleshooting manual or in the Books Online for Exchange Server 5.5.
