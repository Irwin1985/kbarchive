-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a simple Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)
profile, you may receive the following error message:

  No transport provider was available

CAUSE
=====

Your profile contains both of the following services:

- An internet e-mail service such as Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) or
  Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3)

  -And-

- Microsoft Exchange Server service

This behavior is due to the way that MAPI handles SMTP address resolution. While
this configuration may appear to work, the resolution order, and therefore the
ability to resolve SMTP addresses correctly, may not work. This behavior becomes
more noticeable in complex organizations. This configuration also causes issues
when you connect to a computer that is running Microsoft Exchange Server.

Microsoft does not support this configuration.

For additional information about the support limitations of MAPI provider
services, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q234936 XCLN: Support Boundaries of MAPI Provider Services

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, create two different profiles: one for the
Internet mail service and one for the Exchange Server service. For additional
informationabout how to set up Outlook profiles and how to configure Outlook to
prompt you for a profile, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q195478 OL2000: (CW) User Profiles and Information Services

  Q182159 OL98: (CW) User Profiles and Information Services

  Q162203 OL97: User Profiles and Information Services

When you set up two different profiles, you must quit Outlook before you can
switch to the other profile.

Another way to work around this behavior is to use Outlook Express for POP3 or
SMTP internet e-mail services, and to use Outlook when you connect to a computer
that is running Exchange Server.

This information applies to using Microsoft Mail in a profile with Exchange
and/or Internet Mail Service. In addition, Microsoft recommends that you have a
separate profile for the Microsoft Mail service.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you install Internet Mail Service (IMS) on a computer that is running
Exchange Server, mail is automatically sent using Exchange Server. The SMTP
server that you specify as your Internet e-mail account is not used.

The Outlook program, acting as the Exchange client software, sends an
NspiResolveNames request to Exchange Server. If you install IMS, Exchange Server
attempts to handle the message even if you have not correctly configured it to
send Internet e-mail. In such a situation, a non-delivery report (NDR) is
received.

There is no client resolution available for this situation other than the use of
separate user profiles for Outlook. Configure Exchange to send SMTP mail by
installing IMS, or to use another e-mail program to send Internet e-mail.
