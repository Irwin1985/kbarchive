SUMMARY
=======

This article describes recommendations for troubleshooting issues on Exchange
computers that antivirus software is installed on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

File-Based Antivirus Software
-----------------------------

You can install file-based scanning antivirus software on an Exchange computer.
However, never run scanning against the program and database files of an
Exchange computer.

In addition, never run scanning against the Installable File System (IFS) drive
(drive M) of an Exchange 2000 server. If you do so, you might receive false
reports of a virus and you might damage Exchange 2000 databases when you attempt
to disinfect the file.

In Exchange 2000, drive M is a convenient label for the Exchange IFS. The
Exchange IFS enables you to view and use the Exchange information store as a
file system.

NOTE: Drive M can use a letter other than M. This drive is generally referred to
as drive M; however, if the letter M is already being used, this drive uses
another drive letter. For additional information about issues that are caused by
antivirus scanning of drive M, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q298551 XADM: Large Number of Transaction Logs Created

In some situations, you may experience additional issues with the Exchange IFS.

If you need to run a file-based virus scanner on an Exchange computer, remove the
Exchange-specific files and folders from the scheduled scans and real-time
scanning. File-based scanning of Exchange 2000 executable files is supported.

IMPORTANT: Never run file-based scanning software against Exchange databases,
logs, temporary files, the IIS system files, or the IFS drive (drive M).
Configure antivirus software to avoid scanning the folders that contain these
files.

You can run file-based antivirus software against the operating system of the
Exchange computer and against Exchange program files (the Exchsrvr\Bin folder),
but never run file-based antivirus software against files in the following
folders:

- Exchange databases and log files (the original location is the
  Exchsrvr\Mdbdata)

- Exchange MTA files (Exchsrvr\Mtadata)

- Additional log files (Exchsrvr\&lt;server_name&gt;.log)

- Virtual server folder (Exchsrvr\Mailroot)

- Site Replication Service (SRS) files (Exchsrvr\Srsdata)

- Internet Information Service (IIS) system files
  (%SystemRoot%\System32\Inetsrv)

You can run file-based scanning against the following folders:

- Exchsrvr\Address

- Exchsrvr\Bin

- Exchsrvr\Conndata

- Exchsrvr\Exchweb

- Exchsrvr\Res

- Exchsrvr\Schema

Temporarily disable file-based scanning software during operating system and
Exchange upgrades; this includes upgrading to new versions of Exchange or the
operating system, and applying any Exchange or operating system fixes or service
packs.

When you upgrade an Exchange or operating system product, or apply a service pack
or fix, it is standard procedure to stop and disable all of the third-party
services, hardware vendor and operating system monitors, and any agents or
Exchange monitors before you perform the update or upgrade. Also stop and
disable any performance monitors, any Microsoft or third-party backup programs,
and Microsoft Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Then restart the
Exchange computer before you apply the upgrade or fix. This procedure prevents
files that the update process needs to access from being locked.

IMPORTANT: This procedure also includes stopping and disabling any antivirus
programs (including file-based scanning antivirus software) before you upgrade
any version of Exchange or the operating system and before you apply any
Exchange or operating system service pack or fix.

Exchange Information Store Scanning Software
--------------------------------------------

Microsoft provides application programming interfaces (APIs) that give other
manufacturers the ability to write antivirus programs that scan the information
store. If this type of software is running on your Exchange computer and you are
experiencing issues, research the issues and follow normal troubleshooting
procedures. If these procedures do not resolve the issue, temporarily disable or
remove the antivirus software to determine whether it is contributing to the
issue. If the antivirus software is not contributing to the issue, you can
re-enable the antivirus software.

If the issue stops occurring after you disable or remove the antivirus software,
contact the manufacturer of the antivirus software for the most recent update.
If the most recent update of the software does not resolve the issue, continue
working with the antivirus software manufacturer and Microsoft to pursue a
resolution to the issue.
