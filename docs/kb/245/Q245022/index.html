SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, an SNA Support Professional may ask you to capture a problem in
traces for troubleshooting purposes. When capturing a problem in SNA traces, it
is important to turn off tracing immediately after the problem occurs, to
prevent the traces from wrapping and overwriting pertinent data. WEventMon.exe
and SNA Trace Maker are two utilities that can help you to capture a certain
problem in SNA traces without you having to manually stop tracing. They can be
obtained from SNA Server technical support.

SNA Trace Maker is used to select the items that you need to trace. It creates
two files: Start.reg and Stop.reg. Start.reg is a registry file that contains
the trace items that you select. Stop.reg can be used to clear these trace
options when tracing is completed.

WEventMon.exe is a program that will monitor the Application, System, or Security
event log for a particular event ID, source, or type of event. In addition, a
program can be configured to execute when the event is logged. For example,
WEventMon can be configured to monitor for Event ID 23 and to execute the
Stop.reg file (created with SNA Trace Maker) when this event is logged.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create Start.reg and Stop.reg using SNA Trace Maker, see the following
steps:

1. Install SNA Trace Maker on the SNA Server by running the Setup.exe program. A
  program group named SNA Trace Maker will be created in the Start menu.

2. Start Trace Maker from the Start menu, and you will see a box listing all the
  SNA Server trace items. Select an item you want to trace, and click
  Properties to enable the appropriate options. Do this for each trace item
  that you want to enable.

  NOTE: If a link service is one of the items that needs to be traced, click Add
  Link. Select the appropriate type of link service from the Link Service
  drop-down box. In the small drop-down box, select the number of the link
  service you want to trace. For example, if you need to trace the Snadlc1 link
  service, select DLC 802.2 Link Service and 1.

3. The Clear All button can be used to clear the trace settings if you need to
  start over.

4. When all the desired trace options are enabled, click Make .reg File. Two
  files, Start.reg and Stop.reg, will be created in the \\Program Files\SNA
  Trace Maker\reg directory.

  To configure WEventMon.exe to monitor for an event and execute Stop.reg when
  the event is logged, see the following steps. In this scenario, WEventMon
  will be configured to monitor for an Event 23 in the Application Event Log.

  1. Copy WEventMon.exe to the SNA Server, and start the program.

  2. Click the Application Log radio button where it says "Log To Monitor"

  3. Under Properties to Search For, select Event ID, and type "23" (without
     the quotation marks) in the box below.

  4. At the bottom of the screen, where it says "Execute This Program", type in
     the command to run the Stop.reg file that you created previously with SNA
     Trace Maker (that is, regedit "C:\Program Files\SNA Trace
     Maker\reg\stop.reg"). Please note that you must include the regedit
     command on this line, or the .reg file will not execute.

  5. When you are ready to enable monitoring, start the traces by
     double-clicking start.reg. Then, click Start Monitoring. Traces will
     continue to run until the Event ID 23 is logged. By default, traces are
     stored in \\sna\traces.

NOTE: When you run this program, if you receive a message stating "Cannot open
filename," move the created stop.reg and start.reg to a folder in a path without
long filenames. Edit the created batch file to reflect the new path, and then
change the path in WEventmon.exe accordingly.
