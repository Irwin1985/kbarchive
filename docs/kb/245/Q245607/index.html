-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition provides increased functionality
for Windows NT domain environments. Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server
Edition affects all aspects of the domain environment. This article describes
the areas affected, and provides hyper-links to Microsoft Knowledge Base
articles that contain specific troubleshooting steps for those areas.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the acronym "TSE" is used in this article to indicate a Windows NT
Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition-based server.

Installation of Terminal Server as a Domain Controller (DC) or Member Server
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition is a new operating system and
provides a new kernel, and because of this it cannot be installed as a service
in Windows NT 4.0. Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition cannot be
installed after server installation.

Domain Controller Installations:

To log on to a TSE with a network client, the user must have the right to "Log on
Locally." If a TSE is installed as a DC, and this right is granted to a group
such as Everyone, then Everyone would be able to log on to every DC in the
domain. This is because the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database is a
replica copy of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) SAM database. Therefore, if
"Log on Locally" is provided to the Everyone group on one DC, then "Log on
Locally" is permitted on every DC. If the TSE is the only server in the
environment, then configuring the TSE as a domain controller is appropriate. If
the TSE is one of many servers in the domain, then the TSE should be configured
as a Member Server.

Member Server Installations:

Installing Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition as a Member Server gives
it a local SAM database that is not shared with any other computers. It is
important to remember that users are logging on to the domain and not the TSE.
Users log on through the TSE session to the DCs, PDC or Backup Domain Controller
(BDC), so they are subject to domain security and administration.

Home Directories
----------------

Home directories store information for the multiuser environment.

  Q186521 Why Terminal Server Users Should Have New Home Directories

Terminal Server Home Directory:

  Q230165 Terminal Server User's Home Directory Is Not Set Correctly

  Q195934 Incorrect Permissions Applied to Terminal Server Home Folders

  Q192164 Home Directories Are Created with Incorrect Permissions

Changes to User Manager for Domains
-----------------------------------

- Terminal Server Profile Path is only used when logging onto a TSE.

- Terminal Server Home Directory is used to store multiuser environment
  information.

- User Configuration dialog box.

Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition uses additional fields in the SAM
database that standard Windows NT Server 4.0 does not utilize. The User
Configuration dialog box used through a user's account properties provides
access to the additional fields. User Manager for Domains on a standard Windows
NT 4.0 DC cannot place data and path statements into these fields. Therefore, a
Windows NT 4.0 DC does not display the contents of those fields.


Terminal Server Profiles
------------------------

Local profiles are created under the Wtsrv\Profiles\&lt;user name&gt; folder of
the TSE, where &lt;user name&gt; is a user name. This is not recommended for
clustering Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition with the Citrix
MetaFrame add-on, which is described later in this article. This is undesirable
because there would be separate local profiles on each of the numerous TSEs with
MetaFrame and clustering, and these various profiles would not match each
other.

The typical Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server Edition installation has a
small system partition as C:\, and a large data partition or RAID 5 striped set
with parity as D:\. Using local profiles can fill up the small system partition
on C:\, and does not utilize the large data partitions on drive D. Consequently,
C:\ is filled with the local profiles for the TSE user sessions, while D:\ may
have several Gigabytes of unused capacity that could store the profiles.


Roaming Profiles:

The Terminal Server Profile Path is used for roaming profiles only while a user
is logged on to a Terminal Server session. This is good for Citrix MetaFrame
clustered TSEs. Select a server to use roaming profiles that can be used by any
TSE in the environment. For additional information about issues with using
roaming profiles, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q187453 User?s SID Remains in Registry After Logoff


User Profile Path Versus Terminal Server Profile Path
-----------------------------------------------------

- The User Profile Path is used for both Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal Server
  Edition and standard Windows NT Server. This is good for Windows NT
  Workstation-based desktop computers that have the same desktop settings
  whether using a Terminal Server session or a standard Windows NT Server-based
  logon.

- Terminal Server Profile Path is used for the roaming profile for Terminal
  Server use only. This is desirable for Microsoft Windows 98/95 or other
  desktop computers that need a roaming profile with their virtual Windows NT
  Workstation user settings stored in it.

System Policies
---------------

- Local Policies are applied when working on that TSE only. For additional
  information about local policies, click the article number below to view the
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q186529 Local Policy Does Not Permit You to Log On Interactively

- Domain Policies are applied whenever the user logs on to the domain. These
  policies are stored in the Netlogon share on Windows NT 4.0-based domain
  controllers. For additional information about domain policies, click the
  article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q192794 How to Apply System Policies to Terminal Server

- Changes to System Policies. There are new settings that only apply to TSEs
  sessions and not standard domain logons. For additional information about
  using system policies for Terminal Server clients, click the article number
  below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q186618 New System Policy Options in Terminal Server

Permissions
-----------

Windows NT File System (NTFS) permissions are used to define the file system
requirements for the multiuser environment. All Windows NT Server 4.0 Terminal
Server Edition users need to have the "Change" permission for the %SystemRoot%
folder. Terminal Server has Read permission set by default.

numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q186569 Security Configuration in Terminal Server

  Q186616 Terminal Server Client Error 13D at Logon

Terminal Server Connection Configuration
----------------------------------------

This is the system-wide Graphical User Interface (GUI) setting for Remote Desktop
Protocol-Transport Control Protocol (RDP-TCP) and Citrix MetaFrame Independent
Computing Architecture-Transport Control Protocol (ICA-TCP) security
permissions. This can override what User Manager for Domains has in it for
Connection Permissions. This is often missed because of the standard Windows NT
Server troubleshooting techniques used in User Manager for Domains.

Rights
------

- "Access Computer from Network" should be disabled for a TSE that is a Member
  server in a domain, or Standalone server. This right should be enabled for a
  TSE that is a DC. Because a combination DC/TSE affects every DC in the
  domain, standard Windows NT-based servers need this right for users to be
  able to have file and printer sharing functionality. This right is not
  required from a Thin client. For additional information about the Access
  Computer from Network right, click the article number below to view the
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q186490 Terminal Server's Use of Access This Computer From Network

- Log on Locally. Configure TSE as Member server or DC as described earlier in
  this article. Every user must have the "Log on Locally" right to log on to
  the TSE.

- Account Management. For additional information about how to disable
  connectivity to the Terminal Server for maintenance issues, click the article

Terminal Server Licensing
-------------------------

- License Manager tracks domain licenses as other Windows NT Server-based
  servers.

- Terminal Server License Manager: For additional information about License
  Manager, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q187629 Terminal Server Licensing

  If no licenses are available, the user is able to log on to the domain but
  Terminal Server Local Profiles will not load. Licensing errors: For
  additional information about licensing errors, click the article numbers
  below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190233 Terminal Licensing Failed with the Specific Error 322148762

  This is replacing the Hydra.mdb file from the CD-ROM.

  Q216843 Clients Receive Error 1000 No Licenses Are Available

- Terminal Server Licensing Service Product Options:

  1. Existing Windows NT Workstation Version 4.0 License

     This is for those clients that are already using Windows NT Workstation 4.0
     on their desktop computers.

  2. Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Full License

     This option is used for those clients that have any non-Windows NT
     Workstation client platforms to license the virtual Windows NT Workstation
     computer. This has been modified with the Terminal Server Client Access
     License (CAL).

  3. Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Version Upgrade

     This option is for those clients that have Windows NT Workstation 3.5x as
     their operating system and only need a version upgrade. Note that this is
     less expensive that the full license option.

  4. Temporary License for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Full License

     This option is for those clients that do not have a license. This option
     grants unlicensed clients 90 days to work while licenses are being
     purchased.

Service Pack (SP) 4 Updates
---------------------------

For additional information about Service Pack 4, click the article number below
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q222970 List of Bugs Fixed in Terminal Server Edition

Post Service Pack (SP) 4 Hotfixes
---------------------------------

Dirty Shutdown Criteria Changed in SP4:

Dirty shutdown used to only mean sudden power outages, but now it can mean
scheduled shutdowns, session initiated reboots, software installed reboots, and
AT command reboots. Anything other than pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE at the server
console causes the "orphaned" temp folders problem. For additional information
about shut down issues, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q230449 Service Control Handler May Not Receive SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN

Temp Directory Hotfix:

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q234029 Err Msg: 'Temp Directory Not Accessible' After Applying TSE SP4

The scope of this hotfix is when launching a new Terminal Server session, the
hotfix checks the C:\TEMP folder for an existing subfolder with the same session
ID. If a similar session ID exists, it is deleted and re-created by the system
account. It does not remove all orphaned temp folders as may be expected.

Profiles Stuck in the Registry:

For additional information about user profiles, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q234606 Terminal Server User Profiles Do Not Unload

The scope of this hotfix is to have Client Server Runtime System (CSRSS) send out
a query for all processes that are running in the user's session, and then send
out a request for all user processes to stop. Once the specified wait time
expires, Winlogon starts the session shutdown. The shutdown should not work if
there are session ID processes still running.

RestrictAnonymous Does Not Work after Applying Service Pack 4:

For additional information about this issue, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236185 Terminal Server User Profiles and Home Folder Paths Are Ignored

This is based on having the RestrictAnonymous setting in the registry from SP3.
The RestrictAnonymous setting disrupts the logon based on having the paths for
user profile, netlogon share, and so on, tried prior to logging the user on to
the system so they were anonymous. Winlogon.exe had to be rewritten to process
the user logon first, then validate the user's profiles and shares.
