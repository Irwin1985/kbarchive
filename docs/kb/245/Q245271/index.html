-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Software Metering service in Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0, the software metering servers may appear to stop responding (hang).
The hang may occur after a few days or several weeks, depending on the software
metering server load. The only way to recover from this problem is to reboot the
software metering servers.

Provided that at least one software metering server is available, clients
continue to function without problems. The overall performance of the clients
and server may decrease as the site server hang shifts the load to the remaining
servers. If all software metering servers are unavailable, software metering
clients are unable to contact a software metering server for updates and
configuration changes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a memory leak in the License Metering service
(Remodbc.exe). The License Metering service is written to monitor the amount of
memory that it consumes. If the License Metering services use more than 50
megabytes (MB) of memory (the default value), the service is automatically
restarted by the License Server Manager. This prevents the License Metering
service from consuming too much memory. Server hangs occur when the License
Metering service cannot be successfully stopped. Because of this, it cannot be
successfully started to allow the license metering server to continue working.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to correcting a leak in the SMS_LICENSE_SERVER component of Software
Metering, the post SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 hotfix mentioned in this article also
increases performance in the loading of Software Metering user interface Summary
window. For additional information, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q251099 SMS: Slow Performance in License Metering Administration Tool

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q245271.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run Q245271.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard.

Manual Installation:

To install the hotfix, follow these steps on the SMS site server:

1. Copy the contents of the hotfix (including sub-folders) to a local folder on
  the site server/software metering site computer you will be updating.

2. Stop the SMS Site Component Manager and SMS Executive services on SMS Site
  Servers on which you are installing the hotfix files.

3. Stop the SMS_LICENSE_SERVER service on all software metering server site
  computers.

4. Copy the following files from the i386 folder to the SMS\BIN\i386 folder on
  SMS site servers:

  Abc32acc.dll
  Abc32srv.dll
  Ignprod.dll
  LicAdmin.exe
  Licgphwz.dll
  Liclogon.dll
  Licrepwz.dll
  Licsrvc.dll
  Licsvcfg.dll
  ListMaint.dll
  Prodpage.ocx.dll
  Productdb.dll
  Remodbc.exe
  Srvrview.ocx
  Ignprod.dll

5. Copy the following files from the Alpha folder to the SMS\BIN\Alpha folder on
  SMS site servers

  Abc32acc.dll
  Abc32srv.dll
  Ignprod.dll
  LicAdmin.exe
  Liclogon.dll
  Licsrvc.dll
  Licsvcfg.dll
  ListMaint.dll
  Prodpage.ocx.dll
  Productdb.dll
  Remodbc.exe
  Srvrview.ocx

6. Copy the following files from the i386 directory to the
  SMS\INBOXES\CLICOMP.SRC\LICMTR\i386 directory on SMS site servers

  Abc32off32.dll
  Abcstb32.dll
  Liccli95.exe
  Licclint.exe
  Licgphwz.dll
  Liclogon.dll
  Licrepwz.dll
  Licsrvc.dll
  Licsvcfg.dll
  Listmaint.dll
  Prodpage.ocx.dll
  Productdb.dll
  Remodbc.exe
  Srvrview.ocx
  Ignprod.dll

7. On SMS Site servers copy the Compverlicmtr.ini file from the hotfix location
  (i386 folder of the hotfix location) to SMS\INBOXES\CLICOMP.SRC\LICMTR,
  replacing the Compver.ini file.

8. On SMS Site servers copy the following files from the hotfix location Alpha
  folder to the SMS\INBOXES\CLICOMP.SRC\LICMTR\Alpha folder on SMS site servers

  Abc32off32.dll
  Abcstb32.dll
  Licclint.exe

9. Next, on SMS site servers locate the Update.sql file in the i386 hotfix
  folder. From a SQL Server tool such as ISQLW (SQL Query Analyzer), connect to
  the SMS Software Metering database and verify that the DB combo box shows the
  software metering database name, normally SMS_&lt;sitecode&gt;_LicDB
  (sitecode is the three digit site code for that site). Load the Update.sql
  script into ISQLW and execute the script. If the script executed normally,
  the Results pane should show the "The command(s) completed successfully"
  message.

10. On SMS software metering site computers, copy the following files from the
  i386 folder to the SWMTR directory (or alternate location chosen during
  installation. This is the folder shared as LICMTR). If the software metering
  site computer is running on the Alpha platform, copy the following files
  from the Alpha folder of the hotfix.

  Abc32acc.dll
  Productdb.dll
  Remodbc.exe

11. After the server components are replaced, restart the SMS Site Component
  Manager and SMS Executive on SMS Site servers, and SMS_LICENSE_SERVER on all
  SMS software metering site computers.

12. All computers running the SMS Administrations tools (where Software Metering
  UI Tools was chosen) should also be upgraded. It is recommended that the
  Windows NT Replace command be used to replace binaries updated by the
  hotfix. If a workstation has the SMS Administration tools installed in
  D:\SMSADMIN, the hotfix can manually be installed by changing the current
  folder to that of the platform you will be updating with the hotfix
  location, for example, i386. Run the Windows NT REPLACE command to update
  the SMS Admin tools on the workstation. For Intel platforms

  REPLACE *.* X:\&lt;INSTALLPATH&gt;\BIN\i386\*.* /R /P

  where X:&lt;INSTALLPATH&gt; is the location where the SMS Admin tools were
  installed. For Intel platforms, this will normally replace approximately 12
  files.
