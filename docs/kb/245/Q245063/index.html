Clean the CD-ROM. To do this, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently wipe the

CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion.

commercial CD cleaning solution. Dry the CD-ROM thoroughly before you insert it
into the CD-ROM drive.

Clean the CD-ROM Drive
----------------------

If cleaning the CD-ROM does not resolve the issue, clean the CD-ROM drive using a
CD-ROM drive cleaning disc if you have one. If you do not have one, obtain one.
CD-ROM drive cleaning discs are available in most computer stores.
