Last Modified: 06-AUG-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a three-tier Systems Management Server (SMS) hierarchy with a central site,
child primary sites, and associated secondary sites, Distribution Manager on the
secondary sites may have problems decompressing *.pck files. This behavior is
intermittent.

In addition, the following information is recorded in Distmgr.log:

  ~Package AUS0001B requires a newer version (2) of source files and the new
  compressed files hasn't arrived yet, current version is 1, skip
  D:\SMS\inboxes\distmgr.box\INCOMING\U2J0GVIQ.PKG

  As the number of *.PKG files in the distmgr.box\INCOMING \ directory grows,
  the following may also be logged in the DistMgr.log:

  ~Cannot update the package AUS0001B in the package source, error = 8

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Create the package on the child primary site instead of on the central site,
where they are destined for the third-level secondary sites.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: You can only use this method for I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q245579.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run Q245579.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode using the /s command-line switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Close the SMS Administrator console and stop the SMS Site Component Manager
  and SMS Executive services. If the Sms_Site_Backup service is running, stop
  that as well.

2. Replace the Distmgr.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_directory&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

3. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager and SMS Executive services.
