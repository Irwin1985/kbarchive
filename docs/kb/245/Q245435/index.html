SYMPTOMS
========

After you synchronize a Microsoft Outlook Calendar with a 3Com Palm Connected
Organizer, one or more of the following issues may occur:

- Attendees are deleted from recurring appointments.

- Recurring items are changed to nonrecurring items.

CAUSE
=====

These issues may occur when you use Chapura PocketMirror version 2.5 or earlier
to synchronize Microsoft Outlook Calendar items (appointments, tasks, meeting
requests, and so on) with a 3Com Palm Connected Organizer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Chapura has confirmed this to be an issue in the PocketMirror software version
2.5 or earlier. This problem was corrected in PocketMirror, version 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a recurring item has one or more exceptions and the item contains
attendees, the attendees may be deleted and may not appear in the Attendee
Availability tab of the Calendar item.

In addition, recurring appointments may be divided into individual single-day
appointments because of a limitation in the way that Chapura PocketMirror
software handles exceptions in a recurring item. An exception of this issue is
an instance of a recurring item that you have modified from the original item.

According to Chapura, there is no workaround for exceptions that are generated
from the handheld device by using the Chapura software. You must apply changes
to meetings (for example, appointments with attendees) in Outlook only. If you
apply changes on the handheld device, attendees may not be notified of the
change. In addition, the attendee list for the meeting may be lost during
synchronization if it is a recurring meeting.
