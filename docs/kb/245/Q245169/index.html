-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During site attachment and processing of .sha files, the Discovery Data Manager
(DDM) thread of the SMS_EXECUTIVE service may stop processing until the service
is restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During site attachment, .sha files are placed in Sms\Inboxes\ddm.box as
notification for DDM that sites have been added to the hierarchy.

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the Systems Management
Server site server.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q245169.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server with an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

4. Run Q245169.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. On each site server, stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service and then the
  SMS_EXECUTIVE service.

2. Replace the Ddm.dll file in the Sms\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the file
  from this hotfix that corresponds to the platform of the site server.

3. Restart the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.
