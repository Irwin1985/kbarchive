The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure a hardware or software inventory to run on a simple
schedule, the Systems Management Server (SMS) clients all report inventory at
midnight. If a computer is turned off when the inventory interval is reached,
the inventory is taken after the computer is restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you specify a simple schedule, it normally permits the inventory to be
taken at a single, specific interval. While this permits less flexibility in
scheduling, this method usually causes less network traffic because the time
each client's MIF file is sent is initially based on that client's installation
time. For subsequent inventories, it is based on the interval and the last time
that inventory was taken on that computer.

When this problem occurs, all clients can generate their inventory information
close to the same time and the servers specified as Client Access Points (CAP)
can be flooded with a large number of inventory files. This problem can cause
the network redirector on the servers to generate the following Windows NT event
error messages:

  Event ID: 2022
  Description: The server was unable to find a free connection x times in the
  last 60 seconds.

  Event ID: 3013
  Description: The redirector has timed out to &lt;system name&gt;.

This behavior can also occur when an inventory is configured to use a full
schedule. This by-design behavior occurs because this type of schedule is
intended to have all of your clients run inventory at exactly the same time.
Ideally, a full schedule should not be used if the network environment and the
number of client access points are not scaled high enough to support the
additional load that is associated with this configuration.
