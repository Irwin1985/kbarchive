-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 experiences directory synchronization
(dirsync) problems on entries from Lotus Notes to Exchange Server. Message flow
and dirsync from Exchange Server to Notes works fine, but only a partial dirsync
occurs from Notes to Exchange Server.

The application logs report no errors and the Exchange Connectivity Controller
log browser reports more entries are exported than the actual amount of entries
in the Lotus Notes Address Book.

Copying the Person documents to a new Address Book does not resolve the problem.

CAUSE
=====

The Lotus Notes Address Book is corrupted. The Exchange Notes Connector cannot
read the Foreign DirSync Allowed field from the Notes Address Book correctly. It
reads some entries as No even though they appear as Yes in the Address Book.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. In the Notes administrator program, open the document properties for user
  entries that were not exported during dirsync, and change the Foreign
  Directory Sync field value from Yes to No, and then save the document.

2. Change the same value back from No to Yes, and then save the document again.

3. Run dirsync from Notes to Exchange Server. If the user appears in Exchange
  Server, you can repeat the same process on other Lotus Notes Person documents
  that are not being exported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some Lotus Notes environments, Address Books are replicated to all servers to
keep a standard Address Book synchronized. Sometimes during that process,
because of external circumstances such as network problems, the Address Book can
become corrupted.
