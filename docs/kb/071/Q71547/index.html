-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses known problems with the Texas Instruments Graphics
Adapter (TIGA) video driver version 2.0 release 1.2 for Microsoft Windows
version 3.0. The date of this driver is 12/21/90. The information in this
article can be found in the text file that comes on the disk with the TIGA
driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-DOS-Based Applications
-------------------------

When you run two full-screen MS-DOS-based applications in 386 enhanced mode and
press ALT+TAB to cycle directly from one MS-DOS-based application to the other,
the cycling title screen remains on the screen. The second MS-DOS-based
application appears to have a corrupted screen.

Switching to Windows and back to the MS-DOS-based application properly restores
the screen of the MS-DOS-based application. The ALT+ESC key combination does not
exhibit this problem.

Running MS-DOS in a Window
--------------------------

When you run MS-DOS in a window, the MS-DOS cursor disappears when the cursor is
at the bottom of the window. (The cursor is actually below the edge of the
window.) Use the MS-DOS CLS command to clear the MS-DOS screen and move the
cursor to the top of the window.

Shelling to MS-DOS in Real Mode
-------------------------------

When you run Windows in real mode and the TIGA is set at 4 bits per pixel,
exiting an MS-DOS shell sometimes causes the color palette to be reloaded
incorrectly. Exit and restart Windows to reset the color palette.

Using 256-Color Display
-----------------------

If the desktop wallpaper is a 256-color bitmap and an application uses a
different color palette, when the application is minimized or terminated, the
desktop wallpaper's colors may be changed. Exit and restart Windows to reset the
color palette.

Mouse Pointer Leaves a Trail
----------------------------

If you select custom colors using the Control Panel Colors icon, the cross hair
(mouse pointer) leaves a trail of black pixels. At this time, no solution for
this problem is available.

Asymetrix ToolBook - Animation Primer
-------------------------------------

On the title screen, when the bouncing red ball moves behind the text boxes, bits
of the black text pixels disappear. As the ball passes behind a section that has
disappeared, the bits sometimes reappear. At this time, no solution for this
problem is available.

Micrografx Designer
-------------------

Micrografx Designer comes with a sample drawing of a highway scene, ART-WORK.DRW.
The line in the middle-road dividing line should be distinctly dashed. Instead
it looks like a dotted line. The road color is light gray instead of dark gray.

Microsoft Windows Paintbrush
----------------------------

Flipping a selected bitmap region vertically or horizontally will often cause
white pixels to be left at the edge of the selection box. Invert the image twice
to restore the image.

The spray pattern for the spray can is wrong. At this time, no solution for this
problem is available.

In 16 colors, green and cyan colors are not displayed correctly. The color green
consists of green and yellow. The color cyan consists of cyan and white. This
does not happen on the inside of shapes.

Microsoft PowerPoint
--------------------

Text consists of vertical lines instead of solid characters. The solution is to
use colored text at 8 bits per pixel only.

Terminal
--------

NOTE: This Terminal information pertains to the 1024 x 768 (TIGA48.DRV) driver
only.

The text buffer window in Terminal does not display text properly with the System
font. When scrolling back through the text in the buffer, the characters become
distorted. All other fonts work correctly.

we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these product's performance
or reliability.
