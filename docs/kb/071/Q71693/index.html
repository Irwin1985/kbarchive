SUMMARY
=======

There are a number of file management functions available in MS-DOS Shell that
are not available at the DOS prompt. These functions include viewing, moving,
and toggling attributes on hidden files, and the renaming of directories.

In MS-DOS version 5.0, the Shell interface has been greatly altered. To view
hidden files, you must enable that option by choosing File Display Options from
the Options menu in Shell. The other functions maintain the same command
sequences as in MS-DOS 4.01 Shell. It should also be noted that MS-DOS version
5.0 allows the manipulation of hidden and system files using the ATTRIB command.
Renaming directories is still not directly possible from the command prompt
within DOS 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find hidden files at the DOS prompt, you must first know the name of the file
being searched for. The same is true for copying, deleting, or moving hidden
files. You cannot toggle the hidden file attribute at the command prompt alone.

These functions are simple within Shell. Hidden files are included in the file
listing in the File System portion of Shell. Hidden files can be manipulated in
the same manner as all other files. Toggling file attributes (including the
hidden attributes) requires selecting the file, and from the File menu, choosing
Change Attributes.

You cannot rename directories from the DOS prompt without a third-party utility.
Instead, you must create a new directory with the desired name, copy the files
to that directory, delete those files in the old directory, and remove the old
directory.

Within Shell, all that is required is to select the directory within the File
System portion of the shell, and choose Rename from the File menu.
