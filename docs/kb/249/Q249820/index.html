-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

An APPC application may experience a slow response time when it is configured to
use an SNA subdomain with multiple SNA Server computers if the Supports Dynamic
Remote APPC LU Definition option is enabled on several computers.

CAUSE
=====

If an APPC application specifies a Local LU Alias when calling TP_STARTED, the
APPC interface incorrectly tries SNA Server computers that are configured to
support dynamic remote APPC LU definition, even if those computers do not
support the Local LU Alias being requested. Because additional time is spent
connecting to those other servers, the opening of the application may be
delayed.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, try one of the following:

If you are not using Supports Dynamic Remote APPC LU Definition, disable it by
clicking to uncheck the Supports Dynamic Remote APPC LU Definition check box on
the SNA Server computer(s).

-OR-

Configure the LUWIDSUP=NO registry entry on the computer where the APPC program
is running.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

On SNA Windows NT clients:

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\Client
  LUWIDSUP:REG_SZ:NO

On SNA Windows 95 clients:

  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\Client
  LUWIDSUP:REG_SZ:NO

Setting this registry entry to NO defers resource allocation until an
[MC_]ALLOCATE is issued. This causes WAPPC32 to issue the GetServerList with the
Remote APPC LU alias only, and not the local. Therefore, the resource allocation
proceeds correctly.

STATUS
======

A supported feature that modifies the product's default behavior is now
available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to modify the behavior
described in this article and should be applied only to systems having a
specific need for it. This feature may receive additional testing at a later
time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you are not severely
affected by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the
next Microsoft SNA server version 4.0 service pack that contains this feature.

To obtain this feature immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this feature should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------+
| SNABASE.EXE | 01/24/00 | 08:09p | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.

NOTE: This hotfix is for the SNA Server. This update does not have to be applied
to the SNA clients.
