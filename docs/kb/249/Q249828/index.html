  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you join a domain after applying Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later to your
Windows NT 4.0-based computer, you are unable to log on to the domain. Also, you
receive the following error message after you restart your computer:

  System can not log you on to the domain because the systems computer account
  in its primary domain is missing or the password on that account is
  incorrect.

When you use the Server Manager tool to view the properties of your computer, you
receive the following error message:

  The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain
  failed.

The domain controller your computer is authenticating with generates an event id
5722 in the System log for your Windows NT 4.0 SP4-based or later computer name.
Also, an event id 3224 is generated on the System log of your computer with the
following error message:

  The authentication service is unknown.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because of a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) issue with the
following registry key on your computer:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\RPC

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, use either of the following methods:

- Export the registry key listed earlier in this article from a working Windows
  NT 4.0-based computer, and then import it to your computer.

- Use the Server Manager tool to reset your computer account.
