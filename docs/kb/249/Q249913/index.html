SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how your Microsoft Asheron's Call character information
is stored on the Asheron's Call servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- Characters you create are stored on the Asheron's Call servers. For this
  reason, character information is not deleted if you remove or reinstall
  Asheron's Call on your computer.

- Characters are stored for up to 1 year. If the subscription for the account
  has not been active in this time, the characters on that account are subject
  to being removed.

- Character information is linked to your MSN Nickname used on Zone.com. You
  can use the same character on any computer on which Asheron's Call is
  installed if you log in to the Zone with the same MSN Nickname.

- A character can only be used in the world in which it was created. If you
  create a character in one world, that character is not available in other
  worlds.

  You can have up to five characters in each world.

- You cannot transfer characters from one MSN Nickname to another, or from one
  world to another.

- When you delete a character, that character is permanently deleted after one
  hour.
