www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/pws/default.htm. This URL is no longer valid.

Personal Web Server for Windows 98 is included on the Microsoft Windows 98 CD-ROM
in the "\add-ons\pws" folder, and you can also download it from:

http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/NT4OptPk/default.asp
(http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/NT4OptPk/default.asp)

and
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ntoptionpack/askwiz.asp
(http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/ntoptionpack/askwiz.asp)


Page 25: Half-Megabyte Should Be 5805 KB
----------------------------------------

On page 25, the second paragraph states that the CRT source code requires 5805
KB. The next paragraph states that the CRT library source code takes a
half-megabyte.

Change the third paragraph from:
"If you would like to have the CRT library source code available, and you can
spare the half-megabyte of disk space that this option requires..."

To:
"If you would like to have the CRT library source code available, and you can
spare the 5805 KB of disk space that this option requires..."


Page 69: Step 10 Correction
---------------------------

On page 69, in Step 10, delete the second sentence.

"Click Close to close the Advanced Options dialog box."


Page 78: Typo in Third Bulleted Item
------------------------------------

On page 78, in the 3rd bulleted item, the quotation marks around _tcscat are
misplaced.

_"tcscat"

To:
"_tcscat"


Page 106: Typo in Table 3.7
---------------------------

On page 106, in Table 3.7, change the capitalization in "CMetafileDC" to
"CMetaFileDC".


Page 124: Change "Import" to "Connect" In Step 6
------------------------------------------------

On page 124, in step 6, change the second sentence as follows:

Change:
"The dialog box for the Import command should now look as it does in Figure
4.5."

To:
"The dialog box for the Connect command should now look as it does in Figure
4.5."


Page 131: Change The Title Of Table 4.1
---------------------------------------

On page 131, change the title of Table 4.1 from:
"Table 4.1 CCmd UT Member Functions"

To:
"Table 4.1 CCmdUI Member Functions"


Page 143: Corrections To Procedure
----------------------------------

On page 143, in the "To Add A Check Box Control To The Dialog Box" subheading,
make the following corrections.

In step 2, in the first sentence change:
"With the crosshair pointer, draw a check box control beneath the read-only edit
control, as shown in Figure 4.12."

To:
"With the crosshair pointer, draw a check box control beneath the Access Level
input box, as shown in Figure 4.12."

In step 6, change:
"In the Caption box, type Attempt to connect at application &amp; startup."

To:
"In the Caption box, type Attempt to connect at application &amp;startup."


Page 143: Change IDC_CHECKCONTROL To IDC_CHECKCONNECT
-----------------------------------------------------

On page 143, in step 5, under "To add a check box control to the dialog box," the
control ID should be IDC_CHECKCONNECT to work with step 12 on page 164 when you
add DDX member variables.

On page 143 change:
"5. On the General tab, change the control ID by typing IDC_CHECKCONTROL in the
ID box."

To:
"5. On the General tab, change the control ID by typing IDC_CHECKCONNECT in the
ID box."


Page 145: Use "Connect" in place of "Continue" and "Conflict"
-------------------------------------------------------------

On page 145, in the "To Test The Dialog Box" subheading, correct the last
sentence in step 2.

Change:
"Try selecting the different sample commands in the list box, and then try
closing the dialog box with the Continue or Cancel button."

To:
"Try selecting the different sample commands in the list box, and then try
closing the dialog box with the Connect or Cancel button."

Also, toward the bottom of the page change the subheading:
"To create the CConflictDialog class"

To:
"To create the CConnectDialog class".


Page 147: Function Names Incorrect
----------------------------------

On page 147, change the "To Display The Connect To Data Source Dialog Box"
procedure as follows.

Change step 2 from:
"Double-click the OnUpdateConnect() function icon..."

To:
"Double-click the OnUpdataDataConnect() function icon..."

Change step 4 from:
"Locate the OnConnect() handler function..."

To:
"Locate the OnDataConnect() handler function..."


Page 154: Step 8 Should Refer To The No Button
----------------------------------------------

On page 154, step 8 should refer to the "No" button rather than the "Cancel"
button.

Change:
"Copy the Cancel button to create a new button."

To:
"Copy the No button to create a new button."


Page 157: CSTUpload Should Be CSTUploadDoc
------------------------------------------

On page 157, in step 2 under "To create the Import command handler function":

Change:
"2. In the Class Name list, click CSTUpload."

To:
"2. In the Class Name list, click CSTUploadDoc."


Page 158: Quotation Mark Missing in Code
----------------------------------------

On page 158, in step 3, there should be a quotation mark between the equal sign
and the word Data.

Change:
CString strFilter = Data files (*.dat) | *.dat | All Files (*.*) | *.* | |";

To:
CString strFilter = "Data files (*.dat) | *.dat | All Files (*.*) | *.* | |";


Page 173: Change CListBox to CEdit
----------------------------------

On page 173, at the bottom of the page, CListBox should be changed to CEdit.

The bulleted item will then read:
"To add a CEdit member variable"


Page 175: Corrections To Code That Disables The Connect Button
--------------------------------------------------------------

On page 175, the code in step 5 does not disable the Connect button when the
dialog box is first displayed. The following code will resolve the problem:

  char tempbuf[8];
  m_bnConnect.EnableWindow(FALSE);
  if(m_lbDSN.GetCurSel() != LB_ERR)
  {
  	if(m_editUserID.GetWindowText(tempbuf, 7))
  		m_bnConnect.EnableWindow(TRUE);
  }


Page 178: CDialog Should be CPropertySheet
------------------------------------------

On page 178, in step 6, CDialog should be changed to CPropertySheet.

Change:
"Create a modal property sheet with the CDialog::DoModal( ) function, or a
modeless property sheet with the CDialog::Create( ) function."

To:
"Create a modal property sheet with the CPropertySheet::DoModal( ) function, or a
modeless property sheet with the CPropertySheet::Create( ) function."


Page 187: Misspelled Parameter
------------------------------

On page 187, in the first paragraph following code, in the first sentence:

Change:
"The LOGPIXELSX and LOGPIXELSXY parameters to the GetDeviceCaps()..."

To:
"The LOGPIXELSX and LOGPIXELSY parameters to the GetDeviceCaps()..."


Page 200: Ctimer Should Be CTimer
---------------------------------

On page 200, in the code in step 2, change "class Ctimer" to "class CTimer".


Page 202: Incorrect Variable Name
---------------------------------

On page 202, in the "To Create The CTimerDialog Class" subheading, in Step 2,
there is an incorrect variable in the second sentence.

Change:
"This should be a variable of type CTime and be named m_settime."

To:
"This should be a variable of type CTime and be named m_time."


Page 229: Correction To Step 4
------------------------------

On page 229, in the second step 4,

Change:
"4. Add the following line of code to the top of the MainFrm.cpp file:"

To:
"4. Add the following line of code to the top of the MainFrm.cpp file after the
'#inlcude STUpload.h' statement:"


Page 230: Correction To Step 1 To Implement The Function
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 230, in step 1, under the section for implementing the function, you will
need to open the MainFrm.h file.

Change:
"In File View, expand the Header Files folder and double-click the CMainFrm.h
file icon to open the file."

To:
"In File View, expand the Header Files folder and double-click the MainFrm.h file
icon to open the file."


Page 233: Steps Should Refer To CSTUploadDoc Not CDocument
----------------------------------------------------------

On page 233, in the steps outlined at the bottom of the page, every "CDocument"
should be replaced by "CSTUploadDoc".

Under "To add the CDocument::m_strCurrentFund member" change:
"Right-click the CDocument icon in Class View and add a protected member
variable..."

To:
"Right-click the CSTUploadDoc icon in Class View and add a protected member
variable..."

Under "To create accessory functions for the m_strCurrentFund member variable"
change:
"Add the following lines of code to the public section of the CDocument class
declaration:"

To:
"Add the following lines of code to the public section of the CSTUploadDoc class
declaration:"


Page 236: Sample Code Is Found In CH5_06.cpp
--------------------------------------------

On page 236, in the line just above the 2nd piece of code, change "CH5_15.cpp" to
"CH5_06.cpp", so the statement reads as follows:

"This code can be found in CH5_06.cpp, installed from the companion CD."


Page 247: strPath Needs Quotation Marks Around Path
---------------------------------------------------

On page 247, change the code in the middle of the page so the path is enclosed in
quotation marks.

Change:
CString strPath = C:\\Program Files\\MyApp\\MyFile.bin;

To:
CString strPath = "C:\\Program Files\\MyApp\\MyFile.bin";


Page 251: Change "writing to" To "reading from"
-----------------------------------------------

On page 251, in the fifth paragraph, change "writing to" to "reading from" as
follows:

Change:
"When writing to a text mode file, use the ReadString( ) function, which is
similar to Read( ) except that:"

To:
"When reading from a text mode file, use the ReadString( ) function, which is
similar to Read( ) except that:"


Page 256: Change CtestAppDoc to CTestAppDoc In Code Sample
----------------------------------------------------------

In the code sample on page 256, change CtestAppDoc to CTestAppDoc in the first
line of code.


Page 258: Change Both Instances Of CMyApp To CMyAppDoc
------------------------------------------------------

On page 258, in Step 1, change both instances of "CMyApp" to "CMyAppDoc".


Pages 309 &amp; 322: Incorrect Case In "forwardOnly" Parameter
----------------------------------------------------------

In Table 7.3 on page 309 and on page 322, the parameter "forwardOnly" was
incorrectly printed as "forwardonly".

In Table 7.3 on page 309, change:
"CRecordset::forwardonly"

To:
"CRecordset::forwardOnly"

In the second bullet item on page 322, change:
"forwardonly"

To:
"forwardOnly"


Page 330: CViewDBDialog Should Be CViewDBDlg
--------------------------------------------

Step 2 on page 330 contains an error.

Change:
"CViewDBDialog"

To:
"CViewDBDlg"


Page 330: Last Two Variable Names In Table Are Reversed
-------------------------------------------------------

On Page 330, in Table 7.4 the last two variable names are reversed.

The corrected table should look like this:

Resource ID        Category      Variable type     Variable name
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDC_ADODC1         Control       CAdodc            m_adodc
IDC_DATAGRID1      Control       CDataGird         m_datagird
IDC_ORDERLIST      Value         CString           m_strOrder
IDC_ORDERLIST      Control       CListBox          m_lbOrder


Page 334: Incorrect Variable Name &amp; Resource ID In Table
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 334, in Table 7.5, IDC_FUND should be IDC_QUERY_FUND on both lines, and
the variable name m_dtFund should be m_cbFund.

The first two entries in the table should look like this:

Resource ID        Category      Variable type     Variable name
------------------------------------------------------------------
IDC_QUERY_FUND     Value         int               m_nFund
IDC_QUERY_FUND     Control       CComboBox         m_cbFund


Page 338 &amp; 339: ID_QUERY_DATABASE Should Be ID_DATA_QUERYDATABASE
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On page 338 and 339, both references to "ID_QUERY_DATABASE" should be changed to
"ID_DATA_QUERYDATABASE".

On page 338, step 2 should read:
"Use ClassWizard to add a command handler for the ID_DATA_QUERYDATABASE ID to the
CSTUploadDoc class."

On page 339, step 1 should read:
"Use ClassWizard to add an UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handler for the
ID_DATA_QUERYDATABASE ID to the CSTUploadDoc class."


Page 389: IEncoder Is Missing a Cap
-----------------------------------

On page 389, in the code block at the end of the page, in the 4th line, "public
Iencoder" should be replaced with "public IEncoder".


Page 401: Idispatch Should Be IDispatch
---------------------------------------

On page 401, in the code at the bottom of the page, change Idispatch to
IDispatch.


Page 404: Iunknown Should Be IUnknown
-------------------------------------

On page 404, at the bottom of the page, change Iunknown to IUknown.

The last line of type on the page should be:

  IEncoder : public IUknown&lt;BR/&gt;


Page 410: Step 4 EncodeServer\Debug Should Read EncodeHello\Debug
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On page 410, in step 4 change EncodeServer\Debug to EncodeHello\Debug.

Step 4 should read as follows:
"When the compilation is complete, locate the files EncodeServer.tlh and
EncodeServer.tli in the EncodeHello\Debug folder."


Page 421: STLink.udl Is Not In The Location The Code Points To
--------------------------------------------------------------

On page 421, Lab 10 instructs you to create a folder and file
C:\DataLinks\STLink.udl

In the sample code shown on page 424, the following code is used to refer to this
file:

  File Name=C:\\STLink.UDL

If the code is executed, the file will not be found and you may receive an error
message.

You can either change the location of the file to C:\STLink.UDL or change the
code to C:\\DataLinks\\STLink.udl. Either method will fix the problem.


Page 427: Code In CH10_04.CPP Is For Step 7 Not Step 5
------------------------------------------------------

On page 427, the reference to the file CH10_04.cpp shouldn't be in step 5. It
should be in step 7. This file contains the code for the
CSTUploadDoc::OnDataUpload() function only.

Delete the following sentence from step 5 and place it under the first sentence
in step 7.

"(This code can be found in CH10_04.cpp, installed from the companion CD.)"


Page 441 &amp; 442 : Incorrect File Name
------------------------------------

On page 441, in the second line change:
"OneArmedBandit.cpp"

To:
"OneArmedBanditCtrl.cpp"

This file name is also used on page 442, in the last sentence of the first
paragraph on Stock Property Pages and should also be changed as outlined above.


Page 444: Change ClassWizard To ClassView
-----------------------------------------

On page 444 in step 1, change ClassWizard to ClassView.

Step 1 should read:
"In ClassView, right-click the COneArmedBanditCtrl class."


Page 456: NumberOfProperties Should be NumberOfSymbols In Last Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 256, in the last paragraph, NumberOfProperties should be changed to
NumberOfSymbols.

Change:
"This function sets the control's NumberOfProperties property with the integer
value..."

To:
"This function sets the control's NumberOfSymbols property with the integer
value..."


Page 481: Change TitlePage To MyPage
------------------------------------

On page 481, in steps 1 and 2 at the bottom of the page, all instances of
TitlePage should be changed to MyPage.

In Step 1, change:
LoadFromResource(IDR_TITLEPAGE);

To:
LoadFromResource(IDR_MYPAGE);

In Step 2, change:
"Build and run the MyHtmlApp application. Check that the IDR_TITLEPAGE HTML
resource displays as expected.

Note that what you are seeing is a compiled version of the TitlePage.htm file.
This means that any changes you make to the HTML code in the TitlePage.htm..."

To:
"Build and run the MyHtmlApp application. Check that the IDR_MYPAGE HTML resource
displays as expected.

Note that what you are seeing is a compiled version of the MyPage.htm file. This
means that any changes you make to the HTML code in the MyPage.htm..."


Page 545: The VERIFY Macro Will Evaluate Regardless Of Build Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 545, the first sentence states that if you prefer to leave a check in
place for both debug and release builds you can use the VERIFY macro. This is
incorrect. In release versions, VERIFY evaluates the expression argument but
does not check the result.

If you want the expression to be evaluated in both debug and release versions,
you can use the VERIFY macro instead of the ASSERT macro. In debug versions,
VERIFY is the same as ASSERT. However, ASSERT will not evaluate expressions in
the release version.

Change:
"If you prefer to leave a check in place for both debug and release builds, use
the VERIFY macro instead, which functions regardless of the build
configuration."

To:
"If you want to evaluate the expression in both debug and release builds, use the
VERIFY macro instead, which evaluates regardless of the build configuration."
