SYMPTOMS
========

Web clients may fail to connect to Web sites that use Server Gated Cryptography
(SGC) for strong encryption when a secure connection is required. If either the
Internet server or Web client is running Microsoft products, then the connection
may fail. If the Internet server and Web client are both running Microsoft
products, then no problem occurs.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs in the security provider Schannel.dll file, which is used in
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and Microsoft Internet Explorer,
when you connect to a site that uses SGC to do high encryption, and the export
cipher suite uses one hash algorithm and the domestic cipher suite uses another.
In this situation, the Schannel.dll file occasionally selects the wrong
algorithm, which results in a failed connection.

RESOLUTION
==========

STATUS
======

Windows 2000
------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows 2000. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000
Service Pack 1.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT 4.0.

Windows 9x
----------

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98 Second Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix should be applied based on the following scenarios:

- If the server is running IIS and the clients are not running Microsoft
  Internet Explorer, then apply the Microsoft Windows NT patch on the server.

- If the server is running Microsoft Personal Web Server (PWS) for Windows 95
  or 98 and the clients are not running Microsoft Internet Explorer, then apply
  the appropriate Microsoft Windows 95 or 98 patch on the PWS computer.

- If the server is not running IIS or PWS and the client is running Microsoft
  Internet Explorer, then apply the appropriate Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft
  Windows 95, or Microsoft Windows 98 patch on the client.

Note: If the Internet server and Web client are Microsoft products, then there is
no issue. In most Windows 95 and Windows 98 cases, Windows is used as a client,
and the fix should be applied on the client side.
