-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the inventory synchronization process initiated either manually or
automatically as part of the site attachment process, the inventory information
sent to the parent site may be damaged. This can lead to failure in the
inventory synchronization operation and/or cause damaged data to be inserted at
the parent site.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the child site improperly formatting the data files
that represent the inventory and then forwarding the improperly formatted data
files to the parent site. Upon reception, the parent site attempts to insert the
data as formatted, causing invalid data to be inserted or insertion failures
resulting in damaged information and/or failed inventory synchronization. This
is the result of a buffer overflow during the site attachment file construction
at the child site and can cause damage at 8 kilobyte (KB) intervals within site
attachment data files. If the data that is damaged during this process is
validated by SQL server prior to insertion into the site database (as with
date/time fields), a failure will cause the attachment process to fail. If the
data that is damaged during this process is an unvalidated field such as a
string, the corrupt data is inserted at the parent site without causing a
failure in site attachment.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
