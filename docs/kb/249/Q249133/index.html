-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Microsoft Exchange Server is used as a backbone between two Lotus cc:Mail
post offices, all of the messages that are sent from cc:Mail users that are
addressed to cc:Mail users on a different post office are rejected by the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail. A non-delivery report (NDR) that
is similar to the following is sent to the originator of the message:

  From: ~BEL01 at CCMAIL
  Sent: Wednesday, December 22, 1999 11:31 AM
  To: User, Test
  Subject: Undeliverable: test from bel02

  Your message was not delivered to all recipients.

  Subject: test from bel02
  Sent: 12/22/99 9:02:00 AM

  The following email address(es) were unknown:

  at PO_NAME

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the Connector for cc:Mail cannot process the message
because the recipient address is incomplete in the TO field. To determine if the
recipient address is incomplete, use one of the following methods:

- In the text of the NDR, look for a description that is similar to the
  following:

  The following email address(es) were unknown: at PO_NAME

  If the description is missing the user name portion of the e-mail address, the
  recipient address is incomplete. If the recipient address is complete, the
  e-mail address is formatted as "USER_NAME at PO_NAME."

- If cc:Mail message archiving is enabled, a copy of the original message from
  cc:Mail is saved in the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Export.bak folder. Open the CCM
  file and examine the message header. If the TO field is missing the user name
  portion of the e-mail address, the recipient address is incomplete.

For additional information about how to enable cc:Mail message archiving, click

  Q192516 XFOR: T-shooting cc:Mail Connector Mail Conversion Problems

This problem is caused by the cc:Mail version 8.3 Export.exe file.

WORKAROUND

cc:Mail version 8.01 Export.exe file.
