-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although Logon Server Manager (LSM) is set to use a polling cycle that is
defined by the logon point update interval for Windows Networking Logon Client
Installation/Windows Networking Logon Discovery in the Systems Management Server
(SMS) Administrator console, it performs an unscheduled polling cycle when you
start SMS Executive.

This may be a problem if a number of SMS sites exist within a domain that spans
wide-area network (WAN) links with many domain controllers. If one or more SMS
site servers perform an unscheduled LSM polling cycle, excessive network traffic
may be produced during domain enumeration. If a number of SMS sites share a
single domain, it may cause that domain enumeration not to succeed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the site server is unable to create the Nt_logon.tok
file in the primary domain controller's Smslogon\Sitescfg folder because another
site is currently performing a domain enumeration. Only one site at a time can
successfully perform an LSM polling cycle because of the required file
manipulation on the primary domain controller's logon point. If a number of site
servers share the same Microsoft Windows NT-based domain, it may become
difficult for a single site to obtain the lock (the Nt_logon.tok file) on the
primary domain controller for domain enumeration and file manipulation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The functionality of SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER has been changed so that it
does not perform a polling cycle when you stop and restart SMS Executive. A
polling cycle begins under the following circumstances:

- A polling cycle is actually due.

- A polling cycle was due to take place while LSM was stopped.

- A site control file property for LSM has changed since it was stopped.
