SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Release 1 (SR-1) contains key advances in
messaging security via support for Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
version 3 (S/MIME v3).
S/MIME v3 is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet standard which
extends the capabilities of S/MIME v2, most of which was implemented in
Microsoft Outlook Express and Outlook 98.

The new Cryptographic Message Syntax standard, S/MIME v3 and S/MIME v3 Extended
Security Services (ESS), taken together, allow S/MIME to provide greatly
enhanced capabilities.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some of the key features of Outlook 2000 SR-1 for advanced security are:

- Support for the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement for encryption

- DSS for Digital Signature - an SHA hashing algorithm that generates a 160-bit
  hash value.

- Signed (Secure) receipts

- Security labels

- A new Certificate User Interface

- The ability to publish your S/MIME certificates to the Global Address List

- Multiple layers of encryption and signatures

- Multiple digital signatures per layer

Several new Outlook 2000 features are implemented, as well. These features are:

- LDAP support in-the-box for accessing certificates

- Cryptographic auto configuration to assist in setting up a security profile

- Contact security properties to control encryption to external addresses

- Ability to share contact entries which contain certificates

- Addition of "Signed By" to Read Note form

NOTE: The enhanced encryption and security features of this release require
Microsoft Windows 2000.

IMPORTANT: Outlook continues to work with Internet Explorer 4.x and Internet
Explorer 5 without these new encryption and security features. There is no need
to upgrade to a new operating system or a new version of Exchange Server unless
you need these new features. (Note that the new security and encryption features
are disabled but visible if Outlook 2000 SR-1 is installed without upgrading the
operating system to Windows 2000.)

The advanced security features of Outlook 2000 SR-1 are enabled by the addition
of a registry key. To enable these new features:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following subkey in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Outlook

3. On the Edit menu, click New, and then click Key.

4. Type "Security" (without the quotation marks) to name the new subkey, and
  then select this new subkey.

5. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: EnableSRFeatures Data Type: REG_DWORD Value: 1

6. Quit Registry Editor.

If the EnableSRFeatures value is set to 0, the new security features are not
enabled or visible to users.

Additional information about enhanced security features in Outlook 2000 SR-1 can
be found in the New Encryption and Security Features in Microsoft Outlook 2000
SR-1 white paper. This white paper also documents additional registry settings
that allow you to customize security. You can download the white paper from the
