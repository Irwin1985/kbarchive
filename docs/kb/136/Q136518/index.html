SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines some new features, software, and utilities that are new to

smooth integration of future releases of Microsoft Messaging software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

New Server Features in version 3.5
----------------------------------

Multitasking MTA for Windows NT:

  With Microsoft Windows NT support, you can run multiple instances of the
  External and Dispatch programs on a single computer. These can either be run
  as services within Windows NT, or as a console application.

  You can increase the number of remote postoffice links, provide modem pooling
  for Remote client users, and improve Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)
  service.

  To allow easier administration, these services can be remotely monitored from
  another Windows NT computer.

  NOTE: In previous version of Microsoft Mail, the Multitasking MTA was a
  separate product. It is now included as a server component.

Postoffice Diagnostics Utility:

  The Microsoft Mail Postoffice Diagnostics utility is a Windows-based utility
  that checks and fixes Microsoft Mail databases.

  You can use the diagnostics utility to diagnose and resolve potential
  corruption problems on the postoffice.

  Microsoft designed this utility to enable you to better administer and
  maintain your Microsoft Mail postoffice.

New Utilities
-------------

A new set of utilities provides easier management of message files,
synchronization of Personal Address Books (PAB), and help to manage Dir- Sync.
The utilities are Those are provided on the Utilities disk. For more
information, please refer to Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide, Appendix A
"Administrator Utilities."

The following is a list of the utilities that are in included with Microsoft Mail
for 3.5 and a brief description:

MS-DOS Client Utilities

The Flag Down Utility
The Flag Down utility, FLAGDOWN.COM, is for MS-DOS clients. It removes the Mail
flag that appears when you are running Monitor or Micro with the Flag option
specified and receive new mail. If you don't run the Flag Down utility, you can
make the flag disappear by pressing the hot key.

The Hot Key Utility
The Hot Key utility, HOTKEY.EXE, is for MS-DOS clients. It allows you to check
your Monitor or Micro hot key in case you have forgotten it.

The New Mail Utility
The New Mail utility, NEWMAIL.EXE, is for MS-DOS clients. It allows you to check
the postoffice for new mail, telling you the number of new mail items and the
number of unread mail items that you have.

The Remove It Utility The Remove It utility, REMOVEIT.COM, is for MS-DOS clients.
It removes the Micro program or the Monitor program from your workstation's
memory.

The Remove Operator Utility
The Remove Operator utility, REMOVEOP.COM, is for MS-DOS clients. It removes the
Operator program from your workstation's memory.

Administrator Utilities

NOTE: You can run the Rebuild and Import utilities on both MS-DOS and Windows NT
systems. All other utilities are for MS-DOS systems only.

The Re-sort Utility
The Re-sort utility, RESORT.EXE, is for administrators. When address lists are
exported, some countries sort their extended characters in a different order
than others do. Re-sort allows you to sort the address lists in a way that is
acceptable for your postoffice. See Appendix D of the Microsoft Mail
Administrators Guide, "Using Microsoft Mail in an International Environment,"
for additional Re-sort utility applications.

The Folders Compression Utility
The Folders Compression utility, FOLDCOMP.EXE, is for administrators and MS- DOS
clients. It recovers disk space from folders. There may be space to recover if
mail has been deleted from the folders since the last time the folders were
compressed. The most common use of the Folders Compression utility is by MS-DOS
client users, to compress folders that have been moved to hard disk storage on
their own computers. Most administrators use the Local-Admin Folders Compress
option to compress folders on the server. However, administrators can also use
the Folders Compression Utility.

The Rebuild Utility
The Rebuild utility, REBUILD.EXE, is for administrators. It rebuilds the Global
Address List (GAL).

The Global Address List (GAL) lists all the addresses that are accessible to
users at your postoffice, combining entries from all address lists, including
gateway lists. With it, users can select addresses from one list rather than
moving through several lists. Use of the Global Address List is optional. When
changes are made to any of the address lists at your postoffice, the Global
Address List must be rebuilt so that it reflects the address changes. You can
use the Rebuild utility to rebuild the Global Address List. If you use directory
synchronization, it rebuilds the Global Address List for you. See Chapter 9 of
the Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide, "Global Directory Synchronization,"
for more information.

The Import Utility

Administrators can use the Import utility, IMPORT.EXE, to:

- Import local postoffice user information.

- Import external postoffice and gateway user information.

- Import users' names extracted from the LAN Manager account service or the
  Novell Bindery with the LMEXT.EXE and NOVEXT.EXE utilities.

Windows Utilities

Convert Utility
The Convert utility converts version 2.1 MS-DOS, Windows, and Presentation
Manager client folders to the version 3.0 format. It is described in the
documentation for the Windows and Presentation Manager clients.

Move User Utility
Use the Move User utility, MOVEUSER.EXE, to move users to another postoffice or
delete users from your postoffice. To move users directly between postoffices,
both postoffices must be connected by a direct MS-DOS drive. Move User copies
the user's mail information to a new postoffice; it does not remove the user
from the original postoffice. The user's Mail information remains until you
delete it. If postoffices are not on the same network, you can use Move User to
export mailboxes to a file that can be imported into a postoffice on another
network.

Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&amp;T Mail

Also included in Microsoft Mail 3.5 is the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&amp;T
Mail. This is a software package that provides connectivity of Microsoft Mail
software to the AT&amp;T Mail network. Connectivity of Microsoft Mail to
AT&amp;T Mail through the Gateway lets users of Microsoft Mail communicate
globally using the AT&amp;T Mail service. Users must have contact AT&amp;T Mail
in order to establish an account and obtain the appropriate software before
using this gateway. Please refer to the Microsoft Mail Gateway to AT&amp;T Mail
Administrator's Guide for additional information.

Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer for Microsoft Mail for Windows.

Also included with Microsoft Mail 3.5 is the Electronic Forms Designer software
that was previously should as a separate package that complements

Microsoft Mail for Windows. The Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer is a set of a
tools for developing powerful electronic forms to use with Microsoft Mail
electronic mail system. With Electronic Forms Designer, you use Microsoft Visual
Basic version 2.0 Professional Edition programming system for Windows to develop
your forms and use Microsoft's messaging application programming interface
(MAPI) for access to the messaging system. The Designer consists of function
libraries, sample forms, a browsing application (the Browser), and a generic
template that you use as a foundation for all of your forms. The electronic
forms (eforms) you develop can structure information and automate complex tasks.
When you install these forms as Microsoft Mail custom message types, users can
electronically route structured information to coworkers anywhere on their on
their network. Please refer to the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer
Developer's Guide for more information.
