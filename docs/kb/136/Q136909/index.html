MORE INFORMATION
================

COPYING PICTURES TO THE CLIPBOARD OR DESKTOP
============================================

You can copy a variety of pictures from Microsoft World of Flight to
the Windows Clipboard or use them as your Windows Wallpaper. If you
copy to the Clipboard, you can paste the picture into another Windows
program. If you make wallpaper, the picture will appear on your
desktop behind the windows on your screen. To use a Microsoft World of
Flight picture as wallpaper, the picture file must be copied to your
Windows directory.

To copy a picture:

1. Click the Options button to display the list of choices.

2. Click Picture Gallery.

3. Display the picture you want by clicking the arrow keys or
  scrolling through the Gallery List.

4. Either click Copy Picture to copy the picture to the Clipboard, or

You can also change your Windows wallpaper by using the Windows
Control Panel. In Windows 3.1, open the Desktop dialog box. In Windows
95 or later, open the Display dialog box. For more information on
changing your Windows wallpaper, see your Windows documentation.

ADDING THE WORLD OF FLIGHT COLLECTION TO MICROSOFT SCENES 2.0
=============================================================

If you have Microsoft Scenes 2.0 installed on your computer, you can
add a new collection of 40 Microsoft World of Flight pictures to your
current installation of Scenes.

To add Microsoft World of Flight pictures to Scenes:

1. Click the Options button to display the list of choices.

2. Click Picture Gallery.

3. Click the Add To Scenes button.  A dialog will appear telling you
  that the pictures will be copied to your hard drive.

4. Click YES.

5. Another dialog will appear asking you if you want to edit your
  screen saver settings. If you click YES, you will be able to change
  the delay, the transition effects, and other settings available
  through Microsoft Scenes 2.0.

6. When you have finished editing your screen saver settings, click
  OK.

After following these steps, the World of Flight Scenes Collection
will be completely installed on your computer. You can go back and
edit your screen saver settings at any time with the Microsoft Scenes
program or by using the Windows Control Panel.

If Scenes Installation Fails
----------------------------

If you follow the steps above to install the World of Flight Scenes
Collection and you get a message that says "Installation failed", you
should try doing the following:

- Re-install Microsoft Scenes 2.0 to replace files which may be
  missing from your current Scenes installation.

- Check to make sure you have enough space on your hard drive for the
  40 new images (approximately 2.0 MB).

- Make sure your scenes2.ini and system.ini files are not read-only.
  You can find these files in your Windows directory, and you can
  determine if they're read-only by selecting properties from the
  File menu within File Manager.

PRINTING
========

You can print any article screen or popup window in Microsoft World of
Flight. Both pictures and words on the screen will be printed, so
printing may take a few minutes. The Quality setting in the Print
dialog box affects the time it takes to print. High quality takes
longer to print; low quality takes less time to print.

To print:

1. Display the image you want to print on the screen.

2. Click the Options button to display a list of choices.

3. Click Print to display the Print dialog box.

4. Under Quality, click High/Slower (slower printing) or Low/Faster
  (faster printing).

5. Under Page Orientation, you can select how you want your picture to
  print. Click Portrait/Tall to print a picture that is taller than
  it is wide. Click Landscape/Wide to print a picture that is wider
  than it is tall.

6. Click OK to begin printing.

USING SCREEN SAVERS
===================

Microsoft World of Flight comes with a screen saver option that will
display a slide show of pictures from Microsoft World of Flight. You
can choose between two different picture sets:  Scrap Book Slide Show
or Warbirds Slide Show.

If you have Microsoft Scenes 2.0 installed on your computer, you can
also choose to add a new collection of 40 Microsoft World of Flight
pictures to your current Scenes installation. For more information on
this option, see the "Adding the World of Flight Collection to
Microsoft Scenes 2.0" section above.

The Microsoft World of Flight screen savers go into effect after the
keyboard and mouse have been idle for a certain amount of time. To
change the delay time or to choose other options that affect the
screen saver, use the Windows Control Panel.

  you've selected the screen saver, a dialog box appears to tell you
  that it will copy a file onto your hard drive.

If you want to switch from one screen saver to another, just select
the new screen saver.

CONTROLLING SOUNDS AND ANIMATIONS

randomly while you're using Microsoft World of Flight (like the planes
that fly across your screen).  If you choose to turn the background
Sound Effects/Animations Off, the animations and their associated
sounds will stop playing.

RUNNING FULL SCREEN
===================

If you are using Windows 95 or later and your screen resolution is
higher than 640x480, Microsoft World of Flight allows you to choose
between full screen mode (640x480) and your current screen resolution.

To control the way World of Flight displays on your computer:

1. Click the Options button to display a list of choices.

2. Click Audio/Video to display the Audio/Video dialog box.

3. Choose On or Off under Run Full Screen.

4. Click OK.

RANDOM JUMPS
============

You can set up Microsoft World of Flight so that the program displays
articles randomly on the screen. It's a great way to find out what's
in Microsoft World of Flight.
