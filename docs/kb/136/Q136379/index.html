-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit: FFAPI for Gateways and Applications, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message and later receive a non-delivery message, the following
message may be included:

  [021] Message was not delivered due to missing routing file.

The message is also placed in the SYSTEM.LOG of the postoffice of the recipient.
This non-delivery message can be inappropriate in that the recipient has
received the message.

CAUSE
=====

Gateways and FFAPI-based applications can contribute to the occurrence of this
incorrect message. When these programs execute the mailer process, they will
delete the routing file prior to updating the In queue of the postoffice. When
the In queue cannot be updated due to file contention, a reference will continue
to exist for a message that has no associated routing file. This will cause the
021 message on the next cycle of In queue processing.


WORKAROUND
==========

When possible, the following steps should be taken to reduce the occurrence of
these errors.

- Use the mailer disable option on gateways that support this option. When you
  use the mailer disable option, an external program must be available to
  perform the mailer option. (Version 3.2 and later of the External Mail
  program (EXTERNAL.EXE will not delete the routing file if the In queue cannot
  be updated.)

  The SMTP and X400 gateways support -md (mailer disable.)

- Place gateways and FFAPI-based applications on postoffices that have a
  minimal amount of In queue activity. This will reduce the occurrence of In
  queue file contention and increase the likelihood that the In queue will be
  updated successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail
Software Development Kit: FFAPI for Gateways and Applications. A fix for this
problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Contact Microsoft Product Support
Services for more information on the availability of this fix.



MORE INFORMATION
================

Mailer is the process that handles mail that has been posted to the In queue
mailbag of a postoffice. The process involves posting a message header into each
recipients mailbag, updating the In queue to remove the reference to the mail
item, and deleting the routing file that was used to identify local recipients
of the message.

The 021 error can occur when the mailer process is unable to access the In queue
to delete the reference to the mail item following mail delivery. On a
subsequent mailer process, a header is found that no longer has a routing file
associated with it. This produces the 021 error message in the SYSTEM.LOG and
results in the non-delivery notice being sent to the sender of the mail item.

NOTE: The problem described in this article will not occur in mail systems that
have version 3.2 or later of the External Mail program. These versions of
External will not delete the routing file when the In queue cannot be updated.
