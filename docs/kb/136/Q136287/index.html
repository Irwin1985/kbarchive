Beta Release Document
Bookshelf Intro Edition (MSN)
Test Release 14

This document was last updated on June 23th, 1995

Thank you for using Microsoft Bookshelf Intro Edition. We
hope you enjoy it!

SETUP of Bookshelf Intro Edition
--------------------------------

To install Bookshelf Intro Edition, double click on the
Bookshelf Installer. Installation will take about 5 minutes
running at 14.4 Kbps and will require approximately 700 KB
of hard drive space.

If you would like an easy way to run Bookshelf after the
installation is finished, click and hold the Bookshelf Intro
Edition icon in the Microsoft Bookshelf Intro Edition Forum
window, then drag the icon onto your desktop and let go.
This will create a desktop shortcut that you can click on to
start Bookshelf. If you click on the icon when you aren't
connected to MSN, you will be logged on automatically before
Bookshelf starts.

If you experience difficulties, please see the section
Installation Help below.

BEGINNING TO USE BOOKSHELF INTRO EDITION: YAHOO!
------------------------------------------------

Bookshelf Intro Edition was designed with novice users in
mind. Just type in the word or words you would like to find
in the Table of Contents Edit Field. Another way to search
is by using Find, or full text search. Click on the Find
tab, type the search word or phrase and hit Enter. If you
have more questions, please use our on-line help which is
available from the Help menu in Bookshelf Intro Edition.

SENDING FEEDBACK
----------------

PLEASE DO NOT REPORT PROBLEMS WITH DOWNLOADING OR RUNNING
BOOKSHELF INTRO EDITION IN THE BOOKSHELF BBS!

Instead, problems (bug reports) should be posted in the

Please send us your comments via The Bookshelf BBS area we
have made available on The Microsoft Network. If you do send
us your comments on the BBS, please let us know if you read
this document. We want to determine what the best way to
keep you all informed is.

Thanks!

If you have any questions regarding billing, error messages
or other system problems, the quickest way to get an answer
is to find it in Categories / The Microsoft Network Beta / 
Member Assistance folder. If you don't find the answer
there, you can call Microsoft Customer Support for billing
and subscription issues (the phone numbers are available in
the Member Assistance area), or Microsoft Technical Support
for software or hardware problems or questions. Please have
your MSN Member ID handy when you call.

HAVE FUN! WE THINK BOOKSHELF INTRO EDITION IS AWESOME!

Installation Help
-----------------

(These notes apply to the Installer which was operational up
to June 23rd, 1995. A new Installer was put into place
beginning June 24th, 1995.)

These errors may be encountered during the download process.

Out of Environment Space
Not Enough Memory to Run

You should increase your DOS environment to 2,048 bytes, by
following one of the two suggestions noted below. In the
interim, we are working internally on a better installation
program.

1. Go to Tools Find on the menu.

2. Select File or Folders.

3. Search for the file Instbe.bat.

4. Right click its icon.

5. Open the property sheet.

6. Select the Memory tab.

7. Change the Initial environment value to 2048.

8. Click on OK to exit the property sheet.

  -or-

  Use the Explorer to find the Command.com file. Right-
  click to change the properties of your DOS environment.

8. Select the Memory tab to increase the initial environment
  setting to 2048.

Cannot Create/Delete Directory Although we have a solution
for this tech issue, we are still investigating why it
occurs. The solution  is to locate the following files and
remove the read only attribute from each:

- Bshelf95.exe
- Bssym1.ttf
- Bssym2.ttf
- Bssym3.ttf

It may be noteworthy that the Microsoft Network directory is
marked Read-Only. If your DOS window opens up outside the
directory then you might get this error.

Invalid Parameters
------------------

You receive a DOS error message "Invalid Parameters"
You may have attempted to run the Instbe.bat file manually.
This batch file is called automatically by the Installer
with the correct parameters.

  - or

You may have an incorrect file association. See To Set Or
Change A File Association below.

It Downloaded But Does Not Run
------------------------------

You click on the installer icon and a progress bar appeared.
After the progress bar disappeared, you clicked on the Run
icon, but nothing happened. You may have clicked on the icon
of the file BSHELF95.EXE on your local hard drive. You must
click on the Step 3 Run Bookshelf icon in the MSN Viewer
window.

  - or

You may not have the correct file association set up. At
this time, you need to have a file ending in .INS associated
with a file called Instbe.bat. See To Set Or Change A File
Association below.

Uninstalling Bookshelf
----------------------

If there is a national emergency, or you buy the CD ROM
version, then you may want to delete Bookshelf Intro Edition
from your hard drive. Delete the following files from your
C:\PROGRAM FILES\THE MICROSOFT NETWORK directory:

- Bshelf95.exe
- Bssym1.ttf
- Bssym2.ttf
- Bssym3.ttf

To Set Or Change A File Association
-----------------------------------

1. In the menu of the MSN window, select View, Options from
  the menu.

2. In the dialog box, choose File Types.

3. In the File Types tab, click on New Type.

4. In the Description of type text box, enter "MSN
  Installer."

5. In the Associated Extension text box, enter "ISN"

6. Click on the New button to open the New Action dialog.
  (If you get an error at this point, you already have the
  file association  installed, so just back up).

7. In the Action text box, enter "OPEN"

8. Use the Browse button to find the Instbe.bat file (it
  should be under \program files\The Microsoft Network) and
  click OK to select it.

9. Select OK to exit the Action dialog and save your
  changes.

10. Select Close to exit the Add New File Type dialog.

11. Select Close to exit the Options dialog. Try re-
   installing Bookshelf.
