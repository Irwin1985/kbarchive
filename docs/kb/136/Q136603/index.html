SUMMARY
=======

This article contains the text of the Readme.txt file included in Ppredraw.exe,
a self-extracting file that corrects a screen redraw problem.

When you toggle between certain views in PowerPoint version 7.0a, PowerPoint may
appear to stop responding or it may redraw objects incorrectly. In addition, you
may receive one of the following error messages:

  System resources are too low to draw everything correctly.

  Out of Memory.

This screen redraw problem exists only in the 7.0a release of PowerPoint 95. This
problem drains system resources, which causes PowerPoint screen redraws to
become distorted and system performance to be slow. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Office version 7.0b for Windows 95.

Microsoft(R) PowerPoint(R) for Windows(R) 95
Screen Redraw Problem and Solution

======================================================================
Revision Date: 3/96

The following information applies to Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95,
version 7.0a.

INTRODUCTION--EXPLANATION OF THE SCREEN REDRAW PROBLEM
======================================================

PowerPoint version 7.0a may exhibit a screen redraw problem in certain
views after several minutes of use. This screen redraw problem only exists
in the "a" release of PowerPoint 95. This problem drains system resources,
causing PowerPoint screen redraws to distort and system performance to slow
upon continued use. You may receive system alerts notifying you of low
system resources. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should save
your work and close PowerPoint. Your files will remain intact, along with
any changes you have made. If you do not save and exit PowerPoint as soon
as you notice the symptoms, you may lose any recent changes to the open
PowerPoint file. This problem will not corrupt the PowerPoint file, or any
other open files on your system. Once PowerPoint is closed, system
resources and the behavior of other applications will return to normal.

The problem occurs mainly under Windows 95, although it may occur under
Windows NT(R) 3.51 with heavy PowerPoint use.

DETERMINING IF YOUR VERSION OF POWERPOINT 95 HAS THIS PROBLEM
=============================================================

To determine if you have the 7.0a version of PowerPoint:

1. Launch PowerPoint.

2. From the Help menu select About Microsoft PowerPoint.

3. If Version 7.0a appears below the product name, you should install
  the patch for this problem.  If it simply reads Version 7.0, you
  do not need this patch.

CORRECTING THE PROBLEM IN VERSION 7.0a
======================================

The patch file included with this Readme file is for use with Microsoft
PowerPoint version 7.0a only. This patch modifies Microsoft PowerPoint so
that the problem no longer occurs.

To install the patch
--------------------

1. If you received a disk with this Readme file, insert the
  patch disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.

  If you downloaded this Readme file from an online service,
  using File Manager or Windows Explorer, double-click the
  PPREDRAW.EXE file you downloaded onto your disk.

2. If Microsoft PowerPoint is running, quit Microsoft PowerPoint.

3. Using File Manager or Windows Explorer, double-click the Update.bat
  file in your drive A folder or your hard disk.

  After a moment, you will see the following message in a MS-DOS(R)
  window:

     The patch was successfully installed.

4. Close the MS-DOS window. You are now ready to run PowerPoint.

To apply the patch to Administrative Installs
---------------------------------------------

This section is applicable to Network System Administrators.
Administrative installations of PowerPoint must also be updated. To update
a shared PowerPoint install point, or a shared PowerPoint installation:

1. You must have full access to the shared server location.

2. Connect to the Shared Server Location (where PowerPnt.exe resides).

3. Verify that the PowerPnt.exe file is read/write.

4. Open an MS-DOS Window.

5. Change to the folder where the patch resides.

6. Type the following at the command prompt

     Update &lt;path&gt;

  where &lt;path&gt; is the fully qualified path to the shared server
  location.  For example, if the shared server is denoted by
  \\server\share, you would type:

       Update \\server\share

  You will see the following message in a MS-DOS window:

     The patch was successfully installed.

7. Close the MS-DOS window.

8. Set the Powerpnt.exe file back to read only if it was read only
  originally.
