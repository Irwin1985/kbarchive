The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes full, incremental, and differential backups. The Backup
tool in Windows 95 supports full and incremental backups. Differential backups
are not supported.

Backup uses backup file sets to help you manage backing up drives, folders, or
files. Incremental and differential backups rely on an initial full backup of
the drives, folders, or files in question.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many Windows 3.1-based backup programs use the archive bit to mark files that
have been backed up. Backup does not use the archive bit in any way. The
decision as to whether or not a file should be backed up in an incremental
backup is based on the filename, its last modified date, and the date of the
last incremental backup, all of which are stored in the file set.

Full Backup (or Reference Backup)
---------------------------------

When you set the Backup Type setting to Full, all the files and folders on the
drive are backed up every time you use that file set. To set the backup type,
click Options on the Settings menu, and then click the Backup tab.

Example:

1. In Backup, click the drives, files, or folders to back up, and then click
  Next Step.

2. Click the destination (where you want the files backed up to).

3. On the Settings menu, click Options, click the Backup tab, click "Full:
  backup of all selected files," and then click OK.

4. On the File menu, click Save As and name your backup set. Once saved, click
  Start Backup.

5. Provide a name for the selected drive, files, or folders in the Backup Set
  Label dialog box, and then click OK.

Advantages:

- All files from the selected drives and folders are backed up to one backup
  set.

- In the event you need to restore files, they are easily restored from the
  single backup set.

Disadvantages:

- A full backup is more time consuming than other backup options.

- Full backups require more disk, tape, or network drive space.

Incremental Backup
------------------

An incremental backup provides a backup of files that have changed or are new
since the last incremental backup. To start the process, a file set with the
incremental option selected is used to perform a backup. You can select the
backup type by clicking Options on the Settings menu, and then clicking the
Backup tab.

For the first incremental backup, all files in the file set are backed up (just
as in a full backup). If you use the same file set to perform a incremental
backup later, only the files that have changed are backed up. If you use the
same file set for a third backup, only the files that have changed since the
second backup are backed up, and so on.

In Backup, you can select files and/or folders to be backed up. If you select a
folder, all the files and folders within that folder are selected. In an
incremental backup, if you select a folder, files that are added to the folder
are included during the next backup. If you select specific files, files that
are added to the folder are not included during the next backup.

Example:

Monday - Perform the first incremental backup of selected files and/or
        folders using a file set with the Incremental option enabled.

Tuesday - Perform another backup with the backup file set you created
         Monday. Only files that have changed since Monday's backup are
         backed up.

Wednesday - Perform another backup with the backup file set you created
           Monday. Only files that have changed since Tuesday's
           incremental backup are backed up.

To reset a file set so that the next backup backs up all files, and not just
files that are new or have changed, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open File Set. Click the file set you want to use,
  and then click Open. Click Next Step.

2. Click the destination (where you want the files backed up to).

3. On the Settings menu, click Options, click the Backup tab, click "Full:
  backup of all selected files," and then click OK.

4. On the File menu, click Save to save your backup set.

5. Repeat steps 1 and 2.

6. On the Settings menu, click Options, click the Backup tab, click
  "Incremental: backup of selected files that have changed since the last full
  backup," and then click OK.

Advantages:

- Backup time is faster than full backups.

- Incremental backups require less disk, tape, or network drive space.

- You can keep several versions of the same files on different backup sets.

Disadvantages:

- In order to restore all the files, you must have all of the incremental
  backups available.

- It may take longer to restore a specific file since you must search more than
  one backup set to find the latest version of a file.

Differential Backup (Not Supported in Backup)
---------------------------------------------

A differential backup provides a backup of files that have changed since a full
backup was performed. A differential backup typically saves only the files that
are different or new since the last full backup, but this can vary in different
backup programs. Together, a full backup and a differential backup include all
the files on your computer, changed and unchanged.

Example:

Monday - Perform a full backup and save the file set.

Tuesday - Perform a differential backup using the same file set. All files
         that have changed since the full backup are backed up in the
         differential backup.

Wednesday - Perform a differential backup using the same file set. All the
           files that have changed since Monday's full backup are backed
           up.

Advantages:

- Differential backups require even less disk, tape, or network drive space
  than incremental backups.

- Backup time is faster than full or incremental backups.

Disadvantages:

- Restoring all your files may take considerably longer since you may have to
  restore both the last differential and full backup.

- Restoring an individual file may take longer since you have to locate the
  file on either the differential or full backup.
