The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Visual Basic, the Project window displays a list of all the form modules,
class modules, and standard modules in the project, as well as a single resource
file, if one is used in the project. To the left of the file name, is a small
icon (called a glyph) which shows the file type. There are different glyphs for
forms, classes, modules, and resource files. In addition, if the file is read
only, there will be a tiny red padlock on the bottom left hand corner of the VB
glyph.

There can be a second glyph to the left of the Visual Basic file glyph. This
second glyph only appears if the file is under source code control. The Source
Code Control glyphs are the same in Visual SourceSafe as they are in Visual
Basic.

NOTE: The forms, classes and modules should only be modified when the red check
mark is visible. The red check mark is only visible when you have checked out
the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The source code control glyphs include the following:

1. A sheet of paper with the corner folded and a black border indicates that the
  file is under source code control and currently has read only status.

2. A sheet of paper with the corner folded and a gray border indicates that the
  file is under source code control and is currently checked out by another
  user.

3. A sheet of paper with a red check mark and a black border indicates that the
  file is checked out of source code control to you and currently has
  read/write status.

4. Multiple sheets of paper with the corner folded and a gray border indicates
  that the file is under source code control, is currently being shared with
  another source code control project, and is currently checked out by another
  user.

5. Multiple sheets of paper with the corner folded, a red check mark, and black
  border indicates that the file is under source code control, is currently
  being shared with another source code control project, and is currently
  checked out to you.

IMPORTANT: Caution should be advised if the sheet of paper with the corner folded
has a black border but neither the tiny padlock nor the red check mark are
present. This indicates the file is under source code control, NOT checked out,
but has read/write status. Anytime a file is not checked out, it should be
marked read-only so you do not accidentally modify the file without it being
checked out. To avoid possible problems, either check the file out to edit it or
set the read-only flag from the Windows Explorer.

If the Source Code Control Add-in is turned off by clearing the box in the Add-In
Manager, all the source code control glyphs disappear. In addition, all the
source code control menu items are disabled.
