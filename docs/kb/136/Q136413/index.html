Subject: Addressing CompuServe Mail users

A message you sent to a CompuServe Mail user could not be delivered due to an
incorrect address. The correct method of addressing CompuServe Mail users is
outlined below.

Five types of CompuServe Mail addresses can be reached from the Internet as
follows:

a. Members of the CompuServe Information Service have an address (a.k.a. User
  ID) of the form "xxxxx,yyyy", such as "74906,1610". To send mail to such an
  address from the Internet, change the comma to a period and attach
  "@CompuServe.com". For instance:

  74906.1610@CompuServe.com

b. Members of organizations with a private CompuServe Mail area have an address
  of the form "organization:name", such as "ABC:J.SMITH". To send mail to such
  an address from the Internet, send it to "name@organization.CompuServe.com".
  For instance:

  J.SMITH@ABC.CompuServe.com

  A few organizations also include a department in the form
  "organization:department:name", such as "ABC:ACCTG:JOHN". To send mail to
  such an address, send to "name@department.organization.CompuServe.com". For
  instance:

  JOHN@ACCTG.ABC.CompuServe.com

c. Members of organizations whose LAN mail system is connected to the CompuServe
  Mail Hub via Novell NetWare MHS have an address of the form "name@workgroup",
  such as "JSMITH@ABC". To send mail to such an address from the Internet, send
  it to "name@workgroup.MHS.CompuServe.com". For instance:

  JSMITH@ABC.MHS.CompuServe.Com

d. Members of organizations whose LAN mail system is connected to the CompuServe
  Mail Hub via cc:Mail have an address of the form "name at postoffice", such
  as "JSMITH at ABC". To send mail to such an address from the Internet, send
  it to "name@postoffice.ccmail.CompuServe.com". For instance:

  JSMITH@ABC.CCMAIL.CompuServe.Com

e. Members of organizations whose X.400 mail system is connected to CompuServe
  as a CompuServe PRMD. Their X.400 addresses will have a Country value of "US"
  and an ADMD value of "CompuServe", such as
  "x400:(c=US;a=CompuServe;p=ABC;s=Smith;g=John)". To send mail to such an
  address, send it to "/s=surname/g=givenname/@prmd.X400.CompuServe.COM". For
  instance:

  /s=Smith/g=John/@ABC.X400.CompuServe.COM.

  Note that the Country and ADMD values are NOT needed on the left side of the
  at sign. Those values are implied by the ".X400.CompuServe.COM" portion of
  the address.

  The "tags" (i.e. the "/s=" and "/g=") are as follows:

       /O    Organization
       /OU   Organizational Unit
       /S    Surname
       /G    Given Name
       /I    Initials
       /Q    Generation Qualifiers
       /U    UA Unique ID
       /X    X.121 Address
       /T    Terminal ID
       /D    Domain Defined Attribute
             (/DD and /DDA are also acceptable)
             NOTE: In a Domain Defined Attribute, the type and value
             are to be separated by an equal sign.

Please note that a number of special destinations available to users of
CompuServe Mail which are NOT accessible from the Internet, including:

   Facsimile Delivery                  (e.g. FAX: )
   Postal Delivery                     (e.g. POSTAL: )
   Telex Delivery                      (e.g. TLX: )
   MCI Mail Delivery                   (e.g. MCIMAIL: )

Finally, please realize that only CompuServe Mail users have access to our member
directory. Since there is no mechanism for you to obtain addresses directly from
CompuServe Incorporated, you should obtain this information from the individuals
with whom you wish to correspond.

Thank you.

  Cordially,

  The Electronic Postmaster
