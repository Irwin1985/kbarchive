  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server (SMS) clients use existing connections from the Client
Access Points (CAPs) and Distribution Points (DPs) designated in their site by
default. If no existing connection exists, clients randomly select from the
CAP/DP list for their site. Sites are defined by local or fast network
connectivity, ensuring load balancing across all CAPs and DPs in the site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some situations, a site may manage a handful of clients across a slow link.
Although this is not a recommended configuration, there are provisions in the
SMS 2.0 architecture to force a client to use a specific CAP or DP. When you
consider an implementation where specific clients have a designated CAP or DP,
keep in mind that clients that do not explicitly have a preferred CAP or DP
identified, select their servers randomly. In other words, if a CAP or DP is
available over a slow link, it still may be chosen by a local client that does
not have designated preferred servers. Defining a site that includes wide area
subnets is not recommended as it negates the SMS 2.0 architecture.

For more information about site boundaries and hierarchy configuration, refer to
Chapter 3 (Planning for SMS in Your Organization) and Chapter 9 (Discovering
Resources and Installing Clients) in the Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0
Administrator's Guide.

Clients can use the following three methods to determine which CAP or DP to use
(listed in order of attempted use):

- Preferred
  Connections are attempted to shares that have been assigned to the preferred
  list and the CAP/DP list. This method is disabled by default. You can specify
  preferred servers using the Prefserv tool (Prefserv.exe), which is included
  with the Microsoft BackOffice 4.5 Resource Kit.

- Existing Connection
  The current list of connections is checked for matches against the shares in
  the CAP/DP list. The first existing connection is reused. This method is
  enabled by default for configurations where workgroups, by way of a drive
  mapping at logon, default to designated application servers, which also
  perform the role of a DP.

- Random
  A share is chosen randomly from the list. This method is enabled by default to
  ensure load balancing across a site.

It is possible to enable, disable, or otherwise configure each server selection
method using the Prefserv tool.
