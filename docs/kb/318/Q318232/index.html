IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are troubleshooting browsing services, running the "browstat.exe
status" command may not return the server list. For example:

  Status for domain Domain1 on
  transport \Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{A6CF5547-5F56-443D-8EDE-EB587696F543}
  Browsing is active on domain.
  Master browser name is: SERVER01
  Master browser is running build 2195
  3 backup servers retrieved from master SERVER01
  \\SERVER02
  \\SERVER03
  \\SERVER04
  Unable to retrieve server list from SERVER01: 1230

This problem may occur if a Systems Management Server (SMS) site is installed on
the domain master browser.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems

testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) version of this fix should have

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, set the set the IsDomainMaster value to No under the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Browser\Parameters registry
key, and then restart the Computer Browser service.
