-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After application of a post-Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 3
(SP3) SMSAPM32 hotfix, dependant programs, previously-disabled programs, or
programs in which the supported platforms have been modified may unexpectedly
run again. Because this problem was introduced with the hotfix for Q293187, any
subsequent post-SMS 2.0 SP3 hotfix to client components that is later than
version 2.00.1493.3194 also has this problem.

CAUSE
=====

The hotfix for Q293187 implements a change where SMSAPM32 deletes program
complete files in the %windir%\MS\SMS\Clicompa\APA\Data\Complete folder after
the program is no longer advertised. This process is intended to delete complete
files that are genuinely no longer advertised. However, because dependant
programs, disabled programs, or programs that have platform that is not valid
are not considered to be advertised by SMSAPM32, SMSAPM32 inadvertently deletes
job files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Examples
--------

Dependant Program Example:

1. Create package A, create Program 1, and then create Program 2.

2. Make Program 2 dependent on Program 1, and then advertise Program 2.

3. Client receives advertisement for Program 2.

4. Program 1 successfully runs, and Program 2 successfully runs.

5. 46 hours passes, or the client computer is restarted 2 times. By default,
  SMSAPM32 shuts down and restarts itself every 23 hours. Because of this, job
  deletion might occur after 2 computer restarts or 46 hours.

6. Program 2 is rescheduled by the advertisement that was created in step 2.

7. Client receives the advertisement, and then starts Program 1 before Program
  2.

NOTE: In some cases, Program 2 may never run. This could be caused if Program 1
needs to restart, 46 hours elapse, the Program 1 job file is deleted, the
computer finally restarts, and then Program 1 (not Program 2) runs because there
is no history of Program 1 previously running.

Disabled Program Example:

1. Create Package A, create Program 1, and then advertise Program 1.

2. Client receives advertisement, and then successfully runs Program 1.

3. The SMS administrator disables the program in Program 1 properties.

4. 46 hours passes, or the client computer is restarted two times. By default,
  SMSAPM32 shuts down and restarts itself every 23 hours. Because of this, job
  deletion might occur after 2 computer restarts or 46 hours.

5. The SMS administration enables the program in Program 1 properties.

6. Client runs Program 1 again.

Platform Support Example:

1. Create Package A, create Program 1, and then advertise Program 1 to a
  Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 collection.

2. Windows NT 4.0 clients receive the advertisement and successfully run Program
  1.

3. The SMS administrator changes Program 1 properties for "This program can run
  only on specified client platforms" to something other than Windows NT 4.0
  clients.

4. 46 hours passes, or the client computer is restarted two times. By default,
  SMSAPM32 shuts down and restarts itself every 23 hours. Because of this, job
  deletion might occur after 2 computer restarts or 46 hours.

5. The SMS administration changes Program 1 properties for "This program can run
  only on specified client platforms" back to "The program can run on any
  platform".

6. Client runs Program 1 again.
