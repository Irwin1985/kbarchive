SYMPTOMS
========

A network install point for the installation of the MSDN Library does not
exist.

The Netsetup.exe program that creates a network install point for the
installation of the MSDN Library is not included with the January 2002 and later
editions of the MSDN Library.

CAUSE
=====

The functionality of NetCopy and NetSetup is included with the Darwin/Windows
Installer-based installation of the MSDN Library product, beginning with the
January 2002 editions and all later editions.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a network install point for the MSDN Library product. To do this, use one
of the following methods:

Use the Windows Installer
-------------------------

The functionality of NetCopy and NetSetup is built into the Darwin/Windows
Installer product, and it is referred to as an Administrative Installation.

To start the Windows Installer, use one of the following command lines:

  msiexec.exe /a &lt;path to MSI file&gt;

-or-

  msiexec.exe /a &lt;path to MSI file&gt; TARGETDIR="&lt;path to target location&gt;"

Use the Manual Method (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM)
-----------------------------------------

To copy the MSDN Library files to a network installation folder, follow these
steps:

- MSDN CD-ROM

  1. Create a folder on the network that is available to the client computers.

  2. Share the folder, and then assign the appropriate read permissions to the
     folder (that is, to client computers, or to user groups as appropriate).

  3. Copy the contents of the CD-ROM #1 to the shared folder.

  4. Copy the contents of the CD-ROM #2 &lt;CD Drive Letter&gt;:\Program
     Files\Msdn\2002Jan\1033 folder into the 1033 folder of the network share
     that you created during step 3.

  5. Repeat step 4 for all remaining CD-ROMs.

- MSDN DVD-ROM

  1. Create a folder on the network that is available to the client computers.

  2. Share the folder, and then assign the appropriate read permissions to the
     folder (that is, to client computers, or to user groups as appropriate).

  3. Copy the contents of the DVD-ROM to the shared folder.

To perform the installation from this shared folder, follow these steps:

1. From the client computer, browse to the shared folder.

2. Run the Setup.exe.

3. Follow the Installation Wizard instructions.

Microsoft recommends that you select the Typical setup option if the shared
folder is to remain available to the clients. This setup requires the least hard
disk space from the client computer.

If you do not expect to retain the network install point, Microsoft recommends a
full installation to avoid losing access to the shared files.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
