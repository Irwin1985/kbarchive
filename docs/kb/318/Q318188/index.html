SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to use the Graphics Device Interface (GDI)
application programming interface (API) to save the client area of a Visual
Basic form to a device-independent bitmap, known as a DIB section, that
applications can write to directly. A DIB section, which you can create by
calling the Windows API function CreateDIBSection(), allows device-independent
modification of the bits because you have access to a pointer to the location of
the bitmap's bit values.

Save the Client Area to a DIB Section
-------------------------------------

To save the client area of a Visual Basic form to a DIB section, follow these
steps:

1. Use the GetDC() GDI API call to create a device context for the Visual Basic
  form window's client area.

2. Create a DIB section bitmap that is the same size as the Visual Basic form
  window's client area.

3. Use the CreateCompatibleDC() GDI API call to create a memory device context
  that is compatible with the Visual Basic form window's device context that
  you created in step 1.

4. Use the SelectObject GDI API call to select the DIB section bitmap into the
  memory device context.

5. Use a GDI API call, such as BitBlt() or StretchBlt() to transfer the image
  from the form's device context to the memory device context.

Sample Code
-----------

To simplify the creation and use of DIB sections, a sample of code is available
that contains most of the functionality in a dynamic link library (DLL). For
additional information and to download this sample, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q186221 SAMPLE: DibSectn.exe Uses DIBSections in Win32

The sample code that follows uses this DLL to demonstrate the steps that are
listed earlier, and then calls DSStoreDIBSectionInBMPFile from the DLL to store
the DIB section to a file. You can use other functions in the DLL to make
changes to the DIB section that you create, or you can use GDI API calls.
