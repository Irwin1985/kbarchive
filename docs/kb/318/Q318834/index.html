-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The source version of a Systems Management Server (SMS) Package that appears in
the SMS Administrator console at a child site may be different from the source
version that appears in the parent site's SMS Administrator console view of the
same child site.

In the SMS Administrator console on the child site you see the source version by
clicking System Status, Package Status, &lt;Package Name&gt;, and then &lt;Child
Site&gt;.

In the SMS Administrator console on the parent site you see the source version by
clicking System Status, Package Status, &lt;Package Name&gt;, and then &lt;Child
Site&gt;.

After the package source has been successfully updated, the two versions are the
same. If they are not the same and if there are no backlogs in the status
message files that are being received and processed on the parent site, the site
hierarchy may be experiencing the problem that is corrected by the hotfix that
is described in this article.

CAUSE
=====

SMS status messages that are created at the child site to report the source
version may be processed out of sequence when they are received at the parent
site. Additionally, the current reported source version is not checked before
the status message is processed. Therefore, the source version is regressed if
the reported source version is earlier than the existing source version.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English post-SP3 version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  

  Date         Time   Version        Size     File name     Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  01-Mar-2001  17:20  2.0.1493.3240  810,768  Baseutil.dll  Alpha
  01-Mar-2001  17:25  2.0.1493.3241  360,720  Distmgr.dll   Alpha
  01-Mar-2001  17:20  2.0.1493.3240  526,272  Baseutil.dll  Intel
  01-Mar-2001  17:25  2.0.1493.3241  231,312  Distmgr.dll   Intel

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.

MORE INFORMATION
================


How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Apply this fix on all of the sites in the SMS hierarchy. To install the fix, use
one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required; you must
  also download them from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
  folder structure intact. The Q318834.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q318834.exe file and follow the instructions in the wizard. The
  Systems Management Server services are stopped and restarted as part of the
  installation process.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. Copy the update program file (Q318834.exe) and platform folders to a new
  folder. The program file must be located one folder "above" the platform
  folders.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services in Control
  Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. Replace the Baseutil.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version located in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder

4. Replace the Distmgr.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version located in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder

5. Restart the SMS site services.
