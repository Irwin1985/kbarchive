-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open Microsoft SNA Server Manager on a backup Microsoft SNA Server or
on a Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 server, you may receive the
following error message:

  Unable to Open Configuration File, 352

Additionally, a series of diagonal lines across the SNA Manager window.

CAUSE
=====

The SNABase service that is on the backup server cannot complete copying the
configuration file (Com.cfg) from the primary server to the SNABase service
configuration folder.

This behavior can occur for multiple reasons, including the following:

- The backup server cannot open a named pipe connection to the primary server.

- The backup server cannot complete the file copy locally because of incorrect
  Write or Read permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Determine which LanManWorkstation provider that both servers are using. You can
find this information in the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation

If multiple providers are installed on the servers, a registry subkey indicates
the order of the providers. If the ProviderOrder subkey lists
NetwareWorkstation;LanmanWorkstation, reverse the order of the providers, and
place LanManWorkstation first.

The existence of a Netware workstation value indicates that the Novell Client32
has been installed. This problem occurs in Novell Client32 version 4.60;
however, this problem may not occur on more recent versions.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove Novell Client32 version 4.60.

Troubleshooting
---------------

To trace the initial startup of the SNABase service, follow these steps:

1. In SNA Manager, click Trace or Trace Initiator on the Tools menu to open the
  SNATrace program.

2. Click SNABase from the list of trace items, and then click Properties.

3. Select all the trace items that appear in all windows, click Apply, and then
  click Yes to exit with tracing on.

4. Restart the SNABase service.

5. After you receive the error message, open the SNA trace program, and then
  click the "Clear all tracing" check box to stop tracing.

To isolate the problem, follow these steps:

1. To search for this error in the SNABase Internal and Message trace files
  (Napint1.atf and Napmsg1.atf, respectively), search for the msgnum string,
  which indicates the posted event (Event 671).

2. Search earlier in the trace to find the actual error, which in this case is:

  Path Not Found

3. To test whether the issue is a copying problem, follow these steps:

  a. Try to manually copy the file to the Universal Naming Convention (UNC)
     name.

  b. Create a mapping to the share.

  c. Retest. If this is the issue, the system does not complete copying the
     file to a UNC path.

The system successfully copies the file to a mapped drive because Microsoft
Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 2000 handle the two operations differently.
