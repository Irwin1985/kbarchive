-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a Host Integration Server 2000 End-User Client
installation that has been assigned or published through the Microsoft Windows
IntelliMirror feature, and you do not have administrative rights, you receive
the following error message:

  Installer Information

  You must be logged on to this computer as a local or domain administrator in
  order to run Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 End-User Client setup.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Host Integration Server 2000 End-User Client
Windows Installer package explicitly checks to determine whether the user
running the package has administrative rights. This causes the error message
described in the "Symptoms" section of this article, even though Windows
Installer packages published or assigned through IntelliMirror are installed by
using elevated privileges.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

+---------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time  | 
+---------------------------------+
| Hiclient.msi | 02/07/02 | 10:05 | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Host Integration Server 2000 End-User Client Windows Installer Package
requires administrative rights to do the following:

- Add and update registry entries under the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM

- Install the OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM as a Windows service on
  Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 2000, and Microsoft Windows XP-based
  systems.

Applications published or assigned through a Group Policy Object (GPO) as part of
IntelliMirror are designed to run with elevated privileges so that
nonadministrators can install applications that may normally require
administrative rights.

You can allow nonadministrators to install applications that are not published or
assigned through IntelliMirror. To do this (on a Windows 2000-based system),
select the "Always install with elevated privileges" option in both a User
Configuration GPO and a Computer Configuration GPO.

For additional information about how to set the "AlwaysInstallElevated" registry
parameter to allow users to install applications when GPOs are not in use, click
