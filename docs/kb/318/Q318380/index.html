SUMMARY
=======

When users try to access content on your Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0
or Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 server through HTTP or File Transfer
Protocol (FTP), IIS returns a numeric code that indicates the status of the
request. This status code is recorded in the IIS log, and it may also be
displayed in the Web browser or FTP client. The status code can indicate whether
a particular request is successful or unsuccessful and can also reveal the exact
reason why a request is unsuccessful.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Log File Locations:

By default, IIS places its log files in %WINDIR\System32\Logfiles. This directory
contains separate directories for each World Wide Web (WWW) and FTP site. By
default, logs are created in the directories daily and are named with the date
(for example, exYYMMDD.log). For additional information about setting up
logging, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q313437 HOW TO: Enable Logging in IIS 5.0

HTTP:

1xx - Informational

These status codes indicate a provisional response. The client should be prepared
to receive one or more 1xx responses before receiving a regular response.

- 100 - Continue.

- 101 - Switching Protocols.

2xx - Success

This class of status codes indicates that the server successfully accepted the
client request.

- 200 - OK. The client request has succeeded.

- 201 - Created.

- 202 - Accepted.

- 203 - Non-Authoritative Information.

- 204 - No Content.

- 205 - Reset Content.

- 206 - Partial Content.

3xx - Redirection

The client browser must take more action to fulfill the request. For example, the
browser may have to request a different page on the server or repeat the request
by using a proxy server.

- 300 - Multiple choices.

- 301 - Moved Permanently.

- 302 - Found.

- 303 - See Other.

- 304 - Not Modified.

- 305 - Use Proxy.

- 306 - This code is reserved but not used.

- 307 - Temporary Redirect.

4xx - Client Error

An error occurs, and the client appears to be at fault. For example, the client
may request a page that does not exist, or the client may not provide valid
authentication information.

- 400 - Bad Request.

- 401 - Access denied.

IIS defines a number of different 401 errors that indicate a more specific cause
of the error. These specific error codes are displayed in the browser but are
not displayed in the IIS log:

   - 401.1 - Logon failed.

   - 401.2 - Logon failed due to server configuration.

   - 401.3 - Unauthorized due to ACL on resource.

   - 401.4 - Authorization failed by filter.

   - 401.5 - Authorization failed by ISAPI/CGI application.

- 403 - Forbidden.

IIS defines a number of different 403 errors that indicate a more specific cause
of the error:

   - 403.1 - Execute access forbidden.

   - 403.2 - Read access forbidden.

   - 403.3 - Write access forbidden.

   - 403.4 - SSL required.

   - 403.5 - SSL 128 required.

   - 403.6 - IP address rejected.

   - 403.7 - Client certificate required.

   - 403.8 - Site access denied.

   - 403.9 - Too many users.

   - 403.10 - Invalid configuration.

   - 403.11 - Password change.

   - 403.12 - Mapper denied access.

   - 403.13 - Client certificate revoked.

   - 403.14 - Directory listing denied.

   - 403.15 - Client Access Licenses exceeded.

   - 403.16 - Client certificate untrusted or invalid.

   - 403.17 - Client certificate has expired or is not yet valid.

- 404 - Not found.

- 404.1 - Site not found.

- 405 - Method not allowed.

- 406 - Not acceptable.

- 407 - Proxy authentication required.

- 412 - Precondition failed.

- 414 - Request-URI too long.

5xx - Server Error

The server cannot complete the request because it encounters an error.

- 500 - Internal server error.

- 500.12 - Application restarting.

- 500.13 - Server too busy.

- 500.15 - Requests for GLOBAL.ASA not allowed.

- 500-100.ASP - ASP error (note that this code occurs with IIS 5.0 only).

- 501 - Not implemented.

- 502 - Bad gateway.

- 503 - Service unavailable.

- 504 - Gateway timeout.

- 505 - HTTP version not supported.

Common HTTP Status Codes and Their Causes:

- 200 - Success. This status code indicates that IIS has successfully processed
  the request.

- 304 - Not Modified. The client requests a document that is already in its
  cache and the document has not been modified since it was cached. The client
  uses the cached copy of the document, instead of downloading it from the
  server.

- 401.1 - Logon failed. The logon attempt is unsuccessful, probably because of
  a user name or password that is not valid.

- 401.3 - Unauthorized due to ACL on resource. This indicates a problem with
  NTFS permissions. This error may occur even if the permissions are correct
  for the file that you are trying to access. For example, you see this error
  if the IUSR account does not have access to the C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv
  directory.

For additional information about how to resolve this problem, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q187506 List of NTFS Permissions Required for IIS Site to Work

- 403.1 - Execute access forbidden. The following are two common causes of this
  error message:

   - You do not have enough Execute permissions. For example, you may receive
     this error message if you try to access an ASP page in a directory where
     permissions are set to None, or you try to execute a Common Gateway
     Interface (CGI) script in a directory with Scripts Only permissions. To
     modify the Execute permissions, right-click the directory in the Microsoft
     Management Console (MMC), click Properties, click the Directory tab, and
     make sure that the Execute Permissions setting is appropriate for the
     content that you are trying to access.

   - The script mapping for the file type that you are trying to execute is not
     set up to recognize the verb that you are using (for example, GET or
     POST). To verify this, right-click the directory in the MMC, click
     Properties, click the Directory tab, click Configuration, and verify that
     the script mapping for the appropriate file type is set up to allow the
     verb that you are using.

- 403.2 - Read access forbidden. Verify that you have set up IIS to allow Read
  access to the directory. Also, if you are using a default document, verify
  that the document exists.

For additional information about how to resolve this problem, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q247677 Error Message: 403.2 Forbidden: Read Access Forbidden

- 403.3 - Write access forbidden. Verify that the IIS permissions and the NTFS
  permissions are set up to grant Write access to the directory.

For additional information about how to resolve this problem, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248072 Error Message: 403.3 Forbidden: Write Access Forbidden

- 403.4 - SSL required. Disable the Require secure channel option, or use HTTPS
  instead of HTTP to access the page.

If you receive this error for a Web site that does not have a certificate
installed, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q224389 Err Msg: HTTP Error 403, 403.4, 403.5 Forbidden: SSL Required

- 403.5 - SSL 128 required. Disable the Require 128-bit encryption option, or
  use a browser that supports 128-bit encryption to view the page.

If you receive this error for a Web site that does not have a certificate
installed, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q224389 Err Msg: HTTP Error 403, 403.4, 403.5 Forbidden: SSL Required

- 403.6 - IP address rejected. You have configured your server to deny access
  to your current IP address.

For additional information about how to resolve this problem, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248043 Error Message: 403.6 - Forbidden: IP Address Rejected

- 403.7 - Client certificate required. You have configured your server to
  require a certificate for client authentication, but you do not have a valid
  client certificate installed.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190004 Error 403.7 or 'Connection to Server Could Not Be Established'


- 403.8 - Site access denied. You have set up a domain name restriction for the
  domain that you are using to access your server.

For additional information about how to resolve this problem, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248032 Error Message: Forbidden: Site Access Denied 403.8

- 403.9 - Too many users. The number of users who are connected to the server
  exceeds the connection limit that you have set. For additional information
  about how to change this limit, click the article number below to view the
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248074 Error Message: Access Forbidden: Too Many Users Are Connected 403.9

  NOTE: Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and Microsoft Windows XP
  Professional automatically impose a 10-connection limit on IIS. You cannot
  change this limit.

- 403.12 - Mapper denied access. The page that you want to access requires a
  client certificate, but the user ID that is mapped to your client certificate
  has been denied access to the file.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248075 Error: HTTP 403.12 - Access Forbidden: Mapper Denied Access

- 404 - Not found. This error may occur if the file that you are trying to
  access has been moved or deleted. It can also occur if you try to access a
  file that has a restricted file name extension after you install the URLScan
  tool. In this case, you see "Rejected by URLScan" in the log file entry for
  that request.

- 500 - Internal server error. You see this error message for a wide variety of
  server-side errors. Your event viewer logs may contain more information about
  why this error occurs. Additionally, you can disable friendly HTTP error
  messages to receive a detailed description of the error.

For additional information about how to disable friendly HTTP error messages,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q294807 HOWTO: Disable Internet Explorer 5 'Show Friendly HTTP Error
  Messages' Feature on the Server Side

- 500.12 - Application restarting. This indicates that you tried to load an ASP
  page while IIS was in the process of restarting the application. This message
  should disappear when you refresh the page. If you refresh the page and the
  message appears again, it may be caused by antivirus software that is
  scanning your Global.asa file.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248013 Err Msg: HTTP Error 500-12 Application Restarting

- 500-100.ASP - ASP error. You receive this error message when you try to load
  an ASP page that has errors in the code. To obtain more specific information
  about the error, disable friendly HTTP error messages. By default, this error
  is only enabled on the default Web site.

For additional information about how to see this error on non-default Web sites,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q261200 HTTP 500 Error Message Displays Instead of ASP Error Message from
  500-100.asp

- 502 - Bad gateway. You receive this error message when you try to run a CGI
  script that does not return a valid set of HTTP headers.

FTP:

  the Assigned Numbers document.

- 220 Service ready for new user.

- 221 Service closing control connection. Logged out if appropriate.

- 225 Data connection open; no transfer in progress.

- 226 Closing data connection. Requested file action successful (for example,

the command, it may succeed.

- 421 Service not available, closing control connection. This may be a reply to
  any command if the service knows it must shut down.

- 425 Can't open data connection.

- 426 Connection closed; transfer aborted.

- 552 Requested file action aborted. Exceeded storage allocation (for current
  directory or dataset).

- 553 Requested action not taken. File name not allowed.

Common FTP Status Codes and Their Causes:

- 150 - FTP uses two ports: 21 for sending commands, and 20 for sending data. A
  status code of 150 indicates that the server is about to open a new
  connection on port 20 to send some data.

- 226 - The command opens a data connection on port 20 to perform an action,
  such as transferring a file. This action successfully completes, and the data
  connection is closed.

- 230 - This status code appears after the client sends the correct password.
  It indicates that the user has successfully logged on.

- 331 - You see this status code after the client sends a user name. This same
  status code appears regardless of whether the user name that is provided is a
  valid account on the system.

- 426 - The command opens a data connection to perform an action, but that
  action is canceled, and the data connection is closed.

- 530 - This status code indicates that the user cannot log on because the user
  name and password combination is not valid. If you use a user account to log
  on, you may have mistyped the user name or password, or you may have chosen
  to allow only Anonymous access. If you log on with the Anonymous account, you
  may have configured IIS to deny Anonymous access.

- 550 - The command is not executed because the specified file is not
  available. For example, this status code occurs when you try to GET a file
  that does not exist, or when you try to PUT a file in a directory for which
  you do not have Write access.
