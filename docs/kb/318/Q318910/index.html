MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Ch04 Code Sample openxml.sql Change
-------------------------------------------

The final line of code in the code sample openxml.sql, found in the ch04
directory, is incorrect. A replacement file is available for download.

In the attached file,

EXEC sp_xml_removeDocument @hXmlDoc

has been changed to:

EXEC sp_xml_removeDocument @xmlHnd

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  openxml.exe (http://download.microsoft.com/download
  /MSPressPub/openxml/1.0/WIN98XP/EN-US/openxml.exe)

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.


Page 7: "XTML" Should Be "XHTML"
--------------------------------

On page 7, change the section heading:
"XML Compared to XTML"

To:
"XML Compared to XHTML"


Page 97: Missing Column Name In SELECT Statement
------------------------------------------------

On page 97, in the first code sample, the column name Employee_ID is missing.

Change:

  SELECT CONCATENATE(  LastName,  ' ', FirstName ) AS Fullname
      FROM Employee
  WHERE LastName = 'Jordan'

To:

  SELECT Employee_ID, (LastName + ',  ' + FirstName ) AS Fullname
      FROM Employee
  WHERE LastName = 'Jordan'

Note: CONCATENATE is not a standard function in all RDBMS, and you should use the
"+" operator for Microsoft SQL Server and "||" for Oracle to concatenate the
last name and first name values.


Page 98: Incorrect Dept_ID In Table
-----------------------------------

On page 98, in the table at the top, in the fourth row,

Change:
"Dept_ID
3"

To:
"Dept_ID
2"

And in the fifth row,

Change:
"Dept_ID
4"

To:
"Dept_ID
3"


Page 130: Replace Code in Listing 4-27
--------------------------------------

On page 130, in listing 4-27, change the final line of code from:

  EXEC sp_xml_removeDocument @hXmlDoc

To:

  EXEC sp_xml_removeDocument @xmlHnd


Page 140: Line Missing From Results of Listing 4-32
---------------------------------------------------

The expected results table shown on page 140 is missing a row. Add the following
row for record 10 as the last row of the output (column headings given for
reference):

+------------------------------------------------+
| EMPLOYEE_NO | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME | DEPT_NO | 
+------------------------------------------------+
| 10          | Joshua     | Lehman    | 5       | 
+------------------------------------------------+


Page 196: Document Element Incorrectly Repeated In Listing 5-10
---------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 195-196, in listing 5-10, the section of code from the first line to the
tag on page 196 (line 6) should be removed.

The listing should begin with line 7 on page 196.


Page 343: Definition For Address-Object Missing
-----------------------------------------------

On page 343, the definition for the Address-Object is missing, and as a result
the creation of an instance is not complete and does not lead to the XML code in
the next section (The Object Instance XML Document).

Add the following lines of code beneath the call to the Person constructor:

Person p = new Person("John", "Smith", "11/30/1974", "brown", "blue");
p.address.setAddress1("200 Brattle Street"); p.address.setCity("Cambridge");
p.address.setState("MA"); p.address.setZip("02138");
