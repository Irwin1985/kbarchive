The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click "Shut down the computer" on a computer that is running the
Systems Management Server (SMS) client, the SMS Client service (Clisvcl.exe) may
continue to run. This may occur even after the "Shutdown Computer: It is now
safe to turn off your computer" dialog box appears. If you do not immediately
restart your computer, Clisvcl.exe may try to start optional components. These
attempts may lead to the system volume being marked as dirty. If this occurs,
Autochk runs the next time you start your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.
