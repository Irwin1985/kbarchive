-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you (as an administrator) try to start a service in the Services tool in
Control Panel, you may receive the following error message:

  Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service on Local
  Computer.

  Error 123: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

The following error message may be logged in the System log:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: Service Control Manager
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 7000
  Computer: SERVER
  Description:
  The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service failed to start due to the
  following error:
  The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

NOTE: These error messages come from the Services Control Manager and can occur
for any service, not just the Exchange Server services.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, in the registry, make sure that the ImagePath value
for the service that returned the error message does not contain any extra
characters or spaces. To do so, you have to use Registry Editor.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To make sure that the ImagePath value for the service that returned the error
message does not contain any extra characters or spaces:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the ImagePath string value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

  NOTE: This step applies to any service under the Services key in the registry.

3. Open the ImagePath value on the right, and then make sure that it does not
  contain any extra colons (:), spaces, or characters.

  The following is an example of correct string value for the Exchange
  Information Store service:

  C:\Exchsrvr\Bin\Store.exe

4. Quit Registry Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use tools such as Regmon to track the service, program, or process that
is adding the extra characters or spaces to the ImagePath value for that
service. For additional information about Regmon, visit the following
