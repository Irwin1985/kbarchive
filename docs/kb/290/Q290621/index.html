IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange Server administrator or public folder owner examines the rules
that are defined on a public folder, the rules may be marked with a red "X,"
which indicates that the rule is in error. The following events may be logged in
the Application event log:

  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Error
  Category Rules
  EventID: 1041
  Description:
  The rule (1-CF0) with sequence number 100 is being disabled due to errors
  encountered while applying the rule. The public folder is PublicFolderName.

  Source MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Error
  Category: Transport Delivering
  EventID: 2028
  Description:
  The delivery of a message sent by a public folder
  /o=MICROSOFT/ou=SITENAME/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=PublicFolderName213E31CA213E31CA213E31CA18482398000BC1
  has failed
  To: Recipient
  Cc:

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if an antivirus solution that is based on the antivirus
application programming interface (API) is under stress on the Exchange Server
5.5 computer at the same time that an autoforward-type public folder rule is
running. When a post is made to the public folder, the rule generates a new
message to deliver to the recipients that are specified in the rule. Because the
post contains an attachment, the attachment must be submitted to the antivirus
vendor for scanning. If the new message is being scanned when the message
delivery is attempted, the Exchange Server computer attempts to deliver the
message several times, with a delay between each attempt. This behavior can be
controlled by modifying two registry keys that are described in the "Workaround"
section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2654.93 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this fix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem if you are an Exchange Server administrator, examine
and adjust the SendRetries and SendRetryInterval registry values for your
environment. However, if this problem still occurs after you make adjustments to
these registry values, you might need to apply the fix that is described in the
"Resolution" section of this article.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To adjust the SendRetries and SendRetryInterval values:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the SendRetries value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\VirusScan

3. On the Edit menu, click REG_DWORD, change this decimal value as applicable
  (the default value is 2), and then click OK.

  When a client sends a message that contains an attachment, the attachment must
  be scanned before the message is sent. If the message delivery process
  determines that the attachment is currently being scanned, the information
  store attempts to resend the message. This value specifies the number of
  times that the information store attempts to resend the message, including
  the first attempt to deliver the message. If you increase this value, you
  provide more opportunities for messages to be processed. If you modify this
  value, along with the SendRetryInterval value, delivery times might be
  extended.

4. Locate the SendRetryInterval value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\VirusScan

5. On the Edit menu, click REG_DWORD, change this decimal value as applicable
  (the default value is 60000), and then click OK.

  When a message is being sent, if that message contains an attachment that is
  currently being scanned, the information store waits for a certain time
  interval, and then the information store attempts to redeliver the message.
  This value specifies the interval in milliseconds that the information store
  waits before the information store attempts to redeliver the message. If this
  value is set too high, delays might occur when messages are sent. If this
  value is set too low, messages might expire from the sending queue because
  the number of send retries might be exceeded before the scanning process for
  the message is complete.

6. Quit Registry Editor.
