The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the 3270 emulator that is included with
SNA Server (version 3.0 Service Pack [SP] 1 and later) and Host Integration
Server 2000 to take advantage of single sign-on (SSO) while accessing the host
account cache (HAC).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Benefits of Using SSO and the HAC
---------------------------------

- A script file can automate the keystroke logon process as well as include
  application information such as TSO, IMS, and so forth.

- An end-user or administrator can create one script file that could be used
  for all 3270 users when accessing a host application/mainframe.

- The script file includes MS$SAMEU (as the userid value) and MS$SAMEP (as the
  password value) instead of the user's clear text userid and password. This
  eliminates security concerns.

NOTES:

- Third-party emulators can be used for SSO but must support "scripting" of
  user input. The example script files in this article may differ from
  third-party emulators.

- The actual text description in these example script files may differ since
  accessing host applications and logging onto the mainframe can vary among
  users.

- Host security components, a host security domain, and a populated HAC must be
  configured before "look-ups" to the HAC can occur. This article assumes that
  these steps are already completed.

  Q175063 Host Security Integration Setup and Architectural Overview

Steps to Use the 3270 Emulator with a Script File
-------------------------------------------------

- 

  Step 1: Configuring a 3270 Script for SSO:

  a. Start the 3270 emulator.

  b. From the Session menu, choose Connect.

  c. From the Script menu, choose Record. The record facility converts these
     actions into a logon script. The default script file is named Logon.lsc
     and is located in the &lt;snaroot&gt; folder (usually C:\Sna\System).

  d. Connect to the appropriate host application (for example, TSO or IMS). For
     the following example, TSO is selected.

  e. Log on to the host using a valid mainframe userid and password.

  f. When you are finished recording your logon script, from the Script menu,
     choose Stop.

  g. To verify that your script works, you must first disconnect your session:
     from the Session menu, click Disconnect.

  h. From the Session menu, choose Connect.

  i. From the Script menu, choose Play.

  Optionally, you can use one of the following procedures to configure the logon
  script to run automatically when you connect:

   - From the Script menu, choose Auto Run. When you subsequently establish a
     connection to the host, the logon script runs automatically.

  -or-

   - From the Session menu, choose Autoconnect. Every time you subsequently
     start the 3270 client, the connection to the host will be made and you
     will be logged on automatically.

  Example 3270 Script file (Logon.lsc):

  

  SETTIMEOUT 30,EXIT
  WAITSESSION SSCP
  ; Wait for banner. Wait &lt;delay&gt; can be replaced with WaitString "&lt;string&gt;"
  WAIT 3
  SEND TSO@E
  WAITSESSION LULU
  ; Wait for screen after BIND. Wait &lt;delay&gt; can be replaced with WaitString "&lt;string&gt;"
  WAIT 3
  SEND MYUSERID@E
  SEND MYPASSWD@E
  EXIT:

  The following is a list of script file content descriptions:

  - The semi-colon (;) without quotes = remarks
  - TSO = the subsystem application being selected in this example
  - @E = Enter key was pressed
  - MYUSERID = real mainframe userid
  - MYPASSWD = real mainframe password
  - @T = Tab key being pressed (not included in this example)

- 

  Step 2: Edit the 3270 Script to Use SSO with the HAC:

  a. Using any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, edit the Logon.lsc
     script file.

  b. Replace the real mainframe userid and password with "MS$SAMEU" (without
     the quotation marks) and "MS$SAMEP" (without the quotation marks),
     respectively.

  c. Save and close the file, and then test this new script with the same steps
     as before.

  NOTE: If you make multiple script files with different names for accessing
  other applications, you can choose to use them by doing this:

  a. From the Session menu, choose Session Configuration. The 3270 Settings
     dialog box appears.

  b. In the Script File box, click Browse to select another script file.

  c. Double-click the script file that you want to use.

  d. Click OK.

  The newly edited script file from step 1 should now look like this:

  

  SETTIMEOUT 30,EXIT
  WAITSESSION SSCP
  ; Wait for banner. Wait &lt;delay&gt; can be replaced with WaitString "&lt;string&gt;"
  WAIT 3
  SEND TSO@E
  WAITSESSION LULU
  ; Wait for screen after BIND. Wait &lt;delay&gt; can be replaced with WaitString "&lt;string&gt;"
  WAIT 3
  SEND MS$SAMEU@E
  SEND MS$SAMEP@E
  EXIT:

  With host security configured, the HAC populated with an actual mainframe
  userid and password, the following steps occur to complete SSO while using
  the HAC:

  a. When the 3270 emulator starts up (if configured to automatically run the
     scripted logon), MS$SAMEU and MS$SAMEP are passed to the SNA Server/HIS
     2000 server.

  b. SNA Server/HIS 2000 checks if the Windows NT or Windows 2000 user that is
     making this request is a member of the host security domain "local group".

  c. SNA Server/HIS 2000 then scans the data stream. It recognizes MS$SAMEU and
     MS$SAMEP and performs a "look-up". It then substitutes MS$SAMEU and
     MS$SAMEP for the real host userid and password that are configured in the
     HAC.

  For information and caveats regarding the special keywords MS$SAMEU and
  MS$SAMEP, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
