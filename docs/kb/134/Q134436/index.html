-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add an edit box as a control to a grid column and delete some of the
text in the edit box, the text in the other records in this column appear to be
truncated to the new length of the text in the edit box.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the Sparse Property for the grid column that contains the edit box to True
(.T.).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior happens whether the grid is created using the Grid Builder or
manually in the Form Designer.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

NOTE: To understand the following steps, you need working knowledge of the Visual
FoxPro Form Designer. See Chapter 9 of the Microsoft Visual FoxPro "Developer's
Guide" for more information on working with the Form Designer.

1. Open the Testdata.dbc database found in the \VFP\Samples\Data directory.

2. Create a new form.

3. Add the Customer table from the Testdata database to the Data Environment of
  the form.

4. Add a grid object to the form.

5. Set the following properties for the grid, and resize it as desired.

     ColumnCount=3
     RecordSource=Customer
     RowHeight=45

6. Add an Editbox control to either column 2 or 3 (or both) of the grid. To do
  this, follow these steps:

  a. Click the form to make sure it is active.

  b. Click the grid to select it.

  c. Using the right mouse button, click the grid to bring up the shortcut
     menu, and click Edit from this menu.

  d. Click the Editbox control icon on the Form Controls toolbar.

  e. Click the grid column where you want to put the Editbox. Any cell in that
     column will do.

7. Set the following properties for the column(s) that the Editbox control was
  placed in (assume it is column 2 for this example):

     CurrentControl=Edit1
     Sparse=.F.
     ControlSource=Customer.company

8. For the other columns in the grid (columns 1 and 3 for this example), set the
  ControlSource property to a field from the Customer table. Customer.cust_id
  and Customer.contact will work fine for this example.

9. Save and Run the form.

10. The text in the second column of the first record should be "Alfreds
  Futterkiske." Delete the "Futterkiske" portion of the text, and press the
  TAB key a few times to force the grid to refresh. The other entries in the
  second column should truncate (for display purposes only) at the length of
  the word "Alfreds," which was what was left in the edit box in the first
  record.

The grid can also be designed by clicking Builder on the shortcut menu displayed
in Step 6.c above. In the Layout tab of the Builder dialog box, set the Control
Type for column 2 to be Editbox.
