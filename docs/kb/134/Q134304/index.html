-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains steps to help you troubleshoot network browsing problems
in Windows 95. Browsing problems are usually indicated by trouble viewing peer
servers in Network Neighborhood.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step 1: Verify the Problem
--------------------------

Verify that you are having a browsing problem, not a problem with network
connectivity. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Find, and then click Computer.

2. In the Named box, type

  "&lt;Computer_Name&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;Computer_Name&gt; is the name of the network server you want to
  browse.

3. Click Find Now.

If the server is found, its name appears in the Name column and its workgroup or
Windows NT domain appears in the Location column. If the computer is not found,
verify that it is turned on and correctly connected to the network.

If the server is found and its location is a different workgroup than your
computer's, the server will not appear in Network Neighborhood. To determine
your computer's workgroup, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
  Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Identification tab.

3. Note the name of the workgroup displayed in the Workgroup box.

Step 2: Verify That the Correct Network Client Is Loaded
--------------------------------------------------------

Verify that the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks is installed on your
computer. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
  Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Configuration tab, examine the list of installed network components
  and verify that the following client is installed:

  Client For Microsoft Networks

If this client is not installed, you can install it using the following steps:

1. Click Add.

2. Click Client, and then click Add.

3. Click Microsoft, click Client For Microsoft Networks, and then click OK.

4. Click OK.

5. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

Step 3: Verify That File and Printer Sharing Is Installed
---------------------------------------------------------

Verify that the File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks component is
installed. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
  Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Configuration tab, examine the list of installed network components
  and verify that the following component is installed:

  File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks

If this component is not installed, you can install it using the following
steps:

1. Click the Add button.

2. Click Service, and then click Add.

3. Click Microsoft, click File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks, and
  then click OK.

4. On the Configuration tab, click OK.

5. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

After you install this service, allow up to 15 minutes for the server to appear
in the browse list. To refresh the current browse list, click Refresh on the
View menu.

Step 4: Verify That a Common NetBIOS Protocol Is Installed
----------------------------------------------------------

If the server still does not appear in the browse list, verify that a common
NetBIOS protocol is installed on your computer and the server. The following
protocols are NetBIOS compliant:

- NetBEUI

- TCP/IP

- IPX/SPX

Step 5: Check the Master Browse Server
--------------------------------------

Verify that the master browse server is functioning correctly by typing the
following command at an MS-DOS prompt

  "net view /workgroup:&lt;wkgrp_name&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;wkgrp_name&gt; is the name of your workgroup. If your workgroup name
contains spaces, enclose the workgroup name in quotation marks. For example, if
your workgroup name is My Workgroup, type the following line:

  "net view /workgroup:"My Workgroup"" (without the quotation marks)

This command retrieves a browse list from the master browse server. If you cannot
retrieve a browse list from the master browse server, one of the following
problems may exist on the network:

- A backup browse server is not functioning correctly.

- A backup browse server does not have an updated browse list. Retrieving an
  updated browse list can take up to 15 minutes.

NOTE: If a computer is removed from the network before the computer is logged off
the network, it may take up to 51 minutes for that computer to be removed from
the browse list.

Step 6: Verify That the Browse Server Is Available
--------------------------------------------------

If your network includes computers that are frequently powered off or removed
from the network (such as mobile computers), it is a good idea to disable browse
server duties on these computers. To disable browse server duties on a Windows
95-based computer, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, and then click
  Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Configuration tab, click the File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft
  Networks component, and then click Properties.

3. In the Property box, click Browse Master, and then click Disabled in the
  Value box.

4. Click OK.

NOTE: At least one computer in each workgroup must have the ability to become the
master browse server. If browse server capability is disabled on all the
computers in a network, browse functionality is disabled. A network storm will
ensue as clients will be unable to locate the browse master and will force an
election.
