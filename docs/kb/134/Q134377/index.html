SUMMARY
=======

This article covers the steps necessary to reset the mailbag for version 1.0b of
the Microsoft Mail Connection Gateway.

Notes:

- The following steps should be done if there is corruption or if the file is
  missing.

- Evidence of corruption include: a mail message that is being sent multiple
  times from PCMail to AppleTalk Mail, or messages that cannot be deleted from
  the MSMAIL queue.

For additional information regarding these problems, and prior to following the
procedures of this article, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q119022 Message Redelivered Repeatedly to Mac Clients

MORE INFORMATION
================

Prior to recreating the MBG and KEY files for the queue, the administrator
should return mail from the MSMAIL queue.

1. Stop the Connection Gateway.

2. Run the Mail for PC Networks Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE).

3. Select the Queue option, and select MSMAIL from the list of network names.

  This will display messages that are in the queue.

4. Select the Return option, and use the spacebar to mark each message in the
  queue.

5. When you are finished marking the messages, press the RETURN key, and answer
  Yes to the Return Selected Times? prompt.

  NOTE: If more than fifty items are in the mailbag, repeat the procedure.

To recreate the queue, it is necessary to find the number of the queue for the
Connection Gateway. This number is kept in the NETWORK.GLB file on the
postoffice.

1. Copy the NETWORK.GLB file to a local drive.

  WARNING! Be careful to work with the correct drive as the NETWORK.GLB file
  from one postoffice will not be the same as another.

2. Type out the NETWORK.GLB file from the MS-DOS prompt (use the MORE pipe if
  this is a large file and scrolls off the screen).

  Notes:

   - The network names will be followed by a short blank space and an eight
     digit number.

   - The MSMAIL gateway name will be followed by a long blank (greater than 20
     spaces) prior to an eight digit number.

   - The eight digit number following the long space is the queue number for
     the MSMAIL gateway.

  Write down the MSMAIL gateway number.

  (As an added check, look in the XTN directory, and confirm that there is NOT
  an XTN file with this number.)

  The number obtained from the last step is an eight digit hex number
  &lt;HEXID&gt;. To reset the gateway queue involves resetting two files: the
  &lt;HEXID&gt;.MBG and the &lt;HEXID&gt;.KEY.


NOTE: To allow for recovery, make a copy of the &lt;HEXID&gt;.MBG and
&lt;HEXID&gt;.KEY files prior to resetting them.

To create new .MBG and .KEY files:

1. From the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) menu, choose External-Admin,
  Create.

2. Create a new postoffice on an existing network, and then quit ADMIN.EXE.

3. Change to the MBG directory of the postoffice, and look for a 0-byte .MBG
  file with the current date and time.

  Write down the number of this MBG file that will be used to find the .KEY
  file.

To copy the new .MBG and .KEY files:

1. Copy the new 0-byte .MBG file over the corrupt .MBG file. You cannot use the
  MS-DOS COPY command to copy 0-byte files.

  On a Novell NetWare network, use NCOPY.

  On a LAN Manager-compatible network, use XCOPY.

2. Change to the KEY subdirectory of the postoffice; issue the MS-DOS DIR
  command to look for the new KEY file noted in step 3 above.

3. Copy the new 560 byte KEY file over the corrupt .KEY file.

4. In ADMIN.EXE, choose External-Admin, Delete; then delete the new postoffice
  that was created earlier.
