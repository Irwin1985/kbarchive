SUMMARY
=======

You may sometimes need to add a control to a form generated by the Form Wizard.
No additional coding is necessary if you're adding a text box. However, if
you're adding another type of control, such as a combo box or a list box,
additional coding is required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Form Wizard uses the Wizstyle visual class library. Code for the navigation
buttons is stored in this library. When a text box is added to the form, it
functions exactly like the text boxes added by the wizard. It is enabled and
disabled by the edit/revert and add/save buttons. However, if another control,
such as a combo or list box, is added, it's not enabled or disabled by these
buttons, so it remains enabled all the time.

Listed below are two different methods to add this functionality. The first one
works on combo and list boxes. The second method, which is not supported by
Microsoft Technical Support applies to combo boxes only.

Method 1 - List and Combo Box
-----------------------------

The list and combo box can be enabled and disabled in sync with the text boxes by
setting the enabled property of list or combo box to false and adding the
following code to the edit/revert and add/save buttons, assuming combo1 is the
name of the added combo box and text1 is the name of an existing text box on the
form:

     txtbtns.cmdEdit::click     &amp;&amp; cmdEdit will be cmdAdd for the Add button
     thisform.combo1.enabled= thisform.text1.enabled   &amp;&amp; See following NOTE
     thisform.refresh

NOTE: This code causes the combo box to become enabled and disabled in sync with
the text box. The first line of code with the scope resolution operator ensures
that the click method of the Edit button stored in the WIZSTYLE.VCX is
executed.

Method 2 - Combo Box
--------------------

NOTE: Modifications to WIZSTYLE.VCX are not supported by Microsoft FoxPro
Technical Support. This information is provided for informational reasons only.

Modify the SetAllProp method of the TxtBtns class in WIZSTYLE.VCX as follows:

1. Change the line

        CASE ATC(m.oControlParent.Controls[m.i].BaseClass,
        "Checkbox,TextBox,OleBoun Control") # 0

  to

        CASE ATC(m.oControlParent.Controls[m.i].BaseClass,
        "CheckBox,TextBox,OleBoun Control,ComboBox") # 0

  NOTE: The CASE statements above should actually be continuous lines. They were
  broken into two lines here for display purposes only.

This will allow combo boxes added to any Form Wizard-generated forms to be
enabled and disabled along with other objects, so long as the enabled property
is initially set to .F. for each new control.
