SUMMARY
=======


The following is a list of frequently asked questions about Microsoft Mail
gateways.

1. Q. What are the most common gateway issues listed in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base?

  A.

  Q99714: MHS: Connecting Microsoft Mail to cc:Mail
  Q103802: MHS: How to Test Whether the Gateway Is Working
  Q94468: MHS: Microsoft Mail &amp;amp; NetWare Global Messaging (NGM)

2. Q. What is MHS, and how does it relate to the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS?

  A. Message Handling Service, MHS, is a product sold by Novell. It consists of
  three components: a directory manager, a connectivity manager, and a
  transport server. The directory manager is an administrative tool used to
  define the MHS database. The connectivity manager routes messages within the
  database. The transport server transfers messages from one MHS database to
  another. MHS databases communicate with each other asynchronously. Microsoft
  Mail Gateway to MHS is a gateway application that conforms to the Standard
  Message Format version 70 (SMF70) specification. It retrieves messages from
  Microsoft Mail and converts them into the SMF70 format, then deposits them in
  the MHS database. From here, the MHS connectivity manager is responsible for
  final delivery to the recipient. The gateway will also pick up mail routed to
  it from the MHS connectivity manager, convert it to Microsoft Mail format,
  and deliver it to the Microsoft Mail postoffice.

3. Q. Does the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS work with NetWare Global Messaging
  (NGM)?

  A. Yes. NGM adheres to SMF71. To be compatible with an SMF70 gateway, such as
  Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, a Novell executable file, GWDEMON.EXE, must be
  running on a dedicated workstation. For more information, see Chapter 8 in
  the NetWare Global Messaging Administration Manual.

4. Q. What is required to configure Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP?

  A. A mail routing host (smart host) in the TCP/IP network is required. The
  smart host may or may not be using the Domain Name Service (DNS) to handle
  message routing.

  If your smart
      host uses          See this article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
      --------------------------------------------------------------------

      DNS                Q101459, "SMTP: GW0645: Configuring the SMTP
                         Gateway &amp; DNS"
      Host tables        Q115496, "SMTP: Configuring the Mail Routing Host
                         Without DNS"

  If the DNS or host table is not configured correctly, you may experience
  errors such as "550 Addressee Unknown."

5. Q. What causes the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP to hang?

  A. There are five known network configurations that can affect Microsoft Mail
  Gateway to SMTP reliability:

   - Postoffice (PO) and Gateway should be on the same physical network.

   - Use a Mail Relay Host for inbound SMTP mail.

   - Have routers use static routing.

   - Use a 16-bit Network Interface Card (NIC).

   - Use one protocol per NIC (IPX/SPX).

  For more information about these configurations, see

  Q131150, "SMTP: Causes of Hangs on Mail Gateway to SMTP," in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base.

6. Q. What is the optimal way to deploy the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP in my
  company?

  A. A small-volume implementation can process up to 10,000 messages a day, and
  consists of one SMTP gateway. A medium-volume implementation can process up
  to 20,000 messages a day, with dedicated incoming/outgoing SMTP gateways or
  with the purchase of an additional SMTP gateway. A large-volume
  implementation can handle any number of messages greater than 20,000 a day,
  and can be multiple incoming/outgoing gateways, or both.

  Four possible configurations for small- to large-volume scenarios are
  discussed in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. For more information, see Q132060,
  "SMTP: SMTP Gateway in Small, Medium, and Large Organizations."

7. Q. Why does outgoing mail work, but incoming mail does not, with the
  Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400?

  A. If this is the first time you are setting up the gateway, you must add the
  Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 to the "Routing" section in the X400ADM.EXE
  Administrator program.

8. Q. How many Eicon X.25 cards can the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
  support?

  A. The Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 can support one Eicon X.25 card and one
  Ethernet card at the same time. Multiple simultaneous connections can be
  processed using both cards, or one on the computer running the gateway.

9. Q. Why am I getting "ERROR 3" errors?

  A. Both the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 and the other X.400 mail system
  must be properly configured for messages to transfer properly. This means
  that each X.400 system must have defined its own parameters (nsap, tsap,
  ssap, MTA name and password, and x.121 address) and those of the other X.400
  system. Some parameters are not required; for more information, refer to your
  Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP documentation.

10. Q. With the Microsoft Mail Gateway to PROFS and OfficeVision, why do I get
  better performance with inbound mail than with outbound mail?

  A. The VTAM/NCP parameters and buffer sizes on the PROFS host are not
  configured optimally. Some suggestions for improving performance are:

   - Tailor the attachment card buffer size to host VTAM/NCP parameters.

   - Check VTAM/NCP host definitions for token-ring (MAXDATA, MAXTSL, Class of
     Service).

   - Adjust the RU size on MODETAB.

11. Q. Why aren't free and busy times flowing between Microsoft Mail and IBM
  PROFS and OfficeVision?

  A. There are two main configuration points for free and busy times to flow
  properly:

  Check AdminSch and make sure there is a gateway definition for the VM host
  that includes the user name, making a complete 10 x 10 x 10 address.
  AdminSch should also show the fields "Date Sent" and "Date Received," with
  dates filled in if free and busy times have been exchanged. If these fields
  are blank, check the SCHDIST.LOG file in the MAILDATA\LOG subdirectory of
  the Mail database. Remember to fill in a time interval in AdminSch.

  On the Host side, MS-CSM, check the file "schdplus control." This file should
  have comment records, PROFS: records, and PO: records. One PO: record should
  be present for each Microsoft Mail postoffice. If a PROFS: or PO: record is
  missing, exchange of free and busy times has not occurred successfully. The
  SCHDIST.LOG file will contain errors recording why this was unsuccessful.

12. Q. How do I disable the cover page and distribution box in the Microsoft
  Mail Gateway to Fax?

  A. You cannot disable the cover page or distribution box.

13. Q. With the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, how do I get inbound faxes
  delivered to the recipient instead of a designated user?

  A. Faxes currently cannot be routed to the intended recipient. Instead, they
  are routed to a designated user, who forwards them to the recipient. The
  technology necessary for a computer program to read in a handwritten
  recipient name and understand the intended recipient is not yet available.

14. Q. Can I send attachments from a Microsoft Mail client directly to the
  Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax?

  A. You can only do this with ASCII text attachments. If you need to send
  other types of documents, use the fax printer driver.

15. Q. Why isn't my SNADS mail working?

  A. The SNADS gateway is not a Microsoft product. If you experience problems
  sending mail to and from SNADS, contact your SNADS gateway vendor -- either
  Softswitch or Linkage.

16. Q. How do I get addresses changed from Microsoft Mail format to my format?

  A. File Format API (FFAPI) only provides addresses in the form 10 x 10 x 10.
  The address lists generated for Microsoft Mail users to send mail to FFAPI
  users can only be in the 10 x 10 x 10 format. You can use the Import utility
  to add lists of FFAPI users to the Microsoft Mail address lists. If the
  FFAPI users have addresses in another format, the FFAPI gateway
  administrator must provide the functionality to create a table or conversion
  code to change the addresses from 10 x 10 x 10 format to the desired format;
  FFAPI does not provide a table or conversion utility to change 10 x 10 x 10
  addresses to another format.

17. Q. Why doesn't mail sent to a group work?

  A. Mail messages sent from File Format API (FFAPI) to a group that has
  members on other postoffices besides the FFAPI postoffice will not receive
  the message. FFAPI was not designed to resolve group members who receive
  mail on other postoffices.

18. Q. What does the error "80 - Bad Gateway Service Type" mean? A. This error
  indicates you have created a FFAPI postoffice with the same network name as
  another Microsoft Mail postoffice. You must use unique network names.

19. Q. How can I give more memory to the Connection Name Utility (CNU) and the
  Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks server when it is running as an
  extension or an application?

  A. When Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks is running as an extension, the
  administrator can sign in to mail as a network manager and can increase the
  amount of memory allocated to the server by choosing the Server Settings
  option from the Mail menu and setting the server memory allocation. Remember
  that extensions cannot be granted for more than half the total amount of
  memory in the machine.

  When the server is running as an application, you can select the application
  and press COMMAND+I. You can then adjust the amount of memory allocated in
  the preferred settings field accordingly. This same procedure is applied
  when you want to allocate more memory to the CNU when you are running
  Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks.

20. Q. I just installed the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk
  Networks and I do not want to wait for the next directory synchronization
  cycle to propagate the address list. Can I update both the Macintosh and
  Intel Mail systems' address lists right away?

  A. Yes, you can:

  1. With the Connection Name Utility (CNU) in the foreground on the Macintosh
     running the gateway, press COMMAND+S or choose Save To File from the File
     menu. A standard file Save As dialog appears.

  2. Choose Desktop.

  3. Open the Intel volume on which the connection store is located.

  4. Open Maildata and continue until you reach the MACGATE folder.

  5. Change "Untitled" in the "Dump World list into" field to a filename such
     as MACLIST.DOC. (NOTE: You can use any 8.3 MS-DOS filename.)

     The file that is created by this process is in the format required by the
     Import program (IMPORT.EXE). The R(eplace) PCM:proxynet/proxypo command is
     included at the top of the list as well.

     With this file at hand, all Microsoft Mail for PC Networks users who are
     downstream of the Mail for PC Networks gateway can almost immediately
     complete a fresh installation of the connection gateway. The administrator
     can send the address list, along with the Connection setup disk, to other
     Mail for PC Networks administrators, who can install the downstream
     component and the address list in the same session, leaving directory
     synchronization to its normal task of updating the global address list of
     participating postoffices.

  To import the list into a Mail for PC Networks postoffice
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  In the steps listed above, you created a file named MACLIST.DOC and placed it
  in the MACGATE directory in the Mail for PC Networks gateway's Mail
  database. The Import (IMPORT.EXE) and Rebuild (REBUILD.EXE) files should
  also be located in the Mail database. To import the list, run the following
  commands

  import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -d&lt;x&gt; -fmaclist.doc
  rebuild -d&lt;x&gt; -f

  where:

  admin is the administrator account for the postoffice
  &lt;password&gt; is the password for the account
  &lt;x&gt; is the drive letter pointing to the root of the mail database

  The Import utility will update the postoffice network list, and the Rebuild
  utility will update the global address list.

  To reverse the procedure
  ------------------------

  Because it is possible to quickly get the contents of the Macintosh All list
  to the PC Mail environment, it is also possible to reverse the direction and
  insert the contents of the global address list into the All list.

  1. From the CNU, press COMMAND+I and choose the complete directory option.

  2. Watch the Macgate monitor and observe the import request cross the
     gateway.

  3. From an administrator directory on a local computer, run the following
     commands against the directory synchronization server

  srvmain -r -d&lt;x&gt;
  srvmain -t -d&lt;x&gt;
  external -d&lt;x&gt; -0 -a
  external -d&lt;x&gt; -0 -a

     where &lt;x&gt; points to the drive letter of the mail database

  4. Confirm that MACGATE.EXE delivers a message to the network manager of the
     gateway Macintosh postoffice. The subject of the message will be similar
     to the following:

  From: $SYSTEM Subject: SrvTx R=(a digit) S=(multiple digits)

  5. Do nothing with this message. Bring the CNU forward. Choose Application
     from the Configure menu and set the receive updates time to 5 minutes
     ahead of the current Macintosh system time. When that time passes, you
     will see the system message removed from the network manager's inbox. In
     approximately 30 minutes, the contents of the global address list will be
     incorporated into the All list.

  6. Restore the receive updates time to its original setting.
