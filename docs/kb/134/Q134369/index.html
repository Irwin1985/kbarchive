SUMMARY
=======

This article covers some of the most Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about
Microsoft SourceSafe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. Where is SourceSafe putting my files?

  A. SourceSafe stores any files added to it in its DATA directory. The DATA
  directory is like a database, but only SourceSafe has access.

  To create a network share to access files outside of SourceSafe, the Shadow
  directory is used. The Shadow directory is a read-only location you can use
  to build from or access the latest files stored in SourceSafe.

  For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q124529 How to Access SourceSafe Code from a Central Directory


2. Q. How do I install SourceSafe on a network?

  A. SourceSafe stores its contents like a database. All SourceSafe information
  shared by users will be in one location, the DATA directory. When the product
  is installed for multiple users, you want to install SourceSafe in a location
  where everyone has access. Typically, this location is a network server.

  Users often want to have executables and other personal files on the local
  machine for speed purposes. This can be done with the following steps:

  1. Copy executables and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to the local directory.

  2. Set the environment variable SSDIR to point to the network installation of
     SourceSafe. For example: SET SSDIR=G:\SS.

  Some additional optional steps are:

   - Make a copy of the SS\TEMP directory on the local machine. Set the
     variable Temp_Path in the SS.INI. For example: Temp_Path = c:\ss\temp.

   - Make a copy of the SS\USERS\&lt;user name&gt; subdirectory on the local
     machine. Set the variable for the desired user in the Users.txt file to
     point to the new location. For example: JOHN = c:\ss\users\john\ss.ini.

  Q129112 How to Install SourceSafe on a Windows 95 Workstation


3. Q. What is SSWCL.EXE?

  A. SSWCL.EXE is the command line product for the Windows platform. This
  executable allows you to execute SourceSafe commands from Windows.

  For example: the command SSWCL dir $/ -r displays the contents of the Root
  project ($/) recursively.

  For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q124526 SourceSafe: Using the Windows Command Line


4. Q. What are sharing, branching, and merging?

  A. Sharing is a unique feature of SourceSafe that allows you to access the
  same file from multiple projects. This feature is very beneficial for users
  who have several different projects that share common components.

  All actions that take place on the file can be viewed from all projects the
  file is currently in. Therefore, a change made in one project will be
  reflected in all projects.

  Branching, takes a shared file and "separates" it or breaks the link with it
  and the other projects it currently is in. At this point, changes made to the
  file will not be reflected in the other file(s). This feature is often used
  when there is a need for specializing a common file, often for language
  differences or customizing an application.

  The Merge command allows you to merge any changes between separated files.
  This is often useful when a fix made to a branched file needs to be updated
  with the original project(s).

  Knowledge Base:
