-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
- Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using a diskless remoteboot workstation you cannot regain access to
your drive C after the following network error appears:

  Net 808: Incorrect response from network

This symptom occurs if the following conditions apply:

- Your workstation boots from a Windows NT 3.5 remoteboot server.

- Your workstation is running LAN Manager for MS-DOS, version 2.2c.

- Your workstation has at least one network connection to your remoteboot
  server in addition to the drive C connection.

- Your remoteboot server has the AutoDisconnect parameter set to a value of
  greater than zero.

- Your server's AutoDisconnect timer expired for your drive C connection.

CAUSE
=====

There are two causes:

- Your remoteboot server incorrectly auto-disconnects your drive C without
  disconnecting your other network connection to the remoteboot server.

- When you attempt to reconnect to your drive C, your workstation uses your
  computer remoteboot startup credentials (the computer name), instead of your
  logon name and password credentials.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51 or obtain the fix
mentioned below.

To work around this problem:

- Set AutoDisconnect to a greater value on the remoteboot server. However, this
  only reduces the frequency of the problem; it does not eliminate it. To
  change the AutoDisconnect time value, type:

  net config server /autodisconnect:&lt;time&gt;

  where &lt;time&gt; is a number in the range of -1 to -65535 minutes. The
  default value for AutoDisconnect is 15, not -1 as stated in Help.

  -or-

- Set AutoDisconnect to -1 to never disconnect. This may not be a feasible
  option depending on how many remoteboot workstations you have per server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.


MORE INFORMATION
================

A diskless workstation can have two sets of credentials for connections to the
remoteboot Windows NT server.

When your workstation boots, it establishes a connection to the remoteboot server
using the workstation name as its user ID to get permission for downloading its
network software. This connection becomes your drive C.

After booting, you log on using the second set of credentials, that is your user
name and password, and establish connections using these credentials to shared
directories on the remoteboot server (with the Net Use command, etc.). For
example, you may connect drive H to your home directory located on the
remoteboot server.

If the remoteboot server has an AutoDisconnect setting of 15 minutes and your
workstation maintains network activity on drive H, but generates no network
traffic for 15 minutes on the remoteboot connection to your drive C, the server
disconnects drive C, but leaves drive H connected. As a result you get the
unrecoverable Net 808 error mentioned above when your workstation attempts to
access its disconnected drive C.
