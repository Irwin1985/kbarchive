SUMMARY
=======

The Plus Development Passport hard drive will appear as two physical hard drives
when partitioned with the MS-DOS 5.0 FDISK command. However, you can use the
entire drive as one partition under Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 40 MB Passport removable hard drive was developed before MS-DOS allowed for
an extended DOS partition. At that time, users were limited to one 32 MB primary
DOS partition and the Passport hard drive was incompatible with drivers such as
Disk Manager. To allow you to use the entire 40 MB available on your drive, the
Passport has the ability to appear as two physical drives. The drive controller
then provides the translation.

According to Plus Development technical support, the MS-DOS 5.0 FDISK command can
create a 40 MB primary DOS partition on the first of the two physical drives
reported by the Passport controller. The second drive will then appear as a disk
of size 0. Note that FDISK will still report the extra physical drive; this is
perfectly normal and has no ill effects.

If you have a second drive of size 0, you can use the /1 switch on your Passport
driver to eliminate the second drive. For more information on the /1 switch,
contact Plus Development technical support.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
