MORE INFORMATION
================

  LAN Manager Supplemental Disks for MS-DOS 5.0
   ---------------------------------------------

Note about this document's contents and intended audience:

   This document contains instructions for updating network
   software for use with MS-DOS 5.0. While it attempts to
   give complete instructions (and hints where necessary), your
   networking software configuration may differ from the
   examples provided. The information contained herein
   supplements the instructions in the "Updating Networks for MS-DOS
   Version 5.0" chapter of the MS-DOS 5.0 "Getting Started" guide, so
   refer to that documentation in addition to following these
   instructions. The files on the Supplemental Disks supersede the
   files on the MS-DOS 5.0 disks.

   Please see your network administrator or call Microsoft Product
   Support at (425) 637-7095 if you have any questions about how to
   update your networking software. Remember to back up files before
   copying over them, just in case.

This document is long and detailed. You will probably want to print a
copy and work from the printout. Type the following at the command
prompt to print a copy of README.:

   PRINT A:README.

LAN Manager Supplemental Disks for MS-DOS 5.0
---------------------------------------------
The LAN Manager Supplemental Disks for MS-DOS 5.0 contain updated
network files for Microsoft LAN Manager and OEM versions of MS-Net and
LAN Manager networks. These files contain DOS 5.0-aware versions of
software, allowing you take advantage of MS-DOS 5.0, and in some cases,
make a significant amount of conventional memory available for
applications.  Note that some of these files may be identical to files
you have received through other means, but as of the date of production
(June 1991), they are the most up-to-date files available, and thus, you
are encouraged to replace your existing files with the files on these
disks.  (Of course, you should make backup copies of the existing files
before applying updates of any kind.)

There are 4 steps to updating your computer with the files on these
disks:
1. Determine the networking product and version you are using
2. Make backup copies of the files you will replace
3. Copy the files off these disks, replacing existing files
4. Modify your configuration files to take advantage of the new software

Each of these steps is explained in detail below.

1. Determining the networking product and version you are using

The files on these disks apply to several different versions of
networking software.  Use the following procedures to determine which
set of instructions apply to your installation:

Microsoft LAN Manager (and 100-percent compatible):
---------------------------------------------------
If you are using one of the following networks, follow the instructions
for LAN Manager:

.    Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.0 or earlier
.    3Com 3+Open, version 1.1 through 2.0
.    Hewlett-Packard LAN Manager, version A.02.00 or earlier
.    NCR LAN Manager, all versions
.    Olivetti Olinet-LM, version 2.0 or earlier
.    Ungermann-Bass Net/One LM, version 1.1 through 2.0

The updating procedure differs depending on which version of the network
you are using.  Follow the instructions in the appropriate section.  If
you are not sure which version you have, see the following section.

Determining which version of LAN Manager you are using
------------------------------------------------------
To determine the version you are using, type the following at the
command prompt:

   net

If you see a full-screen user-interface, you are using an Enhanced
version.

If you receive an error message when you type the command, you have a
Basic version (or an MS-Net version, so go on to the next section;
check for a subdirectory named BASIC in your C:\LANMAN.DOS directory.)
To find out whether you have Basic version 2.0 or Basic version 1.x, check
the creation dates of the files in your LAN Manager program directory
(typically C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC).  If the files are dated before June
1990, you have version 1.x.  Files dated after June 1990 are typically
version 2.0.

Microsoft MS-Net (and 100-percent compatible):
----------------------------------------------
If you are using one of the following networks, follow the instructions
for MS-Net:

.    Microsoft MS-Net, all versions
.    Hewlett-Packard Office Works, all versions
.    NCR PC LAN, all versions
.    Olivetti Olinet-LAN, version 1.23 or earlier
.    Ungermann-Bass Net/One PC, version 2.0 through 2.1

Other networks:
---------------
IBM PC LAN, IBM DOS LAN Requestor, DEC PATHWORKS and PCSA, and 3Com
3+Share networks require special procedures to update the networking
software for DOS 5.0.  See the "Updating Networks" chapter in your
MS-DOS 5.0 "Getting Started" documentation, or contact your networking
vendor for more information.

2. Making backup copies of the files you will replace

Now that you have determined the type and version of your network, you
should make backup copies of the files that you will replace.  Do this
by copying the files listed below to another diskette or create a
directory on your hard disk and copy the files there.  To create a
directory on your hard disk, type the following at the command prompt:

   MKDIR C:\OLDNET

This creates a directory named OLDNET on your hard disk.

To copy files, type a command like the following, replacing
C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE with the file you want to copy, and
A: with the destination (A: for a floppy in drive A:, C:\OLDNET if you
created a directory on your hard disk).

   COPY C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE A:

If you are unsure of where to find your networking program's files, the
following table should give some hints.  Otherwise, look in your
CONFIG.SYS DEVICE= statement, AUTOEXEC.BAT PATH= statement, or for the
AUTOEXEC.BAT command that loads your network software.

Network            Directory
-------            ---------
LAN Manager         C:\LANMAN.DOS, C:\3OPEN
MS-Net              C:\MSNET, C:\UBNET

These are the files you should backup:

LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced
------------------------
C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE
C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NET.EXE
C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NET.MSG
C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\NETBIND.EXE
C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES\ENCRYPT.EXE
C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES\MSRV.EXE
C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES\NETPOPUP.EXE
C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI\NETBEUI.DOS

C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE

LAN Manager 1.x Basic
---------------------
C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC\NET.EXE
C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC\REDIR.EXE

MS-Net
------
C:\MSNET\NET.EXE
C:\MSNET\REDIR.EXE
C:\MSNET\SETNAME.EXE

3Com 3+Share (partial NetBIOS configuration)
--------------------------------------------
C:\3PLUS\MSREDIR.EXE

3. Copying the files off the LAN Manager Supplemental disks, replacing
  existing files

You are now ready to update your networking software with the files on
these disks.  Check your backup copies first, just to be sure.  Type the
following command at the command prompt (assuming you used a diskette in
drive A: to hold your backup copies):

   DIR A:

Compare the output to the list of files above.  If you used a diskette,
remove it and keep it in a safe place.

Next, copy the files off the LAN Manager Supplemental disks onto your
hard disk, replacing the old copies.  The lists below indicate the
directory and destination directory of the files.  For example,
A:\LM\NET.EXE should be copied to C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NET.EXE using
the following command:

   COPY A:\LM\NET.EXE C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NET.EXE

LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced
------------------------
A:\LM\NET.EXE       -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NET.EXE
A:\LM\NET.MSG       -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NET.MSG
A:\LM\NETBIND.EXE   -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\NETBIND.EXE
A:\LM\ENCRYPT.EXE   -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES\ENCRYPT.EXE
A:\LM\MSRV.EXE      -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES\MSRV.EXE
A:\LM\NETPOPUP.EXE  -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES\NETPOPUP.EXE
A:\LM\NETWKSTA.EXE  -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE
A:\LM\NETBEUI.DOS   -&gt;
            C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI\NETBEUI.DOS

LAN Manager 2.0 Basic
---------------------
A:\LM.20B\NET.EXE      -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC\NET.EXE
A:\LM.20B\REDIR.EXE    -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC\REDIR.EXE
A:\LM\NETBEUI.DOS  -&gt;
            C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI\NETBEUI.DOS

LAN Manager 1.x Enhanced
------------------------
A:\LM.1XE\NETWKSTA.EXE -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.EXE

A:\LM.1XB\REDIR.EXE    -&gt; C:\LANMAN.DOS\BASIC\REDIR.EXE

MS-Net
------
A:\LM.20B\NET.EXE      -&gt; C:\MSNET\NET.EXE
A:\LM.20B\REDIR.EXE    -&gt; C:\MSNET\REDIR.EXE

3Com 3+Share (partial NetBIOS configuration)
--------------------------------------------
A:\3PLUS\MSREDIR.EXE   -&gt; C:\3PLUS\MSREDIR.EXE

4. Modifying your configuration files to take advantage of the new
  software

In most cases, you do not need to make any changes to your configuration
files.  (There are required changes in some cases; see below.)  However,
you may wish to tune your configuration using the directions below.  See
the "Optimizing Your System" and "Commands" chapters in your MS-DOS 5.0
documentation for more details on EMM386.EXE, HIMEM.SYS, the DEVICEHIGH=
statement, the LOADHIGH command, the MEM /C command, and the EDIT
editor.  The directions in this section assume a higher level of
technical knowledge than the directions in the previous sections.

Note that some networking products include their own versions of
EMM386.EXE (sometimes EMM386.SYS) and HIMEM.SYS.  When using DOS 5.0,
you should use the DOS 5.0 versions of these programs.  Be sure your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT refer to the correct versions (usually found
in the C:\DOS subdirectory).

LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced
------------------------
All pieces of your networking software (as enumerated below) may be
placed in upper memory, leaving a 0K conventional memory footprint.
Your hardware and software configuration may not offer sufficient upper
memory space to do this, however.  By modifying your configuration and
using programs supplied on the Supplemental Disks, you can control which
pieces of LAN Manager are loaded into UMBs.

Each file is described below:

NETWKSTA.EXE (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware, UMBable version of the network redirector.
   Controlled via the UMB parameter in LANMAN.INI.  For example, to
   prevent loading the redirector into UMBs, add the following
   command to the [workstation] section of LANMAN.INI

       UMB=NO

   By default, the redirector attempts to load into UMBs, then
   LIM, then HMA, depending on the settings of the UMB, LIM, and
   HIMEM parameters in the [workstation] section of LANMAN.INI.

   Note: Do not use the LOADHIGH command (i.e., LOADHIGH NET START
   WORKSTATION) to load the workstation into UMBs.  This would cause
   the NET.EXE program to occupy UMB space, potentially preventing
   the workstation from loading there.  NETWKSTA.EXE handles loading
   into UMBs without using LOADHIGH.

NET.EXE

   a version of NET.EXE (the NET command) that supports the control
   of individual services being loaded into UMBs via the    [loadopts]
   section in LANMAN.INI.  See the ENCRYPT.EXE section below.

NET.MSG

   the messages that are displayed by NET.EXE

NETBIND.EXE

   a UMBable version of the Protocol Manager binding program.  This
   program is only memory-resident if you are using more than one
   transport protocol or network adapter.  Use the LOADHIGH
   command in AUTOEXEC.BAT to cause NETBIND to load into UMBs:

       LOADHIGH C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\NETBIND

   Note that transport protocols and network adapter drivers are
   typically loaded into UMBs either by use of the DEVICEHIGH=
   statement in CONFIG.SYS or by the LOADHIGH command in
   AUTOEXEC.BAT.

ENCRYPT.EXE
MSRV.EXE
NETPOPUP.EXE

   UMBable versions of the ENCRYPT, MESSENGER, and NETPOPUP
   services.  The ENCRYPT, MESSENGER, and NETPOPUP services and
   NETBIND.EXE supplied with LAN Manager 2.0 (prior to LAN Manager
   2.00C) do not support loading into UMBs, so the versions provided
   on the Supplemental Disks should be used if you wish to do this.
   These services automatically load into UMBs, but you can control
   this on a service-by-service basis.  For example, to prevent
   loading the MESSENGER into UMBs, create a    new [loadopts] section
   in LANMAN.INI and add MESSENGER=LOW to this section.  For example:

       [loadopts]
         messenger=low

   If you want a service to load into UMBs, use the UMB parameter,
   e.g., MESSENGER=UMB.  This is not necessary, though, as
   the MESSENGER, NETPOPUP, and ENCRYPT services attempt to load into
   UMBs by default.  NETPOPUP will use LIM memory, if necessary,
   but in general, services cannot be loaded into LIM or HMA.

NETBEUI.DOS (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware, UMBable version of the NETBEUI transport
   protocol.  Use the DEVICEHIGH= statement in CONFIG.SYS to load
   NETBEUI into UMBs:

   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI\NETBEUI.DOS

Taking advantage of upper memory

By using the EMM386 and MEM /C commands, you can see which drivers and
applications are loaded into conventional memory and UMBs, how much
space they need, and how much space is available in each area.  Note
that UMBs are allocated in largest-available first order, so you
typically want to load larger things into UMBs first (but always load
PROTMAN.DOS before transport protocols and net card drivers in
CONFIG.SYS).  Some experimentation with the various commands
(DEVICEHIGH, LOADHIGH, and UMB=NO in LANMAN.INI) and load order may be
necessary on machines with lower amounts of UMB space.  MEM /D is more
cryptic than MEM /C, but it gives more information and more clearly
shows how NETWKSTA may be broken up into 3 separate pieces to take
advantage of smaller UMB blocks, LIM, etc., depending on the hardware
and configuration.

Example configuration

Here are the CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, and LANMAN.INI from a machine
with 160K of UMB space, along with the output of MEM /C showing where
everything is loaded and how much space is used.  Note that NETPOPUP and
MESSENGER are not started and DOS is slightly modified in CONFIG.SYS,
giving a 0K conventional memory footprint for LAN Manager and over 610K
for apps.  You will have differing results based on hardware and how you
configure DOS and LAN Manager.

LAN Manager 2.0 Basic
---------------------
The network redirector, transport protocol, and network adaptor driver
may be placed in upper memory, leaving a 0K conventional memory
footprint.  Your hardware and software configuration may not offer
sufficient upper memory space to do this, however.  By modifying your
configuration and using programs supplied on the Supplemental Disks, you
can control which pieces of LAN Manager are loaded into UMBs.

Each file is described below:

REDIR.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware, UMBable version of the network redirector.
   Controlled via the UMB parameter in LANMAN.INI.  For example, to
   prevent loading the redirector into UMBs, add the following
   command to LANMAN.INI immediately after the START RDR $1 line:

       UMB=NO

   By default, the redirector attempts to load into UMBs.

   Note: Do not use the LOADHIGH command (i.e., LOADHIGH NET START
   WORKSTATION) to load the redirector into UMBs.  This would cause
   the NET.EXE program to occupy UMB space, potentially preventing
   the redirector from loading there.  NET.EXE handles loading
   REDIR.EXE into UMBs without using LOADHIGH.

NET.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware version of NET.EXE (the NET command) that supports
   loading the redirector into UMBs.

NETBEUI.DOS (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware, UMBable version of the NETBEUI transport
   protocol.  Use the DEVICEHIGH= statement in CONFIG.SYS to load
   NETBEUI into UMBs:

   DEVICEHIGH=C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\NETBEUI\NETBEUI.DOS

See the LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced section above for more information
about taking advantage of upper memory.  Note that Basic workstations do
not have NETPOPUP and MESSENGER services.

LAN Manager 1.x Enhanced
------------------------
The NETWKSTA.EXE file is described below:

NETWKSTA.EXE (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware version of the network redirector.  The LAN
   Manager 1.x Enhanced redirector cannot be loaded into UMBs.

See the LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced section above for more information
about taking advantage of upper memory.  Do not attempt to load any LAN
Manager 1.x Enhanced pieces into UMBs, except for the network adapter
driver.  The redirector, transport protocol, and services do not support
loading into UMBs.

LAN Manager 1.x Basic
---------------------
The network redirector and network adapter driver may be placed in upper
memory.  Your hardware and software configuration may not offer
sufficient upper memory space to do this, however.  By modifying your
configuration and using programs supplied on the Supplemental Disks, you
can control which pieces of LAN Manager are loaded into UMBs.

Each file is described below:

REDIR.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware, UMBable version of the network redirector.
   Controlled via the UMB parameter in LANMAN.INI.  For example, to
   prevent loading the redirector into UMBs, add the following
   command to LANMAN.INI immediately after the START RDR $1 line:

       UMB=NO

   By default, the redirector attempts to load into UMBs.

   Note: Do not use the LOADHIGH command (i.e., LOADHIGH NET START
   WORKSTATION) to load the redirector into UMBs.  This would cause
   the NET.EXE program to occupy UMB space, potentially preventing
   the redirector from loading there.  NET.EXE handles loading
   REDIR.EXE into UMBs without using LOADHIGH.

NET.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware version of NET.EXE (the NET command) that supports
   loading the redirector into UMBs.

See the LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced section above for more information
about taking advantage of upper memory.  The LAN Manager 1.x NETBEUI
transport protocol cannot be loaded into UMBs.

MS-Net
------
The network redirector and network adapter driver may be placed in upper
memory.  Your hardware and software configuration may not offer
sufficient upper memory space to do this, however.  By modifying your
configuration and using programs supplied on the Supplemental Disks, you
can control which pieces of MS-Net are loaded into UMBs.

In order to use the files described below, you must rename your
MSNET.INI file to LANMAN.INI.  (e.g., RENAME MSNET.INI LANMAN.INI)

Each file is described below:

REDIR.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware, UMBable version of the network redirector.
   Controlled via the UMB parameter in LANMAN.INI.  For example, to
   prevent loading the redirector into UMBs, add the following
   command to LANMAN.INI immediately after the START RDR $1 line:

       UMB=NO

   By default, the redirector attempts to load into UMBs.

   Note: Do not use the LOADHIGH command (i.e., LOADHIGH NET START
   WORKSTATION) to load the redirector into UMBs.  This would cause
   the NET.EXE program to occupy UMB space, potentially preventing
   the redirector from loading there.  NET.EXE handles loading
   REDIR.EXE into UMBs without using LOADHIGH.

NET.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware version of NET.EXE (the NET command) that supports
   loading the redirector into UMBs.

SETNAME.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   a DOS 5.0-aware version of SETNAME.EXE (which sets your
   computer name into memory).

   Review your LANMAN.INI file to ensure that redir appears
   before setname each time both commands appear in the same
   command set.  For example, suppose one of your commands in
   LANMAN.INI appears as follows:

       start rdr $1
           chknet
           loadniu -r -d -m:d -i:5 exniuw.xfm stdlc
           xnsbios -m:d -i:5
           session
           setname $1
           redir /l:26 /s:9
           prtsc

   You would reverse the order of setname and redir commands so the
   command set appears as follows:

       start rdr $1
           chknet
           loadniu -r -d -m:d -i:5 exniuw.xfm stdlc
           xnsbios -m:d -i:5
           session
           redir /l:26 /s:9
           setname $1
           prtsc

On certain configurations, PRINT.COM and SHARE.COM are copied to the
MSNET subdirectory.  These versions do not work in all cases with DOS
5.0.  Rename them (to PRINT.OLD and SHARE.OLD, for example), and copy
the PRINT.EXE and SHARE.EXE files from your DOS 5.0 subdirectory into
the MSNET directory.  Similarly, you should use the EMM386.EXE and
HIMEM.SYS from DOS 5.0, rather than the versions supplied with MS-Net.

See the LAN Manager 2.0 Basic section above for more information
about taking advantage of upper memory.  MS-Net transport protocols
typically cannot be loaded into UMBs.

3Com 3+Share partial NetBIOS configuration
------------------------------------------
3Com 3+Share networks provide the option to load with a partial
NetBIOS configuration (NB.COM).  To use this configuration with DOS 5.0,
you must use the redirector provided on the Supplemental Disks.
This file is described below:

MSREDIR.EXE  (required for DOS 5.0)

   A DOS 4.0-aware version of the partial NetBIOS redirector.  This
   redirector should not be loaded into UMBs.  Because this
   redirector is not DOS 5.0-aware, use the SETVER command to cause
   DOS to report version 4.0 to MSREDIR.EXE.

If you are using the complete NetBIOS configuration, follow the
instructions for MS-Net, above.
