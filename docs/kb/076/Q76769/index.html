The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the Windows with Multimedia Extensions
version 1.0 README.TXT file. The Setup program copies this file to the Windows
with Multimedia Extensions directory.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

WHAT IF YOU RUN OUT OF MEMORY?
==============================

As you're running applications in Windows or are trying to start an
application, you might receive messages about being out of memory. You
can find out how much memory is available and of what type by choosing
the About command from the Help menu in either Program Manager or File
Manager. A dialog box containing memory information appears.

The following list describes each memory category and suggests how to
increase available memory:

Amount of memory free   This number is the amount of conventional
                       memory currently available for
                       applications.

                       When you run Windows in standard mode,
                       this number includes extended memory.

                       When you run Windows in 386 enhanced
                       mode, this number includes virtual
                       memory and could be much larger than the
                       physical amount of memory in your
                       computer.

                       If you need more memory or if the amount
                       of free memory is less than 30K, close
                       some applications.

Amount of EMS free      When you run Windows in real mode with
                       an expanded memory driver installed,
                       this number shows the amount of expanded
                       memory currently available. It is
                       possible to have plenty of expanded
                       memory available, but be out of
                       conventional memory.

                       You can close some applications to free
                       up conventional memory.

                       You will be unable to use the Multimedia
                       extensions when running Windows in real
                       mode.

SMARTDrive Amount       This number is the amount of expanded
                       memory claimed by SMARTDrive. Windows
                       3.0 can allocate memory from SMARTDrive
                       as needed.

                       For more information on how to use
                       SMARTDrive, see Chapter 4, "Optimizing
                       Your System," in Introducing Windows with
                       Multimedia.

System Resources        This number is the percentage of system
                       resources available. This number never
                       reaches 100% because the system itself
                       takes up some system resources.

                       If this number is too low (about 15%),
                       you cannot run more applications
                       regardless of how much free memory you
                       have. Close some applications to free
                       system resources.
