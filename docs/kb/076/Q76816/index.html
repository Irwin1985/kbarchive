The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes settings in the SYSTEM.INI file that are specific with
Windows with Multimedia Extensions. This information is part of the contents of
the SYSINI.TXT, SYSINI2.TXT, SYSINI3.TXT, and SYSINI4.TXT files shipped with the
product.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

The following sections are added to the SYSTEM.INI file:

Section             Description
-------             -----------

[drivers]           Lists drivers for Windows with Multimedia
                   Extensions

[mci]               Lists Media Control Interface (MCI) drivers for

                   Windows with Multimedia Extensions

[mmsystem]          Lists options that control the stack

                   used by MMSYSTEM.DLL at interrupt time

[Multimedia.Setup]  Lists audio and display drivers selected
                   during setup of Windows with Multimedia
                   Extensions for use by the Setup program
                   and the Display application in the Control
                   Panel (the listings for this section are
                   in the SYSINI4.TXT file)

The specific options are described separately, by section, below.

[BOOT] SECTION
--------------

Drivers=&lt;filename&gt;:

Default: MMSYSTEM.DLL

Purpose: In Windows with Multimedia Extensions, this setting specifies drivers
that are installed at boot time.

[DRIVERS] SECTION
-----------------

The [drivers] section lists installable device drivers for Windows with
Multimedia Extensions. These drivers do not include Media Control Interface
(MCI) device drivers, which are listed in the [mci] section of the file.

Entries in this section have the following format:

  device_type=driver_name [parameters]

The device_type is the type of device, and the driver_name is the filename for
the device driver installed for that device type. Parameters that are specific
to a device driver may follow the driver_name. Alternatively, these parameters
may be given in a section with the same name as the device driver:

  [driver_name]
  keyname=value
  .
  .
.

The following sections describe the settings that Windows with Multimedia
Extensions adds to the [drivers] section. Follow these steps to change any of
the settings:

1. From the Control Panel, select the Drivers icon.

2. Choose Add to add a new device driver, or select a device type from the
  Installed Drivers list to modify or remove the current driver.

3. Choose Setup to select options for the driver.

4. Choose OK.

joystick=&lt;filename&gt;:

Windows with Multimedia provides: IBMJOY.DRV

Purpose: This setting specifies the joystick device driver.

midi=&lt;filename&gt;:

timer=&lt;filename&gt;:

Windows with Multimedia provides: TIMER.DRV

Purpose: This setting specifies the timer device driver.

wave=&lt;filename&gt;:

Purpose: This setting specifies waveform-audio device driver.

[MCI] SECTION
-------------

The [mci] section lists MCI device drivers for Windows with Multimedia
Extensions. If more than one device of a given type is installed, the keyname
has a number as its last character.

Windows with Multimedia adds the following settings to the [mci] section.

CDAudio=&lt;filename&gt;:

Windows with Multimedia settings: MCICDA.DRV

Purpose: This setting specifies the filename of the MCI driver used to control
audio compact-disc (CD) players.

new videodisc driver, or select CDAudio from the Installed Drivers list to
modify the current driver. Click Setup to select options for the device driver
(for example, the device number for the CD player). Then choose OK.

Sequencer=&lt;filename&gt;:

Windows with Multimedia settings: MCISEQ.DRV

Purpose: This setting specifies the filename of the MCI driver used to control
playback of MIDI sequences.

To change: Select the Drivers icon from the Control Panel. Choose Add to add a
new driver, or select Sequencer from the Installed Drivers list to modify the
current driver. Click Setup to select options (if any) for the device driver.
Then choose OK.

Videodisc=&lt;filename&gt; [&lt;com-port&gt;]:

Windows with Multimedia settings: MCIPIONR.DRV COM1

Purpose: This setting specifies the filename of the MCI driver used to control
external videodisc players.

new videodisc driver, or select Videodisc from the Installed Drivers list to
modify the current driver. Click Setup to select a COM port for the videodisc
player. Then choose OK.

WaveAudio=&lt;filename&gt; [&lt;buffer-size&gt;]:

Windows with Multimedia settings: MCISEQ.DRV 4

Purpose: This setting specifies the filename of the MCI driver used to control
recording and playback of waveform audio files. It may optionally specify the
number of seconds (an integer in the range 2 to 9 seconds) of audio the driver
should buffer during playback or recording.

To change: Select the Drivers icon from the Control Panel. Choose Add to add a
new driver, or select WaveAudio from the Installed Drivers list to modify the
current driver. Click Setup to select options (for example, buffer size). Then
choose OK.

[MMSYSTEM] SECTION
------------------

The [mmsystem] section includes options used by MMSYSTEM.DLL.

Windows with Multimedia puts the following settings in the [mmsystem] section.

StackFrames=&lt;number&gt;:

Defaults: 3

Purpose: This setting specifies the number of stack frames used when new
instances of MMSYSTEM.DLL are called.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

StackSize=&lt;number&gt;:

Defaults: 1536

Purpose: This setting specifies the number of bytes in each stack frame used when
new instances of MMSYSTEM.DLL are called.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

[MULTIMEDIA.SETUP] SECTION:

The [Multimedia.Setup] section records information about the currently installed
audio and video hardware from your input during setup. Anytime you run Setup
after the initial setup, and anytime you select the Display application from the
Control Panel, these programs use the information given in this section.

Windows with Multimedia adds the following settings to the [Multimedia.Setup]
section:

audio=&lt;filename&gt;,&lt;port&gt;,&lt;interrupt&gt;,&lt;dsp-version&gt;:

Windows with Multimedia uses: SNDBLST.DRV,210,3,none

Purpose: This setting specifies the device driver for the audio device you
specified when setting up Windows with Multimedia. For the Sound Blaster audio
board, the extra parameters specify the port number, interrupt, and Digital
Signal Processor (DSP) version. The DSP version is either 105 (version 1.05),
150 (version 1.5), or 200 (version 2.0).

To change: Rerun Setup.

display=&lt;filename&gt;:

Windows with Multimedia uses: MMV7VGA.DRV

Purpose: Specifies the device driver for the video card you specified when
setting up Windows with Multimedia.

To change: Rerun Setup.

SECTIONS FOR WINDOWS WITH MULTIMEDIA DEVICE DRIVERS
---------------------------------------------------

As noted earlier in this file, for any device driver described in the [drivers]
section of SYSTEM.INI, parameters may be defined in a section with that device
driver name. The following device-specific sections define parameters for the
default device drivers provided in Windows with Multimedia Extensions:

  [ibmjoy.drv]
  [sndblst.drv]

The following sections describe the entries that may appear in these sections.
(Additional sections may appear for other audio, video, or peripheral devices
installed on the system.)

[ibmjoy.drv]
axes=&lt;2-or-3&gt;
timeout=&lt;hex-number&gt;

  Defaults: axes=2
           timeout=0x3000

  Purpose: The axes option specifies whether the joystick is
  two-dimensional (2) or three-dimensional (3). The timeout option is
  a hexadecimal value specifying how many times the joystick driver
  is polled before the system determines that a joystick is not
  installed on the system.

  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

[sndblst.drv]
port=&lt;hex-humber&gt;
interrupt=&lt;number&gt;
DisableWarning=&lt;Boolean&gt;

  Defaults: none

  Purpose: The port option specifies the port number for the Sound Blaster audio
  card. This is the port where the jumper on the card is set. The interrupt
  option specifies which interrupt the Sound Blaster uses. The DisableWarning
  option, if enabled, displays a warning message if a DOS application running
  from the Windows DOS prompt tries to access the Sound Blaster port given in
  the port option or the interrupt given in the interrupt option. This option
  is enabled by default.
