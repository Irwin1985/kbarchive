SUMMARY
=======

Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are very useful tools in Windows programming. Many
applications can use the code in a DLL, meaning that only one copy of the code
is resident in the system. It is possible to update a DLL without changing
applications that use the DLL, as long as the interface to the functions in the
DLL does not change.

This article provides some general information regarding DLLs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The small and medium memory models are the preferred memory models for Windows
3.0 applications and DLLs. By default, the compact and large memory models
create multiple data segments. These data segments are fixed in the memory space
and cause difficulties for all applications running in Windows. Fixed segments
in standard and enhanced modes can cause fragmentation of the heap. Because of a
problem in Windows 3.0, all fixed segments are also page-locked, and can
overburden the enhanced-mode virtual memory manager.

In Windows 3.1 with the Microsoft C/C++ and later compilers, the large model is
the preferred method since the problem with Windows 3.0 has been fixed in
Windows 3.1.

If an application requires the large memory model, a method can be used to
unpage-lock the extra data segments of the DLL. For additional information on
large-model programming, query on the following words in this Knowledge Base:

  " large and model and protected " (without the quotation marks)

However, if the language compiler used supports the large memory model with a
single data segment, this method is not required.

When compiling a DLL with the Microsoft C Compiler, specify the -Aw switch so
that the code generator does not assume that the application's stack segment is
equal to its data segment (SS != DS). The generated code will not automatically
load DS at each module entry point. The -An switch should be used to specify
near data, and the -As or -Al switch to specify near or far code, respectively.

When writing code in DLLs, it is important to remember that SS != DS. This is an
issue when an application function passes a pointer to one of its local
variables to the DLL function. In Microsoft C, all near pointers are assumed to
be relative to DS. The way to avoid problems is to either:

- Use a function prototype declaring the parameter to be a FAR pointer.

- Explicitly cast the parameter to FAR.

When using Microsoft C run-time functions, specify the model independent
functions; for example: _fmemcpy, _fmemset.

The -Gw compiler switch generates the Windows prolog and epilog code. When a
function is called, the prolog saves the current data segment on the stack. When
memory moves in real mode, Windows "walks" the stack and changes the stored DS
values to reflect the memory motion.

The prolog code is not required when a DLL will be used only in protected mode.
There are two restrictions when choosing not to use the -Gw switch in protected
mode:

1. Windows debuggers will not be able to properly provide stack trace
  information.

2. Exported functions must include the _loadds attribute in the declaration of
  the function. The following is an example declaration:

        BOOL FAR PASCAL _loadds ExportedFunction(VOID)

DLL functions that will be called from applications should be declared with the
FAR modifier because an intersegment jump is required from the application.
Functions that are only called from within the DLL may be declared NEAR. The
PASCAL or _cdecl calling conventions may be used as appropriate. Functions
called from Windows must be declared using the PASCAL calling convention.

When exporting _cdecl functions in the module definition (DEF) file, one must
maintain the case of the function name and use an underscore prefix. For
example:

  EXPORTS
     WEP                  @1  RESIDENTNAME
     _ExportedFunction    @2

A DLL is limited to one instance. The DATA SINGLE or DATA NONE statements can be
used in the DEF file to specify that the DLL should have a data segment of its
own or not. Because a DLL does not have a stack of its own, automatic variables
are allocated from the stack of the calling application.

DLLs can maintain data by using the local or global memory allocation routines.
In most cases, memory allocated by GlobalAlloc is owned by the calling task.
Global memory allocated by DLLs with GMEM_DDESHARE specified is owned by the
DLL. When using local memory management functions, allocations are performed
within the current data segment. Therefore, the handles returned from these
calls are only valid when processed by the DLL.

Naming the segments within the DLL, keeping segment size less than 16K and
specifying the segment options PRELOAD, LOADONCALL, MOVEABLE, and DISCARDABLE,
as appropriate, will ease memory requirements and simplify the task of the
memory manager.

There are three methods to access the functions in the DLL:

1. List the names of the functions in the IMPORTS section in the application's
  DEF file.

2. Link the application to an import library generated from the DLL's DEF file
  using the IMPLIB utility.

3. Use the LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress functions to load the library and
  retrieve a pointer to the function, respectively. This dynamic-dynamic
  linking method is the most powerful.

These methods are documented in Section 20.4.2 of the "Microsoft Windows Guide to
Programming," pages 20-31 through 20-34.

For additional information regarding linking DLL routines, please see page 178 of
the Microsoft Visual C++ "C Language Reference".
