The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Rooms or other physical items, such as a conference room or vehicle, can be set
up as a resource to be scheduled using Microsoft's Schedule+ program included
with Windows for Workgroups (WFWG).

Only the postoffice administrator can set up a resource to be scheduled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Workgroups for Windows Mail Postoffice (WGPO) and Windows for Workgroups
Schedule+ must be installed and set up before beginning this process.

1. The Mail Postoffice administrator needs to create an account for the room. An
  example would be for the Conference room #1.

2. Create a mail account called CONFER1 for the Name and CONFER1 for the
  Mailbox. The password must be the same as the administrator's password for
  the Mail Postoffice.

3. Exit and sign out of Mail and Schedule+.

4. Rename the MSMAIL.MMF file in your local Windows directory.

5. Start Schedule+. When it prompts for a name and password, use CONFER1 as the
  name and enter the password. This starts the account for this room.

6. From the Schedule+ Options menu, choose General Options. Select This Account
  Is For A Resource, then chose OK.

7. If each person running Schedule+ is to have the ability to add and delete
  appointments for the room CONFER1, follow these steps. (If only one person
  will add or delete appointments, skip this step and go on to step 8.)

  a. Choose Exit and Sign Out from the File menu.

  b. From your local Windows directory, delete the MSMAIL.MMF file that
     Schedule+ just created.

  c. Rename your previous MSMAIL.MMF file back to MSMAIL.MMF.

  d. Start Schedule+. From the File menu, choose Open Other's Appt. Book.

  e. Choose the room that was set up (CONFER1). The room is now set up.

8. If there is to be only one person in charge of setting up and modifying the
  times for the room CONFER1, do the following:

  a. From the Options menu, choose Set Access Privileges.

  b. Set the default Privilege to "Read Appointments &amp; Tasks."

  c. Select the Add option and choose the person who is to be in charge of
     making appointments to the room CONFER1.

  Select the Assistant option for this person, then choose OK.

  d. Choose Exit and Sign Out from the File menu.

  e. From your local Windows directory, delete the MSMAIL.MMF file that
     Schedule+ just created.

  f. Rename your previous MSMAIL.MMF file back to MSMAIL.MMF.

  g. Start Schedule+.

  h. From the File menu, choose Open Other's Appt. Book.

  i. Choose the room that was set up (CONFER1). The room is now set up.
