   - Requirements
- Back Up the IIS Configuration
- Restore the IIS Configuration

   - Restoring the IIS Configuration After an IIS Reinstallation

SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to back up your Internet Information
Services (IIS) configuration so that you can easily return to a previous state.

Requirements
------------

The following items describe the recommended hardware, software, network
infrastructure, skills and knowledge, and service packs that you will need:

- IIS version 5.0

- Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x, 4.x, 5.x

Back Up the IIS Configuration
-----------------------------

To back up your IIS configuration, follow these steps:

1. In the IIS snap-in on the local computer, click the Computer icon under
  Internet Information Services.

2. Click Action and select Backup/Restore Configuration.

3. Click Create backup, choose a name for your backup file, and then click OK.

NOTE: The default location of the backup is the
%SystemRoot%\system32\inetsrv\MetaBack folder. If you want to save your backup
file to another location, you can copy the file from this default location to
another location. Keep a copy in the default location to allow for an easy
restoration. Note that by default, C:\Winnt is the %SystemRoot% folder in
Microsoft Windows 2000.

4. Click Close.

NOTE: This backup method provides a way to restore only your IIS settings, not
your content files. This backup method does not work if you reinstall your
operating system. Backup files cannot be used to restore an IIS configuration on
other computers that are running Windows 2000.

Restore the IIS Configuration
-----------------------------

The steps to restore a configuration differ depending on whether you removed and
reinstalled IIS.

NOTE: If you want to restore your IIS configuration and only an older copy or no
copy of the metabase file exists, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q234429 How to Manually Restore the Metabase When No Backup Exists

Restoring the IIS Configuration Without an IIS Reinstallation:

To restore your IIS configuration if you have not removed and reinstalled IIS,
follow these steps:

1. In the IIS snap-in on the local computer, click the Computer icon under
  Internet Information Services.

2. Click Action and select Backup/Restore Configuration.

3. In the Configuration Backup Name dialog box, select a backup file and click
  Restore. When you are asked if you want to restore your configuration
  settings, click Yes.

Restoring the IIS Configuration After an IIS Reinstallation:

To restore your IIS configuration after you have removed and reinstalled IIS,
follow these steps:

1. In the IIS snap-in on the local computer, click the Computer icon under
  Internet Information Services.

2. Click Action and select Backup/Restore Configuration.

3. In the Configuration Backup Name dialog box, select the backup file that you
  created and click Restore. Although an error message states that the
  restoration has failed, a portion of your backed-up configuration is
  restored.

4. At a command prompt, type the following:

  "cscript.exe X:\InetPub\AdminScripts\Adsutil.vbs enum w3svc" (without the
  quotation marks)

  where X is the letter of the drive on which IIS is installed. From the listed
  settings, locate the WamUserName and the associated WAMUserPass value.

  NOTE: To use the Adsutil.vbs utility, you must have Windows Script Host
  installed.

5. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click
  Administrative Tools, and then double-click Computer Management. Click Local
  User Managers and click Users.

6. Double-click the IWAM_computername user account. Type the WAMUserPass value
  that you retrieved from the previous step and click OK.

7. In the Configuration Backup Name dialog box, select the backup file that you
  created and click Restore. This fully restores your configuration.

  NOTE: If you change the identity of your out-of-process applications, those
  applications revert back to the previous IWAM user name.
