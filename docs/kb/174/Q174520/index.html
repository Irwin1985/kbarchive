The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you log on to a computer running Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or Windows NT
Server 4.0 in a domain with roaming profiles configured, the following error
message is displayed:

  Your roaming profile is not available, the operating system is
  attempting to log you on with your local profile. &lt;error #&gt;

-or-

  The update of your roaming profile failed. Please contact your Network
  Administrator. &lt;error #&gt;

Furthermore, in the Event Viewer Application Log of the client computer, the
following event may be logged:

  Event ID: 1000
  Source:   Userenv
  Description: Your roaming profile is not available, the operating system
  is attempting to log you on with your local profile. (error #)

The description may also read:

  You do not have permission to access your central profile located at
  \\Server\Share\%UserName%. The operating system is attempting to log you
  on with your local profile. Please contact you Network Administrator.

The various error codes that appear are important to diagnosing the source of the
problem. These error codes include 2, 53, 67, 71, and 1385.

CAUSE
=====

For error 2, the customer may be using a mandatory profile and the system cannot
find the file specified, or the default user profile may have been deleted.

For error 32, the problem is that the profile is being accessed by another
process. A possible cause is that the user is already logged on with the same
account at another computer.

For error 53, the error is that the network path is not found.

For error 67, the error is that the network name could not be found. This could
occur if the syntax in the user's profile path is incorrect.

For error 71, the problem is that the server where the profile is stored will not
permit another connection.

For error 1385, the problem is that the user does not have the user right to
"Access this machine from network." This usually occurs if an administrator has
removed the everyone group from this right.

RESOLUTION
==========

For error 2, verify that the location of the mandatory profile is the same as
the location referenced in the user's profile path, and that it is named
Ntuser.man, or restore or re-create a default user profile for the computer.

For error 32, log the other process off.

For error 53, it could be a problem of name resolution or network connectivity.
Resolve these issues appropriately.

For error 67, verify that the path listed matches the location of the share and
directory name where the profile is stored.

For error 71, verify that the server has the necessary number of licenses and
that it is a retail version of NT.

For error 1385, add the appropriate user or group to this list.
