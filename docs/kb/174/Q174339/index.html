SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access an intranet Web site using its NetBIOS name in
Internet Explorer instead of using its host name, you may receive the following
error message:

  http:/1.0 404 Object Not Found

Instead of the above error message, you may experience long delays when you
attempt to load intranet Web pages.

CAUSE
=====

The client system on which you are running Internet Explorer has a domain name
configured within its TCP/IP properties.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Add the web server's NetBIOS name to your Domain Name Service (DNS) server.
  This will keep the DNS server from forwarding the query to other DNS servers
  -- possibly root servers on the Internet -- in an attempt to resolve the
  name. If your DNS server is authoritative for the domain being queried, it
  can respond almost instantly with a positive or negative response, avoiding
  any timeouts. If the DNS server is not authoritative for the domain being
  queried, and its cache file contains root servers, it will forward the name
  query to the root servers that are authoritative for that domain and wait for
  a response before replying to the client. This can make the client wait up to
  five seconds, after which time it will resend its query to the same DNS
  server.

-or-

- If the client receives DNS server IP addresses from a Dynamic Host
  Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, do not configure static DNS server IP
  addresses in the client's TCP/IP properties. This increases the number of
  servers from which it will wait for a response before trying to resolve the
  name via a NetBIOS name service.

Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you type a name in the address line of Internet Explorer, such as "server",
and your computer is configured with a domain name, such as "domain.com", a name
query is first sent with the domain appended to the name, "server.domain.com".
This query will be sent to all DNS servers for which your computer is configured
before trying to resolve the name of just "server" through a NetBIOS naming
service such as Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).

Computers configured for DHCP and running Windows 95 and Windows NT that have DNS
server addresses manually specified in their TCP/IP configuration will
effectively have four DNS servers to send queries to. The client will try to use
all DNS addresses available. The client queries its primary and secondary DNS
addresses first and it will then wait for a response for up to five seconds
before querying again. If it fails to resolve the name on the first two servers,
it will then try the third and fourth DNS addresses and wait for responses from
them. While waiting for these servers to respond, the client browser may
timeout.
