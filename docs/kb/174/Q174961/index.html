-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying a Systems Management Server service pack or initiating a
site-wide change to one or more of the Systems Management Server client
services, the Windows NT client is not automatically updated. The update only
occurs when the client has completed running the client setup program,
Cli_nt.exe. This program is normally called when either Smsls.bat or Runsms.bat
is run.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, ensure that users run the Systems Management Server
script and log off their Windows NT systems after applying a Systems Management
Server service pack or making a site-wide change to the client services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

This can be a problem for users that rarely log off their Windows NT systems.
This may result in a situation where an older version of the Systems Management
Server Client Inventory service is creating invalid inventory (.raw) files. For
more information on this problem, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q169038 SMS: Event ID 132 Occurs After Applying SMS 1.2 Service Pack 2

With the release of Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3, new
functionality has been introduced. For users who are logged on and have
Climonnt.exe running, Systems Management Server will check the CopyListVersion
line in the Cl_nt.txt file when a .raw file is created. If a difference is
detected between the local CopyListVersion store in the local Sms.ini file, a
.ccr file will be created to have the services updated on the client computer
running Windows NT.

For servers running the SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT service, Systems Management Server
will also generate a .ccr file to have the client services updated when a
difference in the CopyListVersion value is detected.

When a value for CopyListVersion is detected, the service (CLIMONNT or INVWIN32)
calls Cli_nt.exe. Then client setup actually creates the .ccr file. If the
Client Configuration Manager service finds no need to update any of the client
services, the client will not be prompted to restart.
