1.  System Requirements
=======================
* Windows 95 or later operating system
* Personal computer with a 486/66 or higher processor
* 14.4 Kbps modem or higher
* 16MB of memory required
* 70MB available hard disk space (See Disk Space Requirements note below)
* CD-ROM drive (2x or higher)
* VGA or higher resolution graphics card
* Sound card recommended
* Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device

Disk Space Requirements
Internet Explorer 4.0:  45 MB
The Microsoft Network:  20 MB
MSN Setup:       5 MB

If you need to clear space on your hard disk for MSN,
one option is to uninstall any previous versions of
Internet Explorer (3.02 or earlier) that you may have
installed.

To uninstall Internet Explorer 3.02 or earlier:
1. Click the Windows Start button, then click
  Settings, Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
3. Select Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x from the list.
4. Click Add/Remove... and then follow the directions.

MSN is compatible only with Windows 95 or later.  It does not run
on Windows NT or on Windows 3.1.  MSN is considering future
support for Windows NT.

In order to fully experience MSN you will need a sound card and
speakers.  MSN will function properly without them, but audio is
an integral part of the full experience.

2.  Video Cards and Display Problems
====================================
LESS THAN 256 COLOR:
MSN Setup will run if your display is set to 16-color mode;
however, it is designed to run at 640x480 resolution or higher,
with a minimum of 256 colors. If your display is set to show 16
colors, we strongly recommend that you change your display
setting to show 256 colors or more.

If you experience problems with display colors, check your
color configuration:
1. Click the Windows Start button, then click Settings,
  Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Display icon.
3. Click the Settings tab.
4. In the Color palette list box, click 256 Color.

MORE THAN 256 COLOR:
MSN is designed to look even better at higher color settings.
You will find that much of the text is more readable and the
images much clearer when you set your display resolution to
16 bit (65,536 colors) or higher.

Some video cards may encounter problems when using accelerated
video drivers, video drivers with more than 256 colors, or high
resolution video drivers.

If you run into display problems:
1. Try switching to a driver supplied with Windows 95 or later.
2. Change to a different display mode. An alternative to using a
  different driver is to change your video mode to a standard
  video mode such as 640x480 resolution with 256 colors.

For details on how to change drivers or switch to a different
display mode, see your Windows documentation.

NEC computers using the Alliance Promotion video card do not work
well with the MSN setup program. Please contact your computer
dealer for assistance.

3.  Hard Disk Location of MSN Program Files
===========================================
MSN requires that its files be installed on your system disk (the
drive from which your computer boots, generally the C: drive).

If you do not have enough space on your system drive, Setup will
notify you.  You will need to make room on your system disk in
order to install MSN.

4.  Microsoft Internet Explorer Installation
============================================
MSN requires Internet Explorer (IE) version 4.0 or higher.  If
you have an older version of IE, MSN Setup will install a new
version and back up your old version.  During IE installation,
you may be prompted to accept the IE End User License Agreement.
If you do not accept the IE License Agreement, MSN Setup will fail
and your computer will not be properly configured to access MSN.
You must accept the IE license in order to use MSN.

WARNING: Do not install a previous version of Internet Explorer
over Internet Explorer 4.0. If you need to install an earlier version
of Internet Explorer, you must uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0 first.

You should always uninstall your current version of
Internet Explorer 4.0 before installing a newer build.

INSTALLING IE 4.0 WINDOWS DESKTOP UPDATE
The Internet Explorer 4.0 Windows Desktop Update brings true Web
integration to Windows: a Web-enhanced Active Desktop, taskbar,
Start menu, and folders.

To install the IE 4.0 Active Desktop:
1. Click the MSN Quick View icon (the small hand
  icon next to your clock in the Windows task bar).
2. Click MSN Options, then Customize MSN.
3. Follow the directions on the Web site.

INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0 FULL INSTALLATION
Included on the MSN CD are the files for a "Full" installation of
Internet Explorer 4.0. After installing MSN 2.51, reinsert
the MSN Setup CD and click the "Browse the CD" button. The IE 4.0
setup program is in a directory labeled "IE40."
Run "ie4setup.exe" and select the FULL installation.

5.  Installation Problems
=========================
VERSION CONFLICTS:
You may encounter a version conflict when running
the MSN setup program, or when logging in for the first time.
If a "Version Conflict" dialog box is displayed, always keep the newer
version. The dialog box will usually ask, "Do you want to keep this file?"
to which you should click "Yes."

PROGRAMS RUNNING DURING SETUP:
During MSN Setup, we notify you of any running programs that may interfere
with the MSN installation.  Before continuing, we recommend that you close
those
programs. This better ensures a successful installation.
Some programs, such as anti-virus applications that load automatically at
startup,
may be more difficult to close than others. If you are unable to close
these programs,
you can continue with MSN Setup by clicking the Next button and selecting
"Yes" when
you are given a "Do you want to continue anyway?" prompt. In most cases,
MSN Setup will
complete successfully. However, should you run into problems, for example,
your system
stops responding for several minutes during Setup, please try the steps
below to disable all running applications prior to installing MSN.

Recommended steps to disable programs that load during startup:
1. Restart your computer.
2. While Windows is loading, hold down a Shift key.
3. After booting up, but before running other programs,
  press the Ctrl-Alt-Del keys together ONCE.
  If there are programs in the list other than Explorer and Systray
  select them and click the End Task button.

Programs may also load automatically in the Startup folder.  These items
can be
temporarily moved to another temporary folder or your desktop until MSN
completes the installation.  Once finished they can be placed back in the
Startup folder.  This folder is located in:
Windows\StartMenu\Programs\Startup
and the items appear as shortcuts.  Once moved from your Startup folder, be
sure
to restart your computer so that the changes will take effect.

6.  Known Problems with This Release
====================================
MSN SIGN IN APPEARS AFTER DISCONNECT:
Some programs like Outlook Express and some Web-based
content like Microsoft Investor periodically check for updated
information. If you are not already connected to the Internet when
these checks occur, MSN will attempt to dial in to the Internet
for you.

There are two ways to prevent this from happening:
*  Close all Internet applications after you disconnect from the
  Internet.
*  Disable the default dialer option for Internet access.  This
  will require that you first start your MSN connection before using
  Internet applications. To do this:
    1. Click the MSN Quick View icon (the small hand
       icon next to your clock in the Windows task bar).
    2. Click MSN, then Connection Settings.
    3. Click the Options tab.
    4. Uncheck the Use this service for all dial-up Internet access
       option.

SIGNUP OR REQUEST NEW PASSWORD SERVERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE:
When you sign up for a new MSN account, or if you want to
change the password on your current account, MSN will step you
through a process that puts your computer into "kiosk mode" (the
IE 4.0 browser with no user interface controls). If there are
Internet server problems while you are in kiosk mode, you can use
the Alt-F4 keyboard command to cancel the operation and
close out of IE 4.0.

IE AS DEFAULT BROWSER:
Internet Explorer launches when you click e-mail, chat, or
history links. MSN does not replace your default browser and
will be activated only if you double-click the MSN icon on your
desktop or click the MSN Quick View icon in the Windows system
tray to connect to MSN.

JAVA SCRIPT OR VB SCRIPT ERROR:
Java or Visual Basic script errors could occur in the MSN
Program Viewer for a couple of reasons:

1. The MSN Program Viewer does not support the "window.open"
  command, which is supported by IE 3.0, IE 4.0, and
  Netscape 2.0, 3.0 &amp; 4.0.
  Pages that use this command will cause a script error in the
  MSN Program Viewer.

2. MSN is now based on IE 4.0, which includes higher security
  safeguards that will prevent some script commands from
  executing on your machine.

MSN QUICK VIEW COMES BACK EVEN AFTER IT IS CLOSED:
The MSN Quick View icon in your Windows taskbar provides
you with periodic information about your e-mail message count and
the status of your friends online, and it checks to make sure
that your MSN client software is up to date.

Even if you close MSN Quick View, it will be restarted if you
visit a Web page that requires its functionality.  For example,
MSN's On Stage and Communicate home pages use MSN Quick View to
display your new e-mail count.

NOTE: As of 10/13/98 the MSN Communicate home page no longer exists.

REMOVING MSN QUICK VIEW FROM STARTUP:
If you do not want MSN Quick View to start when you turn on
your computer, you can remove it from your Windows Startup group.

To remove MSN Quick View from your Startup group:
1. Click the Windows Start button, then click Settings, Taskbar.
2. Click the Start Menu Programs tab.
3. Click the Remove button.
4. Click the plus (+) sign next to the Startup folder that appears
  in the list.
5. Click MSN Quick View to select it.
6. Click the Remove button. MSN Quick View will no longer start up
  with Windows.

Please note that MSN Quick View will still automatically start when
you connect to MSN or when you connect via a LAN or a proprietary dialer.
MSN Quick View will also start up whenever you visit a page that uses
Quick View's services, such as MSN's Communicate home page.

NOTE: As of 10/13/98 the MSN Communicate home page no longer exists. MSN
Quick View will restart if you visit http://memberservices.msn.com.

MSN QUICK VIEW BEHAVIOR WHEN USING A LAN TO CONNECT TO MSN:
If you connect to MSN using a LAN, MSN Quick View will be unable
to tell when you are done using MSN. If you want to disconnect
from MSN, you will need to select that option from the MSN Quick
View menu.

Otherwise, MSN Quick View will restart anytime you
visit a page that uses MSN Quick View's services.
MSN Quick View will detect that you are configured to connect over
a LAN and start a "sleep" timer, which will count down and put MSN Quick
View to sleep.  When MSN Quick View is running, it will notify you of
Friends Online, e-mail and software updates.  You will not be notified of
these events when MSN Quick View is asleep.

MSN Quick View's sleep timer is set by the Idle Disconnect value in your
Internet browser properties.

To change your sleep timer settings:
1. Click the MSN Quick View icon.
2. Click MSN Options, then Internet Properties.
3. Click the Connection Tab, then click the Connect to the Internet
  using a modem check box to enable the Settings button.
4. Click the Settings button and then choose a value for Disconnect
  if idle for ____ minutes.
5. Click OK and then reselect Connect to the Internet using a local
  area network.
6. Click OK again to accept these settings.

MSN QUICK VIEW BEHAVIOR WHEN CONNECTING WITH DIAL UP
NETWORKING OR PROPRIETARY DIALER:
The MSN dialer starts MSN Quick View once a successful
connection has been made, and it turns it off once the modem
disconnects.  While MSN Quick View is running, it will provide
intermittent notice of e-mail and friends online status, and it
will estimate how long you have been connected.

If you use a proprietary dialer (like AOL), or you start your
connection by clicking on a Dial-Up Networking icon, then MSN
Quick View will only start when you visit a page that uses MSN
Quick View's services.  MSN Quick View cannot detect the end of a
dial-up connection started by another service and may still be
active after you have disconnected.  MSN Quick View will detect
that you are configured to connect via non-MSN connection and
start a "sleep" timer which will count down and put MSN Quick
View to sleep.  To change the interval used to put MSN to sleep,
refer to the instructions for changing the sleep timer interval
in the LAN connection section above.

7. Outlook Express Mail and News
================================
UPGRADING TO MICROSOFT OUTLOOK EXPRESS FROM MICROSOFT EXCHANGE
("INBOX"), OUTLOOK, OR WINDOWS MESSAGING:
MSN 2.51 installs a new Internet e-mail program called
Microsoft Outlook Express. If you have an existing MSN e-mail
account (Microsoft Exchange), MSN Setup will give you
the option of importing your existing mail file to this new program.

If you choose to upgrade (recommended), MSN 2.51 will replace your
previous mail account with a new MSN Internet mail account, and you
will no longer be able to use Exchange, Outlook, or Windows Messaging
as your MSN e-mail program.

If you have MSN installed on another computer and you want to be
able to access your MSN e-mail account on that computer, you'll need
to install MSN 2.51 and Microsoft Outlook Express there as well.

CHANGES IN EXISTING MSN E-MAIL ACCOUNT ADDRESSES:
You may note, as you receive replies to the messages you send, that
your e-mail address is listed as MSN_Member_ID@email.msn.com, instead
of MSN_Member_ID@msn.com.  This DOES NOT mean that your e-mail
address has changed. The addition of the word "email" after the "@"
sign is simply a behind-the-scenes mechanism used to ensure higher
levels of performance on the new MSN mail platform. Your e-mail
address is the same as before the upgrade.

8.  Connection Problems
=======================
AOL USERS WHO INSTALL MSN 2.51:
AOL 3.0 should work fine after installing MSN.  In order to use both MSN
and AOL at the same time, however, you will need to disable MSN's autodial
functionality before you connect to MSN.

To turn off the autodial functionality, complete the following steps:
1.  Click the MSN Quick View icon (hand icon in the system tray).
2.  Click MSN Options, then Connection Settings.
3.  Click the Options tab.
4.  Uncheck "Use this service for all dial-up Internet access."

    Then complete the next procedure on configuring AOL to use
    TCP/IP access.

To configure AOL to use TCP/IP access, complete the following steps:
1.  At the AOL login screen, click Setup.
2.  Select Edit Location
3.  Choose TCP/IP for the type of network.

You can now use both MSN and AOL by starting your connection
through MSN first, and then starting AOL.

AT&amp;T WORLDNET USERS WHO INSTALL MSN 2.51:
AT&amp;T Worldnet should work fine after installing MSN
2.51. If there are any problems getting connected to AT&amp;T
Worldnet or using AT&amp;T Worldnet to access the Internet
check the "Connection Configuration of MSN" section for
instructions on how to manually configure your Internet
connection.  If you are unable to fix the problem manually,
then you should re-install AT&amp;T Worldnet to reset your
connection configuration.

PRODIGY USERS WHO INSTALL MSN 2.51:
Users of Prodigy may find that the Prodigy Internet browser does not work
after
installing the MSN 2.51.  This is because MSN 2.51 installs the latest
version of
Internet Explorer (4.0), which includes new security features that conflict
with the Prodigy browser.  You will need to uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0
from your machine and then reinstall Internet Explorer 4.0 from the
Internet.
This will allow both MSN 2.51 and Prodigy to be used on the same PC.

CONNECTION CONFIGURATION OF MSN:
To reconfigure any of the connection settings in the following chart,
first:
1. Click the Windows Start button, then click Settings, Control Panel.
2. Double-click the "Internet" icon.
3. Click the Connection Tab.

DESIRED CONNECTION   SETTINGS IN INTERNET PROPERTIES
CONFIGURATION      CONNECTION TAB
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Dial Up Using MSN   In the Connection section, check the
        "Connect to the Internet using a modem"
        option. Click the Settings
        button and make sure that "MSN" is the
        highlighted connection.  Make sure that
        "Connect using a proxy server" is
        unchecked.

Dial Up Using       In the Connection section, check the
other RAS Service   "Connect to the Internet using a modem" option.
(eg. MCI, AT&amp;T)      Click the Settings button.  Select the service
        you want to use. (If the service you use
        is not listed, see the next topic about
        proprietary ISPs.)  Make sure that
        "Connect using a proxy server" is
        unchecked.

Dial Up Using       In the Connection section, check the
Proprietary ISP      "Connect to the Internet using a modem" option.
(e.g., AOL, Netscape)   Click the Settings button.  If your service does
not
        appear in the drop-down list, then click
        the Add button and follow the steps to
        create a connection for your service.
        Make sure that "Connect using a proxy
        server" is unchecked.

Direct Connection   In the Connection section, check the
to the Internet   or,   "Access the Internet via a Local Area
Remote Winsock Proxy   Network" option and make sure that
Connection via LAN   "Connect using a proxy server" is
        unchecked. Note: Only Remote Winsock Proxy 2.0
        or later is supported.

LAN Proxy Connection   You can configure IE or MSN to
(cannot access       use LAN Proxy by checking the
MSN via proxy until   "Connect through proxy" box in
Q4 1997)      the Proxy Server section.

MODEM ACCESS WITH WINSOCK PROXY (WSP):
If you have Remote Winsock Proxy installed on your computer
and would like to access MSN 2.51 with a modem,
you will need to turn off Remote Winsock Access.

To turn off Remote Winsock Access:
1. Click the Windows Start button, then click Settings, Control Panel.
2. Double-click the "WSP Client" icon.
3. Uncheck the "Enable WinSock Proxy Client."

Additionally, you will need to uncheck the Proxy server in your Internet
Explorer Connection Properties, as described above.

WHICH CONNECTION CHOICE TO SELECT
This 2.51 version of MSN ships with a new dial-up
connection manager that replaces the dial-up manager from
previous versions of MSN. The new dial-up connection
manager creates an entry in your Dial-up Networking folder
called "MSN" but does not delete your old entries, "The
Microsoft Network" and "The Microsoft Network (backup)."
Either of these old entries will still work with the new MSN
dial-up connection manager, but they will disable the autodial
support for IE and Mail.  So when you access dial-up networking
within either Outlook Express Mail, Exchange Mail, or Chat,
you will be presented with all three choices for connection
to MSN.  You should select the connection entry "MSN" for
all dial-up access to MSN.
