-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.0 SP1, 5.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- The message transfer agent (MTA) may stop unexpectedly and an event similar
  to the following may appear in the event log:

     Source: MSExchangeMTA
     Event: 2051
     Description: A fatal internal MTA error occurred. Contact Microsoft
     Product Support Services. An illegal GET from element &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt;
     occurred at offset &lt;yyyy&gt;

- When you send a message with high importance, the MTA may stop transferring
  messages. The messages you send appear in the MTA queue, but they are not
  sent to the intended recipients.

- Event ID 1097, Event ID 2124, or Event ID 2171 may appear in the application
  log.

CAUSE
=====

These problems can occur when the Dbserver.sch file that is included with
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 is installed on your hard disk, even though you
have applied Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2. This can
occur for either of the following reasons:

- When you applied Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2, the Dbserver.sch file was
  not updated.

  -or-

- When you applied Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2, the Dbserver.sch file was
  updated properly. However, after you applied Service Pack 1 or Service Pack
  2, the Dbserver.sch file was replaced with the version of the file that is
  included with Exchange Server 5.0.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reapply Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 1 or
Service Pack 2. If the problem still occurs, rename the Dbserver.sch file in the
Exchsrvr\Mtadata folder on your hard disk, and then use one of the following
methods to obtain a new copy of the file:

Copy the Dbserver.sch file from your Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2 (depending
on the Service Pack you have applied) compact disc or disks to the
Exchsrvr\Mtadata folder on your hard disk.

  -or-

Decompress the self-extracting Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2 file that you
downloaded from an online service (if you have not already done so), and then
copy the Dbserver.sch file from the resulting Mtadata folder to the
Exchsrvr\Mtadata folder on your hard disk. To decompress the Service Pack 1 or
Service Pack 2 file, type "&lt;filename&gt; -d" (without the quotation marks) at
a command prompt, and then press ENTER.
