SUMMARY
=======

Tracking logs are created when message tracking is enabled on a Microsoft
Exchange component. These logs can be read and edited by any text editing
program. The logs are tab delimited and can be loaded into spreadsheet programs
such as Microsoft Excel. You can also write an application to interpret message
tracking logs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Tracking logs are located in Exchsrvr\Tracking.log. Each daily log is named by
the date on which it was created in yyyymmdd.log format. The file name date,
like all time in the tracking log, is in Greenwich mean time (GMT).

The following table defines the event numbers in the tracking logs.
