SYMPTOMS
========

After you recreate the Foreign.nsf file from scratch, any full loads or updates
to existing users have no effect from Exchange to Lotus Notes. You may also see
the following errors for the process DXANOTES in the LinkAge logs:

  1997/09/22 18:29:40- DXANOTES(0165) 2 64083:Transaction: ### - Record
  has already been added - Treat as an update
  &gt;&gt; lndxapi(1965)
  1997/09/22 18:29:44- DXANOTES(0165) 1 41116:Error opening Notes document
  with id = ####
  &gt;&gt; lsnabapi(1012)
  1997/09/22 18:29:44- DXANOTES(0165) 2 41127:Notes Package ID: Notes
  Storage Facility (NSF). Extended Reason String: Invalid or nonexistent
  document
  &gt;&gt; lsnabapi(3118)
  1997/09/22 18:29:44- DXANOTES(0165) 1 64103:Error {System failure}
  detected opening Note
  &gt;&gt; lndxapi(2512)
  1997/09/22 18:29:44- DXANOTES(0165) 2 64073:Error {System failure}:
  While processing Transaction ###
  &gt;&gt; lndxapi(1397)

Applies to the LinkAge Notes Connector with LinkAge Directory Exchange version
3.2 (components include LinkAge Exchange DXA, LinkAge Notes DXA, and LinkAge
DXM).

CAUSE
=====

The LinkAge Directory Exchange Manager (DXM) sends the full load to the Notes
Directory Exchange Agent (DXA); however, the Notes DXA compares each user being
added to the LMD table, which has not been reset. Because the entry exists in
the Local Mapping Directory (LMD), the Notes DXA assumes that the entry should
be interpreted as an update to an existing user in Foreign.nsf, though the
Foreign.nsf has been cleared. The Notes DXA then attempts to update the person
document in Foreign.nsf that no longer exists. The result is that the user is
not added, and the above error occurs in the LinkAge log files (located in
Linkage\Logs directory).

WORKAROUND
==========

This workaround should only be used when Foreign.nsf has been recreated from
scratch. The following procedure requires a directory pull/push on the Notes
side, which could take a significant amount of time to transmit and process:

1. Stop the DXANOTES process, or shut down the LinkAge Directory Exchange
  service.

2. Go to the LINKAGE\DXANOTES directory and delete, rename, or move the
  following files:

  Dlockfil.dat
  Lmd.dat
  Lmd.ix1
  Lmd.ix2

3. Start the DXANOTES process, or start the LinkAge Directory Exchange service.

4. Request a full load from Notes. This will bring in a full directory from
  Notes and recreate the LMD tables.

5. Send a full load from DXM to Notes. This will ensure that the LMD also
  represents what currently exists in Exchange.

Step 5 may produce duplicate entries in the Notes address book if it was not
empty; that is, if it contains any Exchange users. The LMD tables have a
correlation between the document ID and the key fields (username, domain) of the
person document. When this LMD table is removed, the Notes DXA will try to
insert these names as new documents, not modifications, though the identically
named user is in the address book. To recover, or prevent this, in the case
where Exchange names are stored in a separate address book, recreate a blank
address book for the Exchange names, and redo steps 1-5. In the case where
Exchange names are stored in the same address book as other Notes names, a
solution would have to be researched.
