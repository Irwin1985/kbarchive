-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Excel 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you a drag a file that is not a Microsoft Excel version 7.0 or Microsoft
Excel 97 file into a briefcase, you may receive the following error message:

  Update Briefcase
  '&lt;Filename.xls&gt;' will not be updated because its merge handler cannot be
  loaded.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if both of the following conditions are true:

- The file you are dragging into the briefcase opens by default in Microsoft
  Excel 97.

  -and-

- The file is not saved in the "Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook (*.xls)" format
  or the Microsoft Excel 97 workbook format.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation.

NOTE: If the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch is installed, it is necessary to
remove a registry key in the registry. To remove the registry key, use Method 2
instead of Method 1.

Method 1: Use If SR-1 Patch Is Not Installed
--------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Microsoft Office 97 Service Release CD-ROMs and replacement CD-ROMs
are no longer available from Microsoft. For additional information about
obtaining the Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) and Microsoft Office
97 Service Release 2 (SR-2), click the article number below to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q192874 OFF97: An Overview of Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2)

If you have not updated Office 97 by running the SR-1 Patch, remove Office 97,
and then install the Office 97 SR-2 Replacement CD. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs. In the list of installed programs, click
  Microsoft Office 97, and then click Add/Remove. If you installed Microsoft
  Office from a CD, you are prompted to insert the first CD.

  If a dialog box notifies you that programs are running, quit the programs, and
  then click OK.

3. In the Microsoft Office 97 Setup dialog box, click Remove All.

4. When you are prompted to remove shared components, click Remove All.

  If you are prompted to restart the computer after Setup is finished, do so.

5. Install Microsoft Office 97 SR-2.

Method 2: Use If SR-1 Patch Is Installed
----------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If you have updated Office 97 by running the SR-1 Patch, follow these steps:

1. On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the
  quotation marks), and then click OK.

2. In the Registry window, click the plus sign (+) to the left of the following
  keys, in order:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT CLSID {00020820-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} Roles

  Then, click the yellow Reconciler folder on the left. The text that appears in
  the status bar should be the following:

  \HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00020820-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
  \Roles\Reconciler

3. On the Edit menu, click Delete, and then click Yes to delete the key.

4. On the Registry menu, click Exit.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97 SR-2 Replacement CD.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q172475 : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs because the Xlrec.dll file attempts to use the shared
workbooks functionality that is built into Microsoft Excel 7.0 and Microsoft
Excel 97 to share the workbook in the briefcase. Other file formats that are
opened in Microsoft Excel do not support the shared workbooks functionality and
thus have no merge handle to load. This functionality was changed in the
Microsoft Office 97 SR-2 Replacement CD so that all files formats that you open
in Microsoft Excel can be shared in a briefcase.
