SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use Microsoft Outlook Express and MSN, The
Microsoft Network, to create and exchange e-mail messages with a Subscriber of
MSN or another Internet service provider (ISP).

NOTE: To use Outlook Express with MSN, you need MSN 2.5. The CD-ROM with the MSN
2.5 upgrade is being shipped to all MSN customers. If you have not yet received
this upgrade or if you want to continue to use your current version of MSN, you
cannot use Outlook Express. To send and receive e-mail with MSN 2.0 and earlier,
you need to continue to use Windows Messaging or Microsoft Exchange (the Inbox).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outlook Express is a Post Office Protocol (POP3) e-mail client included with
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0. Internet Explorer 4.0 is available on the MSN
2.5 CD-ROM. You can also obtain Internet Explorer 4.0 from the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ie/

To Create and Send an E-mail Message
------------------------------------

1. In MSN Program Viewer, click Send Or Read E-mail on the Communicate menu. In
  Windows 98 click Start, point to Programs, point to Internet Explorer, and
  then click Outlook Express. If the MSN Sign-In screen appears, type your
  Member ID and password, and then click Connect.

2. In Outlook Express, click Compose Message.

3. In the To box, type the recipient's e-mail address. For example, to send a
  message to a MSN subscriber, type the following address

  "&lt;Member ID&gt;@msn.com." (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;Member ID&gt; is the recipient's MSN Member ID. Note that the
  address is not case sensitive.

4. In the Subject box, type a title for your message. You are not required to
  type any information in the Subject box, but it makes it easier for the
  recipient to determine the nature of the e-mail message.

5. Type your message in the message window. Internet standards limit messages to
  64,000 characters, but files (for example, Microsoft Word documents) may be
  attached to messages. MSN limits the total size of each message to 1.5
  megabytes (MB). The total message size includes the message header, body, and
  file attachments. To attach a file to your e-mail message, use the following
  steps:
  a. On the Insert menu, click File Attachment.

  b. In the File Name box, type the path and name of the file you want to
     attach to your e-mail message, and then click Attach.

6. Click Send. If you are connected to MSN, the message is immediately
  transferred to the e-mail server. A copy of the message is saved in your Sent
  Items folder. If you are not connected to MSN, click Start, and then click
  The Microsoft Network. If the MSN Sign-In screen appears, type your Member ID
  and password, and then click Connect. In Outlook Express, click Send And
  Receive to send your message to the MSN e-mail server.

To Receive an E-mail Message
----------------------------

1. In Outlook Express, click Send And Receive. This sends a request to the MSN
  e-mail server to deliver your e-mail messages. If the MSN Sign-In screen
  appears, type your Member ID and password, and then click Connect.

2. Double-click a message to open it. After you are finished reading the
  message, click Close on the File menu. To delete a message, click the
  appropriate message, and then click Delete on the Edit menu.
