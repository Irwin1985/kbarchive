SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Rservice.exe in a master domain model, you may receive the
following error message:

  Error 5 Access is denied

This error occurs when you run RSERVICE on a Windows NT computer that is a member
of one resource domain and the target computer is a member of a different
resource domain. In this situation, RSERVICE uses the incorrect account to
connect to the target computer. If RSERVICE is executed without the /c switch,
it should connect to the target system with the account of user who is logged
on. Instead of using the account of the user who is logged on, it uses the
account specified in the Rservice.ini file.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run RSERVICE from a computer that belongs to the master domain or the same
resource domain that the target computer is located in.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, you have domains R1, R2, and ACCTS in a master domain model where
domain R1 and domain R2 trust domain ACCTS (the master domain). An administrator
running RSERVICE on a Windows NT Server system belonging to R1, is logged on to
the ACCTS domain as ACCTS\MikeT and has specified ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account in the
Rservice.ini file.

The test target computer is in R2 and the ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account does not have
local administrative privileges to this client computer. As per the
documentation, the administrator is relying on RSERVICE to give this
ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account "Log on as a Service" rights and add this account to the
target computer's local Administrators group.

This fails and the "Error 5 Access is denied" error message is displayed.
RSERVICE incorrectly tries to use the ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account to install the
service instead of using the ACCTS\MikeT account which has administrator
privileges on the client computer. If you give the ACCTS\Smspcmsvc account local
administrator privileges to the target computer, it will successfully install
the service.
