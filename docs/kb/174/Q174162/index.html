-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you turn on the "Save AutoRecovery info every" option (on the Tools menu,
click Options, and then click the Save tab), the following error message may be
displayed when Word tries to do an AutoRecovery save:

  Saving the AutoRecovery file is postponed for &lt;filename.doc&gt;

NOTE: The "Save AutoRecovery info every" option is turned on by default.

This error message will occur when all of the following conditions are true:

- The Word document has previously been saved to a share on a Microsoft Windows
  NT 4.0 primary domain controller (PDC), and the share is on a New Technology
  File System (NTFS) partition.

  -and-

- Share permissions are set to User (Full Control), and NTFS permissions for
  the share are set to Administrator (Full Control) and &lt;local group
  name&gt; (Full Control).

  -and-

- You are logged onto a Windows NT 4.0 client machine, and you are a member of
  either the local shared group or a global shared group which is a member of
  the local shared group.

  -and-

- The "AutoRecover files" path points to a folder in a NTFS partition on the
  client machine.

CAUSE
=====

Word copied the security attributes of the saved document and applied them to
the temporary file that is to become the latest AutoRecovery file. Word then
attempts to rename the temporary file to:

  AutoRecovery save of &lt;filename&gt;.asd

The rename fails because the necessary permissions to rename the file are derived
from the PDC local group, which is unknown on the client machine. The Save As
command fails because a similar rename operation fails.

For additional information about security permissions on an NTFS partition,
please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q169387 OFF97: Security Requirements When Using NTFS Partitions

  Q178565 OFF97: Troubleshooting Office Programs Under Windows NT 4.0


  Q100108 Overview of FAT, HPFS, and NTFS File Systems


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install Microsoft Office 97 for Windows Service Release
2 (SR2).

To temporarily work around this problem, do one or more of the following:

- Change the AutoRecovery path to a FAT partition.

  For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q77535 WD: Setting the AutoSave-Path in Word

  -or-

- Make the user a member of Workstation\Administrators.

  -or-

- Add domain users to the directory permissions on the server, and give Domain
  Users full access to the share.

  -or-

- Give existing global groups permissions for the directory.

NOTE: For technical assistance in adding a member to a group or changing
permissions for users, please contact Microsoft Technical Support for Windows NT
4.0. For additional information on how to contact Microsoft Technical Support,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q102344 Microsoft Product Support Options Q&amp;A

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Microsoft
Office 97 for Windows Service Release 2 (SR-2).

For additional information about SR-2, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q151261 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-2

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you close Word, a temporary file may remain in the "AutoRecovery files"
location specified on the File Locations tab (click Options on the Tools menu).
Since Word copied the security attributes of the saved document and applied them
to the temporary file, you may not have the necessary permissions to delete the
temporary file.

In addition, if you open a file from a shared folder on a Windows NT server (NTFS
partition), you may be unable to save the file to your local folder on your
client machine (NTFS partition). This problem may occur if either of the
settings of Allow Fast Saves or Allow Background Saves (click Options on the
Tools menu and then click the Save tab) are turned off. When you try to do this,
you may receive the following error message:

  Word cannot complete the save due to a file permissions error.
