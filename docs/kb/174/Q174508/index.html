SYMPTOMS
========

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

When you use the Setup Wizard in Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools to
create disk images on a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 98 or
Internet Explorer version 4.0, and then you use the disk images to install the
application on a computer running Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x, Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3.x no longer works. When started, Microsoft Internet Explorer
3.x does not display pages correctly.

CAUSE
=====

Two of the files installed during setup are incompatible with Microsoft Internet
Explorer 3.x. These files are Urlmon.dll and Wininet.dll.

NOTE: This issue does not occur with Internet Explorer 4.01 or later.

RESOLUTION
==========

Solution 1
----------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

Replace the following files in your Windows\System folder with earlier versions
that are compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.x:

  Urlmon.dll
  Wininet.dll

You can obtain these files from the Windows\System folder of a computer that is
running Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.x, but is not running Windows 98
or Internet Explorer version 4.0. Versions of these files that are compatible
with Internet Explorer 3.x are also located on the Microsoft Office 97 CD in the
OS\System folder. To replace the files, follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer on a computer that has Microsoft Internet Explorer
  version 3.x installed and working properly.

2. Browse to the folder where you have Windows installed. This folder is
  typically Windows\System in Windows 95 and Windows 98 and Windows\System32 in
  Windows NT and Windows 2000.

3. Copy the files Urlmon.dll and Wininet.dll to a floppy disk.

4. On the computer where Internet Explorer 3.x is not working properly, rename
  the files Urlmon.dll and Wininet.dll, which are located in the Windows\System
  or Windows\System32 folder.

5. Copy Urlmon.dll and Wininet.dll from the floppy disk or from the Microsoft
  Office 97 CD into the Windows\System or Windows\System32 folder.

  Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x should now display pages correctly.

Solution 2
----------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

You should run the Setup wizard and build your disk images on a computer that
does not have Microsoft Windows 98 or Internet Explorer 4.0 installed These
images will allow Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x to function properly on the
target computer because the version of Urlmon.dll and Wininet.dll that is
distributed with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x will only overwrite older
versions of those files.

If you distribute an application using the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition
and Windows 98 or Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 on Microsoft Windows
95, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q174217 ODE: Comcat.dll Can't be Registered during Run-time install

Solution 3
----------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

NOTE: A file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center
(Mdtupdtr.exe) that automatically carries out the manual steps listed below for
Solution 3. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q179567 ODE97: Setup Wizard Template Files Updater Available in Download
  Center

It is possible to change the version of Urlmon.dll and Wininet.dll that is
included in your disk images by changing an entry in two of the Setup Wizard's
tables.

WARNING: Because the following solution will modify the Setup Wizard's default
tables, you should back up these tables for reference. If you completed a
default installation of the Office 97 Developer Edition, navigate to the
following folder

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard\Msaccomp

and make copies of these files in a different folder:

  01Microsoft Access Run-Time Version.MDT
  09Microsoft Replication Manager.MDT

After you have made the backups of these two tables, follow these steps:

1. Copy a version of Wininet.dll and Urlmon.dll that will register correctly
  into the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard\Redist
  folder on your development computer.

  NOTE: Version 4.70.1215, which is on both the Office 97 Professional CD-ROM
  and the Microsoft Access 97 CD-ROM, will work.

2. Open Microsoft Access.

3. In the Microsoft Access dialog box, select Open An Existing Database, and
  then select More Files in the list box. Click OK.

4. In the Open dialog box, select All Files (*.*) in the Files Of Type box and
  move to the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard\Msaccomp

5. Select and open the file, 01Microsoft Access Run-time Version.MDT.

6. Open the SHAREDINET table and find the line with the following values:

  LineID: add Urlmon_dll
  Param2: $(WinSysPath)
  Param3: C:\Windows\System\URLMON.DLL

  Change it to this:

  LineID: add Urlmon_dll
  Param2: $(SwizSetupFilesPath)
  Param3: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard
          Redist\URLMON.DLL

7. Find the line with the following values:

  LineID: add Wininet_dll
  Param2: $(WinSysPath)
  Param3: C:\Windows\System\WININET.DLL

  Change it to this:

  LineID: add Wininet_dll
  Param2: $(SwizSetupFilesPath)
  Param3: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard
          Redist\Wininet.DLL

8. Close the database.

9. Select and open the file, 09Microsoft Replication Manager.MDT, and repeat
  steps 6 and 7.
