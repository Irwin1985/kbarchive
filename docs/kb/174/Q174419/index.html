SUMMARY
=======

NOTE: Creating delegated subnetted reverse lookup zones is not a trivial task.
It is important to understand how DNS zones work before attempting to create
subnetted reverse lookup zones. There are numerous notes throughout this
document to which you should pay close attention. It is recommended that you
first attempt these procedures in a test environment before deploying them on a
live network because of the ease with which mistakes can occur during
configuration.

The rapid growth of the Internet community created the need to subnetwork full IP
networks into smaller portions. In a subnetted environment, DNS servers can
easily delegate authority of forward lookup zones because they are independent
of the underlying subnetted infrastructure. However, because of the inverse
structure of reverse lookup zones and their strict reliance on the specific
subnet structure, delegation of these zones requires special considerations. The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has created RFC 2317, "Classless
IN-ADDR.ARPA Delegation," which discusses these considerations.

Delegating subnetted reverse lookup zones complements the ability to delegate
forward lookup zones. This flexibility in zone ownership allows you, as the
administrator of a parent domain, to delegate control of both a child subdomain
and a corresponding subnet of addresses to another administrator. Conversely, as
the administrator of a child domain, you now have the control necessary to make
changes to both DNS host (A) records or IP address (PTR) records without having
to make a request for change through the parent domain.

This article discusses how to configure delegated subnetted reverse lookup zones
for a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 DNS server.

NOTE: Simply because your network environment is subnetted does not imply that
your DNS server must be configured in the manner described in this article.
Creating delegated subnetted reverse lookup zones is an administrative choice
only; it is not solely dictated by the underlying subnetted infrastructure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A "classful" IP addressing scheme is one that does not break an IP network down
into smaller segments. For example, a class C address of 192.168.1.0 with a
subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is a classful IP addressing scheme.

A "classless" IP addressing scheme is one that uses a subnet mask to divide an IP
address into smaller segments. For example, a class C address of 192.168.1.0
with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 is a classless IP addressing scheme. Along
with this network, you would also have the following IP network addresses:
192.168.1.64, 192.168.1.128, and 192.168.1.192.

When subnetting IP networks, additional bits are taken from the host portion of
the IP address and given to the network portion. This is defined by adding
additional bits to the subnet mask. The value
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 shows us a classful subnet mask for a Class
C network of 255.255.255.0, while the value 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
illustrates the classless subnet mask of 255.255.255.192. Therefore, from the
example above, we know that:

  If the subnet mask is   The subnet mask bit-count is
  ---------------------   ----------------------------
  255.255.255.128          25
  255.255.255.192          26
  255.255.255.224          27
  255.255.255.240          28
  255.255.255.248          29
  255.255.255.252          30
  255.255.255.254          31

The Syntax
----------

Delegated subnetted reverse lookup zones can be used to transfer administrative
control between any parent and child IN-ADDR.ARPA zone in the DNS. Common
configurations involve an ISP (Parent) delegating to a Customer Site (Child) or
a Corporate Headquarters (Parent) delegating to a Corporate Remote Site (Child).
Because the ISP scenario is most typical, it will be used in the following
example.

When creating classless reverse lookup zones, you may use notation such as the
following:

  &lt;subnet&gt;-&lt;subnet mask bit count&gt;.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa or

  &lt;subnet&gt;/&lt;subnet mask bit count&gt;.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa or

  &lt;subnet&gt;.&lt;subnet mask bit count&gt;.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa or

  SubnetX&lt;subnet&gt;.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa (where X is the subnet number
  assigned by parent) or

  &lt;subnet&gt;.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa

For example:

  64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa or

  64/26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa or

  64.26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa or

  Subnet3.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa or

  64.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa

This indicates that the subnetted reverse lookup zone is the 64 subnetwork that
is using 26 bits for its subnet mask.

NOTE: If you will be performing any Zone Transfers, between parent and child you
need to check the syntax of the files that will be transferred between DNS
servers. Not all versions of DNS servers will support the various syntax methods
defined in the RFC (the hyphen, the slash, etc.). Microsoft DNS will support any
of these methods.

NOTE: Whichever syntax is chosen in the Parent domain MUST be identical to the
syntax used in the Child domain.

The Checklist
-------------

Filling out the following checklist will make walking through this document
easier.

Parent Checklist                         Child Checklist
----------------                         ---------------
&lt;Parent DNS server name&gt;                 &lt;Child DNS server name&gt;
&lt;Parent DNS server IP&gt;                   &lt;Child DNS server IP&gt;
&lt;subnet mask&gt;                            &lt;subnet mask&gt;
&lt;subnet&gt;&lt;syntax&gt;&lt;subnet mask bit count&gt;  &lt;subnet&gt;&lt;syntax&gt;&lt;subnet  mask bit 
                                         count&gt;

Here is the example we will use of an ISP who has taken a Class C range and
subnetted it into 4 subnets by using the 255.255.255.192 subnet mask. The 4
subnets are 192.168.100.0, 192.168.100.64, 192.168.100.128 and 192.168.100.192.
The subnet being delegated to the Customer Site is the second range, that is the
64 network using 65-126 for the host IP addresses.

The Parent Walkthrough for Windows 2000 Environments
----------------------------------------------------

- Launch the DNS MMC (Microsoft Management Console).

- Under view, change from standard view to advanced.

- Highlight Reverse Lookup Zones, right click and select new zone.

- Select Zone Type of Active Directory Integrated or Standard Primary, click
  next.

- Type in either the non-subnetted network ID (for example, 192.168.100) or the
  reverse lookup zone name (for example, 100.168.192.in-addr.arpa) for the
  non-subnetted class C address, click next.

- If you selected standard primary, you can either create a new zone file or if
  there is an existing zone file, you can place it in the
  %systemroot%\winnt\system32\dns directory and the server will read it from
  that directory.

- Once the primary parent zone is created, right click on the newly created
  zone, and select new delegation.

- Add the naming convention you choose as the parent for the delegated child
  zone, (for example, 64-26). Be sure to communicate that naming convention to
  the administrator of the child domain. See examples.

- Add the CNAME (ALIAS) RR (resource records) for the devices within each of
  the subnets.

For example,

  65 CNAME 65.64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.

NOTES:
- Dynamic updates for subnetted reverse lookups do not work in Windows 2000.
  The records will need to be added manually.

- Using "Create Associated PTR record" checkbox will not work for the subnetted
  reverse lookup zone when "A" (host) record is created through GUI.

The Parent Walkthrough for Windows NT 4.0 Environments
------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The Microsoft DNS Manager can be used to set up the reverse lookup zone for
that name server, as well as the subnetted reverse lookup zone or zones. After
the in-addr.arpa zone and the subnetted in-addr.arpa zone(s) are created, the
files will need to be manually edited to include the NS, CNAME, and PTR records
in each zone file. NOTE: Several prerequisites are assumed in this example. It
is assumed that the Microsoft DNS server has been installed and that the TCP/IP
properties (IP Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, and so on) have been
configured correctly.

1. Apply the latest Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack.

2. Restart your computer when prompted.

3. Click Start, select Programs, select Administrative Tools, and then click DNS
  Manager.

4. On the DNS menu, click New Server, type the IP address or host name of your
  DNS server, and then click OK.

5. Create the non-subnetted reverse lookup zone using the following steps:

  a. Click your DNS server, and then click New Zone on the DNS menu.

  b. Click the Primary radio button in the Creating New Zone dialog box, and
     then click Next.

  c. Type "100.168.192.in-addr.arpa" (without the quotation marks) in the Zone
     Name text box, and then press TAB.

  d. The Zone File text box should automatically be populated with
     100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns.

  e. Click Finish.

6. When you have finished creating the zones, stop the DNS Server using either
  of the following methods:

   - Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
     the Services icon. Select Microsoft DNS Server in the Service list and
     click Stop.

   - Type the following at a command prompt and press Enter:

        NET STOP DNS

  NOTE: It is important to stop the DNS service before editing the Zone files or
  you may lose manually recorded information.

7. With a text editor, open the non-subnetted reverse lookup zone file that you
  have just created. We now need to add an NS record that will delegate a
  subnet to the child dns server. Add the following to the end of the file:

  ;  Begin Delegation comments
  ;
  &lt;subnet&gt;&lt;syntax&gt;&lt;subnet mask bit count&gt;        NS     &lt;Child DNS server name&gt;
  ;  End delegation

  Our example will look like this:

  ;  Begin Delegation sub-zone:  64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
  ;
  64-26                   NS	NS1.msn.com.
  ;  End delegation

8. It is now necessary to create a CNAME records for each addresses in the
  delegated subnetted range. Our example looks like this:

     65    CNAME    65.64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
     66    CNAME    66.64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
     67    CNAME    67.64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
     68    CNAME    68.64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
     69    CNAME    69.64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
     ...
     126   CNAME    126.64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.

  NOTE: The ellipse, "...", indicates the unique IP addresses and hosts between
  67 and 126. Ellipses are not valid in the file.

9. By repeating steps 8 and 9, you may delegate any additional subnetted zones.

10. After the NS and CNAME records have been entered, save and exit the file.

11. Start the DNS server using one of the following methods:

   - Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
     the Services icon. Select Microsoft DNS Server in the Service list and
     click Start.

   - Type the following at a command prompt and press Enter:

        NET START DNS

The Child Walkthrough for Windows 2000 Environments
---------------------------------------------------

1. Launch the DNS MMC (Microsoft Management Console).

2. Under view, change from standard view to advanced.

3. Highlight Reverse Lookup Zones, right click and select new zone.

4. Select Zone Type of Active Directory Integrated or Standard Primary, click
  next.

5. Select the option for the "Reverse lookup zone name". Type in the name of the
  reverse lookup zone, (for example, 64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa) for the
  subnetted class C address. Be sure to use the naming convention supplied by
  the administrator of the parent domain, click next.

6. If you selected standard primary, you can either create a new zone file or if
  there is an existing zone file, you can place it in the
  %systemroot%\winnt\system32\dns directory and the server will read it from
  that directory.

7. Manually add your PTR (pointer records) as you would any reverse lookup
  zone.

  For example:

  65 PTR host65.msn.com.

8. You may have to configure the child DNS server(s), which are hosting the
  delegated zone, to forward to the parent DNS servers. This enables the child
  DNS servers to resolve records in the zones hosted by the parent DNS servers.

The Child Walkthrough for  Window NT 4.0 Environments
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Apply the latest Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack.

2. Restart your computer when prompted.

3. Click Start, select Programs, select Administrative Tools, and then click DNS
  Manager.

4. On the DNS menu, click New Server, type the IP address or host name of your
  DNS server, and then click OK.

5. Create a subnetted reverse lookup zone using the following steps:

  a. Click your DNS server, and then click New Zone on the DNS menu.

  b. Click the Primary radio button in the Creating New Zone dialog box, and
     then click Next.

  c. Depending on the syntax chosen at the Parent, select one of pairs listed
     below. For our example we'll type "64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa"
     (without the quotation marks) in the Zone Name text box, and then press
     Tab.

        Zone Name: 64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa
        Zone File: 64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns or

        Zone Name: 64/26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa
        Zone File: 64.26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns or

        Zone Name: 64.26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa
        Zone file: 64.26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns or

        Zone Name: 64.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa
        Zone file: 64.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns or

        Zone Name: Subnet64.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa
        Zone file: Subnet64.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns or

     NOTE: Microsoft DNS Administrator will automatically populate the File Name
     field when creating zones. If you use the "/" syntax, please be sure to
     change the filename and replace the "/" character because the underlying
     file system will not allow a "/" in the file name. Simply substitute the
     slash character in the filename with another character such as the one
     suggested in the second example above
     (64.26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns).

  d. The Zone File text box should automatically be populated with
     64-26.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns.

  e. Click Finish.

  f. Repeat steps a through e, for any additional subnets to being delegated to
     you.

6. When you have finished creating the zones, stop the DNS server using either
  of the following methods:

   - Click Start, select Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
     the Services icon. Select Microsoft DNS Server in the Service list and
     click Stop.

   - Type the following at a command prompt and press Enter:

        NET STOP DNS

  NOTE: It is important to stop the DNS service before editing the Zone files or
  you may lose manually recorded information.

7. Open the subnetted reverse lookup zone file using a text editor. It is now
  necessary to create the PTR records for each address in the delegated
  subnetted range. Add the following to the end of the file:

     65                      PTR     host65.msn.com.
     66                      PTR     host66.msn.com.
     67                      PTR     host67.msn.com.
     ...
     126                     PTR     host126.msn.com.

  NOTE: The ellipse, "...", indicates the unique IP addresses and hosts between
  67 and 126. Ellipses are not valid in the file.

8. After the PTR records have been entered, save and exit the file.

9. Restart the DNS server using one of the following methods:

   - Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
     the Services icon. Select Microsoft DNS Server in the Service list and
     click Start.

   - Type the following at a command prompt and press Enter:

        NET START DNS

10. Hosts on the Internet should now be able to perform a reverse lookup for IP
  addresses in the delegated reverse lookup zone. One last series of steps is
  required in order for hosts that use the Customer Site DNS to be able to
  perform the reverse lookups correctly. It is necessary that a copy of the
  non-subnetted zone be present on the child domain DNS server. The easiest
  way to do this is to become a secondary zone to the ISP. Create the
  secondary zone using the following steps

  a. Click your DNS server, and then click New Zone on the DNS menu.

  b. Click the Secondary radio button in the Creating New Zone dialog box.

  c. For Zone: enter 100.168.192.in-addr.arpa and for Server: enter the
     &lt;Parent DNS server IP&gt;. For our example, it is 192.168.43.8. Click
     Next.

  d. For Zone Name: enter 100.168.192.in-addr.arpa and for Zone File: enter
     100.168.192.in-addr.arpa.dns. Click Next.

  e. In the IP Masters field, again enter the &lt;Parent DNS server IP&gt;. For
     our example it is 192.168.43.8. Click Add, Click Next, and then Click
     Finish.

11. You may have to configure the child DNS server(s), which are hosting the
  delegated zone, to forward to the parent DNS servers. This enables the child
  DNS servers to resolve records in the zones hosted by the parent DNS
  servers.
