-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
- Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup Wizard for your custom application on a Windows 95
computer that is running Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 or on a
computer running Windows 98, and you then install your application on a computer
that does not have Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 installed, you may
receive the following error message

  Comcat.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry

and Setup is not completed successfully.

CAUSE
=====

You used the Office Developer Edition Setup Wizard to build disk images. These
disk images include a later version of the Comcat.dll file than the version on
the target computer. When you run Setup for your custom application, Comcat.dll
is replaced with the newer version of the file from your disk image. Setup can
not register this newer version properly; therefore, you receive the error
described in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, you need to ensure that the version of Comcat.dll
included in your disk images is compatible with all the operating systems and
configurations on which you plan to install your application.

NOTE: After you have used one of the following resolutions, you will need to
re-create your disk images and re-install your application to the target
computers. To do this successfully, you will need to rename or remove the newer
version of Comcat.dll that was copied to the computer during the previous failed
installation before you try to reinstall your application.

Solution 1
----------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

NOTE: A file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center
(Mdtupdtr.exe) that automatically carries out the manual steps listed for this
solution. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q179567 SetupWizard Template Files Updater Available in Download Center

It is possible to change the version of Comcat.dll that is included in your disk
images by changing an entry in two of the Setup Wizard tables.

WARNING: Because the following solution will modify the default tables in the
Setup Wizard, you should back up the following two tables for reference. If you
completed a default installation of the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition,
move to the following folder

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard\Msaccomp

and copy these files into a different folder:

  01Microsoft Access Run-Time Version.MDT
  07Microsoft Graph 97 Run-Time Version.MDT

After you have made backups of these two tables, follow these steps:

1. Copy a version of Comcat.dll that will register correctly into C:\Program
  Files\Microsoft Office\ODE Tools\Setup Wizard\Redist folder on your
  development computer.

  NOTE: Version 4.71, which is on both the Office 97 Professional CD-ROM and the
  Microsoft Access 97 CD-ROM, will work.

2. Start Microsoft Access.

3. In the Microsoft Access dialog box, select Open An Existing Database, and
  then select More Files from the list. Click OK.

4. In the Open dialog box, select All Files (*.*) in the Files Of Type box, and
  move to the following directory:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard\Msaccomp

5. Select and open the file, 01Microsoft Access Run-time Version.mdt.

6. Open the SHAREDMSO table and find the line with the following values:

  LineID: add Comcat_dll
  Param2: $(WinSysPath)
  Param3: C:\Windows\System\COMCAT.DLL

  Change these values so that they read as follows:

  LineID: add Comcat_dll
  Param2: $(SwizSetupFilesPath)
  Param3: C:\program files\microsoft office\odetools\setup wizard
  \redist\comcat.dll

7. Close the database.

8. Select and open the file, 07Microsoft Graph 97 Run-Time Version.MDT, and
  repeat steps 6 and 7.

Solution 2
----------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

Use the Setup Wizard to create disk images on a computer that matches the lowest
common configuration for all of the anticipated target computers for your
application. Some configurations that would suit this purpose:

- Windows 95 without Microsoft Internet Explorer

- Windows 95 with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x or earlier

- Windows NT 4.0 Workstation or Server running Service Pack 3

If you distribute an application using the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition
and Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 from Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q174508 ODE: Run-Time Application Built on IE 4.0 Computer Breaks IE 3.x

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The newer version of Comcat.dll that does not register properly is installed by
both Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and Microsoft Windows 98. Install custom
applications that contain the newer file after installing either of these
products on your development computer will cause the described behavior. You may
receive the error message when you install your application that contains the
newer file onto the following target machine configurations:

- Windows 95 without Microsoft Internet Explorer

- Windows 95 with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x or earlier

- Windows NT with any version of Internet Explorer

The error occurs any time you install your application on a Windows NT 4.0
computer because when Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed onto a Windows NT 4.0
computer, it does not install the updated Comcat.dll file. The updated file is
used strictly when installing on Windows 95.
