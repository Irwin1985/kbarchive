-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you play a random map game or a scenario in a campaign in Microsoft Age of
Empires II: The Age of Kings, the game may slow down or become extremely choppy
after you play for a few minutes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install the latest update for Age of Empires II: Age of
Kings. The latest update, Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings 2.0a
Update, includes performance enhancements that are designed to make the game run
faster.

To download the Age of Kings 2.0a Update, visit the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/age2/downloads.htm

If the issue continues to occur:

1. Quit all programs that are running on your computer.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

4. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Age of Empires II, and then
  click Add/Remove.

5. Follow the instructions on the screen to remove Age of Empires II.

6. Empty the Temp folder. To do this, use the appropriate method for your
  version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 95:

  a. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

  b. At the command prompt, type "set" (without the quotation marks), and then
     press ENTER.

  c. Note the path on the "TEMP=" line.

     By default, the path on the "TEMP=" line points to the following folder

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Windows\Temp

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Windows
     95 is installed.

  d. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you
     type each line

  &lt;drive&gt;:
  cd \&lt;path&gt;

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter from the path you noted on the
     "TEMP=" line, and &lt;path&gt; is the path you noted on the "TEMP=" line.

  e. If the Temp folder exists, proceed to the next step.

     If the Temp folder does not exist, type the following lines at the command
     prompt, pressing ENTER after you type each line:

  md \&lt;path&gt;
  cd \&lt;path&gt;

     where &lt;path&gt; is the path you noted on the "TEMP=" line.

  f. At the command prompt, type "del *.tmp" (without the quotation marks), and
     then press ENTER. If you are prompted to confirm the file deletion, press
     Y.

  g. At the command prompt, type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then
     press ENTER.

Microsoft Windows 98:

  a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System
     Tools, and then click Disk Cleanup.

  b. In the Drives box, click the hard disk on which Windows 98 is installed,
     and then click OK.

  c. In the "Files to delete" box, click to select the "Temporary files" check
     box.

     NOTE: Click to clear the check boxes for files that you do not want to
     delete.

  d. Click OK, and then click Yes.

7. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click ScanDisk.

8. In the "Select the drive(s) you want to check for errors" box, click
  &lt;drive&gt; (C:), where &lt;drive&gt; is the volume name of the hard disk.

  If multiple hard disks are installed in your computer, press and hold down the
  SHIFT key as you click to highlight all hard disks in the list.

9. Click to select the "Automatically fix errors" check box.

10. Click Standard, and then click Start.

11. When ScanDisk is finished, click Close.

12. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click Disk Defragmenter.

13. In the "Which drive do you want to defragment?" box, click Drive C, and then
