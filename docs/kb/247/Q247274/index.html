SUMMARY
=======

This article provides steps to remove the public information store completely
from an existing Exchange Server computer to make it a private information store
only server. A private information store only server is a dedicated mailbox
server. A private information store only server cannot store public folders.

The main reason to create a private information store only server is to reduce
traffic on the server by removing the server from participation in public folder
hierarchy replication, which is message-based traffic. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q159919 XADM: Public Folder Hierarchy Replicates Through Messages

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove the public information store to create a private information store
only server:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program and connect to the
  Exchange Server computer from which you want to remove the public information
  store.

2. Open the Private Information Store properties and click the General tab to
  specify the new public folder server. This is the server on which all of the
  top-level public folders that are created by users who have home mailboxes on
  this server are stored. The public folder server is also the server on which
  the users on this private information store view the public folder hierarchy.

3. Make sure that any existing folders in the public information store are
  rehomed to another public folder server in the site:

  a. Click the public folder that you want to rehome, and then click Properties
     on the File menu.

  b. Click the Replicas tab, and then move the server name of the server that
     you want to rehome the public folder to from the left pane under Servers
     to the right pane under "Replicate Folders to".

  c. Click the Advanced tab, and then click the new home server in the Home
     Server list.

  d. If the server is the first server in the site, ensure that you move the
     system folders in the Pub.edb database to another server in the site by
     performing the steps in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
     Base:

  Q152959 XADM: How to Remove the First Exchange Server in a Site

  e. If you want the server to run the Event service, ensure that you move the
     EventConfig_&lt;server_name&gt; folder for the server to another server in
     the site.


4. Start Performance Optimizer (Perfwiz.exe), and then click to clear the Public
  Store check box.

5. In the Administrator program, delete the Public Store object under the server
  name.

6. To make sure that the public information store has been deleted, quit the
  Administrator program. Stop the information store by using Control Panel,
  Services.

7. Restart the information store service.

8. Restart the Administrator program and make sure that the public information
  store object is not displayed under the Server object.

9. Do not remove the Pub.edb database in the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder.

  You cannot run Performance Optimizer at a later date to move Exchange Server
  files because Performance Optimizer requires a consistent Priv.edb and
  Pub.edb database to work.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q264816 XADM: Performance Optimizer Does Not Move Files If the Pub.edb File
  Is Missing

NOTE: You cannot remove the public information store from every server in the
site. There must be at least one Exchange Server computer that has a public
information store in every Exchange Server site.

However, you can remove the private information store from every server in the
site. These are dedicated public folder sites.

For additional information about how to bring back the public information store
after it has been removed, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Information Store Only Server
