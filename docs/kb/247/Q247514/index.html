-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Spanish language template, empty templates may be
displayed, and the Microsoft Event Viewer may log the following 12 error
messages, all of which all have the same event ID:

  Event ID: 295
  Source: MSExchangeDSImp
  Type: Error

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file User.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Distlist.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Forum.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file agent.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Remote.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Search.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Exopt.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file X400.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Pcmail.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Internet.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Macmail.blt.

  Unable to open or read the attribute value include file Ccmail.blt.

In addition, the following error message may be logged in the Template.err log:

  Unable to open or read the attribute value included file User.blt, Dist.blt,
  Forum.blt

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the .blt files were not installed properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run the directory import command from the
foreign-language client CD-ROM where Template.csv is located. The Template.csv
file on the foreign-language client CD-ROM contains all .blt files that are
referenced inside the corresponding template .csv file. When you run this
command, all the required templates are imported. After the import procedure has
completed from the Administrator program, the localized templates are displayed
in the following location:

  Addressing/Details Templates/Addressing/One-Off Address Templates

The localized clients are now able to display details about mailboxes, custom
recipients, or distribution lists.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 and 5.5
----------------------------------------------

In Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5, the location of the Template.csv files
has been changed. These files are now located on the client CD-ROM that comes
with Microsoft Exchange Server, or in the TPL folder on the foreign-language
client CD-ROM.

The Template.csv file is located in the TPL folder. If the language that you want
to use is not included on the client CD-ROM that came with Exchange Server, it
is located on the client CD-ROM that has the appropriate language of the client.
