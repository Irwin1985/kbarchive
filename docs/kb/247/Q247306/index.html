SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released various hotfixes to correct specific issues for Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0 clients. Microsoft has packaged these hotfixes into
a single client hotfix bundle to simplify applying these hotfixes on an SMS 2.0
site that is running Service Pack 1 (SP1). This article will be updated as new
hotfixes are added to this client bundle.

The following section lists Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that document
issues that are corrected in the Client Hotfix Bundle for SMS 2.0 SP1 with
International Client Pack 1 (ICP1) for English, German, French, and Spanish. For
additional information about each corrected problem in SMS 2.0 SP1, view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

NOTE: You must apply SMS 2.0 ICP1 SP1 before you install this client bundle. Do
not install this client bundle on sites that are not upgraded to SP1 or do not
have ICP1 installed.

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



NOTE: When you apply this client hotfix bundle, you may need to temporarily
disable Logon Discovery and Installation to prevent possible client file
mismatches in a single-domain, multiple-site hierarchy. This can result in the
existing senior site designation being lost. For additional information about
special preparations before you apply this hotfix, click the article numbers
below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q238780 SMS: Best Practices for Applying Systems Management Server 2.0 SP1

  Q235726 SMS: Specifying Senior Site for WinNT Logon Point Management

Client Hotfix Bundle Installation
---------------------------------

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only for Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required and must
  also be downloaded from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
  folder structure intact. The Q247306.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q247306.exe file and follow the instructions in the wizard. You can
  run this file in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

5. The SMS services are stopped and restarted as part of the installation
  process. You need to stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE
  services again before continuing to the next step.

6. From the SMS site database server, use a Microsoft SQL Server query tool (for
  example, Query Analyzer or ISQL/W) to open the 54831.sql script file. This
  file is located in the I386 subfolder that you created in step 1. This script
  is also documented in the Q247306q.txt file, which is created in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Logs folder during the installation process.

7. Select the SMS database in the SQL Server query tool and run the script. If
  you use a common SQL Server computer for multiple site databases, apply this
  script to the site database that belongs to the primary site you are
  updating.

8. Restart the SMS site services. The new files are replicated to all logon
  points and client access points (CAPs). After all logon points and CAPs are
  updated, allow an additional 23 hours for clients to begin their update
  polling cycle.

9. WARNING: Editing the Compver.ini file incorrectly can cause serious problems
  that may orphan your clients or cause them to become out of synchronization
  with the site. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
  incorrect use of the following step can be resolved. Use this step only if
  you have the specific component version problem that is described below.

  Continue with this step only after all clients are installed. This step is
  necessary only if the early revision of the hotfix for Q240921 was previously
  applied and your SMS Client Base Component version is in the 2000 range (for
  example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;). Manually reset the component version in the
  Compver.ini file that is located in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder. Change the component
  version from 2.00.1380.2004 to 2.00.1380.1072).

Method 2: Manual Installation:

NOTE: You can use this method for both Intel-based and Alpha-based site servers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required and must
  also be downloaded from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
  folder structure intact. The Q247306.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server and can only
  be run on Intel-based machines. Refer to installation method 1 in this
  article for information about how to use the Q247306.exe file.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services by using Control
  Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. Copy the following files from the hotfix I386 folder to the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Bin\I386 folder:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Bindcli9.dll
  Bindclin.dll
  Bindsvrn.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Falclin.dll
  Mslmcli9.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Mslmsvrn.dll
  Ndscli9.dll
  Ndsclin.dll
  Ndssvrn.dll
  Odpusr32.exe
  Odpsys32.exe
  Sinv32.exe
  Smsapm32.exe

4. If Alpha-based support is enabled on the primary site, copy the following
  files from the hotfix Alpha folder to the &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Bin\Alpha folder:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Falclin.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Mslmsvrn.dll
  Odpusr32.exe
  Odpsys32.exe
  Sinv32.exe
  Smsapm32.exe

5. Copy the following files from the appropriate &lt;Platform&gt; subfolder to
  the &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder:

  Ccmcore.exe
  Clicore.exe

6. Copy the Apasetup.exe file from the appropriate &lt;Platform&gt; subfolder
  into the &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32\&lt;Platform&gt;
  folder.

7. Copy the following files from the appropriate &lt;Platform&gt; subfolder into
  the &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Hinv\&lt;Platform&gt; folder:

  Inhinv32.exe

11. WARNING: Editing the Compver.ini file incorrectly can cause serious problems
  that may orphan your clients or cause them to become out of synchronization
  with the site. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
  incorrect use of the following step can be resolved. Use this step only if
  you have the specific component version problem described below.

  If your current SMS Client Base Component version is in the 1400 range (for
  example, 2.00.1380.14&lt;xx&gt;), replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder with the Compver1405.ini
  file that is located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this
  file to Compver.ini.

12. If your current SMS Client Base Component version is in the 2000 range (for
  example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;), replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder with the Compver2.ini file
  located in the hotfix bundle source folder. Note that you must rename the
  Compver2.ini file to Compver.ini.

13. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder with the
  Compver1110.ini file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after
  renaming this file to Compver.ini.

14. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Hinv folder with the Compver1054.ini
  file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this file to
  Compver.ini.

15. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Sinv folder with the Compver1070.ini
  file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this file to
  Compver.ini.

16. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Swdist folder with the Compver1407.ini
  file located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this file to
  Compver.ini.

17. From the SMS site database server, use a SQL Server query tool (for example,
  Query Analyzer or ISQL/W) to open the 54831.sql script file. This file is
  located in the appropriate &lt;Platform&gt; folder in the hotfix subfolder
  you created in step 1.

18. Select the SMS database from within the SQL Server query tool and run the
  script. If you are using a common SQL Server computer for multiple site
  databases, apply this script to the site database that belongs to the
  primary site you are updating.

19. Restart the SMS site services. The new files are replicated to all logon
  points and CAPs. After all logon points and CAPs are updated, allow an
  additional 23 hours for clients to begin their update polling cycle.

20. Continue with this step only after all clients are installed. This step is
  necessary only if the early revision of the hotfix for Q240921 was
  previously applied and your SMS Client Base Component version is in the 2000
  range (for example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;). Manually reset the component
  version in the Compver.ini file located in the
  &lt;Drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder. Change the component
  version from 2.00.1380.2004 to 2.00.1380.1072).
