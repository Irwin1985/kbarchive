of site boundaries. The following entry may be logged by Clie&lt;x&gt;32, where
&lt;x&gt; represents the index number of the network adapter that is currently
not being used.

  Noted a transitory problem with card at index &lt;x&gt;. Marking the card as
  CLIENT_ASSIGNED

In addition, on a client that is experiencing this issue, the Control Panel tool
lists the client as being assigned to all the sites that share the logon
