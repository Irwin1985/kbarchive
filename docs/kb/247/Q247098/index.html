SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to install or reload the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) filter to turn on SSL for Web sites.

Install the Filter
------------------

The Web sites must have the Sspifilt.dll file loaded. By default, this filter is
installed with the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack for Internet Information
Server (IIS) 4.0, when you install Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 on
Microsoft Windows 2000, and when you install IIS 5.1 on Microsoft Windows XP
Professional. To find this filter, enumerate the master properties in the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

To verify the status of Sspifilt.dll, follow these steps:

IIS 4.0 and 5.0:

1. In the MMC, under Internet Information Services, right-click
  &lt;server_name&gt; and then click Properties.

2. In the Master Properties section, click WWW Service, and then click Edit.

3. On the ISAPI Filters tab, notice the direction and color of the arrow:

   - If the arrow is green and pointing up, the filter is loaded correctly.

   - If the arrow is red and pointing down, the filter is not loaded. SSL will
     not work on this server until this problem is corrected.

IIS 5.1:

1. In the MMC, under Internet Information Services, right-click Web Sites and
  then click Properties.

2. On the ISAPI Filters tab, notice the direction and color of the arrow:

   - If the arrow is green and pointing up, the filter is loaded correctly.

   - If the arrow is red and pointing down, the filter is not loaded. SSL will
     not work on this server until this problem is corrected.

If you find that the filter is not loaded, follow the steps in the Reload section
to correct this problem.

Reload the Filter
-----------------

To reload the Sspifilt.dll filter, follow these steps:

1. Remove Sspifilt.dll from the master properties. (To access the master
  properties, see the steps in the Installation section).

2. At a command prompt, type the following command to stop IIS and its dependent
  services:

  "net stop iisadmin /y" (without the quotation marks)

3. At a command prompt, type the following command to restart IIS and its
  dependent services:

  "net start w3svc" (without the quotation marks)

4. Open the master properties for the IIS server.

5. On the ISAPI filters tab, click Add. Type "SSPIFILT" (without the quotation
  marks) for the name and
  "C:\%&lt;Systemroot&gt;%\System32\Inetsrv\Sspifilt.dll" (without the
  quotation marks) for the path. By default, the status shows Unknown.

6. Stop and restart IIS and its dependent services (see steps 2 and 3).

If these steps prove unsuccessful, see the steps in the Troubleshooting section.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Check the permissions on the C:\%&lt;Systemroot&gt;%\System32\Intersrv
  folder. By default, Everyone has Change permissions; the Creator, Owner,
  Administrators, and System have Full Control permissions.

2. At a command prompt, use the "cd" (without the quotation marks) command to
  change to the C:\%&lt;systemroot&gt;%\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples
  directory, and then type the following command to check the values that are
  stored in the metabase:

  "adsutil enum\filters" (without the quotation marks)

The following output is returned:

  

  KeyType               :(String)  "IISFilters"
  FilterLoadOrder       :(String)  "sspifilt"
  [/w3svc/filters/sspifilt]

3. If this output is correct, check the values on the specific location,
  W3svc/Filters/Sspifilt. To do this, type the following command at a command
  prompt to enumerate the metabase:

  "adsutil enum w3svc/filters/sspifilt" (without the quotation marks)

This returns the following output:

  

  FilterState           :(Integer) 1 (this state shows the filter enabled)

If this procedure is not successful:

For IIS 3.0: Remove and then reinstall IIS 3.0. For additional information, click

For IIS 5.0 and 5.1: Remove and then reinstall IIS.


NOTE: For IIS 4.0, 5.0 and 5.1, you must back up the configuration of IIS before
you remove it, so that you can restore that configuration after the
reinstallation. For additional information, click the article number below to
