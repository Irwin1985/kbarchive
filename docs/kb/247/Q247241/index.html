SUMMARY
=======

WhatsThisHelp.exe is a self-extracting file that has a sample of how to use
"HTML Help" and "WinHelp" to fully utilize the Visual FoxPro help system.
Utilizing custom classes and properties, both "HTML Help" and "What's This Help"
can be implemented in Visual FoxPro.

In previous versions of Visual FoxPro, the help system was based on "WinHelp". In
Visual FoxPro version 6.0, "HTML Help" is now an option. However, "What's This
Help" with "HTML Help" does not behave as expected. This article describes the
steps necessary to implement "HTML Help" and produce the expected behavior of
"What's This Help".

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Visual FoxPro's "What's This Help" works with "HTML Help" right out of the box,
but it does not produce the expected ontext-sensitive popup text. Instead, it
displays the "What's This Help" in the HTML help browser. There are three steps
that you can follow to get the correct behavior for the help system in Visual
FoxPro.

1. To make "What's This Help" work with "HTML Help", you need to be familiar
  with both the "HTML Help" and "WinHelp" tools. You need to create two
  different help files, an HTML Help file for the detailed help and a WinHelp
  file for the "What's This Help" dialog boxes. For the "HTML Help" file, you
  do not need to create HelpContextIDs, since you will be referring directly to
  the HTML page. The other help file is created with WinHelp, and it is only
  necessary to include the popup "What's This Help" topics.

2. Create the class library necessary to run the forms. Create custom form and
  control subclasses.

  NOTE: See the following for the Property, Event or Method (PEMs)and download
  instructions for the sample files.

  Add a custom method to the form class to handle the call to the Help API. In
  the custom controls, include a property named HelpTopic. This property is
  evaluated at run-time to determine which page of the HTML help file to open.

3. Create a new form and add your form subclass to it. When prompted to create a
  formset, click Yes. Remove the other form, then the formset. Fill in the two
  custom properties "HTMLHelpFile" and "WhatsThisHelpFile". Include the path,
  if necessary, to the help files. Fill in the WhatsThisHelpID, if desired.
  Now, place some of the custom classes on the form and assign values to their
  HelpTopic and WhatsThisHelpID properties.

The following is the sample form subclass code. Use this for reference only, as
it cannot be used directly:

  *-- ParentClass:  form
