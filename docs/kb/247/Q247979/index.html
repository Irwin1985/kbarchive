SYMPTOMS
========

You are distributing an application that uses one of the MSDN programming
examples for the File System Object (FSO) when you are running an application
after installation the following error appears:

  Runtime Error '429' : ActiveX Component Can't Create Object

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because many of the MSDN code examples use late binding to the
Microsoft Scripting Runtime (the component that contains the FS0.) Because late
binding is used, a reference to the component (Scrrun.dll) is not required. When
you use the Setup Wizard or Package and Deployment Wizard to package your
application, the Wizards look at the references in the project to see which
components need to be included in the package. Because there is no reference for
this component, the component is not included, and the end result is an error
when you attempt to create an FSO.

This problem is not specific to the FSO or the Scripting Runtime. The error can
occur with any component when you use late binding. If you are using late
binding, make certain that the component you are late binding to is either
included with your application package or is already present on the target
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add a reference to SCRRUN.dll in your project and rebuild the setup package. The
scripting runtime is listed in the References dialog box as "Microsoft Scripting
Runtime."

- OR -

Rerun the PDW or Setup Wizard and manually include SCRRUN.dll.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Verify that the scripting runtime (Scrrun.dll) is present on your computer.

2. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

3. Add the following code to Form1. (This code is from a MSDN example.)

  Private Sub Form_Click()
  Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  Set a = fs.CreateTextFile("c:\testfile.txt", True)
  a.WriteLine ("This is a test.")
  a.Close
  End Sub

4. From the File Menu, save the project then chose Make Project1.exe.

5. To verify that this works, run the EXE and click on the form. You will find a
  file named Testfile.txt in you root (C:\) directory that contains the text,
  "This is a test."

6. Start the Package and Deployment Wizard, and build a setup package for
  Project1.

7. Install the application on a computer that does not have the scripting
  runtime installed.

8. Run the application, and click on Form1.

9. You should receive Error 429.
