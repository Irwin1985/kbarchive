SUMMARY
=======

DnDZoom.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to implement a drag-and-drop and
zoom operation in the ATL framework. Implementing only a drag-and-drop operation
or only zooming capabilities in an ATL control is a straightforward process.
However, when you have to implement both, a design decision needs to be made.
Here are some of the available design options:

- Provide a dedicated area in the control for initiating drag-and-drop
  operations.

- Use CTRL+DRAG to initiate a drag-and-drop operation (while a regular drag
  would still perform the zoom operation).

- Implement a smart drag-and-drop operation that determines, based on the drop
  target, whether a zoom or a drag-and-drop operation is desired.

The first two solutions have obvious shortcomings. DnDZoom.exe implements the
third solution: when the mouse is released outside of the control a
drag-and-drop operation is performed. However, when the mouse is released inside
the control, a zoom operation is completed.

The sample illustrates how a control, by implementing both a drop source and a
drop target can determine whether a zoom operation is desired, or a
drag-and-drop operation on a different drop target should be performed. In
addition, the control is still able to distinguish between simple mouse clicks
in the control, a drag-and-drop/zoom operation being initiated, and a
drag-and-drop versus a zoom operation being performed.

Also, the DragDropZoom() function implemented by the control can take a bit flag
to signify whether a zoom operation is possible or not based on some external
conditions. When you use this member function and the bit flag, a handler for
the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message could be written as the following:

     LRESULT CDnDCtrl::OnLButtonDown(UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam, BOOL&amp; bHandled)
     {
  	DWORD dwEffect;

  	IDataObject *pDataObject;
  	IDropSource *pDropSource;
  	QueryInterface(__uuidof(IDataObject), reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;pDataObject));
  	QueryInterface(__uuidof(IDropSource), reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;pDropSource));
  		
  	DoDragDropZoom(
  		pDataObject,
  		pDropSource, 
  		DROPEFFECT_COPY | DROPEFFECT_MOVE | (m_bEnableZoom ? DROPEFFECT_ZOOM : 0), 
  		&amp;dwEffect
  	);

  	if (dwEffect == DROPEFFECT_MOVE)
  		put_Content(NULL);

  	// Clean up:
  	pDataObject-&gt;Release();
  	pDropSource-&gt;Release();

  	return 0;

     }

The member function DoDragDropZoom() then calls virtual member functions
OnMouseClick(), OnZoom() or OnDrop() depending on the outcome of the drag drop
operation.
