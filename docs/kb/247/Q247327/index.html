SYMPTOMS
========

After you add resources to a cluster server with many resources (close to 1,600
or more), the Cluster service may start and appear to function but you may be
unable to start Cluster Administrator. You may still be able to ping cluster IP
addresses, connect to some virtual servers, and so on. Virtual servers other
than the server with the cluster name may be available to connect to by using
UNC paths, but not the cluster name itself. Attempting to connect to Cluster
Administrator by using the "." option may or may not start Cluster
administrator. If Cluster Administrator does start this way, it will likely stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

There is a "functional" limitation to the number of resources Cluster Server can
support. For additional information, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q185212 Cluster Server Does Not Support More than 900 Shares

Cluster Server can only support 1,600 resources. However, it does not prevent you
from adding more resources when you reach the resource limit. By adding more
resources, you run the risk of unpredictable behavior, including but not limited
to: resources stopping and coming back online for no reason, virtual servers
suddenly not starting, virtual servers stopping for no reason, and the inability
to administer the cluster by using Cluster Administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two methods to work around this behavior.

Method 1
--------

Shut down one node and stop the Cluster service on the other (running) node.
Then, recover the Clusdb file from a tape backup that was created when you were
able to use Cluster Administrator. Note that all changes to the cluster that
have been made since that point are lost. You should restart the Cluster service
with the -fixquorum option or rename the current Chkpoint files from the MSCS
folder on the quorum drive.

Method 2
--------

Manually remove resources until you can once again administer the cluster by
using Cluster Administrator. This may require a few deletions or several
hundred. To manually remove resources from the command line, you need to first
stop the resource and then delete it. There is no wildcard for deleting
resources; you must delete them one at a time. The commands to stop and delete
resources are:

  cluster [&lt;cluster_name&gt;] res [&lt;resource_name&gt;] /off

  cluster [&lt;cluster_name&gt;] res [&lt;resource_name&gt;] /del

STATUS
======

This behavior is a side-effect of putting too many resources on a cluster
server. There is no resolution other than to stay below the 1,600-resource
limit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is a direct result of having a functional limit to the maximum
possible resources instead of a physical limit. The most common occurrence of
this behavior occurs on cluster servers that have many file shares (possibly for
user home folders and roaming profiles). Instead of having hundreds or thousands
of individual resources for all the file shares, use the advanced sharing option
that was introduced in Service Pack 4. For additional information, click the
