IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to configure a computer that is running
Internet Information Services (IIS) to allow server-to-server FTP transfers by
modifying values in the system registry.

NOTE: By default, these values are disabled to prevent malicious attacks against
the file transfer protocol (FTP) service. Although details for configuring
server-to-server transfers are listed in this article, Microsoft does not
recommend modifying these registry keys on IIS-based FTP servers that are
connected to the Internet.

Requirements
------------

The following list outlines the recommended hardware, software, network
infrastructure, and service packs that are required:

- Two computers that are running the IIS FTP Service, with the configured
  changes that are described in the "Server Configuration" section.
- A third computer with the command-line FTP that is included with Microsoft
  Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me),
  Microsoft Windows NT, and Microsoft Windows 2000, or another FTP client that
  supports issuing literal FTP commands.

Server Configuration
--------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

IIS 5.0:

1. Set the following value in the registry on both FTP servers to allow
  server-to-server FTP transfers when you issue commands from a client that is
  not located on either of the two FTP servers:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSFTPSVC\Parameters\EnablePortAttack
  = 1

2. Set the following value in the registry on the server that will issue the
  literal port command (Client1 in the example):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSFTPSVC\Parameters\EnablePASVTheft
  = 1

NOTE: By default, this value does not exist in the registry, and it requires
Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or later to be recognized.

IIS 4.0:

1. Set the following value in the registry on the server that will issue the
  literal port command (Client1 in the example) to allow server-to-server FTP
  transfers when you issue commands from a client that is not located on either
  of the two FTP servers:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSFTPSVC\Parameters\EnablePortAttack
  = 1

2. If you are using IIS 4.0 computers that are running Windows NT 4.0 Service
  Pack 6a or earlier, install the fix that is described in the following
  Microsoft Knowledge Base article to allow the EnablePortAttack registry key
  to function properly:

  Q246173 FTP Server Does Not Allow FTP Server-to-Server Connection

Example
-------

In typical client/server FTP transfers, the user is only responsible for sending
"friendly" commands to the server; the client responds automatically. When a
server-to-server FTP transfer is performed, another server is the client.
Therefore, the user is responsible for sending all FTP commands to both servers
(in RFC959 format, these are preceded by the "literal" keyword).

To transfer a binary file (named myFile.xls) from Server1 (IP address:
192.168.0.10) to Server2 (IP address: 192.168.1.20) by using the command-line
FTP client on Workstation1, follow these steps:

NOTE: You must have Write permissions enabled on Server2 for this example to
work.

1. Connect to Server1 by using a command-line FTP client. (This connection will
  be referred to as Client1).

2. Connect to Server2 by using a command-line FTP client. (This connection will
  be referred to as Client2).

3. Issue the following command in Client2:

  literal pasv

  The response is as follows:

  227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,1,20,15,61)

  Note that 15,61 represents the low and high order bytes of the port number
  (port 3901 in this case), which is randomly assigned with each FTP
  connection. As a result, the last two numbers of this string are different.

4. Issue the following command in Client1:

  literal port 192,168,1,20,15,61

  The response is as follows:

  200 Port Command Successful

  Use the IP and port string that is returned in step 3.

5. Issue the following command in both Client1 and Client2:

  literal type i

  The response is as follows:

  200 Type set to I

6. Issue the following command in Client1:

  literal retr myFile.xls

  The response is as follows:

  125 Data Connection already open; Transfer Starting

7. Issue the following command in Client2:

  literal stor myFile.xls

  The response is as follows:

  Opening BINARY mode data connection for myFile.xls

8. Continue to issue the following command on Client2 until you receive a 211
  "No data connection" response message:

  literal stat

  This 211 response message is several lines long and indicates that the
  transfer is no longer in progress.

To transfer files from Server2 to Server1, issue the literal retr command from
Client1 and the literal stor command from Client2.
