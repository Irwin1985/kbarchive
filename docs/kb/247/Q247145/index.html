-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to rehome a public folder to a server in another site, you may
receive the following error message:

  Microsoft Exchange Server is unable to rehome the selected public folder.
  Ensure that the Limit administrative access to home site option
  is not set for this public folder, and that the server you are currently
  connected to supports RPC network connections to the new home
  server.

This error message contains one of the following ID numbers:

  ID no: c1040af3

  - or -

  ID no: c1040af5

CAUSE
=====

If you receive an error message that contains ID number c1040af3, you do not
have Service Account Administrator permissions for the remote Exchange Server
site to which you are rehoming the public folder.

If you receive an error message that contains ID number c1040af5, one of the
following conditions exists:

- The Exchange Server computer in the destination site is located in a domain
  that does not trust the domain that you are logged on to when you attempt to
  change the Home Server attribute of the public folder.

- In User Manager on the remote computer, the user right to "Access this
  Computer from the Network" has been taken away from the Everyone group, and
  neither your account nor a global group that your account belongs to has been
  granted the user right to "Access this Computer from the Network."

- There is no remote procedure call (RPC) connectivity between the current home
  server and the intended home server.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Exchange Server rights, Windows NT user rights, or network connectivity
prevent you from rehoming the public folder from the home site, have a Service
Account Administrator in the destination site where the replica exists rehome
the folder. This resolves the problem if the folder does not have the "Limit
Administrative Access to Home Site" option enabled. You do not need Exchange
Server rights or Windows NT rights to the computer where the public folder is
currently homed to pull the Home Server attribute from the server and site where
a replica exists.

For example, if an organization contains the following sites, servers, and public
folders:

  Site_A
  Server_A
  Folder_A

  Site_B
  Server_B
  replica of Folder_A

From Server_B, you can rehome the replica of Folder_A to Server_B without any
connectivity or rights to Server_A if the Limit Administrative Access to Home
Site option is not set on the folder.
