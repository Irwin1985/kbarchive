-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages appear to be properly delivered, but are silently deleted by the
information store when the message transfer agent (MTA) is not started or the
information store loses session to the MTA. In the client, the message appears
to be properly delivered because the message leaves the Outbox and becomes
visible in the Sent Items folder.

CAUSE
=====

This issue was introduced when fixing the issue outlined in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q235455 XCON: Modification in X.400 Blind Copy Implementation

If an MTA session is not available because of insufficient resources in the MTA
or because the MTA service is currently stopped, the number of MTA recipients is
incorrectly set to zero. This causes the message to be deleted from the queue in
the information store.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q244976 XADM: Event ID 1197 and 1005 When Starting the Information Store

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 SP3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue occurs under the following conditions:

- If a message is handed off from the information store to the MTA (information
  store-side fix).

- If the MTA is running as well.

- If the system is under stress.

This issue is not in any way related to blind carbon copy (Bcc) messages,
although the issue was introduced while modifying Bcc message behavior.

NOTE: This issue does not occur on dedicated message switches (if a message never
reaches the information store). Outbound Internet mail is not affected (it never
reaches the MTA) but inbound Internet mail is (because it runs through the
information store for content conversion).
