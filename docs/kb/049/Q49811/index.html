SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the network adapter ROM requirements to initiate the
Remote Initial Program Load (RPL) service on an OS/2 LAN Manager server in order
to boot MS-DOS or OS/2 over the network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.0 RPL service allows personal computer
"requesting devices" to boot OS/2 or MS-DOS from a network server "loading
device."

Instead of booting MS-DOS or OS/2 from the local disk drive, the requesting
device attaches to the network and broadcasts a boot request. The boot request
must be functionally compatible with the SEND.FILE.REQUEST frame, which is sent
by the IBM Remote Program Load Module. The IBM Remote Program Load Module is an
optional ROM chip attached to an IBM token ring network adapter. The request is
sent using frames in IEEE 802.2 format encapsulated in token ring or Ethernet
packets.

Before an OS/2 LAN Manager server can respond to the request, it must be running
the RIPL service and must be configured to accept boot requests from the
requesting device. When a valid boot request is received from a requesting
device, the RIPL server sends the appropriate boot image to the device. Once the
boot image has been transferred, the requesting device transfers control to the
boot image.

The following sequence describes how LAN Manager supports remoteboot for a
workstation with an RPL ROM installed.

                                    Loading Device (OS/2 LAN
Requesting Device (with Remote        Manager with RIPL service
Program Load Module installed)        installed)
----------------------------------    -------------------------
                                     1. OS/2, LAN Manager, and the
                                        RIPL services are loaded and
                                        active. The RIPL service
                                        waits for a FIND frame
                                        from a requesting device.

2. After power-on, the IBM Remote
  Program Load Module attaches to
  the ring and sends a FIND frame
  to a loading device that includes
  its network address.

                                     3. The FIND frame is received,
                                        and a FOUND frame is sent
                                        back to the requesting
                                        device that includes the
                                        network address of the
                                        loading device.

4. The FOUND frame is received,
  and a SEND.FILE.REQUEST frame
  (requesting the boot image) is
  sent back to the loading device.

                                     5. The SEND.FILE.REQUEST is
                                        received. The RIPL service
                                        validates the machine
                                        request, then sends the
                                        appropriate boot image
                                        (either MS-DOS or OS/2),
                                        depending on the RIPL
                                        configuration specified
                                        for the machine by the LAN
                                        administrator.

6. Once the SEND.FILE.REQUEST has
  been completed, control is passed
  to the boot image, which then
  performs all necessary initialization
  under either MS-DOS or OS/2.

Below is a list of available IBM products that describe the operation of the IBM
Remote Program Load ROM and provide sample source code for server-based
bootstrap and loader programs under MS-DOS. Please note that the bootstrap and
loader programs described in the IBM products are replaced by OS/2 LAN Manager
version 2.0 RIPL and OEM-adapted RIPL DLLs (dynamic-link libraries) for the OS/2
remote boot.
