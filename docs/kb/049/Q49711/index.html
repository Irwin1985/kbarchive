As specified in the README.TXT file on Disk 2 of the companion disks
to the "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference" (a Microsoft Press
release, 1989), the MOUSE routine in MOUSE.LIB has been changed to
MOUSES (and to MOUSEL, which is not mentioned in the README.TXT).
MOUSES and MOUSEL are the small- and large-model implementations of
mouse calls, respectively, and are contained in MOUSE.LIB, which comes
on the companion disks.

The change of MOUSE to MOUSES affects QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 examples in the "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference" that
call MOUSE through building the QBMOUSE.QLB file (using MOUSE.LIB).
After creating the QBMOUSE.QLB and trying to execute QBMOU.BAS,
MOUSE.BAS, PENCIL.BAS, or QBTEST.BAS (from the disk or book), the
following QuickBASIC error occurs on reference to MOUSE:

   "Subprogram not defined"

This error occurs because there is no routine named MOUSE in
MOUSE.LIB. To work around this problem, change the CALL (or implied
CALL) and DECLARE statements from MOUSE to MOUSES or MOUSEL.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 and to Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.00, and 6.00b for MS-DOS, and
Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00 for MS-DOS.

The following specific corrections apply to "Microsoft Mouse
Programmer's Reference" (published by Microsoft Press, 1989):

1. On Pages 220, 222, 223, and in MOUSE.BAS on the companion disk,
   change all occurrences of

      CALL MOUSE(m1%, m2%, m3%, m4%)   ' Gives "Subprogram not defined"

   to the following:

      CALL MOUSES(m1%, m2%, m3%, m4%)  ' Small-model mouse CALL works OK
   or
      CALL MOUSEL(m1%, m2%, m3%, m4%)  ' Large-model mouse CALL works OK

2. On Pages 212, 213, 214, and in QBMOU.BAS, QBTEST.BAS, and
   PENCIL.BAS on the companion disk, change all occurrences of

      MOUSE m1, m2, m3, m4         ' Gives "Subprogram not defined"

   to the following:

      MOUSES m1, m2, m3, m4        ' Implicit CALL OK
   or
      MOUSEL m1, m2, m3, m4        ' Implicit CALL OK

3. On Pages 214 and 221, and in the QBMOU.BAS, MOUSE.BAS, PENCIL.BAS,
   and QBTEST.BAS programs on the companion disk, change the DECLARE
   SUB MOUSE statements to DECLARE SUB MOUSES or DECLARE SUB MOUSEL.

Recommended Method to Call Mouse Functions
------------------------------------------

As an alternative to linking with the MOUSE.LIB library that is
provided with the "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference," Microsoft
recommends the BASIC procedure below to provide the mouse interface.
This routine uses the CALL INTERRUPT statement to access the mouse via
interrupt 51.

DEFINT A-Z
REM $INCLUDE: 'QB.BI'
REM When using this code in BASIC PDS 7.00, it is necessary
REM to include the 'QBX.BI' file instead of QB.BI.
SUB mouse (m0, m1, m2, m3) STATIC
DIM inregs AS RegType, outregs AS RegType
    inregs.ax = m0    'Load the registers
    inregs.bx = m1
    inregs.cx = m2
    inregs.dx = m3
    CALL INTERRUPT(51, inregs, outregs)
    m0 = outregs.ax
    m1 = outregs.bx   'Return values from driver
    m2 = outregs.cx
    m3 = outregs.dx
END SUB
