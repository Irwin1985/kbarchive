Protected-mode CodeView (CVP) Version 2.30 allows debugging of dynamic
link libraries (DLLs) by specifying their names on the command line
with the /L switch. Because of a problem exclusive to CVP 2.30, this
particular version of the debugger does not allow a pathname to be
used with /L to specify the DLL's location in another directory.
Therefore, all DLLs to be debugged with CVP 2.30 must reside in the
current working directory.

Since DLLs are also required to be in a directory that is on the
LIBPATH, two copies of the DLL may need to be resident on the disk,
unless the current working directory is also a LIBPATH directory.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CodeView Version
2.30. We are researching this problem and will post new information as
it becomes available.

When tracing a program under CodeView that calls DLLs, the only way to
trace into the code of a particular DLL is if the DLL was specified
ahead of time on the command line with /L when CVP was invoked. If a
program statement is traced that calls a DLL that was not specified by
/L, then CodeView executes all the code in the DLL and returns control
back at the line following the call to the DLL. Thus, the call is
handled as if the step command, rather than the trace command, had
been used.

You can indicate only one DLL with the /L switch, so debugging
multiple DLLs requires multiple /L switches. Normally, the switch is
followed by a space and the name of the DLL to be debugged, and if the
DLL is not located in the current directory, a path may precede the
DLL name. It is only with CVP 2.30 that this becomes a problem because
a pathname is not recognized with this version, so tracing into the
DLL is prevented.

Unfortunately, CodeView does not display error messages for improper
use of the /L switch, so if the DLL is not found, there is no message
indicating this. Instead, CodeView does not allow debugging of the
improperly specified DLL. Use of a pathname with /L with CVP 2.30
causes this same behavior.

The only workaround for DLL debugging with CVP 2.30 is to keep a copy
of the DLL in the current working directory from which CodeView is
invoked. Thus, if the current directory is not a directory specified
on the LIBPATH, there must be two copies of the DLL on the disk. It is
very important that the two copies are exactly the same because
differing code makes any attempts at debugging very difficult and
confusing.

A common practice is to put a period (.) as the first directory on
the LIBPATH because this makes the current working directory a LIBPATH
directory, eliminating the need for two copies of the DLL. More
information on this practice can be found by querying on the
following words:
