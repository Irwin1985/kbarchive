SERVER BUGS FIXED IN MAIL 3.2A
------------------------------

PC Adm: Microsoft Mail ADMIN.EXE 3.2.12 Update:

  Q107443

File Updated/Modified: ADMIN.EXE

- With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt .MAI file could be created
  when you export the address list to a large number of postoffices. ADMIN.EXE
  has been modified so that the correct .MAI file is created when address lists
  are exported.

- With the earlier version of this file, a corrupt SRVCONF.GLB file could be
  created when you add a Directory Synchronization (Dir- Sync) requestor on a
  computer that has an EtherExpress(TM) 16 network card and is running the
  Ethernet_II protocol. ADMIN.EXE has been modified so that it uses a buffer
  size of 512 bytes instead of 1K for its buffered I/O.

- If a Mail Remote for Windows user forgets his or her password or if the
  password is changed while the remote driver is in use, the password can now
  be reset.

  NOTE: To reset the password, you must ensure that the user's data disk was
  created using ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.9 or later.

- Local postoffice users added with the ADMIN.EXE utility will no longer be
  assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file is locked open.
  Also, batch creation of local postoffice users with the ADMIN.EXE utility
  while the TID.GLB file is locked open no longer results in the same invalid
  identification number being assigned to multiple users.

- When you use ADMIN.EXE to change the routing type defined for a hub
  postoffice, the routing type definition for any downstream postoffice is also
  updated to match the routing type of the hub postoffice.

- When you use ADMIN.EXE to remove users from a global group, access to group
  folders associated with that global group is also removed.

- Correct figures are now reported when you use the Mail Administrator program
  to create reports that involve multiple postoffices with more than 32,768
  users.

PC Adm: Removed User Still Has Access to Group Folder:

  Q105967

File Updated/Modified: ADMIN.EXE

With versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, a user
removed from a Global group may still have access to any group folders
associated with that Global group.

A Global group is defined as a group that is created from the Mail Administrator
program (ADMIN.EXE) and that is available in the postoffice address list (POL).

PC Ext: EXTERNAL.EXE 3.2.13 Update:

  Q111558

File Updated/Modified: EXTERNAL.EXE

- NetBIOS notification does not work when the sender and receiver are on
  different postoffices and there are multiple External Mail programs running.
  The only time notification works is if the first External Mail program that
  was started up dispatches mail between the sender's and receiver's
  postoffices.

- On Novell(R) networks, the RNETWORK.GLB file is not updated at 4:00 A.M. on
  any drives that are dynamically attached.

- In low-memory conditions, the External Mail program deletes mail from the
  outgoing mail queue without returning that mail to the sender. There are
  error messages in the SESSION.LOG and SYSTEM.LOG, but the mail file is still
  deleted. In most cases, the sender is not notified that the mail was not
  delivered. With the updated External Mail program, the mail message is not
  deleted but remains in the outgoing queue, and the External Mail program
  still attempts to deliver the mail. Because there is not enough memory to
  return the message to the sender, there is no entry in the SYSTEM.LOG. The
  administrator can return the mail from the queue.

- When the EXTERNAL.INI parameter MinKDiskFull is not included in the
  EXTERNAL.INI file, the default value of 0 is used. This causes the External
  Mail program to attempt to deliver mail to a postoffice that has no disk
  space. The default value for MinKDiskFull has now been changed from 0 to
  100K.

- When the External Mail program marks a dynamic drive as being full (no disk
  space), it is not checked again until the External Mail program is restarted.
  The External Mail program now checks dynamic drives that are full on every
  cycle and changes their status if disk space becomes available.

- Messages transferred asynchronously or through an X.25 connection do not get
  time stamped. Therefore, when you view the received message in Mail for
  Windows, the received date/time is actually the date/time it was composed,
  not the date/time it was received by External. The External Mail program now
  time stamps all messages.

- The External Mail program sometimes hangs when CommType=X25EICON. The
  CommType setting can be specified in the .INI file or on the command line for
  External.

- Versions 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 of the External Mail program mark a static drive as
  being full (no disk space) and the drive is not checked again until the
  External Mail program is restarted. The External Mail program now checks
  static drives that are full on every cycle and changes their status if disk
  space becomes available.

- Mail sent to Remote Mail users would not be recorded in the SENT.LOG file if
  the LogSent option was specified in the EXTERNAL.INI file or if the -ms
  command-line option was included when the External Mail program was started.
  Version 3.2.9 of the External Mail program will correctly log mail sent to
  Remote Mail users in the SENT.LOG file.

- When the Import utility is run with the autocreate function, and the External
  Mail program is also run against the same postoffice across a wide-area
  network (WAN) connection or in a high mail traffic situation, the Import
  utility may report "Fatal [59] Error autocreating postoffice: XXXXXXXXXX."
  This error occurs because of .XTN file contention between the External Mail
  program and the Import utility. Under normal circumstances, the External Mail
  program holds an .XTN file open for a very short interval and file contention
  is not an issue. Version 3.2.9 of the External Mail program now allows the
  Import utility to have write access to the .XTN file.

- The External Mail program now determines and uses the appropriate
  international date format when the MS-DOS country command is used in the
  CONFIG.SYS file of the workstation running External.

- The MinKDiskFull and MinKDiskNotFull parameters and their specified values
  are now recorded in the SESSION.LOG file and are displayed on screen in the
  External Mail program's LAN Postoffice Mail Activity display area when you
  use EXTERNAL.INI file entries and the undocumented -q1 command-line switch.
  Previously, logging of these parameters and their specified values would only
  occur when you used command-line parameters and the undocumented -q1 command-
  line switch.

PC Ext: Err Msg: Retry Count Exceeded:

  Q113165

File Updated/Modified: EXTERNAL.EXE

With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when EXTERNAL.EXE cannot
deliver mail to a *.MAI file, the following error message appears:

  Retry count exceeded

External generates this error after it has tried to deliver the message three
times. It takes approximately 16 minutes to make the three attempts. If the file
remains locked, External's copy of the message is destroyed. You can tell this
problem has occurred by looking in the sending postoffice's SESSION.LOG and
SYSTEM.LOG files for "Retry Count Exceeded" and "Missing Message File"
messages.

PC Adm: IMPORT.EXE 3.2.9 Update:

  Q111556

File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE

- The Import utility (with the -A option) no longer adds invalid DGN names to
  the Postoffice Address List (POL) when those names do not appear in the
  normal .USR files.

- The Import utility no longer corrupts the MCI.NME file when importing MCI
  user names. This problem caused the Mail Administrator program to incorrectly
  display the MCI address information.

- The Import utility no longer stops responding (hangs) when it processes
  RESYNC.GLB after doing heavy processing.

- The Import utility now updates FLAG.GLB when it runs, causing the External
  Mail program to update its address lists on the next cycle interval.

- The Import utility no longer does 1-byte reads of the template files.

- When it is importing modified SNADS template information, the Import utility
  no longer incorrectly sequences the information.

- When you use the Import utility to modify a user's configuration (any option
  set with an "&amp;") and that user has remote access, the user's remote
  access ability is no longer removed.

- When you use the Modify transaction type to update a user in the POL but you
  do not make any changes to the user's alias, the user's record is no longer
  deleted.

- When you use the -A command-line option to modify template information, the
  Import utility no longer increases the size of the associated .INF file on
  each pass. The Import utility now creates a new .INF file that incorporates
  the changes rather than appending the changes to the existing .INF file.

- When you use the Import utility to change a user's mailbox name, Error
  34--"Could not access log information file"--no longer occurs when you start
  the MS-DOS client.

- Deleting a local user with Import no longer leaves the user's folder files
  (.IDX and .FLD) orphaned in the FOLDERS\LOC\0000???? subdirectory of the Mail
  database.

- A Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 PROXYNET\PROXYPO postoffice address list is
  now propagated to a downstream requestor postoffice when the gateway
  postoffice is also the directory server postoffice. The Import utility now
  copies FFAPI postoffice address lists from the directory server to the
  GLB\RESYNC.GLB file to perform a directory synchronization manual import
  procedure.

- Local postoffice users added with the Import utility will no longer be
  assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file is locked open.
  Also, batch creation of local postoffice users with the Import utility while
  the TID.GLB file is locked open no longer results in the same invalid
  identification number being assigned to multiple users.

- Trap D errors or "An OS/2 program caused a protection violation" error no
  longer occurs under OS/2(R) or under the OS/2 subsystem of Windows NT(TM)
  when you use the Import utility with the -ST command- line option.

- The Import utility now creates unique mailbag numbers when you add local
  postoffice users, even if the CONTROL.GLB file has been reset to zero.

PC Adm: Deleting Users w/IMPORT Leaves Orphaned Folders, .IDXs:

  Q117197

File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE

When you use the IMPORT utility (IMPORT.EXE) included with versions 3.0 and 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to delete users from the local postoffice, the
users are deleted from the database; however, their folders and .IDX files
remain.

PC Adm: IMPORT .INF File Size Increases When IMPORT -A Is Used:

  Q117198

File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE

When you use the IMPORT utility (IMPORT.EXE) included with versions 3.0 and 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to modify users with template information, the
size of the .INF file for this address list doubles in size each time IMPORT.EXE
is used.

PC Adm: Err: Modifying Mailbox Name Causes Notice 34 &amp; 127:

  Q117259

File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE

When you use the IMPORT utility (IMPORT.EXE) included with versions 3.0 and 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to modify a local postoffice user's mailbox
name, the user will receive the following error when he or she logs in to the
MS-DOS client:

  Notice 34 Could not access log information file.

Furthermore, if this modified user tries to access any MS-DOS client folders, he
or she will receive the following error message:

  Notice 127 Private Folder Index Missing.

The user will not be able to access, store mail in, or view his or her private
MS-DOS folders.

PC Adm: IMPORT.EXE Does Not Recover from Reset CONTROL.GLB:

  Q117738

File Updated/Modified: IMPORT.EXE

The IMPORT.EXE utility provided with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks versions 3.0
and 3.2 does not properly recover after the CONTROL.GLB file is reset (bytes set
to zero). If the administrator uses IMPORT.EXE to add users to the local
postoffice after a CONTROL.GLB reset, these new users receive the same
hexadecimal identifiers (hex-IDs) as existing users.

PC Adm: Microsoft Mail MOVEUSER.EXE Version 3.2.8 Update:

  Q118510

File Updated/Modified: MOVEUSER.EXE

- Users moved from one postoffice to another postoffice with the MOVEUSER
  utility are assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file on
  the destination postoffice is locked open. Moving multiple users while the
  TID.GLB file is locked open results in the same invalid identification number
  being assigned to multiple users. When Mail is addressed to one of these
  users, the other users with the same invalid identification number also get
  added to the recipients list. To avoid this problem, the MOVEUSER version
  3.2.8 update will not move a user if the TID.GLB file is locked open.

PC DirSync: REBUILD.EXE 3.2.4 Update:

  Q111701

File Updated/Modified: REBUILD.EXE

On MS-DOS and Macintosh workstations, the GALNETPO.GLB file is regenerated while
REBUILD.EXE is running.


PC DirSync: Bad CRC Causes No Error; Corrupted Data in SRVCONF:

File Updated/Modified: REQMAIN.EXE

The following two problems can occur:

- When a bad CRC is found in the Dir-Sync attachment (.ATT) file, no error
  message is generated.

- When you use certain brands of network cards and Novell NetWare version 3.x,
  the first 6 bytes of the SRVCONF.GLB file are corrupted. This problem does
  not occur under all circumstances and is not consistent among operating
  systems. The next time SRVMAIN.EXE runs, it will fail because of the
  corrupted data.


PC DirSync: SRVMAIN.EXE 3.2.9 Update:

  Q111703

File Updated/Modified: SRVMAIN.EXE

- The Import utility no longer stops responding (hangs) when it processes
  RESYNC.GLB after doing heavy processing. This problem occurred because the
  heap became corrupted when it was under a heavy load.

- The Srvmain utility no longer does one-byte reads of the template files.

- A Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 PROXYNET\PROXYPO postoffice address list is
  now propagated to a downstream requestor postoffice when the gateway
  postoffice is also the directory server postoffice. The Import utility now
  copies FFAPI postoffice address lists from the directory server to the
  GLB\RESYNC.GLB file to perform a directory synchronization manual import
  procedure.

PC DirSync: FFAPI ProxyNet/ProxyPO Not Included in Import:

File Updated/Modified: SRVMAIN.DLL

If an administrator to a new Mail for PC Networks postoffice requests an import
(by selecting Admin, Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Import) from the server
running directory synchronization (Dir-Sync), the new postoffice will not
receive the ProxyNet/ProxyPO names if the Dir-Sync server is also the Mail
Connection 3.2 gateway postoffice.

CLIENT BUGS FIXED IN MAIL 3.2A
------------------------------


PC Win: Network Error Using Mail Conversion Program:

  Q97734

File Updated/Modified: CONVERT.EXE

When you use version 3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Conversion Program to convert Mail
2.x folders to Mail 3.0 or 3.2, CONVERT.EXE may report a network error and then
exit.


PC Adm: Microsoft Mail MAILMGR.DLL Version 3.2.0.4074 Update:

  Q120448

File Updated/Modified: MAILMGR.DLL

- The Check Names function fails to properly resolve partial friendly names and
  returns several selections when a unique resolution is possible. This
  behavior is most obvious when the GAL is selected as the default address list
  and the first and last name of the intended recipient begin with the same
  letter.

PC MAPI: WA0729: Microsoft Mail Simple MAPI Update:

  Q95522

File Updated/Modified: MAPI.DLL

- Deleting a message in a shared folder does not function as expected; the
  message in the folder is deleted, but the header still appears. If you select
  the header to bring up the message, Mail for Windows returns a dialog box
  that says "The message cannot be accessed." Also, if you change a message in
  any way, the message becomes inaccessible.

- Reply, Reply All, and Forward commands on customer messages in shared folders
  fail if these commands are called from Mail for Windows. This problem occurs
  because the client hands off the temporary message ID of the shared folder,
  instead of the permanent shared-folder message ID.

- To correctly launch e-forms, Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer requires
  that the message type it gives to Simple MAPI be preserved in the delivered
  message. However, the message type is not encoded in WINMAIL.DAT by default,
  so it is lost across gateways. Therefore, the message is received and
  displayed as a note rather than as a Microsoft electronic form.

PC MAPI: Errors When Compiling Sample in Visual Basic:

  Q115164

File Updated/Modified: MAPI.DLL

You may receive errors when you attempt to compile the Visual Basic Sample MAPI
application included on the Technical Reference disk that is provided with
version 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows.

PC Win: WA0889: Mail for MSMAIL.EXE 3.20.4037 Update:

  Q111557

File Updated/Modified: MSMAIL.EXE

- When an open custom message is deleted from a shared folder, the message
  header still appears in the folder. Trying to open the message again results
  in the error "The message cannot be accessed."

- You cannot do a Reply, Reply All, or Forward on a custom message that is
  located in a shared folder.

PC Win: Mail for Windows MSSFS.DLL 3.2.0.4074 Update:

  Q96694

File Updated/Modified: MSSFS.DLL

The following problems can occur when you use version 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for
Windows:

- When you send mail to an external postoffice group or gateway group that
  contains extended characters in the address, Mail for Windows does not
  convert from code page 850 to the ANSI code page when it reads the records
  from the NETPO.GLB file or any other gateway address file.

- External postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and nodes for PROFS(R) and OfficeVision(R)
  are not displayed in alphabetic order because Mail for Windows reads them in
  one at a time and adds them to the hierarchy. With the updated version of
  MSSFS.DLL, Mail for Windows reads them in all at once, sorts them, and adds
  them to the hierarchy.

- An "Unknown user" error may occur when you send a message. Mail for Windows
  caches only the first 8170 bytes of the NETWORK.GLB file and loses the rest.
  Postoffices and gateways that are defined past 8170 bytes are ignored;
  therefore, you cannot send messages to the users on those postoffices or
  gateways.

- The simple MAPI command MAPILogon() does a case-sensitive match on the user
  name and password; however, Microsoft Mail is not case sensitive. This
  problem occurs only if a MAPI session was already established when
  MAPILogon() is called.

- Incorrect message dates are displayed. When parsing old A.M./P.M. style dates
  (generated from some gateways), Mail for Windows adds 12 to the time if it is
  P.M. However, if the message was sent during the noon hour, the time is
  incorrectly read as 24:xx. Because this is an invalid time, the date is set
  to the programmer's birthday (12/16/68).

- Mail for Windows may cause a general protection (GP) fault when it encounters
  a corrupt .XTN file in the database. It does not properly handle .XTN files
  that are an incorrect size.

The following problems can occur when you use version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows:

- Mail for Windows cannot view templates of SNADS or PROFS users when GALONLY=1
  is set in the MSMAIL.INI file.

- When you read a custom message from a shared folder, the wrong date is
  displayed.

- In version 3.0b of Mail for Windows, the time stamp associated with resolved
  addresses is not saved correctly: if the Global Address List (GAL) was built
  twice in the same day, any mail addressed but not sent before the second
  rebuild could be misdirected. This problem was partially corrected in version
  3.2 of Mail for Windows: the time stamp is saved correctly, thus reducing the
  time frame in which this problem could occur from one day to one clock hour.
  However, mail may still be misdirected at sites where GAL rebuilds are made
  within the same clock hour.

- All users running Windows from a shared installation point must use the same
  postoffice when they use Advanced Security. This problem occurs because the
  MAIL.DAT file is saved to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, which is shared
  among all users running Windows from the same location. The client now checks
  both the WINDOWS (user's local directory) and WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories, in
  that order, for the MAIL.DAT file.

- Duplicate addresses are added to the Personal Address Book (PAB).

- If users are running Mail for Windows from a shared installation point and
  the NETBIOS=1 flag is set in the MSMAIL.INI file, Mail checks the size, date,
  and time of the MSMAIL.INI file every 5 seconds. Because the .INI file is on
  the network, frames are sent to the server to check the size of the file
  every 5 seconds, thus increasing traffic on the network. These checks no
  longer occur with this update.

- When an urgent message is sent to an external user with NetBIOS notification
  in use, Mail for Windows does not send a NetBIOS datagram to the External
  Mail program. This process does work correctly when an urgent message is sent
  to a local user. When sending urgent messages, Mail for Windows now sends
  notifications to the External Mail program when NetBIOS notification is in
  use.

- MACBinary II attachments are not recognized when originating from external
  Mail Systems.

- When sending mail such that the number of recipients is greater than 200
  (exact number depends on the specific address list), the body of the message
  will be missing.

- When "Add recipients to Personal Address Book" is selected, the GAL.NME file
  is locked open each time a global address list name is added to a compose
  note.

- In certain situations, viewing details of an external name from a group
  results in the error message: "A GLB file on your server is corrupt."

- If a message has more than 22 recipients selected from the GAL and that
  message is stored in a shared folder, the message appears to be corrupted.
  Attempting to open the message from the shared folder results in the error:
  "Mail system error, Mail could not read the entire message from the Post
  Office. Some parts of the message may be missing. Ask the sender to resend
  the message."

- Under certain conditions, a general protection (GP) fault can occur in
  MSSFS.DLL when the MAPILogon() function is used to begin a session with the
  messaging system.

- The Check Names function fails to properly resolve partial friendly names and
  returns several selections when a unique resolution is possible. This
  behavior is most obvious when the GAL is selected as the default address list
  and the first and last name of the intended recipient begin with the same
  letter.

PC DirSync: Err Msg: Fatal [203] GAL Rebuild Problem:

  Q108831

File Updated/Modified: MSSFS.DLL

When running version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows there may be persistent
failures of Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) recorded in the DIRSYNC.LOG
file:

  Fatal [203] GAL Rebuild problem accessing files Global Address List not
  installed on this Postoffice

PC Win: Network List Doesn't Sort Alphabetically:

  Q99120

File Updated/Modified: MSSFS.DLL

External postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and nodes for PROFS and OfficeVision are not
displayed in alphabetic order in the Network List because version 3.0 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows reads them in one at a time and adds them to the
hierarchy. Thus they are displayed in the order they were set up.

PC Win: Err Msg: Undeliverable Mail:

  Q114942

File Updated/Modified: MSSFS.DLL

With version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if there are more than 66
network names defined, the following error may occur when you send mail:

  Undeliverable Mail

This problem applies to gateway users, as well as external postoffice users.

PC Win: Missing Message Text When Sending to a Large Group:

  Q117844

File Updated/Modified: MSSFS.DLL

In versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when sending mail such
that the number of recipients is greater than 200 (the exact number depends on
the specific address list), the body of the message will be missing.

PC Win: Duplicate PAB Entries--Part 2:

  Q100498

File Updated/Modified: MSSFS.DLL, PABNSP.DLL

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows add and display the
same user listing to the Personal Address Book more than one time.

PC Win: WA0887: Mail for Windows PABNSP.DLL 3.2.0.4046 Update:

  Q103821

PC Win: WA0722: Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE Version 3.0.2.4001:

File Updated/Modified: SETUP.EXE

Version 3.2a fixes a problem that can occur when you attempt to set up Mail for
Windows to run from a network file server.

The following appnote has been deactivated.

PC Win: WA0723: Mail for Windows STORE.DLL 3.2.0.4065 Update:

File Updated/Modified: STORE.DLL

- When you run version 3.0b of Microsoft Mail for Windows on a PC- NFS(R) file
  server, the Mail Message File (MMF) becomes corrupted and prevents you from
  sending and reading mail messages.

- The MMF recovery feature of version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows
  does not work when the MMF is on a Novell(R) file server and you do not have
  File Scan permissions for the Mail database.

- The manual MMF recovery and compression features of version 3.0b or 3.2 of
  Microsoft Mail for Windows do not work when you run the OS/2(R) Presentation
  Manager(R) (PM) client. When you start the MMF recovery or compression
  feature by holding down the SHIFT or F5 key, respectively, the computer hangs
  after the recovery or compression process finishes. To resolve this problem,
  the progress indicator is no longer displayed while the recovery or
  compression feature is running. The indicator is still displayed when you run
  Microsoft Mail for Windows.

- Sending Schedule+ for Windows meeting requests with the user's MMF stored on
  a PC-NFS file server eventually fails with the error message "Schedule file
  is locked."

- Folder export fails if the destination drive filled up during an attachment
  copy; however, no error appears and the export leaves an unusable message in
  the exported folder. Once the message is imported, that message is
  unreadable.

PC Win: WA0762: Mail for Windows VFORMS.DLL 3.2.0.4064 Update:

  Q96747

File Updated/Modified: VFORMS.DLL

The following two problems can occur when attachments are launched using version
3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

- When you attempt to launch attachments that do not have an extension, an
  error occurs when you hold down the ALT key and double-click the mouse button
  to load the attachment in Notepad.

- When you attempt to launch MACBINARY attachments, Mail for Windows changes
  the name of the file being launched if that filename is less than eight
  characters in length.

The following problems can occur when you use version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows:

- When you open a MAPI Send note through a Windows-based application (for
  example, Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel) and the application is launched
  again via Mail, the application is brought to the front, but the Send note is
  left in the background. If the application is running full screen, the
  computer hangs because the active window (the Send note) will accept any
  keystrokes; however, it is hidden by the full-screen application.

PC Win: Attached MAC Filenames Convert to Windows Incorrectly:

  Q115165

File Updated/Modified: VFORMS.DLL

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows appends a file
extension to an attached file received from a version 3.0 Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, Macintosh workstation, even if the file has a valid Microsoft MS-DOS
filename.

NOTE: MS-DOS supports a filename limited to eight characters for the name and
three characters for the extension (for example, FILENAME.DOC). This naming
convention is commonly referred to as 8.3 format.

PC Mac: Macintosh Client Version 3.0.3 Update:

  Q103945

File Updated/Modified: MACLIENT.HQX

- With the earlier version of this file, the computer could stop responding
  when sending a message to a personal group under low memory conditions. The
  Macintosh Client file has been modified to correct this problem.

- Some network operating systems will not allow a file to be created in all
  uppercase letters. The Macintosh Client file has been modified for these
  types of networks to allow the client to create filenames in lowercase
  letters if LOWRCASE.GLB exists in the GLB subdirectory of the Mail database.

- With the earlier version of this file, when mail is sent to global groups
  that contain nonalphabetic characters in their names, the recipient field
  appears blank when the message is viewed by a Mail for Windows user. The
  Macintosh Client file has been modified to correct this problem.
