SUMMARY
=======

Enabling Virtual Memory on an Apple Power Macintosh allows the Macintosh
Operating System to reduce the memory requirements for Power Macintosh native
applications. Installing version 1.5.2 (or later) of RAM Doubler from Connectix
Software also reduces application memory requirements.

The reason for this behavior lies in how the Power Macintosh loads an application
into memory.

A 680x0-based application stores executable code in the CODE resource and uses
the Resource Manager to load CODE resources into memory. A Power Macintosh
application, on the other hand, stores executable code in the data fork of an
application. This way, a single program can run on a 680x0-based Macintosh and a
Power Macintosh.

With the Virtual Memory option enabled (or with RAM Doubler 1.5 or higher
installed), the Virtual Memory Manager on the Power Macintosh reuses the data
fork of the application as a paging file to help improve performance. As a
result, only the needed portions of code are loaded into memory, thus reducing
the memory requirements of an application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following article was originally posted on the Internet newsgroup
COMP.SYS.MAC.APPS. This article discusses how the Power Macintosh uses virtual
memory. It also discusses how Microsoft Applications make use of virtual memory
and how they use shared libraries.

USING VIRTUAL MEMORY WITH THE POWER MACINTOSH
---------------------------------------------

The Power Macintosh runtime architecture was designed with virtual memory in
mind; therefore, when you use a Power Macintosh, you should usually have virtual
memory turned on.

NOTE: Apple shipped the Power Macintosh with the Virtual Memory option turned off
by default with System 7.1.2. With System 7.5x, the Virtual Memory option is
turned on by default.

How Applications Are Stored and Loaded on a 68K (Non-Power) Macintosh:

On a 68K Macintosh, you give every application a partition size. This partition
is used to hold the application's stack and heap. The heap is used to hold the
following:

- Memory that is dynamically allocated by the application (that is, to hold the
  contents of the cells in a spreadsheet, or the text in a Word document).
- Application resources (icons, dialogs, alerts, some strings).
- Application code (note that code is actually just another resource, and Word
  and Microsoft Excel, for example, each have several hundred code resources).

Breaking up the application's code into resources means that the application's
code can be loaded into memory in small chunks, and it's loaded only when
needed. For example, when you start the application, only a very few code
resources get loaded. Then, when functions are called that are located in
segments that are not yet loaded into memory, those segments get loaded. When
segments are not used, they can be kicked out of memory to make room for other
code segments. What this means is that the partition can be considerably smaller
than the total size of the application's code.

NOTE: The above is true for all Macintosh 68K applications, not just Microsoft
applications.

Microsoft applications go one step further and use technology developed
especially for our Macintosh applications. This technology allows a Microsoft
application to swap out more code that it would normally be able to. Basically,
most applications cannot swap out any segment that contains code that's on the
current call chain, because the code returning to that segment would crash if
the code was unloaded; the Microsoft swapper unloads the segments, and fixes up
the stack to point to code that reloads the segment. The result of this is that
we can run in even smaller partitions than we would be able to otherwise.

How Applications Are Stored and Loaded on a Power Macintosh:

On the Power Macintosh, things are quite a bit different. Power Macintosh code is
not segmented into resources. Instead, the code sits in one large chunk (called
a "fragment") in the application's data fork. (Macintosh files have two pieces:
a data fork and a resource fork.)

Note that this configuration is what makes fat binaries possible: in a fat
binary, all the 68K code sits in code segments in the resource fork, and the
Power Macintosh code sits in the data fork. A 68K Macintosh knows only about the
resource fork, but a Power Macintosh knows to look in the data fork (there's a
special resource that says to look in the data fork that only the Power
Macintosh loader knows about).

How Applications Are Loaded to Memory on a Power Macintosh:

So the question is, with all the code sitting in one big chunk, how is the system
going to load it?

When Virtual Memory Is Off:

If virtual memory is off, the system has no choice but to load the ENTIRE chunk
of code that's in the data fork [in the case of Microsoft Excel, this means
about 7 megabytes (MB) of code] into memory. That's right, no code resources, no
fragmentation, no swapping--the whole thing goes into memory. To do this, the
system increases the partition size you've allocated by the full amount of the
code size.

Why does the system add the full amount of the code (after all, on the 68K
Macintosh, the code goes in the partition anyway)? The system has to add the
full amount of code for the following two reasons:

1. The code doesn't go in the heap with the other resources, it goes in a
  separate area of the partition.

2. On a Power Macintosh, you would typically need a bigger partition because
  stack frames are larger, but since there's no code, things roughly balance
  out.

So, if virtual memory is off, the system looks at your partition size (which is
used for stack and heap, but not code), adds the complete size of the
application code, and uses that for a new partition.

When Virtual Memory Is On:

When virtual memory is on, however, the system does not have to load all the
application's code at once. Instead, it "demand pages" the code from the disk
using a technique called "file mapping." What this means is that when code is
needed, it is brought in from the disk, and it can also be kicked out of memory
to make room when needed. While there is no explicit segmentation of the code
into resources, the virtual memory system divides a file into 4K chunks, and
brings in and kicks out those chunks as needed. So, the system adds nothing to
the partition size, and then it is smart about loading in code as needed. You
might even say that when virtual memory is on, the system can pretty much do
what it does on a 68K machine: that is, it can bring in code in chunks, and kick
them out to make room for other chunks.

POWER MACINTOSH SHARED LIBRARIES
--------------------------------

On a 68K Macintosh, it's very difficult to share code between applications. What
this means is that if two applications want to share code in any non- trivial
way, they typically must each include a copy of the code. That means that two
copies of the code sit on your hard disk (and in memory if the programs are
running).

The Power Macintosh makes things a lot better by adding shared libraries.
Applications can share code by putting this code in a shared library. A shared
library is loaded into memory only once, no matter how many applications are
using it. Another benefit of a shared library is that if there is a bug in it,
it can be replaced without replacing the entire application.

Microsoft applications take full advantage of this new feature of the Power
Macintosh. We put the pieces of code that our applications may share in shared
libraries. These libraries include the following:

- A dialog manager that is shared between Microsoft Excel and Word
- A toolbar button editor that is shared between Word, Microsoft Excel,
  PowerPoint, and Microsoft Project
- Support for Microsoft Mail in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Project,
- OLE
- The Visual Basic, Applications Edition, macro language

Where the Libraries Are Loaded in Memory:

If virtual memory is on, the libraries are "demand paged" as needed (the same way
that applications are loaded).

If virtual memory is off, however, the system needs to load all the code in all
these libraries when you start up the application. And, because these are shared
libraries, potentially used by other applications, these can't go in an
application partition; they have to go in the system heap. In the case of
Microsoft Excel there are about 6MB of code in these libraries. Note that when
you load other applications that use these libraries, they don't get loaded
again (because they're shared).
