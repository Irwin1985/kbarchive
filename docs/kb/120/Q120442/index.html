SUMMARY
=======

Most hard disk utility programs released before Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0
require an update. If you use a non-long filename-aware hard disk utility, you
may lose long filenames and you are at risk of losing data.

If the file maintenance utility you use is not written to support long filenames,
it will likely damage your long filenames. Examples of such programs include the
following:

  4DOS
  Disk utilities in Stacker 4.0 or earlier
  MS-DOS DOSSHELL
  NDOS
  Norton Desktop
  Norton Utilities
  PC-Tools PCShell
  PC-Tools Utilities
  Windows File Manager
  XTree
  XTree Gold
  XTree Pro
  XTreeNet 3.0

For more information about the problems caused by third-party hard disk
utilities, please contact the manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following MS-DOS commands run from MS-DOS (not an MS-DOS command prompt) may
also cause long filename damage:

- COPY - This command results in a mismatched long filename when you copy a
  short filename in the 32-bit entry beneath an orphaned long filename.

- DEFRAG - Using DEFRAG from MS-DOS version 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, or 6.22 causes you
  to lose long filenames because it re-sorts the structure of short filenames
  on your disk without taking into account their associated long filenames.

  Windows 95 Defrag does not re-sort the filenames due to the possibility of
  file corruption in a multitasking environment.

- DEL/DELTREE - These commands result in orphaned long filenames. DEL applies
  to files only. DELTREE applies to files and folders, but only affects the
  topmost folder that it is run on as all subsequent folders and files are
  deleted, including their long filenames.

- MD - This command results in a mismatched long filename. The damage occurs
  when you make a short filename folder in the 32-bit entry beneath an orphaned
  long filename.

- MOVE - This command causes mismatched or orphaned long filenames. If MOVE is
  performed within the context of the same folder (a modified rename) then a
  mismatched long filename will result. If MOVE is performed outside of the
  folder, then an orphaned long filename will result. This applies to both
  files and folders.

- RD - This command results in an orphaned long filename. The damage occurs
  when you remove a short filename folder in the 32-bit entry beneath its
  associated long filename.

- REN - This command results in a mismatched long filename. The damage occurs
  when you rename a short filename in the 32-bit entry beneath its associated
  long filename. The REN command will not fix a previously mismatched long
  filename.

- SCANDISK - This command does not account for the long filename structure when
  it writes corrections to your disk; therefore, it corrupts long filenames.

If you need to use an earlier version of a hard disk utility in Windows 95,
perform the following steps:

NOTE: The long filename backup utility (Lfnbk.exe) is not supported in Windows NT
4.0. There is no comparable utility for Windows NT 4.0.

1. Run Lfnbk.exe, which is a long filename (LFN) backup utility available in the
  \\Admin\Apptools\Lfnback folder of the Windows 95 CD.

  Lfnbk.exe removes your long filenames and saves them to a data file. Read
  LFNBK.TXT for more information.

2. Restart your computer and use the appropriate step below:

   - If you need to run an MS-DOS-based utility, press the F8 key when you see
     the "Starting Windows 95" message, and then choose Command Prompt Only
     from the Startup menu.

     -or-

   - If you need to run a Windows-based utility, allow Windows 95 to start
     normally.

3. After you run the utility, restart your computer and run Lfnbk.exe to restore
  your long filenames.
