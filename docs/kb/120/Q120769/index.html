-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is based on the Visual C++ version 2.0 README.WRI file:

Environment Variable Settings
-----------------------------

The CD Install option does not initialize the environment variables PATH, LIB,
and INCLUDE to point to the CD drive. You must set these directories as
appropriate after you run Setup.

If you reinstall the Visual C++ version 2.0 development environment to a
different path than the original installation, the environment variables are not
reset and the Platforms subkey in the Registry points to the original
installation.

If an INIT variable is specified in AUTOEXEC.BAT, it will be placed in the system
environment but not in the registry, so it will not be accessible to Setup and
to tools using the variable. The INIT variable should be specified using the
System dialog from the Control Panel applet.

Installing for Remote Debugging
-------------------------------

When you install the Visual C++ version 2.0 development environment for Win32s,
Setup installs the Visual C++ Debug Monitor icon in your Visual C++ program
group. However, when you install the development environment for Windows 95 or
Windows NT, Setup copies the appropriate remote debugging files to the BIN
subdirectory of your Visual C++ installation but does not install this icon to
your program group. You can add this icon to your program group.

Installing Over Previous Versions of Visual C++
-----------------------------------------------

If you install Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.0 into a directory that contains
Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.5, version 2.0 will overwrite version 1.5 without
warning.

If you have installed a pre-release version of Visual C++ version 2.0, you should
delete the previous installation and the registry associated with it before
installing the retail version.

WARNING: take care when deleting keys from your registry. It is possible to
damage your system configuration if the wrong keys are deleted.

To delete your registry for previous installations of Visual C++ version 2.0:

1. Run REGEDT32.EXE, which is in your SYSTEM32 directory.

2. Make sure the HKEY_CURRENT_USER on the Local Machine window is active.

3. Open the Software folder by double-clicking the folder icon.

4. Open the Microsoft folder by double-clicking the folder icon.

5. Highlight the Visual C++ version 2.0 folder by clicking it once.

6. From the Edit menu, choose Delete to delete this registration key.

7. Before you choose Yes on the Warning dialog box, verify that the Visual C++
  version 2.0 registration key is selected. It should have an outline box
  around it.

8. Exit the Registry Editor by choosing Exit from the Registry menu.

Installing Without the Microsoft Foundation Class Library
---------------------------------------------------------

If you install Visual C++ version 2.0 without the Microsoft Foundation Class
(MFC) Library and then open an MFC project, a dialog box appears warning that
you did not install MFC. This message may be incorrect if you installed MFC or
built modified MFC libraries at another time. To prevent this dialog box from
appearing, you can change the MFCInstalled registry subkey under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER.Software.Microsoft.Visual C++ 2.0.General to:

MFCInstalled : REG_DWORD : 0x1

NT System Symbols Setup
-----------------------

When debugging code in a callback function, it is helpful to have the symbol
(.DBG) files for corresponding system DLLs on the call stack. If these symbol
files are not installed, the Visual C++ debugger will not always be able to
determine the context in which your functions are called. Without this
information, the debugger shows a truncated call stack.The system symbol files
are also required for OLE RPC debugging.

You can install the symbol files using the NT System Symbols Setup application.
An icon for this application is installed in the Visual C++ program group. The
NT System Symbols Setup application installs symbol files for the most commonly
used system DLLs. If your application calls a less commonly used system DLL, you
may need to install the symbol file manually from your Windows NT distribution
disk. The symbol files are in the SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386\SYMBOLS\DLL directory. They
should be installed into the %SystemRoot%{WINDOWS}\SYMBOLS\DLL directory, or a
directory pointed to by the %_NT_SYMBOL_PATH%\SYMBOLS\DLL environment variable.

If you update your Windows NT system files, you will also have to reinstall the
symbol files containing updated information.
