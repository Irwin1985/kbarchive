SUMMARY
=======

The TCP/IP stack for Windows NT version 3.5 was completely redesigned. This
article covers one of the many performance enhancements implemented; the
improved handling of the TCP PUSH bit on the receive end.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TCP protocol has a bit in every header called the PUSH bit. RFC 1122 section
4.2.2.2 contains the following text on the PUSH bit.

  4.2.2.2  Use of Push: RFC-793 Section 2.8

     When an application issues a series of SEND calls without
     setting the PUSH flag, the TCP MAY aggregate the data
     internally without sending it. Similarly, when a series of
     segments is received without the PUSH bit, a TCP MAY queue
     the data internally without passing it to the receiving
     application.

     The PUSH bit is not a record marker and is independent of
     segment boundaries. The transmitter SHOULD collapse
     successive PUSH bits when it packetizes data, to send the
     largest possible segment.

     A TCP MAY implement PUSH flags on SEND calls. If PUSH flags
     are not implemented, then the sending TCP: (1) must not
     buffer data indefinitely, and (2) MUST set the PUSH bit in
     the last buffered segment (i.e., when there is no more
     queued data to be sent).

     The discussion in RFC-793 on pages 48, 50, and 74
     erroneously implies that a received PUSH flag must be passed
     to the application layer. Passing a received PUSH flag to
     the application layer is now OPTIONAL.

     An application program is logically required to set the PUSH
     flag in a SEND call whenever it needs to force delivery of
     the data to avoid a communication deadlock. However, a TCP
     SHOULD send a maximum-sized segment whenever possible, to
     improve performance (see Section 4.2.3.4).

     DISCUSSION:
        When the PUSH flag is not implemented on SEND calls,
        i.e., when the application/TCP interface uses a pure
        streaming model, responsibility for aggregating any
        tiny data fragments to form reasonable sized segments
        is partially borne by the application layer.

        Generally, an interactive application protocol must set
        the PUSH flag at least in the last SEND call in each
        command or response sequence. A bulk transfer protocol
        like FTP should set the PUSH flag on the last segment
        of a file or when necessary to prevent buffer deadlock.

        At the receiver, the PUSH bit forces buffered data to be
        delivered to the application (even if less than a full
        buffer has been received). Conversely, the lack of a
        PUSH bit can be used to avoid unnecessary wakeup calls
        to the application process; this can be an important
        performance optimization for large timesharing hosts.
        Passing the PUSH bit to the receiving application allows
        an analogous optimization within the application.

The receive-side use of the PUSH bit was changed in Windows NT version 3.5. In
Windows NT version 3.1, TCP/IP behaved as if the PUSH bit was always set by the
sender. Consequently, it completed application recv() calls as soon as any data
was available. In Windows NT version 3.5, the receive logic was optimized to use
the PUSH bit. This reduces the number of times an application has to wake up for
incoming data. However, when NT is communicating with a TCP/IP implementation
(or application) that does not set the PUSH bit at appropriate times,
performance can suffer.

Performance degrades because, when data arrives without the PUSH bit set, TCP
holds onto the application's recv() while waiting for the rest of the data.
Windows NT version 3.5 TCP/IP completes a recv() call when:

- Data arrives with the PUSH bit set.

  -or-

- The user recv() buffer is full.

  -or-

- 0.5 seconds have elapsed since any data arrived.

When the third complete test above is required to complete a recv() call,
performance degrades.

The following example shows how the improved handling of the TCP PUSH bit can
improve performance:

  A client-server pair is going to transfer 4096 bytes between them on
  Ethernet. The client application executes a send() for 4096 bytes.
  Windows NT TCP/IP breaks the 4096 bytes into three Ethernet packets:

     1460 bytes, no PUSH
     1460 bytes, no PUSH
     1176 bytes, PUSH is set

  At the same time, the server executes recv(), for 8192 bytes. When the
  first packet arrives, TCP puts the data into the user buffer. The same
  thing happens for the second packet since PUSH is still not set.
  However, when the third packet arrives, TCP completes the recv() because
  PUSH was set.

In this scenario, holding on to the recv() boosts performance because of the
overhead implicit in each recv() call; instead of making three calls to recv(),
the application makes only one, returning all 4096 bytes. If the client did not
set the PUSH flag on the third packet, TCP would not send recv() for another 0.5
seconds. Because some TCP/IP implementations (and applications) never set PUSH,
they tend to perform poorly with Windows NT version 3.5 TCP/IP.
