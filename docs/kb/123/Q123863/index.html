2.2  List of Bugs Fixed in Windows NT 3.5 U.S. Service Pack 3

1.0  Introduction
-----------------
This release of Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) 3.5 U.S. Service Pack 3 is
easy to apply from within Windows NT and changes only those files that
were originally set up on the Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server
system.  Service Pack releases are cumulative: they contain all previous
fixes, as well as any new fixes made to the system.

2.0  Installation Instructions for the Windows NT U.S. Service Pack
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing the Service Pack from a floppy disk:
1.  Insert Service Pack Disk 1 into the floppy drive.
2.  At the Windows NT Command Prompt, change to that floppy drive (that is,
   A: or B:) and type UPDATE.
3.  Follow the instructions given on the screen.

Installing the Service Pack from a CD-ROM:
1.  Insert the Service Pack CD-ROM disk into the CD-ROM drive.
2.  At the Windows NT Command Prompt, change to that CD-ROM drive, then
   change to the i386, MIPS, or ALPHA directory (depending upon whether
   you have an Intel(TM), MIPS(R), or ALPHA AXP(TM) CPU), and type UPDATE.
3.  Follow the instructions given on the screen.

Installing the Service Pack from a network drive:
1.  At the Windows NT Command Prompt, type the command to connect to the
   network drive on which the Service Pack files reside.
2.  Change to that network drive and type UPDATE.
3.  Follow the instructions given on the screen.

2.1  User Notes
---------------
*** Emergency Repair Disk

If it is necessary to use the Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk to repair
your Windows NT system at some time after you apply the Service Pack, you
will need to re-apply the Service Pack after the repair is completed.  This
is because the Emergency Repair Disk repairs your system by restoring your
original Windows NT setup.  After the repair has completed, simply follow
the above Installation Instructions to reapply the Service Pack.

*** Adding New Components to the System

If new software or hardware components are changed or added to your system
after you have applied the Service Pack, it will be necessary to reapply
the Service Pack.  This is because the files taken from the original
Windows NT disk set may not be equivalent to the files on the Service Pack
disk set.

It is not possible to install new components directly from the Service Pack
media (such as a new keyboard or printer driver).  New components must be
installed from the original product media.

*** Installing Symbol Files from the CD-ROM

To install the symbol files corresponding to the new binaries in Service
Pack 3, do the following (assuming your CD-ROM drive is D:, your symbol
files are located in the C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS directory, and you are installing
the files for an x86 machine):

   XCOPY /S /U /D D:\SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386\SYMBOLS C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS

This will copy the Service Pack 3 .DBG files over the existing versions of
these files.  The XCOPY command shown will copy only those .DBG files that
are already installed (/U switch), and only those with a more recent time-
date stamp (/D switch).

*** Remote Access Service (RAS)

Several fixes were made to Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) that are
included in this Service Pack. Following is background information on
client compatibility with RAS.

NOTE: If you don't already have RAS installed, install it from your
original Windows NT setup media before applying the Service Pack.

RAS Software Compression Compatibility with WFW 3.11 And Windows NT 3.1

In addition to other fixes, the Service Pack installs files that make
Windows NT 3.5 software compression compatible with Windows for Workgroups
(WFW) 3.11 and Windows NT 3.1. Throughput should improve significantly
unless previously compressed files are copied. For best performance
Microsoft suggests you configure the RAS client software on WFW 3.11,
Windows NT 3.1, and Windows NT 3.50 as follows:

1. In Remote Access, make sure the Disable Software Compression option in
  the Options menu is clear (not checked).

2. Choose Edit, choose Modem, and select the following:

   - Enable Hardware Flow Control
   - Enable Modem Error Control

  Clear the Enable Modem Compression check box so software compression
  and modem compression are not used at the same time (as this reduces
  throughput).

Windows NT 3.5 RAS Clients Need No Change for RAS Software Compression

If you install the Service Pack on a Windows NT 3.5 RAS server, unmodified
Windows NT 3.5 RAS clients do not lose software compression compatibility
when calling the RAS server. WFW 3.11 and Windows NT 3.1 RAS clients can
use RAS software compression without any need for new files, except as
noted below.

All copies of Windows NT 3.5 have RAS software compression built-in. Only
Windows NT 3.5 computers that are acting as RAS servers need the Service
Pack for compression compatibility with Windows NT 3.1 and WFW 3.11 RAS
clients. However, because of several code improvements, Microsoft
recommends that you also apply this patch to Windows NT 3.5 RAS clients.
The patch is required for RAS software compression compatibility when you
call a Windows NT 3.1 or WFW 3.11 RAS server from a Windows NT 3.5 RAS
client.

Software Compression in WFW 3.11 and Windows NT 3.1 RAS Clients

Software compression is available by default on these RAS clients unless
you set the Disable Software Compression option in the Options menu or you
purchased your copy of WFW 3.11 or Windows NT 3.1 after February 1994. You
can tell whether you have RAS software compression or not by using the
following information:

Windows for Workgroups 3.11:

  File name    Bytes   Compression
  ----------   -----   -----------
  RASMAC.386   49209   YES
  RASMAC.386   27193   NO

Windows NT 3.1:

  File name      Bytes    Compression
  ------------   -----    -----------
  ASYNCMAC.SYS   53188    YES
  ASYNCMAC.SYS   53716    YES
  ASYNCMAC.SYS   33732    NO

NOTE: The Windows NT 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS compression
files can be obtained from the SUPPORT\RAS directory on the Windows NT 3.5
U.S. Service Pack 3 CD.
