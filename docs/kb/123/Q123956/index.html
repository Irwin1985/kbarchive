The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Symantec's PC Anywhere for Windows under Windows NT, PC
Anywhere Setup restarts your computer. After you log on to Windows NT, the
system stops responding (hangs) with a blank screen. To continue, you need to
press CTRL+ALT+DEL for the Windows NT security dialog box to either Cancel,
Logoff or Shutdown the system.

The following error message appears when you log on to Windows NT:

  &lt;temp&gt;\INSTBIN.EXE could not be found in the source directory.

where &lt;temp&gt; is the path of the TEMP directory.

You must choose OK which returns you to a screen with a wallpaper background. To
continue, press CTRL+ALT+DEL to display the Windows NT Security dialog box.

If you copy INSTBIN.EXE file to the TEMP directory, you may receive the following
error message when you log on to Windows NT:

  Information File Not Found

This message is accompanied with an OK button. If you select OK, the Welcome
dialog box appears for you to press CTRL+ALT+DEL to log on.

CAUSE
=====

Your computer hangs because PC Anywhere Setup replaces the Shell statement in
the Windows NT Registry from PROGMAN.EXE to INSTALL.EXE (PC Anywhere Setup).
Once PC Anywhere Setup starts, INSTALL.EXE is placed in the %systemroot%\SYSTEM
subdirectory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Listed below are possible workarounds to this problem:

  - Recovering Windows NT on a FAT File System
  - Recovering by Network Access
  - Recovering Using Emergency Repair Disk
  - Recovering from Another Windows NT Installation

Recovering Windows NT on a FAT File System
------------------------------------------

1. Boot MS-DOS. If MS-DOS is installed, the Windows NT Boot Loader provides
  MS-DOS as a selection. If not, use an MS-DOS boot disk.

2. Go to the %systemroot%\SYSTEM subdirectory.

3. Rename the INSTALL.EXE file to INSTALL.OLD.

4. Copy the %systemroot%\SYSTEM32\PROGMAN.EXE file to the %systemroot%\SYSTEM
  subdirectory as INSTALL.EXE.

5. Restart your computer and select Windows NT.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

6. Start Registry Editor and locate the following Registry subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT \CurrentVersion\Winlogon

  Change the Shell value from %systemroot%\SYSTEM\INSTALL.EXE to PROGMAN.EXE.

7. Exit Registry Editor and restart your computer.

8. Update the Emergency Repair Disk.

Recovering by Network Access
----------------------------

1. Start the computer experiencing the problem, but do not log on.

2. Go to another Windows NT computer on the network.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

3. Start Registry Editor and choose Select Computer from the Registry menu.

4. Select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree of the computer that is experiencing
  the problem.

5. Start Registry Editor and locate the following Registry subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT \CurrentVersion\Winlogon

  Change the Shell value from %systemroot%\SYSTEM\INSTALL.EXE to PROGMAN.EXE.

6. Exit Registry Editor and log on to the computer that experienced the problem.
  Immediately after logging on, restart the computer in order for the changes
  in the Registry to take effect.

7. Update the Emergency Repair Disk.

Recovering Using Emergency Repair Disk
--------------------------------------

NOTE: Any changes after the last update or since the creation of the Emergency
Repair Disk will be lost and must be re-created. If this is undesirable, you may
attempt one of the other three workaround procedures.

Perform the Repair process using the Emergency Repair Disk.

1. Restart your computer with the Windows NT version 3.5 setup boot disk.

2. At the Welcome To Setup screen press R to repair a damaged Windows NT version
  3.5 installation.

3. In the next screen, select the Inspect Registry Files option. Clear the other
  options and choose Continue.

4. Insert the Emergency Repair Disk when prompted.

5. A screen appears for the restoration of Registry files. Select the "SOFTWARE
  (Software Information)" option and choose Continue.

Recovering from Another Windows NT Installation
-----------------------------------------------

1. Install Windows NT to another location on your computer.

2. Run Command Prompt and go to the %systemroot%\SYSTEM subdirectory of the
  original Windows NT installation experiencing the problem.

3. Rename INSTALL.EXE to INSTALL.OLD.

4. Copy the %systemroot%\SYSTEM32\PROGMAN.EXE file to the %systemroot%\SYSTEM
  subdirectory as INSTALL.EXE.

5. Restart the installation of Windows NT where PC Anywhere was installed.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

6. Start Registry Editor and locate the following Registry subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT \CurrentVersion\Winlogon

  Change the Shell value from %systemroot%\SYSTEM\INSTALL.EXE to PROGMAN.EXE.

7. Exit Registry Editor and restart your computer.

8. Remove the second installation of Windows NT and modify the BOOT.INI file to
  reflect the change.

9. Update the Emergency Repair Disk.
