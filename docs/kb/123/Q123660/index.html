Product(s): Microsoft Fortran Compiler

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There has been a maintenance release of FORTRAN PowerStation that fixed several
bugs in the first release. To get a list of Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB)
articles describing bugs that were fixed, use this query:

  PowerStation kbfixlist 1.0a

The following are some of the components that were updated:

- The subcomponents of the compiler

- The linker

- The MS-DOS-extenders

- The debugger

- Many library functions

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Find Out If You Have the Latest Version
----------------------------------------------

The new version was released in March of 1994. The manuals and other
documentation, as well as the version displayed by the compiler, continue to
show the version as 1.0. There are a number of ways to identify if you are using
the latest version:

- Approximately half of the components of FORTRAN PowerStation were updated in
  the new release. They all have dates after March 1993.

- The new linker is based on the ones that shipped with FORTRAN PowerStation 32
  for Windows NT and Visual C++, 32-bit edition. The old linker version was
  2.8, and the new version is 1.0F. To check the version of the linker, type
  the following at an MS-DOS prompt:

  " link | more" (without the quotation marks)

- The version of CVPACK also changed. The old version was 4.21, and the new
  version is 4.25. To check the version, type the following at an MS-DOS
  prompt:

  " cvpack" (without the quotation marks)

How to Get and Install the Update
---------------------------------

To get the update, call your local Microsoft subsidiary. The update contains a
full set of replacement disks (not including Numerical Recipes which did not get
updated) that you should install in exactly the same way as the original. We
recommend that you delete all components of the original version before
installing the new version. Be sure to search the entire disk and delete all of
the old components -- particularly every copy of the old MS-DOS-extenders.

Problems Using Components of Both Releases Together
---------------------------------------------------

There are two problems that can occur when components of both the first release
and the maintenance release are used together:

- You may get error DX1410, which is caused by the existence of older versions
  of the MS-DOS-extenders.

- You may get a variety of LINK or CVPACK errors, which are caused by using
  libraries created with the new version when building programs with the old
  version.
