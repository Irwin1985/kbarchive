This article describes WINS event log IDs 4135 through 4144. These events
represent warning messages.

Event Log IDs 4135 - 4144
-------------------------

Event   Description
-----   -----------

4135    The local WINS server received a request from a remote WINS
       server that is not of the same version. Because the WINS servers
       are not compatible, the connection was terminated. The version
       number of the remote WINS server is given below.

4136    Winsock Send could not send all the bytes. Connection could have
       been aborted by the remote client.

4137    WINS adjusted a scavenging related time interval (%1) so that it
       is compatible with the replication time intervals.

4138    WINS adjusted a scavenging related time interval (%1).

4139    The timeout period has expired on a call to another WINS server.
       Assuming that the network and routers are working properly, either
       the remote WINS server is overloaded, or its TCP listener thread
       has terminated.

4140    The Scavenger thread found active replicas that needed to be
       verified with the owner WINS server since they were older than the
       verify time interval. The table of owner to address mappings
       indicated the WINS server to be not ACTIVE.

4141    The name registration packet that was just received has too many
       addresses. The maximum number of addresses for a multi-homed
       client is 25. The number of addresses found in the packet is given
       below.

4142    A replica clashed with a static record in the database. The
       replica was rejected.

4143    WINS could not initialize because of some problem with the RPC
       service. Make sure that the RPC service is running.

4144    WINS did not send a notification message to the WINS server whose
       address is given below, because it had a number of communications
       failures with that server in the past few minutes.
