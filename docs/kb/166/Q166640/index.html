-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to delete or move Read Receipts to the Deleted Items, Outbox,
or Sent Items folders using a Microsoft Exchange Client connected to Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0, the following error message may appear:

  The item could not be deleted. Client operation failed.

The Read Receipts that cause this problem were returned from messages sent to
PROFS users, using the LINKAGE PROFS connector.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem:

1. If the Read Receipts are first moved to a personal folder (PST) file, they
  can be deleted.

2. If you log in Off-line and delete the Read Receipts, and then synchronize the
  Off-line personal folder (OST), they will be deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server configurations that are affected by this problem
include:

- If you upgrade Microsoft Exchange Server from version 4.0 to 5.0, any Read
  Receipts generated before the upgrade that still exist after the upgrade will
  produce this problem.

- If the PROFS connector is installed on a Microsoft Exchange Server version
  4.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent over the PROFS connector
  originating from a user on a Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 will
  produce this problem.

Microsoft Exchange Server configurations that are not affected by this problem
include:

- If the LINKAGE connector is installed on Microsoft Exchange Server version
  4.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange
  Server version 4.0 user across the LINKAGE connector to a PROFs user can be
  deleted.

- If the LINKAGE connector is installed on Microsoft Exchange Server version
  5.0, Read Receipts generated from messages sent from a Microsoft Exchange
  Server version 5.0 user across the LINKAGE connector to a PROFs user can be
  deleted.
