SYMPTOMS
========

When you convert a Visual C++ 4.x project, the following error messages may
appear:

On Windows NT 4.0:

  

   MSDEV.EXE - Application Error
   The instruction at :0x00000004" referenced memory at "0x00000004". The
   memory could not be read.

After selecting OK you may get the following error:

  

   MSDEV.EXE - Application Error
   The instruction at :0x5f402181" referenced memory at "0x00000004". The
   memory could not be read.

On Windows 95:

  

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   Details shows:
     MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module &lt;unknown&gt; at
     00de:00000009

After selecting OK you get the following error:

  

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   Details shows:
     MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module &lt;unknown&gt; at
     0137:5f402181

  -or-

  

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
  Details shows:

    MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module SSSCC.DLL at
    0137:48248c18.

Note that in both cases the address in the first message may vary, but the second
one will be consistent.

CAUSE
=====

There are two cases that will reproduce this problem:

Case 1
------

Projects that are missing a top-level project in the directory where the .MDP and
.MAK files are located crash.

Case 2
------

Projects for which the .MDP and .MAK files have been renamed and have a
subdirectory with the same name as the upper-level original project.

RESOLUTION
==========

Steps to Reproduce Case 1
-------------------------

1. In Visual C++ 4.0, create a workspace called Test of the Application type.

2. Insert a top-level project called Top of any type.

3. Using the Build|Configurations menu, remove the Test project and then close
  the project.

4. In Visual C++ 5.0, open the Test workspace's Test.mdp file. Visual C++ 5.0
  converts the project. MSDEV crashes and the error messages noted above
  appear.

Resolution for Case 1
---------------------

1. Under the Test directory which was created for the Test workspace there is a
  "Top" subdirectory. Rename this the "Top" subdirectory to "x" (any name is
  acceptable).

2. In Visual C++ 5.0, open the Test workspace's Test.mdp file. Visual C++ 5.0
  converts the project.

3. Rename the "x" subdirectory to the original name and the project will work as
  expected.

In the general case, you may have several projects. Renaming any one of the
subdirectories as shown above will work around this bug.

Steps to Reproduce Case 2
-------------------------

1. In Visual C++ 4.0, create a workspace called Test of the Application type. It
  should be located in the Test directory.

2. Insert a subproject of any type called Sub.

3. Close the workspace.

4. In the Test directory, rename Test.m?? to MyFile.*

5. Create a subdirectory called Test\Test.

6. In Visual C++ 5.0 open MyFile.mdp. MSDEV crashes and the error messages noted
  above appear.

Resolution of Case 2
--------------------

1. Rename the Test\Test subdirectory to Test\[anything].

2. Convert the project using Visual C++ 5.0. Now you can restore the
  subdirectory name to Test\Test.

Please note that for case 2 the upper-level directory name is of no consequence.
What is important is that there is a subdirectory with the same name as the
original project name.

These scenarios apply to all versions of Visual C++ 4.x.
