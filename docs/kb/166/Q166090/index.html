MORE INFORMATION
================

Does the MSN Software Work in Windows NT?
-----------------------------------------

MSN 5.1 software is designed for use in Windows 95, 98, 98SE, and Windows 2000.
MSN 5.1 is available on a CD-ROM that you can order or downloaded from MSN at
http://free.msn.com/.

Although the MSN software does not currently run in Windows NT, you can still use
your MSN account to access the Internet from Windows NT (see the section titled
"How Do I Configure Windows NT to Use an MSN Account for Internet Access?" in
this article).

Can I Access My MSN E-mail from Windows NT?
-------------------------------------------

You can access your MSN e-mail from Windows NT when you have migrated your MSN
e-mail account to the MSN POP3/SMTP mail servers. You cannot access your MSN
e-mail from Windows NT if you are using the Classic MSN mail servers. You can
migrate your MSN e-mail account using MSN version 2.5 or higher on a computer
running Windows 95, 98, or 98SE. Once the account has been successfully migrated
then you can access your MSN e-mail from Windows NT using an Internet mail
program. Future versions of MSN may be compatible with Windows NT.

For additional information about migrating your MSN e-mail account, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q176276
  TITLE : Frequently Asked Questions About Mail Migration on MSN


Does the Internet Connection Wizard Work in Windows NT?
-------------------------------------------------------

The Internet Connection Wizard (ICW) is part of the Internet Starter Kit (ISK)
and is also included with some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer for
Windows NT. The ICW included with the ISK does not work in Windows NT 4.0. The
ICW that ships with Internet Explorer 4.0 or 4.01 works properly on Windows NT
4.0. For information about running the ICW in Windows NT 3.51, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q159686
  TITLE : Manual Setup for Internet Explorer 3x. and 4.x in Windows 95/98

For additional information, see the Readme.txt file included with your version of
the ISK.


How Do I Sign Up for an MSN Account Using Windows NT?
-----------------------------------------------------

MSN accounts can be obtained or established using the MSN software that is
available in Windows 95 or by obtaining an MSN CD by calling 1 (800) FREE-MSN ,
or by calling The Microsoft Network Customer Service at (800) 386-5550 and
requesting that an account for Internet PPP access be set up manually.

How Do I Configure Windows NT to Use an MSN Account for Internet Access?

     text", and then click OK.

     name. See the "How Do I Troubleshoot Connections to MSN in Windows NT?"
     section in this article for information about user name requirements.

  b. Use your MSN password as your password.

  c. Leave the Domain box blank.

  d. Click OK to dial.

How Do I Troubleshoot Connections to MSN in Windows NT?
-------------------------------------------------------

There are two causes for the above message as follows:

- If you attempt to dial into a MSN account and this account is already in use
  you will get the error. MSN does not allow concurrent connections.

  -or-

- If you have incorrectly entered your user name or password when you are
  dialing in to MSN, you receive the error. Check your user name and password
  entries when dialing. The "MSN" prefix must be capitalized, and the MSN
  account name is case sensitive. The combination of "MSN/" and your user name
  cannot exceed 20 characters.

you try to connect to Internet resources:
