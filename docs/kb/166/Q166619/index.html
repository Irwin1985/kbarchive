-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Delivery Reports (DRs) received from another Microsoft Exchange Server may only
contain the Distinguished Name (DN) of the original recipient in the envelope.
This behavior does not affect normal users, but if the DR is received by an EDK
based agent or gateway, it is no longer possible to relate the DR to the
original message. The DN used in the delivery report is not usable, since the
receiving Microsoft Exchange Server doesn't have any information about the other
Microsoft Exchange Organization.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the DR is generated by another Microsoft Exchange
Organization that is connected by a 88 X400 Connector and Directory Replication
is not configured between the two Organizations. As a result, the X.400 O/R
address is stripped from the DR and when the MTA receives the DR, only the DN is
left.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

WORKAROUND
==========

Use a 1984 X400 connection instead of a 1988 X400 connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix is only needed if you are working with two Microsoft Exchange Servers
that do not have Directory Replication configured between them or that are in
different Organizations. Without the fix, a DR may contain only a DN that
references the user to whom a message was delivered successfully.

The fix changes the handling of invalid DNs, so that the DR always contains a
valid, usable address. This address can be a O/R address or a DN.


To install the fix, follow these steps:

1. Stop all Microsoft Exchange services.

2. Backup the following files from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\bin directory by
  renaming or copying them to another location:

  ADDRESS.DLL, EMSMTA.EXE, MTACHECK.EXE, MMIEXT.DLL, SAALOG.DLL, EMS_RID.DLL,
  P2.XV2, X400OMV1.DLL

3. Backup the following files from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\mtadata directory
  by renaming or copying them to another location:

  P2.XV2, INFOTLOG.CFG, INFODLOG.CFG, P3.TPL, DBSERVER.SCH, DCPRODS.CAT

4. Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\connect\msexcimc\bin
  directory by renaming or copying it to another location:

  ADDRESS.DLL

5. Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\connect\msmcon\bin
  directory by renaming or copying it to another location:

  ADDRESS.DLL (if existing)

6. Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\exchsrvr\res directory by
  renaming or copying it to another location:

  MTALOG.DLL

7. Backup the following file from the &lt;path&gt;\&lt;winntroot&gt;\system32
  directory by renaming or copying it to another location:

  MAPI32.DLL

8. Replace all the above files with the ones provided with the hotfix.

9. Restart all services stopped in step 1.

Please note that it might be necessary to reboot the computer in order for the
changes introduced with MAPI32.DLL to take effect.
