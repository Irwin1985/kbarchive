- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

Shortly after you create a Macintosh volume on a partition larger than
approximately seven (7) GB with a large number of files, the system may crash
with a STOP 0x24 error in NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM (NTFS.SYS).

CAUSE
=====

The AppleTalk protocol driver Afp.sys, depletes the memory pool allocated to
non-paged pool while indexing a Services for Macintosh (SFM) volume.

This problem may also occur when the Services for Macintosh (SFM) server is
experiencing performance problems, Event ID 12053 errors, or indexing problems.
See the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles for more information:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q136300
  TITLE : Event ID 12053 or 12054 Caused by Macintosh Client Disconnect

  ARTICLE-ID: Q147909
  TITLE : Troubleshooting MacVolume Creation Errors


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

NOTE: The above link is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

To work around this problem, increase the non-paged pool memory available to
kernel or reduce the number of files on the SFM volume. The amount of non-paged
pool available to kernel is a fixed value that is based upon the total RAM in
the system. If you increase the RAM you will increase the non- paged pool
available to kernel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem will generally only occur on a partition with 100,000 or more files
that take up 7 to 8 GB or more disk space. When a SFM volume is created, the
service will start indexing the partition. The indexing routines create memory
structures that consume a large amount of non- paged pool memory and if your
volume is large enough and has enough files, you will run out of non-paged pool
and the system will stop responding. In most cases, this results in a STOP 0x24
in NTFS, although it can occur when another kernel-mode driver attempts to
allocate resources that require non-paged pool memory.

The system may simply be slow and unresponsive for the first 20 to 40 minutes
after creating the Macintosh volume. This is because of the large amount of
kernel memory being used by SFM. If SFM is able to complete the indexing without
running out of non-paged pool memory the memory will be freed and the system
will return to normal. There should be no problems after this unless enough
changes occur that a full re-indexing is necessary. In this case, SFM will have
to repeat the procedure.

The simplest way to identify this problem is to run Performance Monitor after you
create the SFM volume and watch the Memory\Pool Nonpaged Bytes counter. If a
constant increase in non-paged pool bytes occurs over a 20 to 30 minute period
of time, resulting in large amount (20 to 30 MB or more) of non-paged pool, you
may be experiencing this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
