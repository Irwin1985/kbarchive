SUMMARY
=======

By default, Windows NT 4.0 unattended setup uses a detection method to determine
which video driver to use. If no video driver can be initialized, the default
VGA driver will be used.

The following types of video adapters are known not to be automatically detected
in Windows NT 4.0:

- 8514a

- Trident

- VGA


MORE INFORMATION
================

To prepare for the installation of an OEM video driver, perform the following
steps:

1. Copy the I386 directory from the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc to a server, and
  then share the directory.

2. In the I386 directory, create an $OEM$ directory.

3. In the $OEM$ directory, create a Textmode directory.

4. Copy the OEM video drivers to the Textmode directory created in Step
  3(XXXXXXXX.dll, XXXXXXXX.sys).

5. Create a Txtsetup.oem file and place it in the Textmode directory. This file
  tells Windows NT Setup how to install the DLL and SYS drivers, and how to
  configure the registry.

  To simplify the creation of the Txtsetup.oem file, copy the example provided
  and save it as Txtsetup.oem.

  The following is the format for Txtsetup.oem. In most cases, this file
  requires very little modification:

  [Disks]
  d1 = "OEM Video Disk",\OEMVideo.tag,\ 

  [Defaults]
  DISPLAY = S3Virge

  [DISPLAY]
  S3Virge = "S3 Virge - OEM"

  [Files.display.S3Virge]
  driver = d1,s3virge.sys,s3virge
  dll = d1,s3virge.dll

  [Config.s3virge]
  value=device0,InstalledDisplayDrivers,REG_MULTI_SZ,S3ViRGE
  value=device0,VgaCompatible,REG_DWORD,0

  This is a standard Txtsetup.oem file that installa the S3 Virge video driver
  that is supplied in the Drvlib directory on the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc.

6. Add OEMPreInstall = YES to the [Unattended] section of the answer file.

  This is used to tell Setup that the $OEM$ directory is going to be used during
  setup. For example:

  [Unattended]
  OemPreInstall = Yes

7. Ensure that the NtUpgrade value in the Unattend section of Unattend.txt is
  not set to Yes.

  [Unattended]
  NtUpgrade = yes

  If NtUpgrade is set to Yes, the installation appears to run normally, but the
  OEM drivers will not be installed. If you need NtUpgrade set to Yes, you can
  perform the following steps to automate the procedure:

  a. Use the RunOnce key as described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
     article:

  Q167012 Setting Control Panel Tools to Start After Unattended Setup

  b. Place the command "Rundll32 Shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL Desk.cpl @0,3"
     (case sensitive) in the Run-once key to bring up the desktop tool and have
     it open to the Settings tab.

  c. You can then create a script that installs the OEM drivers.

8. Add the [DisplayDrivers] section to the answer file.

  [DisplayDrivers]
  "S3 Virge - OEM" = "OEM"

  [Display]
  BitsPerPel = 16
  XResolution = 800
  YResolution = 600
  VRefresh = 60
  AutoConfirm = 1

9. Add the [OEMBootFIles] section to the answer file.

  [OEMBootfiles]
  S3VIRGE.SYS
  S3VIRGE.DLL
  TXTSETUP.OEM

  The example provided is only part of the answer file needed for a complete
  Windows NT 4.0 unattended installation.

The following is an example for the Matrox Millennium drivers supplied by Matrox
from its download service. Steps 1-8 above are the same, the difference being
the name of the driver files, option name, and the registry options.

  [Disks]
  d1 = "OEM Video Disk",\oemvideo.tag,\ 

  [Defaults]
  DISPLAY = MGA64

  [DISPLAY]
  MGA64 = "my mga64 driver - oem"

  [Files.display.mga64]
  driver = d1,mga64.sys,mga64
  dll = d1,mga64.dll

  [Config.mga64]
  value=device0,InstalledDisplayDrivers,REG_MULTI_SZ,mga64
  value=device0,VgaCompatible,REG_DWORD,0

The following is an example of the required information needed in the unattended
answer file:

  [Unattended]
  OemPreInstall = Yes

  [DisplayDrivers]
  "my mga64 driver - oem" = "OEM"

  [Display]
  BitsPerPel = 16
  XResolution = 800
  YResolution = 600
  VRefresh = 60
  AutoConfirm = 1

  [OEMBootfiles]
  MGA64.SYS
  MGA64.DLL
  TXTSETUP.OEM

NOTE: This method of installing video drivers will only install the video driver
itself. Additional utilities or applications provided by the manufacturer will
have to be installed through other methods. Contact the video driver vendor for
information on automation options for their products.

The products listed here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
