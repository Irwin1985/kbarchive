-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the SNA Server 3.0 client for Windows 3.x to use named pipes
as the transport, the Enter Domain Credentials dialog box appears after the
client is started.

NOTE: This will only occur on a Windows for Workgroups (WFW) 3.x system if
Password Caching is disabled. Windows 3.x does not support password caching.
This also occurs when the SNA Server client for Windows 3.x is installed on a
Windows 95/98 system because password caching is not supported.

CAUSE
=====

Changes were made to the SNA Server 3.0 Windows 3.x client to support the data
encryption feature that was added in SNA Server 3.0. The Windows 3.x client was
using the NTLM logon process for validation by the SNA Server; this caused the
extra security Enter Domain Credentials dialog box to appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two resolutions to the problem that will prevent the Enter Domain
Credentials dialog box from being displayed:

- Enable password caching if the Windows 3.x SNA Server client is installed on
  a Windows for Workgroups 3.x system.

  -or-

- Do not enable Client/Server Encryption for Users/Groups in SNA Server Manager
  upgrade to SNA Server client for Windows 3.x version 3.0 SP1 or later.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA Server client for Windows 3.x versions 3.0 SP1 and later have been
updated to include a parameter that is used to specify the logon method used for
the SNA application (non-sponsor) connection to SNA Server. The following
parameter can be added to the [WNAP] section of the Win.ini file:

  LastLogonMethod=&lt;value&gt;

Where &lt;value&gt; is either LSA or NTLM.

The default value is LSA if the parameter is not defined in the Win.ini.

Prior to adding the LastLogonMethod parameter, the Enter Domain Credentials
dialog box was displayed even if Client/Server Encryption was not being used
when the client was configured to use Microsoft Networking (Named Pipes) to
communicate with SNA Server. This is because the NTLM logon method was always
being used.

The following apply if using the SNA Server client for Windows 3.x versions 3.0
SP1 or later:

- If Client/Server Encryption is being used, LastLogonMethod=NTLM has to be
  specified in the Win.ini.

- If the SNA Server client for Windows 3.x is configured in the following
  manner, the Enter Domain Credentials dialog box will continue to be displayed
  the first time an SNA application is started after WFW (or Windows 95/98) is
  started:

   - Microsoft Networking (that is, Named Pipes) is used for the SNA Server
     client protocol.

   - Client/Server Encryption is enabled for the user.

   - LastLogonMethod=NTLM in the Win.ini.

   - Password caching on WFW disabled or on Windows 95/98 if the SNA client is
     installed on Windows 95/98.

The Enter Domain Credentials dialog box will be displayed when using this
configuration even if the user has logged onto the Windows NT Domain that
contains the SNA Server because the User Credentials are not available to the
SNA Server client for logon validation because password caching is not enabled.

As long as the user does not exit WFW or restart Windows 95/98, the Enter Domain
Credentials dialog box will not appear after the initial information is entered
even if the SNA application is stopped and restarted.
