SUMMARY
=======

The Visual Basic 5.0 debugger allows you to debug your code at design time
before you compile it into an .exe, .dll, or .ocx. If you are debugging Visual
Basic-created COM components, you can debug them out-of-process by running
multiple projects in the same instance of Visual Basic 5.0, or by running
separate instances of Visual Basic 5.0 with the client running in one and the
COM component running in the other.

If you want to debug your components after they are compiled, you cannot use the
Visual Basic 5.0 debugger because it will only debug them at design time. To
debug a compiled Visual Basic component, you will need to use the functionality
of the Visual C++ 5.0 debugger. The following are situations when you may need
to debug a compiled Visual Basic component:

- if you are creating an ActiveX control for use in a container other than
  Visual Basic 5.0.
- in an application execution environment such as Microsoft Transaction Server
  where you are only allowed to run compiled .dlls.
- if you suspect your Visual Basic component is behaving differently at design
  time than it is compiled.

This article explains how to do this within the Microsoft Developer Studio
environment. You will need to have Visual Basic 5.0 and Visual C++ 5.0 installed
on your development machine to follow this example.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps assume that you already have a Visual Basic 5.0-created
Standard EXE (.exe), ActiveX DLL (.dll), ActiveX EXE (.exe), or ActiveX Control
(.ocx) that you want to debug.

1. In Visual Basic 5.0, open the Visual Basic project that you want to debug.
  From the File menu, choose Make &lt;YourProject&gt;.exe. Click the Options
  button and select the Compile tab. Choose Compile to Native Code and Create
  Symbolic Debug Info. Then select OK, and OK again to compile your component.

2. From the Visual C++ 5.0 File menu, choose Open Workspace. In the Open
  Workspace dialog, set Files of Type to All files(*.*), and then select your
  compiled component.

3. Again from the Visual C++ 5.0 File menu, choose Open (not Open Workspace),
  and open the Visual Basic module (.bas), form (.frm), or class (.cls) that
  you want to debug. Set break points (F9), watches, step-through instructions,
  etc., that you would for a normal program. You may also want to display
  variable information in the debug environment by going to the Visual C++ 5.0
  Tools menu, selecting Options, and then selecting the Debug tab. In the Debug
  tab, place a check next to Display unicode strings.

  Variables on a separate thread cannot be watched. An example would be a
  background thread with an .ocx or a hidden vb background thread. Visual Basic
  globals are per-apartment or single-thread, so you will not see them on the
  stack if it is on another thread.

  a. Standard EXE: From the Build menu in Visual C++ 5.0, select Start Debug
     then Go, or press the F5 key. When your Visual Basic compiled component
     reaches the line you set a breakpoint on, it will stop in Visual C++ 5.0
     and allow you to perform normal debug operations.

  b. ActiveX EXE, DLL, or OCX: It is a little different for DLLs in that you
     have to specify an exe to debug with. To do this, from the Project menu
     select Settings, and then click the Debug tab. In the Executable for debug
     session text box specify the .exe file that references your .dll. Now
     follow step 4a which will launch your executable and your .dll and the
     Visual C++ 5.0 debugger will come up where you set the breakpoint in your
     .dll.

  c. ActiveX DLL Running Under Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS): To set this
     up, select Settings from the Visual C++ 5.0 Project menu, and then click
     the Debug tab. In the Executable for debug session text box, specify
     MTX.EXE. Then, in the Program arguments text box place /p:{00000000-0000-
     0000-0000- 000000000000} where you would replace the 0's with the actual
     MTS Package ID. The Package ID can be obtained by examining the properties
     of your package in the Transaction Server Explorer. Following step 4a
     above which will launch MTX.EXE and your .dll. Now run the base client
     .exe that makes a call into your COM component running under MTS and the
     Visual C++ 5.0 debugger will come up where you set the breakpoint in your
     .dll.

The following are additional notes when debugging under MTS:

     1. Is the dll being called on the system path?

     2. Have you accidentally re-registered your com object's dll, thereby
        wiping out the MTS-alterations to the registry?

     3. Might you have multiple copies of your com object's dll laying around,
        and you're setting breakpoints in the one that doesn't get loaded?

     4. Similarly to 3, might you have multiple copies of your non-com dll
        laying around?

     5. There was one seemingly very stupid trick which was that you should
        copy your DLL with symbolic Information to the MTS directory and from
        there add that DLL as a package to the MTS explorer. If you do not do
        this, symbolic debugging inside the MTS component does not work.

        Also, make sure you kill all running mtx.exe's before starting up your
        copy in the debugger. When you start it up, does it run or does it
        shutdown immediately? Note any event log messages logged by MTS. To
        start from a safe starting point, you might want to completely delete
        your application, then recreate it, reinstall your component's dll,
        etc.

  d. ActiveX DLL Running Under Internet Information Server (IIS): Because IIS
     runs as an NT Service, you will need to give yourself permission to act as
     part of the operation system. To do this, go to NT Administrative Tools
     and select User Manager. If you are using User Manager for Domains in NT
     Server, make sure you have selected your machine name as the Domain from
     the File menu. Then, choose User Rights from the Policies menu. In the
     User Rights dialog box, place a check next to Show Advanced User Rights
     and select "Act as part of the operating system" from the combo box. Click
     the Add button and type in "domainxxx\userxxx" in the text area, or select
     your username from the listbox. Click OK and you should now have the
     correct privileges. To start the debugging session in Visual C++ 5.0, go
     to the Build menu, select Start Debug, then Attach to Process. Place a
     check next to Show System Processes, then select inetinfo and click OK.
     Now load a client .htm or .asp file that will make a call into your
     ActiveX component. If you follow the directions in step 3 above, you
     should now be able to walk through your Visual Basic code.

  It has been noted that following the guidelines in step 4d of this
  article, the breakpoint is not hit. After some tries you might find
  that, in order for the breakpoint to be hit, it is necessary to load the
  DLL being debugged in the Additional DLLs project settings. Moreover,
  the breakpoint is not hit the first time that the HTML page is called,
  unless you set the breakpoint after attach to process has been made. It
  was tested under Windows NT 4.0 Workstation SP3 with Peer Web Services
  and Visual Studio SP2.


Another Visual C++ feature is the ability to do cross-process and cross- machine
debugging. If you are running in a debugger and call a .dll that has debugging
info, it will automatically start another instance of the debugger and the
source so that you can debug into it.

Note that if the .exe is compiled optimized for size or speed, lines of dead code
will be compiled out of the project.
