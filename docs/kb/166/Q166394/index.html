SUMMARY
=======

The linked list, which is a classical data structure with widespread
applicability in C++, can also be implemented in Visual Basic with the use of
Classes.

A linked list is a set of items organized sequentially, just like an array. In an
array, the sequential organization is provided implicitly (by position in the
array); in a linked list, you use an explicit arrangement in which each item is
part of a "node" that also contains a "link" to the next node.

The primary advantage of linked lists over arrays is that linked lists can grow
and shrink in size during their lifetimes. In particular, their maximum size
need not be known in advance. A secondary advantage is that they provide
flexibility in allowing the items to be rearranged efficiently without actually
moving any data contained in the list.

A disadvantage of a linked list is that operations such as referencing a specific
element in the list require you to walk the entire list from head to tail. In an
array, this could simply be done by accessing an (n). Another operation that
does not work with a linked list is finding an item before a given item. To get
around these limitations, you can build a doubly-linked list in which two links
for each node are maintained, one to the item before and one to the item after.
The cost of providing this extra capability is doubling the number of link
manipulations per basic operation. This article will only demonstrate a simple
linked list, not a doubly-linked list.

================

Sample Program
--------------

The following example creates a linked list of 20 nodes, and then reverses it
using a function named ReverseList. Each node in the list is actually an
instance of a Visual Basic Class created with the New keyword.

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic and choose "Standard EXE." Form1 is
  created by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Add Class Module, Class1 is created by default.
  In the Properties window of the new class module, change the name from Class1
  to "Node," then Paste the following code into the General Declarations
  section of Node:

        Public key As Integer          'var to hold some data
        Public pnext As node           'pointer to next node in list

3. Add a Command button, Command1, to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1:

        Dim head As node               'object pointer to head of list
        Private Sub Form_Load()
          Dim curr As node             'object pointer to current pos in
          Dim i As Integer             'list used in For loop

          'CREATE LIST
          Set head = New node          'object pointer to new node
          head.Key = 0                 'dummy head
          Set curr = head              'keep head pointer here
          For i = 1 To 20              'iterate n times to fill list
            Set curr.pnext = New node  'insert new node after current
            Set curr = curr.pnext      'set current one = new node
            curr.Key = i               'set new node key value
          Next i
          Set curr.pnext = New node    'dummy tail
          Set curr = curr.pnext        'move current to dummy tail
          curr.Key = 0                 'set value of dummy tail
          Set curr.pnext = curr        'points to itself to identify end

          Debug.Print "before: " &amp; DumpList(head) 'print list
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command1_click()
          'RERVERSE LIST
          ReverseList head             'pass in head to ReverseList
          Debug.Print "after: " &amp; DumpList(head)  'print reversed list
        End Sub

        Private Sub ReverseList(ByRef head As node)
          'reverse entire list including dummy head and tail
          'Note: head becomes tail, tail becomes head
          Dim curr As node             'object pointer to current node
          Dim nexx As node             'object pointer to next node
          Set curr = head.pnext        'current to node after head
          Set head.pnext = head        'turn head into tail
          While Not curr.pnext Is curr 'walk entire list
            Set nexx = curr.pnext      'pointer to node after current
            Set curr.pnext = head      'current points back to head
            Set head = curr            'move head to current
            Set curr = nexx            'set current = next node
          Wend
          Set curr.pnext = head        'point new head to first node
          Set head = curr              'return head to first position
        End Sub

        Private Function DumpList(ByRef head As node) As String
          'walk list and dump to debug window
          Dim strOut As String         'temp var to hold string
          Dim curr As node             'object pointer to current node
          Set curr = head.pnext        'skip dummy head
          While Not curr.pnext Is curr 'walk rest of list to end
            strOut = strOut &amp; " " &amp; CStr(curr.Key)
            Set curr = curr.pnext      'current pointer to next node
          Wend
          DumpList = strOut            'return string
        End Function

5. Start the program or press the F5 key. A linked list of 20 nodes will be
  created.

6. Click the Command1 button to Reverse the list and print the results to the
  debug window.
