-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes a fairly automated procedure that you can use to deliver
updated Systems Management Server client files to all Systems Management Server
clients site-wide.

Systems Management Server tracks updates to the client files' version by means of
the CopyListVersion value in the following copy list files:

- Cl_nt.txt

- Cl_dos.txt

- Cl_os2.txt

- Cl_win95.txt

- Cl_win.txt

When Client Setup runs, it compares this value to the value in the [SMS] section
of the client's Sms.ini file. If the values differ, Client Setup forces the
client to go into a "verifying_files" mode that causes the client to compare all
of its Systems Management Server client files with those on the logon server. If
differences are found, the client obtains the updated files from the logon
server.

The upgrade that results from the procedure discussed in this article may cause
the Systems Management Server client to behave unexpectedly until the client has
completed a successful upgrade and been restarted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example details each step of this process as it should occur on
the server and the client.

On the Systems Management Server Site Server
--------------------------------------------

1. Make certain that any client files that have been updated are copied to the
  appropriate location under the SMS\Site.srv\Maincfg.box directory structure
  on the site server.

2. Use a text editor such as Notepad to open the System.map file located in the
  SMS directory, and save it WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES. Simply opening the
  System.map file in Notepad and saving it again gives it a new date/time
  stamp.

  NOTE: Other than saving it with a new date/time stamp, Microsoft does not
  support the modification of the copy list files or the System.map file.

3. On its next pass, the Systems Management Server Maintenance Manager service
  will detect the changed date/time stamp on the System.map file and regenerate
  the copy list files, because it assumes the site has been upgraded. When the
  copy list files are regenerated from the "new" System.map file, they will get
  a new CopyListVersion value.

Additionally, the Maintenance Manager service will copy all of the updated client
files to each of the Systems Management Server logon servers that this site
manages.

On the Systems Management Server Client
---------------------------------------

1. After running the Systems Management Server logon script (SMSLS), the client
  setup program Cli_dos.exe (or Cli_nt.exe for client computers running Windows
  NT), compares the CopyListVersion value in the [SMS] section of its Sms.ini
  file with the value stored in the corresponding copy list file on the Systems
  Management Server logon server. If a difference is found, the client will
  display the following message twice during the client logon process:

  Verifying Microsoft Systems Management Server client installation...

  Systems Management Server will normally display this message during the
  execution of the SMSLS logon script. However, after this completes, another
  logon script dialog will appear displaying the above message again if a
  change in the CopyListVersion was detected in the client's Sms.ini file.

2. Client Setup then updates the CopyListVersion value in the [SMS] section of
  the Sms.ini file, and changes the SetupPhase= statement in the [Local]
  section to "verify_files".

3. As the client's system continues to start up, Smsrun16.exe (or Smsrun32.exe
  for client computers running Windows NT) is run from the client's LOAD= line
  of the Win.ini file (for client computers running Windows NT, there is a Load
  value in the registry). When Smsrun16.exe finds that the SetupPhase value is
  set to "verify_files," it actually makes another call to the client setup
  (either Cli_dos.exe or Cli_nt.exe).


4. The second time that Client Setup runs, it again displays the message
  "Verifying Microsoft Systems Management Server client installation..." At
  this point, the file comparisons are made and updated files are downloaded to
  the client.

  NOTE: If it is determined that any of the client components normally started
  by Smsrun16.exe are running, no updates will be downloaded, and the
  SetupPhase will remain as "verifying_files." This will ensure that the files
  will be downloaded the next time the system is restarted and Smsrun16.exe is
  run.


5. After the updated files have been downloaded, the last step made by Client
  Setup is to change the SetupPhase value to "installed." Additionally, if any
  changes are made to any of the Systems Management Server client services,
  client computers running Windows NT may see a dialog box stating that the
  Systems Management Server Client has been modified and a restart is required
  for the changes to take effect.
