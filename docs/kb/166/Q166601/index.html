-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Move Mailbox command in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program is used
to move a mailbox from one server in a Microsoft Exchange Server site to another
server in the same site. After using this command, the user may log on to the
mailbox on the new server and find one or more folders and their contents
missing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each Microsoft Exchange mailbox contains the following default system folders:
Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, and Deleted Items. The problem mentioned in the
Symptoms section will occur if one of these default system folders has been
renamed and a new folder created with that default name. After moving the
mailbox, the renamed folder and its contents will not appear in the mailbox.

For example, the problem will occur if the server-based system folder "Inbox" is
renamed "My Inbox" and a new folder called "Inbox" is created. "My Inbox" will
remain a system folder and all new mail will be delivered to it.

After using the Move Mailbox command, the default system folder will be renamed
"Inbox" and will contain the mail from the non-system "Inbox" folder. The "My
Inbox" folder and its contents will not be in the mailbox.

This only occurs when the server-based folder is renamed and another folder
exists with the default name of the server-based folder. For example, if "Inbox"
is renamed "My Inbox" and there is no other folder named "Inbox," the contents
of "My Inbox" will exist on the new server in the "Inbox" folder after the Move
Mailbox Command has been executed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0. We are researching the problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, rename the non-system folder and then rename the system
folder to its original name before using the Move Mailbox Command.

If you have already used the Move Mailbox Command, the folder and its contents
will need to be recovered from the last full backup. For additional information
about recovering a single mailbox, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q163713 INF: XADM: Recovering a Single Mailbox from the Online Backup

After the single folder has been restored to a PST, it can be manually moved back
up to the server.
