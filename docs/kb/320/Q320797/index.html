-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Wuser32.exe Systems Management Server (SMS) Remote Control client agent
starts on a Microsoft Windows 98-based computer, the client may cause the
computer to stop responding (hang). When this occurs, only the mouse pointer
continues to work.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs if you are using the Intel 82830M video adapter driver
(Ialmdrv.drv) with the SMS Remote Control feature. Dell Latitude C400 laptop
computers (among others) use this driver. The SMS client was not updated to work
properly with all multiple-monitor-aware Windows 98 video adapter drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this fix for SMS 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) sites
should have the following file attributes or later:

  

  Date         Time   Version         Size       File name       Platform
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  01-Mar-2001  18:55  2.00.1493.3259     23,520  Coexist.dll         I386
  01-Mar-2001  18:55                         67  Compverremctrl.ini  I386
  01-Mar-2001  18:55  2.0.92.09         740,363  Remc16.exe          I386
  01-Mar-2001  18:55  2.0.92.09       1,360,348  Remctrl.exe         I386

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use the Ialmdrv.drv video adapter driver on Windows 98-based clients with
the SMS Remote Control agent installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Use the Hotfix Installer
------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based computers.

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the update file (Q320797.exe) and platform folders to the new folder.
  The folder structure must be arranged so that the update file is located one
  folder "above" the platform folders.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console, if it is running.

5. Run Q320797.exe, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

Manual Installation
-------------------

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfix files to the new folder.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console, if it is running.

5. Stop all SMS services.

6. Replace the Remc16.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl\&lt;Platform&gt; folder
  with the version from the hotfix.

7. Replace the Remctrl.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl\&lt;Platform&gt; folder
  with the version from the hotfix.

8. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl folder with the
  Compverremctrl.ini file from the hotfix. Note that you must rename the
  Compverremctrl.ini file to Compver.ini.

9. Restart all SMS services.
