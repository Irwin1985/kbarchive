SUMMARY
=======

This article describes known video-related issues that you can experience when
you play Microsoft Dungeon Siege. The information in this article is first
broken out by general issues and then by issues that have only been known to
happen on specific types of video hardware.

MORE INFORMATION
================

General Video Issues
--------------------

The following are general video related issues that you may experience when
starting or playing Dungeon Siege:

Startup Errors:

When you attempt to start Dungeon Siege, the game does not start and you may
receive one of the following errors:

- The games hangs on a black screen with little white dots in the lower
  left-hand corner.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q321084 Dungeon Siege: Game Stops During Startup at Black Screen

- Unable to enumerate any DirectDraw devices installed on this system.

To resolve this issue, check or enable Direct3D acceleration:

  1. Click Start, and then click Run.

  2. Type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  3. On the Display tab, verify that all DirectX features are enabled. If any
     are disabled, click Enable next to the feature.

     NOTE: if some DirectX features are unavailable, please verify that your
     video adapter meets the minimum requirements.

- Video Initialization Failed.

To resolve this issue, check the DDI (DirectDraw Interface) version:

  1. Click Start, and then click Run.

  2. Type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  3. Click "Save All Information" to save a Dxdiag.txt report.

  4. Click Desktop, and then click Save.

  5. Open the DxDiag.txt file on your desktop, and then locate the Display
     Devices section.

  6. Under this section find the line marked DDI Version.

     This must read 7 (or higher) for Dungeon Siege to function correctly. If it
     does not, download new drivers for your video card, if possible, or
     upgrade to new video card hardware.

- Your video hardware does not have enough memory.

To resolve this issue, check the amount of video memory:

  1. Click Start, and then click Run.

  2. Type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  3. On the Display tab, verify that the Approx. Total Memory is equal to 8.0
     megabytes (MB).

     The video card must have 8.0 MB, or higher, for Dungeon Siege to function
     correctly. If it does not, upgrade your video card hardware.

     NOTE: Because of video memory that may be in use at the time you run the
     DirectX Diagnostic Tool (DXDiag), this line may read slightly less than
     the actual total. For example, 7.5 MB for a 8.0 MB card.

- Your video chipset has been detected as not supporting the features required
  by Dungeon Siege.

To resolve this issue:

  1. If you are being informed that your video chipset does not support the
     features required by the game you will need to upgrade your video hardware
     for the game to work correctly.

  2. Obtain a new video hardware.

- For all video cards running in 32-bit mode, some effects like smoke and
  waterfall mist may appear too dark when they are viewed from a distance.
  Drivers available at the time of the Dungeon Siege release did not solve this
  problem.

  To resolve this issue, download and install the latest drivers from the
  appropriate manufacturer.
