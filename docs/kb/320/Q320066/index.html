-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or upgrade a client computer that is running Systems Management
Server (SMS) 2.0, a large temporary (.tmp) file may be created in the
%SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Core\Bin folder on the client computer. Typically, this file
is named ~glh000*.tmp. When this issue occurs, Clicore.exe may use 90 percent or
more of the client's CPU resources. The .tmp file grows until the client runs
out of hard disk space, and you receive an error message. The error message
states that the client installation did not succeed and to contact your
administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if the Clicore.exe file becomes corrupted as it is copied
to the client. This issue may also occur if the Clicore.exe file on the site
server, client access point (CAP), logon point, or client is corrupted. The
Clicore.exe file may be corrupted if any of the following conditions exist:

- The Clicore.exe file has a different time and date stamp than the Clicore.exe
  file in the SMS 2.0 source.

- The Clicore.exe file is a different size than the Clicore.exe file in the SMS
  2.0 source.

- When you run the "clicore.exe /x" command from a command prompt, a list of
  client installation files that are contained in the Clicore.exe file that are
  available for extraction does not appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this fix for SMS 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) sites
should have the following file attributes or later:

contains the above files may also contain additional files.



How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: This method works only for Intel-based computers.

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the update file (Q320066.exe) and platform folders to the new folder.
  Arrange the new folder structure so that the update file is located one
  folder "above" the platform folders.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console, if it is running.

5. Run Q320066.exe, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

Manual Installation:

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfix files to the new folder.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console, if it is running.

5. Stop all SMS services.

6. Replace the Boot32nd.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version from the
  hotfix.

7. Replace the Boot32nw.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version from the
  hotfix.

8. Replace the Boot32wn.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version from the
  hotfix.

9. Restart all SMS services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Corrupted Clicore.exe files have occurred in two scenarios:

- The more common variation of this problem is addressed in hotfix Q287990. In
  this case, the corruption occurs during the remote client installation. The
  Q287990 hotfix includes changes to the server-side components that are
  responsible for remote client installation.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q287990 Large .tmp File Is Created When You Install or Upgrade an SMS
  2.0-based Client

- The hotfix that is described in this article addresses a less common
  variation of the problem. In this case, files may become corrupted while the
  client copies files to itself.

You can apply both of these hotfixes if you suspect that you are experiencing the
issue that is described in this article. The hotfixes are complementary; they
contain different files. The hotfix that is described in this article contains
client-side files. The Q287990 hotfix contains server-side files.
