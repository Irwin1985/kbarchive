SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience problems with your application if you use time zone

3. Click Schedule and then click New.

4. On the Location tab, type "Directory Path" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click Report.

5. On the Date and Time tab, enter a start time between 15:00 and 24:00, and
