SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience various problems when you use the DELL/Samsung SM-308 and
SN-308B DVD-ROM drive (the Dell Combo drive) to install Visual Studio .NET (VS
.NET) or the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library.

The issues described in this article can occur when you install VS .NET or its
components, including the MSDN Library, but may not be noticeable until after
the installation has completed.

The following are some of the more common errors:

- Various files are missing or read errors during setup.

- You may receive the following error message when you start VS .NET or the
  MSDN Library:

  Help Update in Progress

  Typically, this error message is followed by a Dr. Watson window, or you may
  receive the following error message:

  Microsoft development environment has encountered an error and needs to
  close.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because some files are not read properly from the DVD-ROM
during the file copy phase of the setup process; some files may become
corrupted.

During some occurrences, you may receive an error message. During other
occurences, you do not receive an error message and the file is copied without
errors; however, a piece of the file is corrupted after the file is copied to
your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Firmware updates should resolve this issue:

Desktop - Dimension 8200 - SM-308B Half Height, DVD/CDRW Combo SM-308B drive

- A firmware upgrade for the T104 drive will be posted to the Dell Support Web
  site:

  (Search by your computer system, your operating system, and Removable Media
  Storage Devices.)

Notebook - Inspiron 8100 - SN-308B Slim Line drive
