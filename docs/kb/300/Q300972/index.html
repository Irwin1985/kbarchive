-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Indexing Service, used with:
   - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Advanced Server 
   - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Professional 
   - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Server 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The Indexing service in Microsoft Windows XP Beta is also affected by the vulnerability. Microsoft is working directly with the small number of customers who are using the Beta in production environments to provide remediation for them. For more information, see the FAQ portion of the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-033.asp

SYMPTOMS
========

As part of its installation process, IIS installs several ISAPI extensions.
These are dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that provide extended functionality.
Among these is Idq.dll, which is a component of Index Server (known in Windows
2000 as Indexing Service) that provides support for administrative scripts
(these are Internet Data Administration, or .ida, files) and Internet Data Query
(.idq) files.

A security vulnerability results because Idq.dll contains an unchecked buffer in
a section of code that handles input URLs. An attacker who can establish a Web
session with a server on which Idq.dll is installed can conduct a buffer overrun
attack and execute code on the Web server. Idq.dll runs in the System context,
so exploiting the vulnerability gives the attacker complete control of the
server and allows him to take any desired action on it.

The buffer overrun occurs before any indexing functionality is requested. As a
result, even though Idq.dll is a component of Index Server/Indexing Service, the
service does not need to be running for an attacker to exploit the
vulnerability. As long as the script mapping for .idq or .ida files is present,
and the attacker is able to establish a Web session, he can exploit the
vulnerability.

Clearly, this is a serious vulnerability, and Microsoft urges all customers to
take action immediately. Customers who cannot install the patch can protect
their systems by removing the script mappings for .idq and .ida files by using
the Internet Services Manager in IIS. However, it is possible for these mappings
to be automatically reinstated if additional system components are added or
removed. Because of this, Microsoft recommends that all customers using IIS
install the patch, even if the script mappings have been removed. For more
information, see the FAQ portion of the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-033.asp

Mitigating Factors
------------------

- The vulnerability can only be exploited if a Web session can be established
  with an affected server. Customers who have installed Index Server or Index
  Services but not IIS are not at risk. This is the default case for Windows
  2000 Professional.

- The vulnerability cannot be exploited if the script mappings for .ida and
  .idq files are not present. The procedure for removing the mappings is
  discussed in the IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0 Security checklists; they can be
  automatically removed with either the High Security Template or the Windows
  2000 Internet Server Security Tool. Customers should be aware, however, that
  subsequently adding or removing system components can cause the mapping to be
  reinstated, as discussed in the FAQ.

  For more information, see the following Microsoft Web sites:

   - IIS 4.0

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/iischk.asp

   - IIS 5.0

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/iis5chk.asp

   - Windows 2000 Internet Server Security Tool

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools.asp

- An attacker's ability to extend control from a compromised Web server to
  other computers depends heavily on the specific configuration of the network.
  Best practices recommend that the network architecture account for the
  inherent high risk that computers in an uncontrolled environment, like the
  Internet, face by minimizing overall exposure though measures such as
  demilitarized zones (DMZs), operating with minimal services and isolating
  contact with internal networks. Steps like this can limit overall exposure
  and impede an attacker's ability to broaden the scope of a possible
  compromise.

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

NOTE: Customers who apply this patch on Windows 2000-based computers that are
running Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) may also need to apply an
additional hotfix. Although it is unrelated to this particular patch, a known
issue can cause the WMI process (Winmgmt.exe) to stop responding (hang) and
consume 100 percent of CPU resources and memory if a program queries for the
Win32_QuickFixEngineering objects. For example, this can occur when Microsoft
Systems Management Server (SMS) queries WMI to determine which hotfixes have
been applied. For additional information about how to resolve this problem,

Base:

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Windows 2000
Service Pack 1 or later.


Windows NT 4.0 Server

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was

changes to the file.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date         Version     Size     File name
  -------------------------------------------
  03-Jul-2001  5.0.1782.4  193,296  Idq.dll

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a.

The original patched English version of this fix had the following file
attributes:

  Date         Version     Size     File name
  -------------------------------------------
  25-May-2001  5.00.1782.4  193,296  Idq.dll

NOTE: The Idq.dll file has been re-released to correct a file version issue.
Specifically, the Idq.dll version number in the original patch (dated May 25,
2001) was not incremented from that of the previous build (dated January 25,
2001). Instead, the version number for both was 5.0.1781.3. A new version of the
patch was released on August 2, 2001, containing an Idq.dll file dated July 03,
2001, that was properly versioned with version number 5.0.1782.4. No other
changes were made in the new version of the patch.

If you installed the original version of this patch (Idq.dll version 5.0.1781.3,
dated May 25, 2001), you do not need to apply the new version (Idq.dll version
5.0.1782.4, dated July 03, 2001) because your system is already protected.
However, if the version of the Idq.dll file on your computer is 5.0.1781.3,
dated January 25, 2000, you should upgrade to the new version of the patch.




Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

Index Server 2.0 is part of the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack which is not supported
on Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. Patches for Index Server 2.0
