-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The error "Conversation was Deallocated with AP_ABEND" occurs when you are
running an application (or sending code from an Active Server Pages page) to
connect via TCP/IP through SNA Server's OLEDB Provider for AS400/VSAM to an
AS400.

The application will run fine the first time. If you disconnect and rerun the
application, the error occurs. However, if you disconnect again and rerun the
same application another time, everything works fine. (The error occurs every
other time.)

Another symptom of the problem is an error in the AS400 QSYSOPR Log "DDM TCP/IP
server error occurred with reason code 7". The complete error entry is as
follows:

  

  Message ID . . . . . . : CPD3E33 Severity . . . . . . . : 40 
  Message type . . . . . : Diagnostic 
  Date sent . . . . . . : 03/06/01 Time sent . . . . . . : 07:55:37 
  Message . . . . : DDM TCP/IP server error occurred with reason code 7. 
  Cause . . . . . : An error with reason code 7 occurred during DRDA/DDM 
  TCP/IP server processing. The name of the server program is QRWTLSTN. The 
  reason codes and their meanings are as follows: 
  1 -- Resolve to the QRWTLSTN program failed. 
  2 -- Retrieval of the QRWTLSTN program lock failed. 
  3 -- Submit job to start the server job failed. 
  4 -- Allocation of the QRWTLSTN program failed. 
  5 -- Starting of the server job failed. 
  6 -- Ending of the server job failed. 
  7 -- Activation of the server job failed.
  8 -- Processing of the start server request failed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem can be resolved by changing the "Maximum number of uses" value in
the QRWTSRVR job to "1" (the default is 200).

First verify what MAXUSE value you are currently using by performing the
following:

1. From an AS400 command prompt, type "wrksbsd (qsys/qsyswrk)" (without the
  quotation marks) and press ENTER.

2. Press DOWN ARROW to QSYSWRK and type "5" (without the quotation marks) (for
  "Display").

3. Select option 10 - Prestart Job Entries.

4. Press DOWN ARROW to QRWTSRVR and type "5" (without the quotation marks)
  (Display).

5. Look at the "Maximum number of uses" value.

  If the value is greater than 1, type the following at an AS400 command prompt,
  and then press ENTER:

  "CHGPJE SBSD(QSYS/QSYSWRK) PGM(QSYS/QRWTSRVR) MAXUSE(1)" (without the
  quotation marks)

This change will take effect immediately.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Maximum number of uses" setting is for the maximum number of requests that
can be handled by each prestart job in the pool before the job will be ended.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The problem can be reproduced using the RLIO_VB.exe sample application (which is
included with SNA Server and Host Integration Server):

1. Run RLIO_VB.exe (which is located in the &lt;SNAROOT&gt;\System folder.

2. Click Connect, type the path for UDL to connect to AS400, and then press
  ENTER.

3. Click Open RS (Record Set), type a valid RS, and then click OK.

4. Click Close RS.

5. Click Disconnect.

6. Try to use the same UDL file to reconnect.

The error will occur.
