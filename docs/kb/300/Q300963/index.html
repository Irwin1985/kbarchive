SUMMARY
=======

The games listed above include an Error Reporting tool that you can use to
report unrecoverable errors (for example, general protection faults or invalid
page faults) to Microsoft over the Internet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an unrecoverable error occurs, you receive the following error message:

  &lt;Game&gt; has encountered a problem and
  needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.

  If you were in the middle of something, the information you were working on
  may be lost.

  Please tell Microsoft about this problem.
  We have created an error report that you can send to help us improve
  &lt;Game&gt;. We will treat this report as confidential and anonymous.

  To see what data this error report contains, click here.

If you choose to send an error report, Microsoft will analyze the fault data and
attempt to identify and correct the issues involved. At the time of reporting,
the Error Reporting tool checks to see if the issue that you have encountered
has already been fixed. While the tool checks, an Error Reporting dialog box
opens that indicates that the tool is preparing an error report.

If a patch or workaround exists for the specific issue that you reported, the
Error Reporting tool directs you to the appropriate Web site, where you can
download the patch or workaround. If you are not prompted to download a patch or
workaround, and you need support for the issue that you reported, please browse
to the following Microsoft Web site for support options:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?PR=gms

The Error Reporting tool provides a new dialog box for unrecoverable errors,
which you can use to send an error report to Microsoft. You can also view the
data that the report contains, choose not to send individual reports to
Microsoft, or view the Microsoft data-collection policy for this tool. To view
the data-collection policy, browse to the following Microsoft Web site:
