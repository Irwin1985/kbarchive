SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use Internet Services Manager to create a new
virtual Web site that has its own IP address.

Requirements
------------

- A static Internet Protocol (IP) address for the Web site to use.

- A Windows Web server that is running either Internet Information Server (IIS)
  4.0 or Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0.

- Administrative rights on the server computer.

How to Create the Content Folder
--------------------------------

NOTE: If you have already created a folder that you want to use as the content
for your new Web site, you can skip this section and proceed to the next
section.

1. Right-click the Windows Start menu, and then click Explore to open Windows
  Explorer.

2. Click the drive in which you want to place the content directory for the new
  Web site.

3. On the File menu, point to New, and then click Folder.

4. Type a name for the folder (for example, type "Webcontent" (without the
  quotation marks)), and then press ENTER key.

5. On the File menu, click Close to close Windows Explorer.

How to Create the Virtual Web Site on IIS 4.0 or IIS 5.0
--------------------------------------------------------

To create the virtual Web site on IIS 4.0 or IIS 5.0, use the steps in one of the
following sections.

IIS 4.0:

1. On the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack,
  point to Microsoft Internet Information Services, and then click Internet
  Services Manager.

  NOTE: Do not click Internet Services Manager (HTML).

2. In the Console tree in the left pane, right-click your computer name, point
  to New, and then click Web Site.

3. On the first page of the Web Site Creation Wizard, type a name for the site
  (for example, type "mywebsite" (without the quotation marks)), and click
  Next.

4. On the second page, in the Enter the IP address drop-down list box, click the
  IP address that you have assigned to this Web site. Leave the Port number at
  the default (which is normally 80). If you do not have Secure Sockets Layer
  (SSL) on the server, the SSL Port text box is unavailable (grayed out);
  otherwise, the default is 443. Click Next.

  For more information about IP addressing, Host Headers, and SSL, see IIS Help
  at the following location on your IIS computer:

  http://localhost/iisHelp/iis/misc/default.asp

5. On the third page, click Browse. Browse to the content folder that you
  created in Section 2 (for example, the Webcontent folder). If this Web site
  is intended for public use, make sure that the "Allow anonymous access to
  this Web Site" check box is selected. If this Web site is meant to be
  available to specific users only, clear this check box. Click Next.

6. On the fourth page, select the Read and Run scripts (such as ASP) check
  boxes. Make sure that the other check boxes are cleared. Click Finish to
  complete the wizard.

IIS 5.0:

1. On the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then
  click Internet Services Manager.

2. In the Console tree in the left pane, right-click your computer name, point
  to New, and then click Web Site.

3. On the first page of the Web Site Creation Wizard, click Next.

4. On the second page, type a name for the site (for example, type "mywebsite"
  (without the quotation marks)), and then click Next.

5. On the third page, in the Enter the IP address drop-down list box, click the
  IP address that you have assigned to this Web site. Leave the Port number at
  the default (which is normally 80), and leave the "Host Header for this site"
  text box blank. Click Next.

  For more information about IP addressing, Host Headers, and SSL, see IIS Help
  at the following location on your IIS computer:

  http://localhost/iisHelp/iis/misc/default.asp

6. On the fourth page, click Browse. Browse to the content folder that you
  created in Section 2 (for example, the Webcontent folder). If this Web site
  is intended for public use, make sure that the "Allow anonymous access to
  this Web Site" check box is selected. If this Web site is intended to be
  available to specific users only, clear this check box. Click Next.

7. On the fifth page, select the Read and Run scripts (such as ASP) check boxes.
  Make sure that the other boxes are cleared. Click Next, and then click Finish
  to complete the wizard.
