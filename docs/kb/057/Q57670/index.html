The LOCATE statement can be used to turn the cursor off. This is done
by passing zero (0) as the third parameter, as in the following
example:

   LOCATE ,,0

However, the ability of LOCATE to turn off the cursor is disabled when
interrupt 10 hex, function 11 hex, subfunction 0 is called. In fact,
the interrupt routine itself turns the cursor on. This interrupt call
(which requires an EGA card and the use of SCREEN 0) causes the video
card to use a block of memory in RAM for generating ASCII characters,
rather than the ROM default ASCII characters.

To turn the cursor off in this instance, interrupt 10 hex, function 1
must be called. The program below illustrates how this is done.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 for MS-DOS, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and
6.00b for MS-DOS, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

It's not just using the RAM font instead of the ROM font that causes
the problem. Once interrupt 10 hex, function 11 hex, subfunction 0 is
called, the LOCATE statement cannot turn the cursor off during the
entire execution of the program. That is, even if you load the default
ROM font back in by calling interrupt 10 hex, function 11 hex,
subfunction 0, the LOCATE statement still will not work properly.

The following code example illustrates the problem. In the comments of
this example, the word "block" refers to the block of RAM where the
new character definition will be. Note that, for simplicity, the
example redefines only one character and leaves the rest in their
default state.

'This example requires an EGA card; VGA will not work.

' $INCLUDE: 'qb.bi'        'Load interrupt routines and types.
DIM Regs AS RegTypeX       'Stores values of registers.
DIM Table AS STRING * 14   'This will hold the definition for one
                           'character (14 rows high, 8 bits wide).

   POKE VARPTR(Table) + i, 255   'All 255s will appear as a solid
NEXT i                           'rectangle.

                            'Put font at table 0.

Regs.ES = VARSEG(Table(0))  'Segment of block.
Regs.BP = VARPTR(Table(0))  'Offset of block.

CALL InterruptX(&amp;H10, Regs, Regs)  'Call interrupt &amp;H10.
                                   'The cursor will turn on.

LOCATE ,,0   'Cursor will not turn off.

'The following interrupt call will cause the video card to use the

'the cursor.
