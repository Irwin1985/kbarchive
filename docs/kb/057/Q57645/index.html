The following two situations might cause an "Illegal function call"
error when attempting to SHELL under OS/2:

1. In the OS/2 DOS 3.x compatibility box, a program can generate an
   "Illegal function call" if the COMSPEC environment variable is
   placed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT. Under OS/2, COMSPEC should be defined
   only in the CONFIG.SYS file.

2. In an OS/2 protected mode session, "Illegal function call" on a
   SHELL can be generated if the parameter /E:xxxx is used to attempt
   to set the environment size on the CMD.EXE command interpreter. The
   CMD.EXE command interpreter will accept this parameter, but it will
   then prevent you from SHELLing another copy of CMD.EXE. To correct
   this problem, remove the COMSPEC from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and make
   sure it is in the CONFIG.SYS. Also delete the parameter /E:xxxx
   after CMD.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 under MS OS/2 real mode, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions
6.00 and 6.00b under MS OS/2 real and protected modes, and to
Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) 7.00 under MS
OS/2 real and protected modes.

To reproduce the problem, do the following:

1. Place the following lines in the CONFIG.SYS file for OS/2:

      SET COMSPEC=C:\OS2\CMD.EXE /P /E:1024
      SET SHELL=C:\OS2\COMMAND.COM /P /E:1024

2. Place the following statement in the OS/2 AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      SET COMSPEC=C:\OS2\COMMAND.COM /P /E:1024

   Note: The path names to CMD.EXE and COMMAND.COM may be different on
   your system, depending on how you installed OS/2.

3. Reboot your computer with the new settings.

4. Do one of the following, depending on whether you are in real
   (MS-DOS) or protected mode:

   a. Load QB.EXE or QBX.EXE in real mode (DOS 3.x box) and either
      choose DOS Shell from the File menu, execute the word "SHELL"
      in the immediate window, or execute a program that contains only
      the word "SHELL." Each of these will produce the "illegal
      function  call" error in QB and QBX.EXE.

   b. Under OS/2 protected mode, execute a BASIC 6.00, 6.00b,or 7.00
      compiled program whose only statement is SHELL to show the
      problem.

To eliminate the problem, remove the COMSPEC statement from the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, delete the /P /E:1024 after CMD.EXE, and reboot.

The Command Interpreter (COMMAND.COM) Under DOS
-----------------------------------------------

Under DOS 3.x, 4.00, and 4.01, the COMSPEC environment variable is
defined in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The SET COMSPEC= statement gives DOS
a path for where the DOS command interpreter COMMAND.COM is located on
the disk.

Under DOS, a SHELL= command defined in the CONFIG.SYS file tells DOS
the name of your command interpreter. This at first may not seem
useful, but this feature was provided so that you can write your own
command interpreter. You can place the name of your command
interpreter in the SHELL= statement for DOS to load that command
interpreter at boot time. However, most people use COMMAND.COM as
their command interpreter in both the SET COMSPEC= and SHELL= commands
under DOS.

If you want to set the environment size, you can use the /E:xxx
parameter on COMMAND.COM to increase or decrease the size available
for environment variables and the PATH.

The Command Interpreters (CMD.EXE and COMMAND.COM) Under OS/2
-------------------------------------------------------------

Under OS/2, there are two command interpreters (CMD.EXE and
COMMAND.COM) and two parameters to SET in the CONFIG.SYS file:

1. First, the SET COMSPEC= statement tells OS/2 where to find the OS/2
   protected mode command interpreter, which is called CMD.EXE. Unlike
   COMMAND.COM, CMD.EXE does not take the parameter /E:xxxx to set the
   environment size. OS/2 does not limit the environment size as DOS
   does with COMMAND.COM. If you use /E: on CMD.EXE, it will not cause
   an error message at boot time, but it will prevent you from
   SHELLing when in an OS/2 session.

2. Second, the SHELL= statement tells OS/2 where to find the DOS
   compatibility box command interpreter, which is called COMMAND.COM.
   Just as in DOS, COMMAND.COM will take the parameter /E:xxxx, which
   allows you to set the environment size for the DOS box command
   interpreter. Note, however, that when you go into the DOS box, OS/2
   takes the value of the SHELL in the CONFIG.SYS and SETs the DOS box
   COMSPEC equal to that value so that normal DOS programs that need
   that information will function normally. This can be shown by
   typing the word SET at the DOS box command line. This will show
   that the COMSPEC is actually set, even though it is not in the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Note again that both COMSPEC and SHELL are set in the CONFIG.SYS file
under OS/2. Nothing is done in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to specify
information about command interpreters under OS/2.
