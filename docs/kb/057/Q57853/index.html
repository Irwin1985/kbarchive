The WindowDo procedure of the WINDOW.BAS toolbox file that is included
with Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version
7.00 for MS-DOS will not trap a click in the current window unless
that click is in a button or edit field.

To work around this limitation, open an "area" button (button type 4)
in the current window that is exactly the same size as the current
window. This does not make the WindowDo procedure trap clicks in the
current window (it is only trapping a click in a button), but it
appears so because an area button is invisible.

The WindowDo procedure allows you to trap window events such as
selecting buttons and edit fields, resizing, moving, or closing a
window, and selecting a window other than the current window. However,
WindowDo cannot trap a click in the current window itself unless the
click occurs on a button or edit field in that window.

For example, suppose a program opens up two windows. For simplicity,
we will assume that there are no buttons or edit fields opened in
either window. By default, the last window opened (window2) is the
current window. The WindowDo procedure will trap a click in the other
window (window1) but not in window2. This is a design limitation of
the WindowDo procedure and is not considered a problem.

To easily work around this situation, in the current window, open an
area button (button type 4) that is exactly the same size as the
current window. The WindowDo procedure is still trapping a click in a
button, but it appears as if a click is being trapped anywhere in the
window because the button is hidden. Type 4 buttons are invisible.

For a detailed explanation of the WindowDo procedure, see Page 572 of
the "Microsoft BASIC Version 7.0: Language Reference" manual. For more
information on area buttons (button type 4), see the ButtonOpen
procedure on Page 557 of the same manual.

The following example program illustrates the limitation and its
workaround:

'$INCLUDE: 'general.bi'   'These INCLUDE, COMMON SHARED, and DIM
'$INCLUDE: 'mouse.bi'     'statements are generally those needed
'$INCLUDE: 'menu.bi'      'for using the User Interface Toolbox.
'$INCLUDE: 'window.bi'

COMMON SHARED /uitools/ GloTitle()        AS MenuTitleType

COMMON SHARED /uitools/ GloWindow()       AS WindowType
COMMON SHARED /uitools/ GloButton()       AS ButtonType
COMMON SHARED /uitools/ GloEdit()         AS EditFieldType
