SUMMARY
=======

The information listed below discusses the following topics:

1. Windows version 3.x support of EMS.

2. Utilization of the services of an already-installed LIM EMS
  (Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Support) version 4.0 driver, such as a
  "limulator" or hardware EMS board by Windows version 3.x.

3. Making EMS calls from an application not based on Windows.

4. Making EMS calls from a Windows-based application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Windows version 3.x support of EMS.

  Windows version 3.x has three modes: real mode, standard mode, and enhanced
  mode. Of the three, only enhanced mode provides EMS. This is because
  "limulation" [simulation of LIM (Lotus/Intel/Microsoft)] requires hardware
  support that only the Intel 80386 provides; the 8086 and 80286 do not have
  the necessary combination of protected mode addressing and virtual 8086
  emulation (provided by the 80386's V86 mode).

2. Utilization of the services of an already-installed LIM EMS
  (Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Support) version 4.0 driver, such as a
  "limulator" or hardware EMS board by Windows version 3.x.

  Real mode Windows can take advantage of either a limulator or a hardware EMS
  board.

  Windows version 3.0 standard mode (which runs in 80286 protected mode) cannot
  use a limulator because these drivers run in 80386 protected mode, thereby
  conflicting with the standard mode's need to switch into protected mode.
  However, if the machine has a hardware EMS board and associated LIM version
  4.0 driver installed, any EMS calls made will be serviced by the EMS driver;
  however, Windows itself will not use the EMS memory in any way. Only small
  frame EMS is supported in protected mode.

  In Windows version 3.1, it is possible to start limulators such as QEMM,
  386MAX and EMM386 in standard mode. All support for EMS from protected mode
  Windows-based applications has been dropped from Windows version 3.1 enhanced
  mode. Any INT67H calls made by a Windows application in enhanced mode under
  Windows version 3.1 will result in an error being returned.

  Enhanced mode is incompatible with preinstalled EMS drivers that cannot be
  "shut off" by Windows. If the EMS driver is a limulator that cannot be shut
  off, Windows will not be able to run in enhanced mode because the 80386 is
  already running in protected mode; limulators that can be shut off respond to
  Windows as it boots, turning themselves off and letting Windows manage the
  EMS that they had been managing.

  Physical LIM memory is not supported by 386 enhanced mode Windows. Software
  running in Virtual 8086 mode in any VM (virtual machine), including the
  system VM (which contains all the Windows applications), can make LIM version
  4.0 calls; however, the calls will be handled by Windows/386, not by any
  previously installed LIM driver. No LIM calls are reflected; they are all
  handled (error or successful completion) by V86MMGR. As mentioned above, only
  small frame EMS is supported in protected mode.

3. Making EMS calls from an application not based on Windows.

  If EMS is present, MS-DOS-based applications and other applications not based
  on Windows have the full LIM version 4.0 specification available for their
  use. Running in enhanced mode, part of the mappable page array may not be
  usable; therefore, applications have to be sensitive to what is usable in the
  mappable page array and what is not; they cannot assume that all of the
  mappable page array is available.

4. Making EMS calls from a Windows-based application.

  If EMS is present, the normal small-frame EMS calls work as they do in Windows
  version 2.x (that is, applications can make LIM version 3.2 calls plus LIM
  version 4.0's realloc function). This allows both Windows versions 2.x and
  3.x applications to use EMS memory.

  CAUTION: In protected mode, the standard technique of querying for the
  presence of an EMS driver by examining the contents of interrupt vector 67H
  will fail due to virtualization of memory and virtualization of the IDT
  (interrupt description table). Therefore, applications will have to use the
  alternate technique of opening a file handle using the name of the EMS device
  driver. For more information on these techniques, please consult Chapter 9 of
  Ray Duncan's "Advanced MS-DOS" book (Microsoft Press, 1986), which is the
  chapter on memory management under MS-DOS. This chapter contains a discussion
  on EMS that describes how to check for the presence of an EMS driver.

  Windows version 3.x applications that use EMS when running in protected mode
  will be slower than non-EMS-using applications, and may run out of memory
  faster. If it is necessary to run a Windows version 2.x application that
  requires EMS under Windows version 3.x, this can easily be done in enhanced
  mode. When designing a new application for Windows version 3.x, however, the
  programmer should take advantage of the new protected mode addressing scheme
  rather than trying to use EMS.

  CAUTION: In protected mode, the value returned as the location of the page
  frame is a selector, not a segment. Therefore, applications cannot make any
  assumptions about that value. Many EMS-using applications, besides
  encountering the inefficiency of using EMS, will probably run into other
  restrictions that will not allow them to run in protected mode. For example,
  they cannot put code into EMS unless they implement special handling in
  protected mode to create a code selector alias for the page frame selector.

  For enhanced mode, there are SYSTEM.INI entries that correspond to the same
  entries in the .PIF file. The Control Panel does not touch them. We do not
  expect many programmers to need to do anything with these at all. See the
  PIFEDIT documentation for information on the meanings of possible values.

  Example:

  ; The following variables perform the equivalent of the XMS and
  ; EMS memory PIF settings for the SYS VM:
  ;
  SYSVMEMSLIMIT           Max value (default is -1)
  SYSVMEMSREQUIRED        Min value (default is -1)
  SYSVMEMSLOCKED          Is the EMS touched under interrupt or needed
                          to be in memory at all times for some other
                          reason? (default is NO)
  SYSVMXMSLIMIT           Max value (default is -1)
  SYSVMXMSREQUIRED        Min value (default is -1)
  SYSVMXMSLOCKED          Is the EMS touched under interrupt or needed
                          to be in memory at all times for some other
                          reason? (default is NO)

  Related switch:

  EMMSIZE                 Controls the maximum amount of memory
                          that will be used for EMS across all
                          VMs (default is -1, no limit).
