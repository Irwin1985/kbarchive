In versions of CodeView earlier than Version 2.30, it was not possible
to redirect the input or output of the program being debugged. For
example, a "filter" program that takes input from a file specified by
the input redirection operator ("&lt;") is hindered by this limitation
under pre-2.30 CodeView because there is no way to specify that you
want the redirection to apply to the application rather than to
CodeView itself.

In CodeView (CV) or protected-mode CodeView (CVP) Version 2.30,
redirection on the command line following the program name is directed
to the program being debugged. For example, invoking CodeView 2.30
with the following command line

   CV test &lt; test.dat

causes all input to the program TEST.EXE to be read from the file
TEST.DAT.

Redirecting I/O to CodeView itself is useful for involved debugging
sessions where many CodeView dialog commands can be put into a
separate text file that is automatically read by CodeView during
debugging. For instance, this method will allow a complicated
debugging scenario to be accurately repeated any number of times.
Prior to CV and CVP 2.30, this was the only type of redirection
supported while debugging.

Starting with CodeView 2.30, you can redirect I/O to both the
application being debugged and to CodeView. The CodeView redirection
is done with the /C command-line option, or from within CV itself with
the redirection dialog commands ("&lt;" and "&gt;"). Since the /C switch
allows you to specify CV dialog commands on the command line, you can
specify the redirection at this point. For example, the following
command line

   CV "/C&lt;cv.dat" test &lt; test.dat

brings up CodeView with TEST.EXE as in the example above (with the
TEST.EXE input coming from TEST.DAT), but this time CodeView also
reads the debugging instructions to perform from the file CV.DAT.
