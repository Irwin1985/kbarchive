-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore an offline backup of the information store database from a
computer that is running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and Exchange Server 5.5 to a
Microsoft Windows 2000 and Exchange Server 5.5 cluster, if you run the isinteg
-patch command, it seems that the command completes successfully. However, when
you start the information store, you may receive the following error message:

  Microsoft Management Console
  Windows could not start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store on local
  computer. For more information review the system event log. If this is a
  non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor and refer to service
  specific error code 1012.

In addition, the following event ID message may be logged in the System log:

  Event ID: 7024
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service terminated with
  service specific error 1012.

The following event ID messages may be logged in the Application event log:

  Event ID: 7202
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Description: The database has been copied from the server (server name) to the
  server (server name). The database cannot function until Isinteg -patch has
  been run.

  -and-

  Event ID: 1005
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Description: Unable to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store. Error
  0x3f4.

These messages indicate that the isinteg command actually has not completed
successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if you omitted the trailing underscore when you set the
required "_CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME_" environment variable at a command prompt (for
example, if you entered "_CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME").

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following format when you type the environment
variable at a command prompt:

  SET _CLUSTER_NETWORK_NAME_=&lt;Cluster Name&gt;

To determine the cluster name:

1. Start the Cluster Administrator program from the Administrative Tools program
  group.

2. Click to expand the Groups container, and then click the appropriate cluster
  group in the left pane.

3. In the right pane, right-click the cluster name resource, click the
  Parameters tab, and then note the name that is listed on the tab.

  Use this name to set the cluster environment variable before you run isinteg
  -patch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article assumes that you performed an offline defragmentation procedure of
the information store databases after the databases were restored and copied to
the Windows 2000-based server before you ran isinteg -patch. When an Exchange
Server 5.5 database is restored to another operating system or to the same
operating system that is running a different service pack level, you must
perform an offline defragmentation procedure of the database so that the
corresponding service for that database can start.
