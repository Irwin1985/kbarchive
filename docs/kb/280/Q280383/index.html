SUMMARY
=======

There are instances when you can use Internet Information Server (IIS) as a
portal to another device on the network that contains available storage. You can
do this in the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in by choosing the A
share located on another computer option on the Web Site or Virtual Directory
tab.

IIS can detect when the path is local or remote even when network mappings make
the drive appear local. Therefore, for access to be granted, IIS must obtain
credentials with permissions to the remote share. These credentials (the user ID
and password) are encrypted and stored in the IIS metabase, but are available
through an Application Programming Interface (API). If normal security practices
are not followed, this can potentially pose a risk to secure operation of the
server.

Server administrators should never allow untrusted code to run on the server. The
potential damage that can result from allowing an untrusted user to run code on
the server goes far beyond this specific incident.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that customers consult the following Knowledge Base
articles for information on how to set the appropriate permissions for Web
users:

  Q155253 Improper NTFS Permissions May Result in IIS Failure

  Q187506 List of NTFS Permissions Required for IIS Site to Work

  Q216705 How to Set Permissions on a FrontPage Web on IIS

Even when proper permissions are set, Microsoft recommends that, in keeping with
normal security recommendations, the user account that is used to access the
share should have the fewest privileges possible. Specifically, Microsoft
recommends that the account have the same permissions as the IUSR_Machinename
account (Read and Execute). By following this recommendation, you ensure that
even if a malicious user is able to run code on the server and gain the
credentials used to access UNC shares, they cannot gain additional privileges by
doing so.

For any Web site or virtual directory with a share, Microsoft recommends that you
carefully plan permissions and do not use any accounts with administrative-level
permissions.

If good security guidelines are followed, then this should not pose a security
risk. However, there is a possibility that this information can be extracted
from the metabase if the wrong security permissions are placed on the IIS
server.

The information in this article was tested with Active Server Pages (ASP) and the
GetObject method of the IIS provider. A vulnerability was discovered with the
correct code method; however, the root cause of the problem is incorrect
security permissions.
