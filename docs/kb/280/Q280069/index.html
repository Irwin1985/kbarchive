Is it DirectX?
--------------

DirectX is a Windows component that improves access to hardware. Games use
DirectX to communicate with your hardware. For more information about DirectX,
visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/aboutdx.asp

To download and install the latest version of DirectX, visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

To install DirectX in Safe Mode, follow these steps:

- Restart Windows in Safe mode. To do this, use the appropriate method for your
  version of Microsoft Windows:

  Restart Windows 95:

  Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

  Restart Windows 98 or Windows Me:

  Restart your computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after the computer
  completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then select Safe Mode from the
  Startup menu.

  When Windows starts in Safe mode, click OK.

  Restart Windows 2000:

  Restart your computer, and when the Boot menu appears, press F8. When the
  "Windows 2000 Advanced Options" menu appears, select an option, and then
  press ENTER. When the Boot menu appears again, with the words "Safe Mode"
  displayed in red at the bottom, select the installation you want to start,
  and then press ENTER.

  WARNING: Do not select a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 installation.

For additional information about how to obtain and install the latest version of
DirectX, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q179113 How to Download and Install DirectX

Is There an Issue with the Video Driver?
----------------------------------------

Games require plenty of information from your video adapter when you run or start
a game. A damaged or outdated video driver can cause an invalid page fault or
exception error to occur.

Contact your computer or video adapter manufacturer to inquire about how to
obtain and install the latest version of the video driver for your video
adapter.

Drivers are small programs that allow your operating system to communicate with
the hardware in your computer. A driver acts as a translator between your
hardware and operating system. The driver helps Microsoft Windows understand
requests from your hardware. Beyond acting as a translator, a driver can also
enhance the operation of a particular piece of hardware, such as a video adapter
or a sound card.

A new video driver for your video adapter might allow your video adapter to use
video features more efficiently or improve performance.

For information about how to contact your hardware manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

To determine the manufacturer and model of your video adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click Device Manager.

4. Double-click "Display adapters".

  NOTE: In the branch under "Display adapters", the manufacturer and model of
  your video adapter should be displayed.

5. Close System Properties, and then close Control Panel.

If the issue continue to occur, proceed to the next method.

Change the Windows Color Palette Setting to "High Color (16 Bit)"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To change the Windows Color Palette setting to "High Color (16 bit)", follow
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. In the Color Palette or Colors box, click High Color (16 bit).

5. Click OK, and then click OK again. If you are prompted to restart the
  computer, do so.

     Restart your computer, and when the Boot menu appears, press F8. When the
     "Windows 2000 Advanced Options" menu appears, select an option, and then
     press ENTER. When the Boot menu appears again, with the words "Safe Mode"
     displayed in red at the bottom, select the installation you want to start,
     and then press ENTER.
