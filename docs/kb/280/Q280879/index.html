IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade an SNA Server 4.0 system that uses the OLEDB Provider for DB2
or ODBC Driver for DB2, the SNA DB2 Service is not removed.

If you attempt to start the SNA DB2 Service after the upgrade to Host Integration
Server 2000 is complete, you receive the following error message:

  Could not start the SNA DB2 Service on Local Computer.
  Error 2: The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

The OLEDB Provider for DB2 and the ODBC Driver for DB2 that are included in Host
Integration Server 2000 have been redesigned and no longer utilize the SNA DB2
Service. The HIS 2000 Setup program incorrectly leaves this service listed in
the Services utility in Control Panel.

WORKAROUND
==========

In the Properties for the SNA DB2 Service, set the Startup option to disabled.
This will keep the SNA DB2 Service from trying to start on your system.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To completely remove the SNA DB2 Service from the Services utility in Control
Panel, remove the following key from the system registry, and then restart the
system:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and select the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaDb2

3. From the Edit menu, click Delete.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.
