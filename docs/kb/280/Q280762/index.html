Downloading SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4
------------------------------------------

Self-extracting executable files that contain updated 4.0 SP4 SNA Server 
and client files can be downloaded electronically from the following
Microsoft Web site:

  www.microsoft.com/sna/download/sna4sp4.asp

The following files comprise the updated SNA Server and client files for
SNA Server 4.0 SP4:

  40Sp4is.exe   - 4.0 SP4 Server Update (Intel) (see NOTE 1, 2, 4)
  40Sp4ic.exe   - 4.0 SP4 Microsoft Windows NT Client Update (Intel) (see NOTE 2, 4)
  40Sp49x.exe   - 4.0 SP4 Microsoft Windows 9x Client Update (see NOTE 2)
  40Sp4clr.exe  - 4.0 SP4 Microsoft Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, Web Client Refresh (see NOTE 3)
  40Sp4ihs.exe  - 4.0 SP4 Host Security Refresh (Intel) (see NOTE 4)
  40Sp4mq.exe   - 4.0 SP4 MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge

All of these files are self-extracting Win32 executables.

For information about changes and new features that are implemented in 4.0 SP4, 
see the Kbhelp.chm and Readme.txt release notes files, which are included in 
the 40Sp4is.exe file. The Kbhelp.chm file includes links to Microsoft Knowledge
Base articles that describe the symptoms and causes for problems that are fixed
in the service pack, as well as fixes that are implemented in SNA Server 4.0 SP1,
4.0 SP2, and 4.0 SP3.

NOTE 1: The SNA Server 4.0 SP4 includes updates to the SNA Server, Print
Service, COM Transaction Integrator, SNA OLE/DB Interface, TN3270 Service,
TN5250 Service, AFTP, and Shared Folders Gateway.

NOTE 2: Once the 4.0 SP4 update is applied, there is no way to uninstall 
(or "roll back") the service pack without reinstalling the previous 
SNA Server 4.0 release. The SNA SDK files are included in these self-extracting 
images and will be automatically upgraded as a part of running the Update 
program.

NOTE 3: The SNA Server Windows 3.x, and MS-DOS clients are still 
unchanged from SNA 4.0 SP1. There is no update installer for these 
clients. The Web-installable clients have been updated in SNA 4.0 SP4.

NOTE 4: SNA Server 4.0 SP4 does not include any updates for Alpha
systems. All updates are for Intel-based systems.

Instructions for Decompressing the Server or Client Update Files
----------------------------------------------------------------

The SNA Server and client update files automatically extract and run 
the Update program. When extracted, these files require the following 
free disk space:

 Server Update (Intel) - 40Sp4is.exe:  165 MB
 Windows NT Client Update (Intel) - 40Sp4ic.exe: 103 MB
 Microsoft Windows 95 Client Update         - 40Sp49x.exe: 43 MB

Microsoft recommends that these files are extracted to a persistent,
shared network location and made available to server and client computers
across the network. Users can then connect to this shared folder and
install the service pack by running the Update program from this network
location. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Extract the desired service pack files to one or more folders on a
  network server:

  These files can be extracted to a separate folder by using the /x or
  /X option. For example:

     40SP4IS /x

2. Share the desired service pack files to network users.

  The full folder structure of the extracted files must be available to
  the user who runs the Update program. For example, "40SP4IS /X" will 
  extract into the following folder structure:

     \ 
     \I386\... (SNA Server 4.0 SP4 files)
     \Reg2udl  (utility used by Setup)

  Similarly, the SNA Windows NT Intel client update (40Sp4ic.exe) extracts 
  into the following folder structure:

    \ 
    \Clients\Winnt\I386  (SNA Server 4.0 SP4 Windows NT client files)
    \Reg2udl             (utility used by the Setup program)

3. Users must run the Update program to install the service pack.

  To apply the service pack, the Update program should be run from the
  appropriate shared program:

     SNA Server (Intel):  \I386
     SNA Windows NT client (Intel):  \Clients\Winnt\I386
     SNA Windows 9x client: \Clients\Win9x

**********************************************************************
WARNING: The Update.exe program should always be used to install the 
service pack, which automatically spawns the Setup program in "quiet" 
mode and requires limited user interaction. The Setup program should 
not be run directly, because the user will be required to select the 
existing installation path, user credentials, and components to install. 
If these options are chosen incorrectly, this can damage the 
installation of the service pack on the destination computer.
**********************************************************************

If the self-extracting files are run without the /X option, the Update
program will be run automatically. When running Update automatically, 
all files are automatically extracted to the folder where the TMP, 
TEMP, or WINROOT environment variable is pointing (trying in that order). 
So, if the SET command shows that TMP=C:\TMP, and C: does not have 
sufficient storage to extract the files, change TMP to point to a 
drive that has sufficient space. For example:

  SET TMP=D:\Temp

NOTE: Once Update has completed, the SNA Server source installation 
folder will point to the folder where Update was run. If SNA Setup
is run from SNA Server program group, Setup will attempt to locate this
folder when adding or removing SNA Server components.

For more information about the service pack installation process and 
possible errors that might occur, see the "More Information" section 
in this Readme.

Installing the New OLE/DB Provider and ODBC Driver for DB2
----------------------------------------------------------

SNA Server 4.0 SP2 includes a new OLE DB Provider for DB2 and ODBC 
Driver for DB2 from Microsoft, while previous versions of SNA Server
include a version that is licensed from StarQuest. SNA 4.0 SP4 includes an 
update to the SNA 4.0 SP2 and SP3 versions. When you upgrade from SNA 4.0 or
SNA 4.0 SP1 systems to SNA 4.0 SP4, the server or client computer 
must first be upgraded to SNA 4.0 SP4 by running the Update program 
from a persistent location (that is, a location where the full extracted 
files exist). Once installed, the new drivers may be installed by 
running the SNA Setup program from the local SNA Server Program 
group and by choosing these new components after selecting Add/Remove 
Components from Control Panel.

Installing the New MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge
---------------------------------------

SNA Server 4.0 SP2 includes the new MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge. The
SNA 4.0 SP4 includes an updated version of the Bridge (40Sp4mq.exe).
This feature is only supported on an Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 SP2, SP3, or
SP4 system. For more information about this feature, refer to the 
License.txt and Readme files that are included in 40Sp4mq.exe.

Upgrading Host Security to 4.0 SP4
----------------------------------

The Host Security updates for SNA 4.0 SP4 (40Sp4ihs.exe)
must first be extracted to a folder. To upgrade SNA Server 4.0, 
4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, or 4.0 SP3 Host Security to 4.0 SP4, the Setup program must be 
run and the current installation folder and Windows NT user context 
must be entered. No Update program is provided to upgrade the Host
Security components to 4.0 SP4.

Upgrading SNA Windows 3.x and MS-DOS Clients to 4.0 SP4
-------------------------------------------------------

The 40Sp4clr.exe file contains the SNA Server Windows 3.x, a Web-
installable version of the SNA Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft
Windows 98, and Windows 3x clients, and MS-DOS and OS/2 client files.
The 40Sp4clr.exe file is a Win32 self-extracting executable. The
administrator must first run this file and choose a folder directory 
in which to place the extracted files. Windows 3.x clients may then
connect across the network and run the Setup program to install the
client files. The Setup program can be used to upgrade a previous
version of the SNA client software.

NOTE: The SNA Windows 3.x and MS-DOS clients are unchanged since
SNA 4.0 SP1, though the Web-installable client CAB files have been 
updated in SNA 4.0 SP4.

Installing the Updated 4.0 SP4 SDK
----------------------------------

The SNA Server 4.0 SP4 Server, Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98
client include the SDK files. Also, the Update program that is automatically
spawned when these self-extracting files are run (40Sp4is.exe, 40Sp4ic.exe,
40Sp49x.exe) will update the SDK files if the SDK option was initially chosen
during SNA Server 4.0 installation.

Installing the Service Pack Files
---------------------------------

Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated in 4.0 SP4.
Updates may be applied in any order--to the server and/or to the clients.
Microsoft recommends that all systems that are running SNA Server 4.0
(that is, SNA Servers and client computers) be updated to 4.0 SP4. It may not be
necessary to update the client computers to SP4 unless you are experiencing
a client problem that has been fixed in SP4.

WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on systems
that are currently running SNA Server 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 server
or client software. These updates cannot be applied over systems that are 
running SNA Server 3.x or 2.x releases.

** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 4.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **

More Information
----------------

As noted above, if /X option is not used, the file is self-extracted to the 
folder where the TMP environment variable is pointing. For example, 
if TMP=C:\Temp, then the C: drive (where this folder exists) must 
have sufficient disk space to accommodate the extracted image. If there 
is insufficient disk space to accommodate the image size, the following 
error message is displayed:

 Extraction Failed
 Access is denied
     &lt;OK&gt;

If this error message occurs, a temporary read-only file may be left in
the TMP folder tree (for example, in C:\Temp\Ext5232\I386\Setup.tdf), which 
may cause the service pack file to continue to fail with the message, 
"Access is denied." To correct this problem, delete the file indicated in
"To Directory:" within the progress dialog box when the "Access is denied"
error is displayed. This file may have the "read only" attribute set, so
the ATTRIB command may be needed to remove this attribute in order to 
delete this file. For example:

  ATTRIB -r &lt;file&gt;

When the Update program is run, it displays the following warning:

 WARNING
 You are about to update your current installation of SNA Server with 
 SNA Server 4.0 with Service Pack 4. You will not be able to deinstall 
 this Service Pack and get back to your original setup. Click Yes if 
 you wish to proceed.  
    &lt;Yes&gt;  &lt;No&gt;

Choose Yes to continue (the default is No).

If the following error occurs, then SNA 4.0 SP4 has already been installed:

 Setup Error 689
 Setup cannot update an installation interactively in Quiet mode.

 Setup Error 723
 Setup was unable to read configuration information from the first section 
 of the setup file:     C:\SNA40\setup\server\snafile.stf

If these errors occur and you want to re-apply SNA Server 4.0 SP4, perform
the following steps:

1. Delete &lt;snaroot&gt;\Setup\Server\Snafile.stf. 

2. Modify the following registry value:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNA Server\CurrentVersion\ 
        SNAVersion: REG_SZ: 4.0 Service Pack 4

3. Change "4.0 Service Pack 4" to "4.0 Service Pack 3" (without the quotation
  marks).

4. Run the Update program again.
