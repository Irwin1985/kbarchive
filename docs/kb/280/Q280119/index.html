SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. The vulnerability can allow a user who is locally
logged on to the computer to grant themselves administrator-level privileges.

A flaw in the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLMSSP) service can potentially
allow a non-administrative user to gain administrative control of the computer.
To do this, the user needs a valid logon account and the ability to run
arbitrary code on the computer.

This vulnerability can be exploited only by a malicious user who can
interactively log on to the affected computer; however, it is recommended that
unprivileged users not be allowed to interactively log on to business-critical
servers like domain controllers, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) servers,
print and file servers, database servers, and so on. If unprivileged users are
not allowed to interactively log on to business-critical servers,
business-critical servers are not at risk from this vulnerability and, as a
result, the computers that are most likely to be affected by this vulnerability
are workstations and Terminal Servers.
