------------------------------------------------

Search the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the Microsoft Support Web Site for
information about specific game requirements:

  http://support.microsoft.com/?pr=kbinfo
  (http://support.microsoft.com/?pr=kbinfo)

Use the following parameters to query for information:

1. In the Search (KB) box, select the name of your game.

2. In the "For solutions containing" box, type "System Requirements".

3. In the Using box, select "All the words entered".

NOTE: If you do not see the Using box, click Show Options.

Are You Running Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000?
-----------------------------------------------

Download and install the latest Service Pack from the following Microsoft Web
Site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.asp

Is a Program Running in the Background Interferring with the Game?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Clean Boot the Computer:

Use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (ME)

Run the System Configuration Utility (Msconfig.exe) to clean boot Windows ME. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click "Selective startup".

3. Click to clear all of the check boxes under "Selective startup".

4. On the "Startup" tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box.


5. Click OK. When you receive the prompt to restart your computer, click Yes.
  After the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without
  the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

  IMPORTANT: Ensure that the check boxes you cleared in the General tab are
  still cleared. Proceed to step 6 if all of the check boxes are still cleared.
  If you see a disabled or gray check box, your computer is not "clean-booted"
  and you may need assistance from the manufacturer of the program that places
  a check mark back into Msconfig.

6. After you verify that your computer is clean-booted in step 5, you can
  isolate the issue. If the original issue does not reoccur after the clean
  boot, click one item at a time under "Selective startup", and then restart
  the computer to see if the additional entry reproduces the original issue.

Microsoft Windows 98

Run the System Configuration Utility (Msconfig.exe) to clean boot Windows 98. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. Click the General tab. Click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:

   - Process Config.sys File
   - Process Autoexec.bat File
   - Process Winstart.bat File (if available)
   - Load Startup Group Items

4. Click the Win.ini tab. Expand the Windows list and then click to clear the
  Load= and Run= check boxes.

5. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q192926 How to Perform Clean-Boot Troubleshooting for Windows 98


NOTE: To restore your original Startup options, rerun the System Configuration
Utility (msconfig.exe), click the General tab, and then click Normal Startup.

Microsoft Windows 95

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key. On the Startup menu, select Command Prompt Only.

2. At the command prompt, type "win" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER. Press and hold down the SHIFT key until the Windows startup
  sequence is complete.

3. Disable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer.

  For information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
  documentation for the program.

4. Quit all running programs except Explorer and Systray. To do this, press
  CTRL+ALT+DELETE, click the program that you want to quit, and then click End
  Task. If you receive a message that the program is busy or not responding,
  click End Task again. Repeat this step to quit all programs except Explorer
  and Systray.

and then enable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer.
For information about how to enable these programs, see the printed or online
documentation for the program.

Is it DirectX?
--------------

DirectX is a Windows component that improves access to hardware. Games use
DirectX to communicate with your hardware like video and sound cards do. For
additional information about DirectX, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/aboutdx.asp
  (http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/aboutdx.asp)

Install the Latest Version of Microsoft DirectX:

Download and install the latest version of DirectX from the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

Install DirectX in Safe Mode:

1. Restart Windows in Safe mode. To do this, use the appropriate method for your
  version of Windows:

   - Windows 2000

     Restart your computer. When the Startup menu appears, press F8. When the
     "Windows 2000 Advanced Options" menu appears, select an option, and then
     press ENTER. When the Startup menu reappears (the words "Safe Mode" are
     displayed in red at the bottom), select the installation option you want,
     and then press ENTER.

     WARNING: Do not select a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 installation option.

   - Windows 98/ME

     Restart your computer. Press and hold down the CTRL key after the computer
     completes the Power On Self Test (POST). From the Startup menu, choose
     Safe Mode.

   - Windows 95

     Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
     press the F8 key. From the Startup menu, choose Safe Mode.

2. When Windows starts in Safe Mode, click OK.

For additional information about how to obtain and install the latest version of
DirectX, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q179113 How to Download and Install DirectX

Is it the Video Driver?
-----------------------

NOTE: If you are using Encarta when encountering an IPF or exception error,
perform the procedures in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q238925 Encarta 2000: How to Troubleshoot Sound and Video Driver Issues

If these procedures do not solve your problem, then follow these steps:

Update the Video Driver:

MultiMedia products require a great deal of information from your video driver
when running or starting the program. A damaged or outdated video driver can
cause an invalid page fault or exception error to occur.

Drivers are small programs that allow your operating system to communicate with
the hardware in your computer. A driver acts as a translator between your
hardware and operating system. It helps Windows understand requests from your
hardware. Beyond acting as a translator, drivers can also enhance the operation
of a particular piece of hardware, like a video card or a sound card.

It's very important to update your video card drivers because new drivers are
created for a number of reasons. A new driver for your video card might allow it
to more efficiently use your video card features. And, having the current
drivers will improve performance. Companies release updated drivers on a regular
basis to keep pace with ever-changing software technologies.

Contact your computer or video card manufacturer to inquire about how to obtain
and install the latest version of the drivers for your video adapter or sound
card.

For information about how to contact your hardware manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
