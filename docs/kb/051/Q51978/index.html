SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft MS-DOS assigns drive letters to the first two physical floppy disk
drives and hard disk drives it finds at boot time in a fixed sequence, including
multiple partitions and logical drives on the hard disks. You cannot change this
sequence.

The drive letters assigned to additional drives installed using DRIVER.SYS and
other installable device drivers is dependent upon the order in which the
drivers are loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file. These drive letter assignments can be
influenced by changing the order of the CONFIG.SYS statements or loading "dummy"
drives to "use up" drive letters.

Drive letter assignments can change when you upgrade from one Microsoft MS-DOS
version to another or from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of
MS-DOS to another version that assigns drive letters differently. (The order in
which drive letters are assigned was modified by OEMs in earlier versions of
MS-DOS.) This article describes how MS-DOS assigns drive letters; it does not
explain how particular OEM MS-DOS versions assign drive letters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following occurs at startup:

1. MS-DOS checks all installed disk devices, assigning the drive letter A to the
  first physical floppy disk drive that is found.

2. If a second physical floppy disk drive is present, it is assigned drive
  letter B. If it is not present, a logical drive B is created that uses the
  first physical floppy disk drive.

3. Regardless of whether a second floppy disk drive is present, MS-DOS then
  assigns the drive letter C to the primary MS-DOS partition on the first
  physical hard disk, and then goes on to check for a second hard disk.

4. If a second physical hard disk is found, and a primary partition exists on
  the second physical drive, the primary MS-DOS partition on the second
  physical hard drive is assigned the letter D. MS-DOS version 5.0, which
  supports up to eight physical drives, will continue to search for more
  physical hard disk drives at this point. For example, if a third physical
  hard disk is found, and a primary partition exists on the third physical
  drive, the primary MS-DOS partition on the third physical hard drive is
  assigned the letter E.

5. MS-DOS returns to the first physical hard disk drive and assigns drive
  letters to any additional logical drives (in extended MS-DOS partitions) on
  that drive in sequence.

6. MS-DOS repeats this process for the second physical hard disk drive, if
  present. MS-DOS 5.0 will repeat this process for up to eight physical hard
  drives, if present. After all logical drives (in extended MS-DOS partitions)
  have been assigned drive letters, MS-DOS 5.0 returns to the first physical
  drive and assigns drive letters to any other primary MS-DOS partitions that
  exist, then searches other physical drives for additional primary MS-DOS
  partitions. This support for multiple primary MS-DOS partitions was added to
  version 5.0 for backward compatibility with the previous OEM MS-DOS versions
  that support multiple primary partitions.

7. After all logical drives on the hard disk(s) have been assigned drive
  letters, drive letters are assigned to drives installed using DRIVER.SYS or
  created using RAMDRIVE.SYS in the order in which the drivers are loaded in
  the CONFIG.SYS file. Which drive letters are assigned to which devices can be
  influenced by changing the order of the device drivers or, if necessary, by
  creating "dummy" drive letters with DRIVER.SYS.

The MS-DOS utility SUBST, networks and programs such as the CD-ROM Extensions
which use the MS-DOS network interface can request a specific drive letter be
assigned to a block device.

Example 1
---------

Consider as an example a system with one floppy disk drive and one hard disk
drive, with two MS-DOS partitions (a primary partition and an extended partition
containing a single logical drive) on the hard disk. In this configuration,
MS-DOS will assign the floppy disk drive as drives A and B, the primary
partition on the hard disk drive as drive C, and the logical drive in the
extended partition as drive D.

Example 2
---------

Consider another system with three floppy disk drives, the third drive being
installed using DRIVER.SYS, and two hard disk drives, with a primary and an
extended partition on each hard disk drive. The extended partition on the first
hard disk drive contains two logical drives, and the extended MS-DOS partition
on the second hard disk drive contains one logical drive. A RAM disk is also
created using RAMDRIVE.SYS.

In this configuration, MS-DOS will assign the first two floppy disk drives as
drives A and B, then assign the primary partitions on the first and second
physical hard disk drives as drives C and D, respectively. MS-DOS will then
assign the drive letters E and F to the two logical drives in the extended
partition on the first physical drive, and G to the logical drive in the
extended partition on the second physical drive.

The third floppy disk drive, installed using DRIVER.SYS, and the RAM disk created
using RAMDRIVE.SYS, will be assigned the letters H and I in the order in which
the DEVICE= statements appear in the CONFIG.SYS file.

Partitioning Schemes
--------------------

Listed below are some sample partitioning schemes for two 40-megabyte (MB) hard
disk drives and their resulting drive letter assignments:

- Drive 1:
  C: 20 MB primary MS-DOS partition
  E: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition

  Drive 2:
  D: 20 MB primary MS-DOS partition
  F: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition

- Drive 1:
  C: 20 MB primary MS-DOS partition
  D: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition

  Drive 2:
  E: 20 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
  F: 20 MB logical drive 2 in extended MS-DOS partition

- Drive 1:
  C: 10 MB primary MS-DOS partition
  E: 10 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
  F: 10 MB logical drive 2 in extended MS-DOS partition
  G: 10 MB logical drive 3 in extended MS-DOS partition

  Drive 2:
  D: 10 MB primary MS-DOS partition
  H: 10 MB logical drive 1 in extended MS-DOS partition
  I: 10 MB logical drive 2 in extended MS-DOS partition
  J: 10 MB logical drive 3 in extended MS-DOS partition
