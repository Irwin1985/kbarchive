_PG_CHART sometimes fails to correctly graph all y-axis values. The
program included below demonstrates this problem. The lowest bar on
the chart should be labeled n-1 with n assumed at the origin. However,
when n is equal to the following values

   28, 30, 44, 45, 48, 51, 52, 56, 60, 63, 66, 69, 74,
   75, 78, 79, 80, 84, 85, 88, 90, 91, 92, 95, and 96.

the graph actually drawn has n-2 as the lowest bar. This is
independent of the video mode setting.

The following program demonstrates the problem:

#include &lt;conio.h&gt;
#include &lt;graph.h&gt;
#include &lt;pgchart.h&gt;

float far value[] = {1.0f,2.0f,3.0f,4.0f,5.0f,6.0f,7.0f,8.0f,9.0f,
                     10.0f,11.0f,12.0f,13.0f,14.0f,15.0f,16.0f,17.0f,
                     18.0f,19.0f,20.0f,21.0f,22.0f,23.0f,24.0f,25.0f,

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
