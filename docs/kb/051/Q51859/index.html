The program listing below demonstrates one method of printing an EGA
or VGA SCREEN 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 image to an Epson printer (or
compatible) with graphics capability.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 for MS-DOS; to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and
6.00b for MS-DOS; and to Microsoft BASIC PDS (Professional Development
System) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS. (Earlier versions do not
support VGA SCREEN 12.)

This article is one part of the application note titled "How to Print
BASIC Video Screens to Epson Printers." A printed copy of this
application note can be obtained by calling Microsoft Product Support
Services at (206) 637-7096. This application note can also be obtained
in separate parts in this Knowledge Base by searching for the
following words:

   Epson and print and screen and QuickBASIC

If you have a printer other than an Epson, you must change the printer
control codes used in the following program for setting line spacing
and graphics mode. Control codes can be found in your printer's
manual.

The routine below for printing EGA and VGA SCREEN modes 7 through 12
is required only if you aren't running under MS-DOS version 4.00 or
later. In MS-DOS 4.00 and later, the program GRAPHICS.COM supports all
standard EGA and VGA SCREEN modes. Thus, the routine given in a
separate article (part of the same application note) for printing CGA
SCREEN modes can be used to print EGA and VGA SCREENs in MS-DOS 4.00
and later.

If you want further information about graphics memory and the various
graphics modes, please refer to the following book, which is available
in bookstores or by calling Microsoft Press at (800) 888-3303 or (206)
882-8661:

    "Programmer's Guide to PC and PS/2 Video Systems," by Richard
    Wilton (published by Microsoft Press, 1987)

Printing EGA or VGA Screen Modes 7 Through 12
---------------------------------------------

Because EGA and VGA memory are stored in contiguous blocks per
"plane," printing the screen to a printer can be a fairly simple
operation. The method used in the program below prints the image
sideways, which avoids the need to do any bit-shifting and uses a
simple two-dots-per-pixel shading pattern to represent different
colors.

To produce different patterns for different colors, each color plane
must be analyzed. In SCREEN modes with four video planes (7, 8, 9, and
12), each of the four different base EGA/VGA colors --  blue, green,
red, and intensity -- is represented in a separate memory bank or
plane of EGA/VGA memory. Each bit in a color plane represents a pixel
on the screen; thus, each pixel on the screen has a color attribute
depicted by four bits, one in each color plane.

Each plane is addressed for reading/writing by selecting the bank of
memory to access with an OUT instruction. This program logically OR's
the blue and red planes together and does the same with the green and
intensity planes. This effectively reduces the number of pattern
(color) combinations from 16 to 4. Therefore, some colors that appear
to be different on the screen have the same appearance on paper.

SCREEN modes 10 and 11 are almost identical, except that there are
only two color planes; thus, each pixel on the screen has a color
attribute depicted by two bits, one in each of the two color planes.
Because there are only two bits per pixel and two pins are being
fired, no OR'ing of the color planes needs to be done.

The Epson printer can fire up to eight pins per graphics byte sent.
Thus, moving from left to right, a loop that reads screen data from
the bottom of the screen upward can access eight vertical columns at a
time. This behavior coincides with the printer firing eight pins at a
time and creates eight horizontal columns on the page, turning the
printout sideways.
