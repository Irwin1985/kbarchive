SUMMARY
=======

WINCAP demonstrates how to capture, save, and print the entire screen, portions
of the screen, or specific windows. The program also defines routines that
accomplish common Device-Independent Bitmap (DIB) functions; these routines form
the DIB Application Programming Interface (API). WINCAP uses the DIB API
functions for most of the screen capture, printing, and saving work. See the
Dibapi.txt file for a description of the DIB API functions.

MORE INFORMATION

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download

WINCAP illustrates the following techniques::

- Capturing the screen (or a specific window) into a DIB

- Capturing the screen to a device-dependent bitmap (DDB)

- Printing a DIB using banding

- Loading and saving a DIB to a disk file (.bmp file)

- Converting between DIBs and DDBs

- Displaying the captured screen DDB

All of these techniques call the DIB API. WINCAP includes the source code for
these functions. You can call these functions easily from a different
application by simply compiling the enclosed Dibapi.dll, and linking with the
Diapi.lib import library.

The preferred way to capture a screen in Microsoft Windows is to copy the screen
pixels into a DIB, and then to use this DIB in subsequent operations (for
example, to save the bitmap to a file or print the bitmap).

If you do not use a DIB in the intermediate step, the results of the screen print
may be less than desirable. If you use a DIB to hold the screen image,
device-dependent information is removed from the bitmap. This simplifies the
process of displaying the image on devices with different display capabilities.
For example, capturing a screen from a 24-bit display adapter and printing it on
a 1-bit (monochrome) printer can produce exceptional results if DIBs are used.
Additionally, many printer drivers implement gray-scale dithering; the output on
these printers is also excellent when DIBs are used.

NOTE: Because bitmaps are device-dependent, you should avoid the BitBlt function
when printing bitmaps. The type of bitmaps that the BitBlt function requires are
normally in the format of the display driver rather than the printer driver.
Depending on the drivers involved, the results of using BitBlt to print a bitmap
can vary from extremely poor output quality to no output at all.

Although all printer drivers are able to BitBlt a monochrome bitmap to the
printer, this technique generally produces poor results because the printer
cannot apply gray-scaling to the image.

This technique of using a DIB to convert a bitmap between display devices with
different capabilities can also be used to convert bitmaps while preserving the
original color information (for example, loading a 256-color bitmap from a .bmp
file and printing it to a 3-color printer or displaying it on a 24-bit
display).

The file Dibapi.txt contains more information on function parameters and usage. A
Windows Help file for the DIB APIs is also included.
