SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the README.TXT file that comes with the
HPPCL5E.DRV printer driver version 31.1.08. The version 31.1.08 driver replaces
the version 31.1.03 driver.

For information on later updates to the HPPCL5E driver, query on "Changes to
Windows Driver Library", (including the quotation marks). Select the article
containing printer drivers beginning with 'H'.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FIXES SINCE LaserJet 4/4M DRIVER VERSION 31.1.03a
-------------------------------------------------

The following problems, evident in LaserJet 4/4M driver version 31.1.03a, have
been CORRECTED in this version, 31.V1.08, of the LaserJet 4/4M driver:

- Inaccurate right justification and centering of TrueType fonts.

- Random sized characters when running ATM 2.5 in soft font mode

- Inaccurate TrueType point sizes

- PASSTHROUGH/TRANSPARENT mode disabled

People who experience the above problems may call in and say that they have
trouble with the underline feature. Since the character may print in random
sizes the underline feature may appear to start early or extended beyond
underlined characters.

To fix the problem immediately activate the "Print TrueType fonts as Graphics"
feature in the driver. NOTE: printing TrueType fonts as graphics will decrease
printing speed.

HEWLETT-PACKARD PERSONAL PERIPHERALS ASSIST LINE
------------------------------------------------

You can call the Hewlett-Packard Personal Peripherals Assist Line weekdays
between 7 A.M. and 6 P.M. (Mountain Standard Time), except for Wednesdays when
the hours are 7 A.M. to 4 P.M.: (208) 323-2551 (USA and Canada only).

FEATURES OF HEWLETT-PACKARD HPPCL5E PRINTER DRIVER VERSION V1.08
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Hewlett-Packard HPPCL5E Printer Driver version 31.V1.08 includes support for
the HP LaserJet 4/4M printer and the following new features:

Support for 600 dpi Printer RESOLUTION

  The user can switch between 300 and 600 dpi printer resolution via the switch
  in the setup dialog of the driver.

Support for Graphics Quality:

  At 600 dpi mode in the LaserJet 4/4M the driver supports graphics resolutions
  of 600, 300, and 150 dpi. At 300 dpi mode the driver supports 300, 150, and
  75 dpi. The actual graphics resolution settings are denoted by the
  descriptive terms of Low, Medium, and High rather than the actual dpi.

Support for the TrueType typefaces:

  All the resident TrueType typefaces in the HP LaserJet 4/4M printer are
  supported. Other TrueType typefaces are supported by building outlines from
  the typeface and downloading the characters needed on the fly. All of the
  internal TrueType typefaces in the HP LaserJet 4/4M printer are supported in
  the 19U symbol set with the exception of WingDings in L$ and Symbol in AS.

  Hewlett-Packard has made the TrueType format screen fonts available for the 35
  Intellifont format typefaces in LaserJet 4/4M. These screen fonts are
  available through your local Hewlett-Packard dealer and are not included in
  this package. TrueType equivalent screen fonts allow for a more closely
  integrated Windows 3.1 solution.

Support for the internal Intellifont typefaces:

  All the internal Intellifont typefaces in the HP LaserJet 4/4M printer are
  supported in the 19U symbol set. To obtain WYSIWYG results, use HP
  Intellifont which supports on-the-fly screen fonts to match your printer
  fonts in Windows 3.1.

Support for HP-GL/2:

  Support for HP-GL/2 is in version V1.08. Under the Options dialog in the
  Printer Setup, a new option of "Graphics Mode" is available. Two options are
  present: HP-GL/2 or Raster. The first choice enables HP-GL/2 which will
  increase print performance but may possibly cause 21 Print Overruns in some
  applications. The second choice disables HP-GL/2 and uses raster only. The
  default for Graphics Mode is HP-GL/2.

  If you do encounter print difficulties in the default Graphics Mode, it is
  recommended that you change the mode to Raster and try your print job again.
  Additional information on this topic may be found in the help files that
  accompany this driver. Choose Help from the driver dialog screens or the HP
  font installer screens to access the HELP information.

Dialog Support for Resolution Enhancement technology:

  Another feature added to the Option Dialog is the Resolution Enhancement
  technology box. The options here are: Printer Default, Light, Medium, Dark,
  and Off.
