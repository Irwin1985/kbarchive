The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you have a compressed drive and you are using Complete Communicator software
that uses voice files, you may notice that the voice playback quality has
diminished.

CAUSE
=====

According to Complete PC Technical Support, Complete Communicator software that
uses voice files may need to be stored on an uncompressed drive. If you store
voice files on a volume that has been compressed (with DoubleSpace or Stacker
for example), the playback quality may diminish as the drive fills up or becomes
fragmented.

This problem occurs with any disk-compression software because the voice files
are already compressed and cannot be properly decompressed when they are
retrieved from a compressed drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

Run Microsoft Degragmenter (Defrag) to defragment the drive. If this does not
correct the problem, you need to move your Complete Communicator software
installation to an uncompressed or host drive.

NOTE: You cannot move the data files to the host drive without moving the entire
directory structure. The Complete Communicator software program requires that
the program files be in the same directory as the voice files.

If you have already installed DoubleSpace and you need to move your Complete
Communicator software to the host drive, do the following:

1. Change to the MS-DOS command prompt for the directory that contains the
  Complete Communicator software.

2. Use the DIR command to determine the total size of the directory (including
  subdirectories). For example, type "dir /s" (without the quotation marks) at
  the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

  Write down the size of the Complete Communicator software directory.

3. Run DoubleSpace (DBLSPACE.EXE).

4. From the Drive menu, choose Change Size.

5. Increase the New Free Space setting to the value you determined in step 2,
  and then choose the OK button.

6. From the Drive menu, choose Exit.

7. Type "dblspace /list" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command
  prompt, and then press ENTER to determine the host drive for the compressed
  drive that contains the Complete Communicator software.

8. Use the XCOPY command to copy the Complete Communicator directory (COMPPC) to
  the host drive. For example, if H is your host drive, type "xcopy
  c:\comppc\*.* h:\comppc\*.* /s" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
  command prompt and then press ENTER.

9. Confirm that all your files were copied to the host drive.

10. Using MS-DOS Editor, edit the CONFIG.SYS file and change the path for any
  device drivers for Complete Communicator to point to the host drive.

11. Using MS-DOS Editor, edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change the path for any
  programs called from the Complete Communicator directory on the host drive.
  You should also change the PATH statement to include the Complete
  Communicator software directory on the host drive.

12. Restart your computer and run the Complete Communicator software.

13. If everything is working correctly, you can delete the Complete Communicator
  software directory from the compressed drive. For example, type "deltree /y
  c:\comppc" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and
  then press ENTER.
