  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

An application for Microsoft Windows often needs to be launched from another
Windows-based application. In addition to starting a second application,
sometimes the primary application needs to know when the second application
terminates.

This technical article discusses the following points:

- Several ways to start applications

- An approach to finding applications not located on the current Windows search
  path

- A method for detecting whether an application is still running

- Using the same Windows-based techniques for starting applications for MS-DOS

APPEXEC, the sample application provided with this article, contains code that
solves the problems involved in finding and starting one Windows-based
application from another, as well as determining later whether that application
is still running.
