CONVERT.TXT
-----------

This file provides instructions and information about converting your
Stacker disk-compression software to DoubleSpace. This file contains
the following topics:

1. Converting Stacker disk-compression software to DoubleSpace
2. Using Stacker floppy disks with DoubleSpace
3. Free-space requirements for converting a Stacker drive
4. DoubleSpace could not convert a Stacker drive because
  there was not enough free space
5. DoubleSpace cannot convert a Stacker drive because
  there is not enough free memory
6. You have less compressed disk space with DoubleSpace than with
  Stacker
7. After converting your Stacker drives to DoubleSpace, your network
  does not work
8. The conversion program cannot continue because there is not
  enough environment space

1. Converting Stacker Disk-Compression Software to DoubleSpace
==============================================================

To convert your Stacker disk-compression software to DoubleSpace,
carry out the following procedure.

Note: To convert a Stacker floppy disk to DoubleSpace format, see
Section 2 below.

Note: If your version of Stacker is 1.1 or you compressed your drive
with a cluster size other than 8K, you cannot automatically convert
your Stacker drive; you must convert it manually, as described in the
README.TXT file in the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

1. Insert the Stacker Conversion Disk in drive A or B.

2. Change to your floppy disk drive. For example, type A: or B: at
  the command prompt.

3. Type CONVERT at the command prompt.

  Follow the instructions on your screen. DoubleSpace will update
  the first version of the DBLSPACE.EXE and DBLSPACE.HLP files
  in your path.

  Note: If you have other versions of the DBLSPACE.EXE and DBLSPACE.HLP
  files on your computer, cancel the Setup program and update these
  versions manually by copying these files from the Stacker conversion
  disk to your hard disk. Then run the CONVERT program again.

  When DoubleSpace restarts your computer, make sure to remove disks
  from all floppy disk drives.

2. Using Stacker Floppy Disks with DoubleSpace
==============================================

If you have floppy disks that were compressed by using Stacker, you
must convert them to DoubleSpace format in order to use them with
DoubleSpace.

When DoubleSpace Setup converts your Stacker drives to DoubleSpace
format, it also converts any compressed floppy disks or other
removable media that are currently mounted. After you have completed
DoubleSpace Setup, you can convert other floppy disks and removable
media from Stacker to DoubleSpace format by using the Convert Stacker
command.

If a compressed floppy disk contains at least .9 MB of free space, you
can convert it to DoubleSpace format by choosing the Convert Stacker
option from the Tools menu in DoubleSpace, or by typing DBLSPACE
/CONVSTAC at the MS-DOS command prompt.

If a floppy disk contains less than .9 MB of free space, you can
convert it to DoubleSpace format manually by carrying out the
following procedure:

1. Insert the floppy disk in drive A or B.

2.  Move the STACVOL.DSK file to the host drive on your hard disk. To
   determine which drive is your host drive, type DBLSPACE /LIST at the
   command prompt. The host drive is listed under the CVF Filename
   column. For example, if D:\DBLSPACE.000 is the CVF Filename associated
   with drive C, drive D is the host drive.

   When you move the file, change its extension to .001. For example
   if the floppy disk is in drive A, and your host drive is drive D,
   type the following at the command prompt:

      move a:\stacvol.dsk d:\stacvol.001

   If there is insufficient disk space, start DoubleSpace by typing
   DBLSPACE at the command prompt, and then choose Change Size
   from the Drive menu. Make the size of the uncompressed drive
   large enough to contain the Stacker compressed volume file.

3.  Delete unnecessary Stacker files from the floppy disk. For
   example, if you have Stacker 2.0, delete STACKER.DRV. If you have
   Stacker 3.0, delete STACKER.EXE and README.STC. (Use the ATTRIB -R
   README.STC command before deleting the file to remove its read-
   only attribute.)

4.  Covert the compressed volume file to DoubleSpace format, as in the
   following example:

      dblspace /convstac=d:\stacvol.001

   After DoubleSpace converts the file, it will mount it.

5.  Make sure your floppy disk is in drive A or B, and then compress
   it by choosing the Existing Drive command from the Compress menu
   in DoubleSpace. Follow the instructions on your screen.

   DoubleSpace mounts the floppy drive after it finishes compressing
   the floppy disk.

6.  Quit DoubleSpace.

7.  Use the DIR /A:H and DIR /A:S commands to determine whether you
   have any hidden or system files and directories on the new
   compressed drive (the drive created in step 4). If you have any
   hidden or system files and directories, use the ATTRIB -S -H
   command to remove their attributes. For more information about
   using the DIR and ATTRIB commands, see MS-DOS Help.

   Note: If you have any hidden or system directories, make sure to check
   whether those directories contain any hidden or system files and
   subdirectories.

8.  Use the XCOPY command to copy all the files on the new compressed
   drive (the drive created in step 4) on your hard disk to the
   compressed floppy disk. For example, if the compressed drive is J
   and the floppy disk is in drive A, type the following at the
   command prompt:

      xcopy j:\*.* a: /s

9.  Delete the compressed drive from your hard disk. For example, if
   the compressed drive is J, type the following at the command
   prompt:

      dblspace /delete j:

   To confirm the deletion, type Y.

10. If you removed the attributes of any files and directories in step
   7, use the ATTRIB +H and ATTRIB +S commands to restore those
   attributes to the files and directories on the floppy disk.

3. Free-Space Requirements for Converting a Stacker Drive
=========================================================

To convert a Stacker drive to DoubleSpace format, the drive must
contain some free space. To convert your startup hard disk, the drive
must contain at least 1.7 MB of free space. To convert other hard
drives and floppy disks, the drive or disk must contain at least 1.0
MB of free space.

4. DoubleSpace Could Not Convert a Stacker Drive Because
  There Was Not Enough Free Space
========================================================

DoubleSpace indicates how much free space needs to be free on your
startup or uncompressed drive. Make a note of this amount. Then carry
out the following procedure:

1. Type the following at the command prompt:

     chkdsk drive:

  For the drive: parameter, type the drive letter of your uncompressed
  drive followed by a colon (:). A line similar to the following should
  appear on your screen:

     20386 bytes available on disk

2. Delete unnecessary files or move files to another drive until you
  have enough free disk space. You might want to back up the files
  before you delete them.

  IMPORTANT: Do not delete your COMMAND.COM, AUTOEXEC.BAT, or CONFIG.SYS
  files, your hidden Stacker or system files, or the STACKER.COM and
  SSWAP.COM files in your Stacker directory. If you cannot delete enough
  unnecessary files, use the SDEFRAG /G command to make more
  uncompressed space available, or contact your disk-compression
  software vendor.

3. Run DoubleSpace again.

5. DoubleSpace Cannot Convert a Stacker Drive Because
  There is Not Enough Free Memory
=====================================================

If DoubleSpace displays a message that it cannot convert Stacker
because there is not enough free memory, carry out the procedures in
"An MS-DOS-based program displays an out-of-memory message" in the
chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" of the Microsoft MS-DOS 6
User's Guide.

IMPORTANT: When carrying out procedure 2 from the User's Guide, do not
bypass any commands that enable access to your Stacker drives. For
example, don't bypass the DEVICE commands that load the STACKER.COM
and SSWAP.COM commands.

6. You Have Less Compressed Disk Space with DoubleSpace Than
  With Stacker
=================================================================

If you convert a drive from Stacker to DoubleSpace, DoubleSpace might
show that you have less compressed disk space than you had with
Stacker. However, because DoubleSpace is thoroughly integrated with
the MS-DOS operating system, it estimates compressed disk space more
accurately than Stacker does. In fact, you may actually have more
compressed disk space than you had with Stacker, regardless of what
Stacker showed.

Also, unlike Stacker, DoubleSpace continually updates its compressed
disk space estimates. So, as you work with a compressed drive,
DoubleSpace updates its estimates to reflect the actual current state
of file compression on your drive.

7. After Converting Your Stacker Drives to DoubleSpace, Your Network
  Does Not Work
====================================================================

If your network files were located on your uncompressed drive before
you converted your drives to DoubleSpace, your network will probably
not work after conversion. To solve this problem, copy your network
files from your uncompressed (local) drive to your compressed drive.
(To determine which drives are local and compressed, use the DBLSPACE
/LIST command.) Make sure the network files have the same path as the
network commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.

8. The Conversion Program Cannot Continue Because There is Not
  Enough Environment Space
====================================================================

If the MS-DOS Stacker conversion program cannot continue because there
is not enough environment space, you need to temporarily increase your
environment space. To do this, carry out the following procedure.

1. Examine the contents of your CONFIG.SYS file. If the file contains
  a SHELL command that includes the /E switch, note the number
  specified by the /E switch. This is your current environment space.

  If your CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a SHELL command, or if
  the SHELL command does not contain a /E switch, your current
  environment space is 256 bytes.

2. At the command prompt, type the COMMAND command followed by the /E
  switch and a number equal to your current environment space plus
  at least 100 bytes. For example, if your environment space is
  currently 512 bytes, type the following at the command prompt:

     command /e:612

3. To convert your Stacker disk-compression software to DoubleSpace,
  carry out the procedure in section 1 of this file.
