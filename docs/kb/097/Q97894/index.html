The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is more than one dialog box to change your password in version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

These change different passwords. They are not for the same use, although the
actual password can be the same.

In some cases, you might have to change both your password and driver to access
all of your different mail systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mail Remote for Windows Driver
------------------------------

With the Mail Remote driver loaded in Mail Remote for Windows, there are two
passwords. One for local Sign-In (access to your mail) and the other for dialing
in to your postoffice.

The first option changes your local password, allowing you security over your
local message store file. By default, this file's name is MSMAIL.MMF and is
located in your Windows directory. When the Change Password dialog box is
activated from the Mail menu, its title is Change Password.

If you select Dialin Password from the Mail, Communications dialog box, the
dialog is titled Dialin Password. The password referred to in the option Dialin
Password contains the password needed by modem users to access their postoffice.
This password is set by your Mail Administrator. If you change it without being
told to by the Mail Administrator, you will no longer be able to connect to your
postoffice.

AT&amp;T Mail Driver
----------------

With the AT&amp;T Mail driver loaded in Mail Remote for Windows, there are also
multiple passwords. There are references to both a password and a secondary
password when you choose the Change Password option on the Mail menu in the
Sign-In screen when you start Mail.

The reference to password provides two functions: local access to mail (password
to your MS_ATT.MMF message store) and it is the primary password for dialing in
to your AT&amp;T Mail host system. A secondary password is optional with
AT&amp;T mail -- it is not required for either local (.MMF) access or for host
(dial-in) access.

Because your local (primary) password must be used for both local and host
access, you should not change the password without notice from AT&amp;T mail. If
you change your local password, you will not get access to AT&amp;T mail hosts
through your modem. You must get this password only from AT&amp;T. As such, do
not change your primary password unless you get confirmation first from
AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T will give you your password -- you cannot choose your own
password.

If you choose to use a secondary password, you can change this yourself. Use the
Terminal option on the Mail menu to dial in to the AT&amp;T host directly and
change your secondary password on the host first. Then use your Mail, Change
Password option to change the password as it is stored in Mail Remote for
Windows.

NOTE: This is in the Help file for AT&amp;T and the Microsoft Mail Product
Support Help file installed by Setup when you setup Mail Remote for Windows.

When you load the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks driver with Mail Remote for
Windows, the Sign-In password is first checked against the password assigned to
your account on your postoffice by your Mail Administrator. This password must
match the password for your .MMF file if you have a local file already created.

If you have a local .MMF with a different password than your Network
Administrator has assigned you, using the Network Mail driver will not allow you
access to that .MMF. The easiest option is to have your Administrator change
your Network-Access password, or Sign-In to your own account with the Microsoft
Mail for MS-DOS client and change your password to match the password you use
for your local .MMF file.

If that is not an option, switch back to a driver that will allow you access to
your local .MMF and change your Local-Access password to match the password
assigned by your Mail Administrator. Then load the Network Mail driver and start
Mail.

Another option is to rename your local .MMF file so it is not MSMAIL.MMF. Once
you start Mail Remote for Windows and it does not find your local file (because
you renamed it), Mail will prompt you to create a new .MMF file. This file will
have the password assigned by your Mail Administrator for Network Mail Access.
