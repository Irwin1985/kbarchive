-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the registry entries for modifying the polling
frequencies of the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail.

CAUTION: The default settings have been set to give the cc:Mail Connector optimal
performance. Please do not change these settings unless absolutely necessary.
Modifying these settings could adversely affect the performance of the
connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Several registry values control when and how the cc:Mail connector service
activates and the amount of processing it performs.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Registry entries that control the connector are found in the following registry
location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC\ 
  Parameters

The entry for the polling interval at which the Export.exe program runs is:

  Second to wait before EXPORT

and the default is 15 seconds.

The entry for the polling interval at which the Import.exe program runs is:

  Second to wait before IMPORT

and the default is 15 seconds.

The entry for the number of messages to request from cc:mail Export for each
activation is:

  Maximum number of messages to EXPORT

and the default is 16.

The entry for the number of messages to Import to cc:mail on each Import
activation is:

  Maximum number of messages to IMPORT

and the default is 5.

By default, the Connector service checks the Import directory and the cc:mail
post office every 15 seconds, in accordance with the settings in the first two
registry entries above (Second to wait before EXPORT and Second to wait before
IMPORT). If there are messages awaiting delivery, the connector service requests
16 or 5 messages to be delivered, in accordance with the second set of registry
entries (Maximum number of messages to EXPORT and Maximum number of messages to
IMPORT).

If the maximum number of messages processed during the Import or Export session
is equal to the registry value, the server immediately processes another
session. By immediately processing again when the maximum number of messages are
present, the connector can continually move messages when there is a backlog. If
the number of messages is less than the default value, no additional processing
occurs until the time interval expires.
