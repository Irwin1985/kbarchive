-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade client components on a client computer running
Windows NT, the client components are not updated if both of the following
conditions are true:

- The Package Command Manager (PCM) service is installed in the Ms\Sms\Bin
  directory.

  -and-

- The PCM service is set to start automatically.

This problem only applies to installations of Systems Management Server where the
Package Command Manager has been implemented as service on client computers
running Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

The application is reported as being an active client application, and the
downloading of the updated client files is delayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the PCM service to manual and restart the
client computer running Windows NT. The next time SMSRUN32 runs, the updated
client components will be downloaded from the logon server as expected.

A more permanent solution is to reinstall the PCM service to a directory other
than Ms\Sms\Bin.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run Upgrade.bat on a Systems Management Server logon server to update
some of the Systems Management Server client components, you must restart the
system for the updates to be downloaded. When the system restarts, Smsrun32.exe
is called from the LOAD statement in the registry. This application first checks
to see if any of the applications in the Ms\Sms\Bin directory are running before
attempting to download any files. If any applications are currently running,
Smsrun32.exe postpones the update.

Running Smsrun32.exe /V shows the following information:

  Reading configuration...
  Client executable active: pcmsvc32.exe
  Warning: Client component in use.
  Client component files will not be overwritten or removed.
  Verifying Microsoft Systems Management Server client installation.

This may keep clients from upgrading their components if Systems Management
Server is upgraded or a service pack is applied.
