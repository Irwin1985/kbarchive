Fringer

The game of untwisting ropes. The player controls a shuttle that untangles
colored ropes in alternating directions.

Mixed Genetics

The game of breeding silly looking animals. The player attempts to cure bizarre
mutations by combining trios of creatures with common characteristics.

Rat Poker

The player manipulates various configurations of traps in order to arrange
Lemming-like multi-colored rats into poker hands. As the game progresses, the
variety of rats and possible hands increases.

Finty Flush
-----------

A game of dropping columns of balls into four-by-four grids. By sliding the
columns back and forth and manipulating the four grids, the player attempts to
pack each grid with balls of the same color.

Color Collision
---------------

The player controls a varicolored flying shawl, trying to touch circles of the
same color. By timing the touches properly, the player can collect various
bonuses.

Jewel Chase
-----------

The player controls Pluh, a purple creature who walks around a multi- colored
board gathering gems and coins. Pluh always jumps to a tile of the same color
it's already on.

Lineup

The player places 5-block pieces on a square grid, attempting to form horizontal
or vertical lines. Various sport-theme bonuses and obstacles appear on the
field, hindering progress.

Spring Weekend

By rotating hexagonal configurations, the player attempts to match the board to
the objective. As the levels increase, the configurations become more varied and
difficult.

Charmer

By controlling the position and type of flute, the player charms snakes out of
their pots. The rising snakes intercept the falling pot lids, which are trying
to shut them in.

Muddled Casino
--------------

A challenging, abstract puzzle game where the player attempts to move a playing
card to the grid exit without knocking other cards off the grid. Cards can only
be moved in groups, which are determined by pairs of symbols at the edges of the
board.
