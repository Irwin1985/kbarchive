1.0  Introduction

This release of Microsoft(R) Exchange Server 5.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) is
easy to apply from within Microsoft Windows NT(R) and changes only those
files that were originally set up on the Microsoft Exchange Server system.

Important: Service Pack 2 requires that Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 has
already been installed on the server or client workstation that you are
updating.

2.0  Installation Instructions for Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 2

To install Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Exchange Server from compressed
files:

1. Create two subdirectories, Setup and Support.

2. Download the compressed Setup file appropriate for your hardware
platform into the Setup directory. Select the appropriate file as indicated
in the following list.

               Alpha AXP                       SP2_500A.EXE
               Intel                           SP2_500I.EXE

3. Download the compressed support file appropriate for your hardware
platform into the Support directory. Select the appropriate file as
indicated in the following list.

               Alpha AXP                       SP2S500A.EXE
               Intel                           SP2S500I.EXE

4. At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the Setup directory and type
the file name (downloaded in step 2) followed by -d to ensure that the
correct directories are created. (Example: SP2_500A -d)

5. At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the Support directory and
type the file name (downloaded in step 3) followed by -d to ensure that the
correct directories are created. (Example: SP2S500A -d)

6. Switch to the Setup directory, and then type Update. Follow the
instructions displayed on the screen.

7. Switch to the Support directory, and then type Setup. Follow the
instructions displayed on the screen.

2.1  Installation Instructions for Microsoft Exchange Client Service Pack 2

To install Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Exchange Client from a compressed
file:

1. Create a Client subdirectory.

2. Download the compressed Setup file appropriate for the clients for your
hardware platform directory. Select the appropriate files as indicated in
the following list.

               Windows 16-bit client                   SP2_50WI.EXE
               Windows 16-bit NEC client (Japan only)  SP2_50EC.EXE
               Windows 95 client                       SP2_509I.EXE
               Windows NT (Alpha)                      SP2_50NA.EXE
               Windows NT (Intel)                      SP2_50NI.EXE

3. At a command prompt, switch to the Client directory, and then type the
file name (downloaded in step 2) followed by -d to ensure that the correct
directories are created. (Example: SP2_50NA -d)

4. To update a client, switch to the Client and platform directory, and
then type Update. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen.

Note: On older computers and non-Intel processors, the Update program can
take 10 or more minutes to run because it must copy the cabinet files to
the local computer, extract the files, and then copy them to their correct
locations.

Note: To refresh the client installation point on your network so it
contains the latest fixes and prevents new users from having to run Update
immediately after they run Setup, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article
Q179548: XADM: How to Update Client Install Share with 5.0 SP1.

information.

2.3  Installation Instructions for Microsoft Outlook Client for Exchange
Service Pack 2

Note: The Microsoft Outlook(r) client included in this Service Pack is
version 8.03 and is a complete installation of the client. Each user will
be required to re-enter the PID number the user entered when installing
Outlook the first time.

Note: This version of the Outlook client cannot be installed on the same
machine running Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0.

To install Outlook version 8.03 from a compressed file:

1. Create an Outlook directory.

2. Download the compressed Outlook client files into the Outlook directory.

                               SP2_50O1.EXE
                               SP2_50O2.EXE

that the correct directories are created. (Example: SP2_50O1 -d)

5. Double-click Setup.exe, and then follow the instructions displayed on
the screen.

3.0  Updating the Web Connector

The Web Connector is now called Microsoft Outlook Web Access.

To update the Web client on Microsoft Exchange Server:

1. Create an Outlook directory.

2. Change to the Outlook directory and create a Web directory.

3. Download the compressed Web Connector file appropriate for your hardware
platform into the Web directory. Select the appropriate file as indicated
in the following list.

               Alpha AXP                       SP2_50BA.EXE
               Intel                           SP2_50BI.EXE

4. At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the Web directory and then
type the file name (downloaded in step 3) followed by a -d to ensure that
the correct directories are created. (Example: SP2_50BI -d)

3.1  Requirements Before Updating

Before updating a server that has the Web Connector installed, the
following must be installed:

- Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
- Active Server Pages 1.0b (distributed in Windows NT 4.0 SP3)
- Outlook Web Access does not support Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0. For IIS 4.0 support, you must upgrade to Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.5.
- Support for Microsoft and Netscape browsers version 4.0 or later requires
Outlook Web Access version 5.5.

3.2  Chinese Language Preferences

Web browsers can request Chinese Traditional (zh-tw) or Chinese Simplified
(zh-cn). Some browsers do not differentiate between Chinese Traditional and
Chinese Simplified when reporting their language preference to the server.
In cases where the browser does not specify a sublanguage, the most
recently installed language pack will be the default.  You can control what
language will be returned in these cases by the order in which you install
your Chinese language packs.

3.3  Anonymous Access

Anonymous access is not available to folders hosted on servers running
Windows NT 3.51 servers. To support anonymous folder access, the folders
must be hosted on a server running Windows NT 4.0.

3.4  Attachment Upload Requirements

When using Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows 95 or Windows NT, you
must update to Internet Explorer 3.02 with the File Upload add-on to add
attachments to a message.

4.0  User Notes

4.1  Using Multiple Offline Address Books in the Administrator Program

Administrators can configure offline Address Books that remote users can
use to obtain information about other users in their organization. When
connecting remotely to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, a user can
download an offline Address Book containing a list of recipients the
administrator specifies. Offline Address Books are stored in hidden public
folders.

Remote users typically send messages to a regular group of addresses and
require a subset of the global address list rather than the entire global
address list for their organization. For example, members of a marketing
group may need the addresses of the complete marketing and sales groups,
but not the entire set of engineering group addresses.

The Offline Address Book property page on the DS Site Configuration object
has been enhanced to allow you to generate and manipulate multiple offline
Address Books.

Defining Offline Address Book Properties

Use the Offline Address Book property page to set up multiple offline
Address Books.

1. In the Administrator window, choose Configuration, and then double-click
DS Site Configuration.

2. Select the Offline Address Book tab.

3. In the Offline Address Book Server box, select one of the servers in
your site.

Important  You must select a server running Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0 and Service Pack 1 or 2.

4. To add containers for more offline Address Books, choose Add. To remove
offline Address Book containers, select a container, and then choose
Remove.

5. To generate offline Address Books, choose Generate All.

The following options appear in the Offline Address Book property page:

Offline Address Book Server
The name of the server where you want to generate the offline Address Book.

Address Books
Displays a list of Address Books to be generated for the site being
administered.

Add
Displays a list of containers that can be added to the list of offline
Address Books.

Remove
Removes the selected offline Address Book from the list.

Generate All
Generates all displayed offline Address Books immediately.

4.2  Using Multiple Offline Address Books in the Client

Multiple offline Address Books require Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 SP1 or
later and either Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 SP1 or Outlook 8.02. When
the multiple offline Address Book feature is enabled on the server and a
user tries to download an offline Address Book (as in previous versions of
Microsoft Exchange Server), the user will be prompted with a dialog box
that lists all available Address Books. The user can select one of these
Address Books.

4.3  Windows File Types List for Microsoft Exchange Client for Macintosh

Under some circumstances, the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh Client sends and
receives e-mail by using only the data fork of the message. A new entry in
the preferences file (named "Windows File Types") lists file types for
which the Microsoft Exchange Client for Macintosh will use only the data
fork of the message. This feature improves interoperability between the
Microsoft Exchange Macintosh Client and other e-mail clients.

Types of Entries
There are two types of entries:

       General extensions
       Specific extensions for creator and type

General Extensions
Users can add an entry using the following syntax:

       EXT [Number]= .[Extension]

All files that have this extension will be inserted in subsequent messages
as a data fork-only attachment. The default types are HTML, GIF, PDF, and
JPEG.

Specific Extensions for Creator and Type
Users can add an entry using the following syntax:

       :[CREATOR]:[TYPE]= .[Extension]

All files that have the specified creator and type will be inserted as a
data fork-only attachment. The extension will be added to the end of the
file name, unless it is already present.

4.4  Installing Internet Explorer 4.0 After Installing Microsoft Exchange
Server

If you need to run Internet Explorer and Microsoft Exchange Server on the
same computer, it is strongly recommended that you install Internet
Explorer 4.0 before installing Microsoft Exchange Server. If you install
Internet Explorer 4.0 after installing Microsoft Exchange Server, Internet
Explorer modifies the MIME registry database resulting in problems for
international mail, especially mail with double-byte character content. If
you installed Internet Explorer 4.0 after installing Microsoft Exchange
Server, complete the following procedure to correct this problem. You can
perform this procedure without stopping any Microsoft Exchange Server
services.

Note: This procedure is not required if you are installing Internet
Explorer 4.0 before you install Microsoft Exchange Server.

1. Create a MIME directory on your local hard drive.
2. Download the compressed file SP2_50MM.EXE to your MIME directory.
3. At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the WPapers directory and
then type SP2_50MM followed by -d to ensure that the correct directories
are created. (Example: SP2_50MM -d)
4. Right-click on the RESET.INF file in the MIME\Support Mimedb directory,
and then choose Install.

4.5  Macintosh Appledouble Attachments

If an Internet message is received with Appledouble attachments, such as
those generated by the Netscape mail client for Macintosh, the outbound
message format is always determined by defaults configured for the Internet
Mail Service or Internet protocols (IMAP4 and POP3), not by the incoming
message format.

4.6  Microsoft Exchange Server White Papers

To download Microsoft Exchange Server white papers:

1. Create the subdirectory WPapers on your local hard drive.
2. Download the file SP2_50WH.EXE located in the Server subdirectory to
your WPapers subdirectory.
3. At the Windows NT command prompt, switch to the WPapers directory and
then type SP2_50WH followed by -d to ensure that the correct directories
are created. (Example: SP2_50WH -d)

The following Microsoft Exchange white papers have been included as a
convenience to you and can be found in the \Support\Whiteppr directory.
These documents can be viewed with Microsoft Word for Windows 95 or
Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0.

Edrv3p1.doc = Microsoft Exchange Disaster Recovery Part I

Edrv3p2.doc = Microsoft Exchange Disaster Recovery Part II
This paper outlines thoughts, observations, and techniques that can be
applied to Microsoft Exchange disaster recovery planning.
