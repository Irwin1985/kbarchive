-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Pack and Go Wizard to pack a PowerPoint 97 presentation that has
a recorded narration, unpack it on another computer, and try to run the slide
show in PowerPoint 7.0 or the 32-bit PowerPoint viewer, the following symptoms
may occur:

- As each slide appears, a dialog box with a title similar to the following
  appears:

  Locate Media Clip ppt292.tmp

  No matter which folder you open, you cannot find a file with that name.

  -and-

- When you click Cancel, you receive an error message similar to the following:

  Ppt292.tmp

  This file cannot be found. Make sure the correct path and filename are given.

If you run the same presentation as a slide show in PowerPoint 97, it plays
without error.

CAUSE
=====

When you pack a PowerPoint 97 presentation, the Pack and Go Wizard saves the
presentation as a "PowerPoint 95 &amp; 97" presentation--a special dual-format
presentation that both PowerPoint 7.0 and PowerPoint 97 can open directly.
Because the Record Narration feature is new to PowerPoint 97, the Pack and Go
Wizard tries to convert the recorded narration to a series of sound (.wav) files
which it links to the individual slides. However, it actually converts the
recorded narration to a series of temporary (.tmp) files which it does not
actually include in the packed presentation.

NOTE: In Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1), the Pack and Go Wizard in
PowerPoint 97 can pack presentations as PowerPoint 97 presentations instead of
PowerPoint 7.0 and 97 dual-format presentations. As a result, packing a
presentation requires fewer disks. For additional information about obtaining
Office 97 SR-1, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1. Create Sound Files That Will Be Packed with the Presentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you use the Record Narration feature on a presentation that you may need to
pack, use the following steps to link the sound files instead of embedding
them:

1. On the Slide Show menu, click Record Narration.

2. Click to select the Link Narrations In check box.

3. Click Browse.

4. In the Choose Directory dialog box, select the folder where you want to save
  your recorded narration sound files, and then click OK.

5. Record the narration.

When you use this method, PowerPoint saves the recorded narration as a series of
sound (.wav) files that are separate from the presentation. When you pack the
presentation, the Pack and Go Wizard includes these files in the package.

Method 2. Copy the .tmp Files to the Destination Computer
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the presentation on the destination computer.

2. Run the presentation. Write down the name of each .tmp file you are asked to
  find.

3. Go to the computer on which you packed the presentation.

4. Search for the .tmp files you wrote down in step 2. If you can find these
  files, copy them to one or more floppy disks or to a network drive and then
  copy them to the destination computer. When you copy them to the destination
  computer, put them in the same folder that contains the unpacked
  presentation.

5. Open the unpacked presentation in PowerPoint 7.0.

6. Run the slide show. Every time the Locate Media Clip dialog box appears,
  select the folder that contains the .tmp file it wants.

7. When you finish the slide show, click Save on the File menu.
