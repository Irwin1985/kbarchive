SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create mandatory profiles for Windows NT version
4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a mandatory profile for Windows NT 4.0, perform the following steps:

1. Create a user called "Template" who will have the same privileges and rights
  as the users in the group for which you are creating the mandatory profile.
  (This step is very important so that you do not have conflicting permissions
  while setting up shares, programs, and so on.)

2. Log on to the computer running Windows NT Workstation as the new Template
  user and set up the profile (set up the desktop, install applications, and so
  on) to your specifications and log off the computer. The profile will not be
  created until you log off.

3. Log back on to the computer running Windows NT Workstation as a user with
  administrator privileges on the local workstation as well as on the domain
  and start the System tool in Control Panel. Select the User Profiles tab.

4. Highlight the profile for your Template user and select Copy To. In the Copy
  To dialog box, you will need to specify where you want to copy the profile
  and who is permitted to use it.

  a. Under the Permitted To Use section of this dialog box, click Change and
     select the user or group who will be permitted to use this profile.

  b. Next, you will need to specify where you want to COPY PROFILE TO. For a
     server based mandatory profile, you will need to specify the following
     information:

  \\ServerName\Sharename\Name of Profile

For example, \\PENDRAGON1\Profiles\mandatory.

If you are using mandatory profiles, go to step 5; otherwise, go to step 6.

5. Windows NT 4.0 has implemented two levels of security in mandatory profiles.

  The first level is to rename the Ntuser.dat file to .man. This will allow the
  users of a mandatory profile to log on to the domain using cached
  information, if the profile is unavailable on the central server.

  a. The steps to implement the first level of mandatory security: Change the
     user's profile path in user manager to reflect the mandatory profile.

  \\servername\sharename\profilename

Rename the Ntuser.dat to Ntuser.man under the profile directory

The second level is to add a .MAN extension on the directory name. When using the
.man extension, if the profile is unavailable, the workstation will not log the
user on and it will return to the CTRL+ALT+DELETE logon screen.

  b. The steps in getting the second level of security are:

     1. Add .man extension to profile path in user manager:

  \\servername\sharename\profilename.man

     2. Add .man extension to server based profile DIRECTORY and the Ntuser.dat
        file needs to be renamed to Ntuser.man

6. Click OK to copy the profile to where you have specified. Open Windows NT
  explorer and connect to the path where you have copied the profile. Open the
  directory and rename the Ntuser.dat to Ntuser.man. This will prevent users
  from being able to modify the profile. If this is not renamed, it will not
  function as a mandatory profile.

7. In User Manager for Domains, select the users you want to use the mandatory
  profile and in the properties for each user, select Profile and specify the
  path to where the mandatory profile exists in the User Profile Path box. This
  must be a UNC path so it must be in the form of \\Server\Share\Profile (all
  users who are going to be using this profile must have at least read access
  to the root share and the profile folder).

8. Test by logging on to the workstation as another user who has just been
  granted the mandatory profile.
