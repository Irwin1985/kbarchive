SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows NT from a different SCSI logical unit number (LUN) other
than LUN 0, a memory dump file (memory.dmp) file will not be created.

CAUSE
=====

The Diskdump.sys file in Windows NT does not check for any other LUN besides LUN
0. If the Windows NT computer is started from any other LUN than 0, this driver
will not load, disabling the ability to write a dump file if the computer traps
(displays a blue screen error message).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) SCSI is a hardware interface that allows
for the connection of up to 15 peripheral devices to a single expansion board
that plugs into the computer called a SCSI host adapter or SCSI controller.

SCSI devices are daisy chained together. Each device has two ports, one for the
incoming cable and another for the outgoing cable to the next device. Each
device must be set to a unique ID number (SCSI ID), which is normally done by
manually flipping a rotary switch on the device itself. The highest number has
the highest priority. Thus, the host adapter usually defaults to ID 7 in the
case of an 8-device SCSI system.

Each SCSI device can be further broken up into eight logical units, identified by
logical unit numbers (LUNs) 0 to 7. Although most SCSI disks contain only one
disk inside and are addressed as LUN 0, CD-ROM and optical disk jukeboxes
contain multiple units. Each disk in these devices can be addressed
independently via LUN numbers; for example, a four-disk jukebox could be
assigned LUN 0 to 3. RAID systems are beginning to use multiple LUN addressing
in their fault tolerant disk systems as well.

On most computers you will not need to worry about LUN addressing since, by
default, most SCSI controllers and devices are set to LUN 0. However, many of
the newer SCSI controllers have the ability to start from LUNs other than zero
(adaptec 2940 allows starting from LUN 0 or 1). You should be able to detect LUN
addressing through the SCSI boot process or by entering the BIOS of SCSI
controller installed on the system.

Obtaining SCSI Standards reference manuals:

American National Standard (ANSI) for Small Computer System Interface (SCSI),
X3.131-1986. This approved standard is available from:

  American National Standards Institute
  11 West 42nd Street 13th Floor
  New York, NY 10036
  Sales Department: (212) 642-4900

The Small Computer System Interface - 2 (SCSI-2) was approved by ANSI on August
31, 1990. Since then, the X3T9.2 committee has asked ANSI to return SCSI-2 for
further editing. Revision 10d is in the works, but it is not finished yet.
Revision 10c can be purchased from:

  Global Engineering Documents
  2805 McGaw
  Irvine, CA 92714
  (800) 854-7179
  Outside USA and Canada: (714) 261-1455

Global has identified this document as X3.131-199x. (The latest revision is Rev
10c with a date of 3/9/90.)
