SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the LinkAge Controller service from Control Panel
Services, the following messages are logged in the LinkAge Administrator
program's Log Browser:

  control(01ba) 1 00001:Operating system error {WIN32:231(All pipe
  instances are busy.)} from NPServer::create

  control(01ba) 1 01054:Error {An unknown error condition has occurred}:
  Could not create the named pipe server object

  control(01ba) 3 00505:control is ending, last return code was {An
  unknown error condition has occurred}

  control(019f) 1 00001:Operating system error {WIN32:231(All pipe
  instances are busy.)} from NPServer::create

  control(019f) 1 01054:Error {An unknown error condition has occurred}:
  Could not create the named pipe server object

  control(019f) 3 00505:control is ending, last return code was {An
  unknown error condition has occurred}

CAUSE
=====

There are two cases when these errors can be generated.

- The LinkAge Controller (Lsmain.exe) is already up and running and a user is
  trying to start the LinkAge Controller service.

- The LinkAge Controller (Lsmain.exe) is stopped or ends abnormally, but the
  rest of the underlying controller tasks are still running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

- Restart the computer. This is the easiest method.

- Terminate the remaining LinkAge processes with the Windows NT Task Manager,
  and then restart the LinkAge Controller service. It should restart correctly
  after all the processes are stopped. Contact a Microsoft Exchange Server
  Support Professional to assist with this method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LinkAge controller task and all the underlying tasks talk to each other
through named pipes (that is, inter-process communication). Named pipes are used
for such things as the scoreboard display on the LinkAge Administrator user
interface, which displays all the processes and their status, the Windows NT
Services listing, located in the Control Panel under Services, and the LinkAge
Connector logs.

If you are trying to start the LinkAge Controller service when it is already
running, the Named Pipe resources clash, and result in the above errors. You do
not need to do anything further.

If the Controller task (Lsmain.exe) is stopped for any reason and all the
underlying tasks remain, and the connector is restarted, the above errors will
be added to the log, and the connector will not appear to start. It is most
likely currently up, and mail is most likely still flowing. But no logs or
status of it being up, other than the NT Task Manager, are available.
