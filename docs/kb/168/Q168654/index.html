MORE INFORMATION
================

Instructions for Decompressing Files
------------------------------------

All of the preceding files are Win32 self-extracting executables. The SNA Server
and client update programs automatically extract and run the Update program. For
these Update programs to run automatically, the server or client machine must
have the following free disk space:

Server Update (Intel) - 30SP2IS.EXE:  95 MB&lt;BR/&gt;
Server Update (Alpha) - 30SP2AS.EXE:  105 MB&lt;BR/&gt;
Windows NT Client Update (Intel) - 30SP2ICU.EXE: 28 MB&lt;BR/&gt;
Windows NT Client Update (Alpha) - 30SP2ACU.EXE: 38 MB&lt;BR/&gt;
Windows 95 Client Update         - 30SP295U.EXE: 13 MB&lt;BR/&gt;

When running Update automatically, please note the following:

- Before the update is run, all files are automatically extracted to the
  directory where the TMP, TEMP, or WINROOT environment variable is pointing
  (trying in that order). So, if the SET command shows that TMP=C:\TMP , and C:
  does not have sufficient storage to extract the files, change TMP to point to
  a drive which has sufficient space. For example:

     SET TMP=D:\TEMP

- to extract the files into a separate directory without running update
  automatically, run the service pack update file using the /x option. For
  example:

  30SP2IS /x

The SNA Server Windows 3.x client files (30SP2CLU.EXE, 30SP2CLR.EXE) are Win32
self extracting executables that cannot be run directly from a Windows 3.x
machine. The administrator must first run the refresh file and choose a
directory to place the extracted files. Windows 3.x clients may then connect
across the network and run the Update program to apply the service pack files.

The SNA Server client refresh files (30SP2ICR.EXE, 30SP2ACR.EXE, 30SP295R.EXE,
30SP2CLR.EXE) include the full client code, which already includes all 3.0 SP2
files. These refresh files each extract into a user-defined directory, though
the setup program is not run automatically.

NOTE: Unlike previous SNA Server service packs, there is no need to extract the
executable with the "-d" option.

Installing the Service Pack Files
---------------------------------

Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated in 3.0 SP2. Updates
may be applied in any order -- to the server and/or to the clients. It is
recommended that all systems running SNA Server 3.0 (that is, SNA Servers and
client computers) are updated to 3.0 SP2. It may not be necessary to update the
client computers to SP2 unless you are experiencing a client problem that has
been fixed in SP2.

WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on systems currently
running SNA Server 3.0 server or client software. These updates should NOT be
applied over systems running SNA Server 2.x releases.

** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 3.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **
