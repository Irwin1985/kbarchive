The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you use the ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager trace facility with the Odbctrac.dll file
that comes with ODBC 3.0, user names and passwords used for connections may be
logged without encryption in the trace log.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can prevent an ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager trace on computers either by removing
the Odbctrac.dll file or by replacing it with a zero-length file of the same
name. If tracing is attempted afterwards, the following message may appear:

  General Error: either odbctrac.dll is not an ODBC tracing dll or it is
  obsolete.

With ODBC version 3.0 Service Pack 1, the user names and passwords are displayed
as "******" in the trace log. Also, the trace DLL must be in the System
directory on computers running Windows 95 or the System32 directory on computers
running Windows NT. If the trace DLL is located elsewhere, tracing will not
occur, and the message described above may appear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager trace facility is provided as a debugging tool for
diagnosing a wide range of ODBC issues, including database connectivity. In many
debugging instances, it is necessary to determine what user name and password
were used to establish the connection to the database. The ODBC 3.0 Driver
Manager trace logs the user name and password to allow for comprehensive
debugging of ODBC issues, and is the ODBC 3.0 replacement for the Driver Manager
trace facility and ODBC SPY trace program for ODBC 2.x. The ODBC SPY trace
program also logs the user name and password used in a connection.

The proper use of the ODBC 3.0 tracing facility is documented in the ODBC 3.0
Programmer's Reference Guide in Chapter 17, "Programming Considerations," under
the section for Tracing.
