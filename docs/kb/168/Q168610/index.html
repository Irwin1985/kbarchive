SYMPTOMS
========

When converting a floating point value to an integer value on Intel Pentium Pro
and Pentium II processors, a negative value much less than the smallest negative
integer does not cause a "Run-Time Error '6': Overflow," as would be expected.
This problem is actually caused by an erratum in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II
processors. The following code illustrates this problem:

     Debug.Print CInt(-2.59615E+33)
     'Where -2.59615E+33 = -2,596,150,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

Normally, this code will generate "Run-Time Error '6': Overflow." However, on
Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors, this code does not generate an overflow.

For conversion to type Integer, the failure to report an overflow occurs only
when the value is in the range -1.84 x 10^19 to -2.60 x 10^33; that is,
between:

  -18,400,000,000,000,000,000

  -and-

  -2,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

Within the range above, fewer than one out of every 65,000 values is affected.

For conversion to type Long, the failure to report an overflow occurs only when
the value is in the range -1.84 x 10^19 to -3.96 x 10^28; that is, between:

  -18,400,000,000,000,000,000

  -and-

  -39,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Within the range above, fewer than one out of every 4,000,000,000 values is
affected.

For this problem to be relevant to the Visual Basic developer, the application
must meet the following conditions:

- Large negative numbers in the ranges given above could possibly be used by
  the application.

- The application may attempt to convert those numbers to an Integer or a Long.

- The application uses an On Error statement to catch the run-time error that
  would be caused by an overflow during the conversion.

CAUSE
=====

Intel Corporation has identified an erratum in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II
processors relating to the conversion of floating point values to signed integer
values when using the Floating Point Integer Store (FIST) instruction available
with these processors. The FIST instruction converts floating point numbers to
16-, 32-, or 64-bit signed integers. Because the range of a floating point
number is larger than any of these formats, some floating point numbers cannot
be converted to integers. When attempting to convert a floating point number
that is too large to an integer, the processor should signal an "Invalid
Operation" exception. Visual Basic uses this signal to report "Run-Time Error
'6': Overflow." The erratum in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors causes
them to not signal the "Invalid Operation" exception for certain numbers in the
ranges given above.

RESOLUTION
==========

An application may be affected by this problem if all three of the conditions
listed under the SYMPTOMS section above are met. In that case, the application
must be modified to explicitly test for large negative values and raise the
exception itself. This must be done at any point that a floating point number,
Single or Double, is converted to Integer or Long, including the following
situations:

- use of CInt or CLng.

- implicit conversion by assigning to an Integer or Long variable.

- implicit conversion by passing a value to an Integer or Long procedure
  parameter.

For conversion to either Integer or Long, the following line of code should be
added immediately before the conversion:

     If FloatingPointValue &lt; -1E+18 Then Error 6

For example:

     Dim IntegerValue As Integer
     Dim FloatingPointValue As Single
   
     FloatingPointValue = -2.59615E+33
     If FloatingPointValue &lt; -1E+18 Then Error 6
     IntegerValue = FloatingPointValue

This test and conversion may be encapsulated into a pair of functions, as
follows:

  Public Function FloatToInt(Expression as Variant) As Integer
        If Expression &lt; -1E+18 Then Error 6
        FloatToInt = Expression
     End Function

     Public Function FloatToLong(Expression as Variant) As Long
        If Expression &lt; -1E+18 Then Error 6
        FloatToLong = Expression
     End Function

Using the FloatToInt function above, the previous example becomes:

     Dim IntegerValue As Integer
     Dim FloatingPointValue As Single

     FloatingPointValue = -2.59615E+33
     IntegerValue = FloatToInt(FloatingPointValue)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this erratum in the processor affects the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. Visual Basic version 6.0 is
not affected by this erratum.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more details on this erratum in the Pentium Pro processor, refer to:

  http://developer.intel.com/design/pro/update/pprosu.htm

For more details on this erratum in the Pentium II processor, refer to:

  http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumII/update/ppiisu.htm

Intel's documentation on this erratum will note additional ranges of values in
which the "Invalid Operation" exception is not set. Visual Basic is not affected
by these additional value ranges and it will report the overflow error correctly
for them.
