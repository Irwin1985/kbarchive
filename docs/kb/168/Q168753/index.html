-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Use the Permissions property page to specify the rights that users or groups
have on the objects within the Exchange Administrator program. You delegate
permissions to a user or group by assigning them a role.

Roles are sets of rights that define how much access and what type of access a
user or group has.

ORGANIZATION OBJECT
-------------------

For the Organization object, Microsoft Exchange provides Administrator,
Permissions Administrator, Service Account Administrator, and User default
roles. You can also create custom roles.

Default Roles and Rights for Organization object:

Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify Administrator
Attributes, and Delete.

Permissions Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify
Administrator Attributes, Delete, and Modify Permissions.

Service Account Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify
Administrator Attributes, Delete, Replication, and Modify Permissions.

User Role: Modify User Attributes only.

SITE OBJECT
-----------

For a Site object, Microsoft Exchange provides Administrator, Permissions
Administrator, Send As, Service Account Administrator, User, and View Only
Administrator default roles. You can also create custom roles.

Permissions you set on the Site object are inherited by the site recipients
container. For example, a user with Mailbox Owner rights at the messaging site
level automatically inherits Mailbox Owner rights for all recipients in the
recipients container.

Default Roles and Rights of Site Object:

Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify Administrator
Attributes, Delete, and Logon Rights.

Permissions Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify
Administrator Attributes, Delete, Logon Rights, and Modify Permissions.

Send As Role: Send Messages As a Mailbox. This is different from send on behalf
of permissions, because the person receiving the message cannot tell that the
message has been sent by someone else.

Service Account Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify
Administrator Attributes, Delete, Send As, Mailbox Owner, Logon Rights,
Replication, Modify Permissions.

User Role: Modify User Attributes, Send As, Mailbox Owner Send As Role: Send As
only.

View Only Administrator Role: Logon Rights only.

CONFIGURATION OBJECT
--------------------

For the Configuration object, Microsoft Exchange provides Administrator,
Permissions Administrator, Service Account Administrator, Send As, and User
roles. You can also create custom roles.

Permissions you set on the Configuration object are inherited by all objects and
containers within the Configuration object. For example, a user with Modify
Permissions rights on the Configuration object can modify permissions on all
subordinate containers and objects.

Default Roles and Rights for Configuration Object:

Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify Administrator
Attributes, and Delete.

Permissions Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify
Administrator Attributes, Delete, and Modify Permissions.

Service Account Administrator Role: Add Child, Modify User Attributes, Modify
Administrator Attributes, Delete, Replication, and Modify Permissions.

Send As Role: Send As Right only.

User Role: Modify User Attributes only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange rights are defined below. These rights are available for
assigning permissions to a user or group on the Organization, Site, and
Configuration objects within Exchange Administrator.

"Add Child" allows a user to create objects below this object.

"Modify User Attributes" allows a user to modify user-level attributes associated
with an object. A user with this permission can modify the members of a
distribution list.

"Modify Admin Attributes" allows a user to modify administrator-level attributes
associated with an object. A user with this permission can modify the job title
and display name fields in a mailbox.

"Delete" allows a user to delete an object.

"Replication" allows a user to replicate directory information with other
servers.

"Modify Permissions" allows a user to modify permissions on existing objects.
Without this permission, a user can grant permissions to new mailboxes but
cannot modify permissions on existing ones.

"Send As" allows a user to send messages as a mailbox. This is different from
Send On Behalf Of permissions, because the person receiving the message cannot
tell that the message has been sent by someone else. You delegate Send On Behalf
Of permissions using the Delivery Options property page.

"Mailbox Owner" allows a user to log on to a mailbox and use it to send and
receive messages.

"Logon Rights" allows a user to log on to any server in the site using the
Administrator program.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

The Service Account Administrator role maintains the highest level of rights and
permissions when assigned to a user or group. By default, the account specified
as the Exchange Service account is granted the Service Account Administrator
role on the Organization, Site, and Configuration objects.

Within Exchange Administrator, on the Tools menu, point to Options, and then
click the Permissions tab to select the option for the Display Rights for Roles
on Permissions page. When this option is selected, the Exchange Administrator
program displays the list of rights on the Permissions tabs of Object
properties.
