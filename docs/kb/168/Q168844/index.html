-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Undo Check Out command does not operate as expected if you have the Compare
Files By option set to Time and the Set Date/Time on Local Files set to Current.

CAUSE
=====

When you set Compare Files By to Time, the algorithm used to determine whether a
Get should be performed is based on a comparison between the timestamp on the
local copy of the file and the timestamp on the last check in for the file.

If the timestamp on the last check in is more recent than the timestamp on the
local file, Visual SourceSafe does the Get and overwrites the local copy of the
file. If the timestamp on the local file is more recent than the timestamp on
the last check in, Visual SourceSafe does not do the Get, and the local file is
not replaced.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do one of the following:

- Set Compare Files By to CheckSum instead of Time.

- Remove the local copy of the file, and then perform the Get/Check Out.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. This problem was corrected in Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you perform an Undo Check Out with the above options set in Visual
SourceSafe, unexpected results occur.

For example, you have a file checked out and you have edited it. The local file
(the one you are editing) has a more recent timestamp on it than the last
checked in copy of the file. After you have edited and saved the file you decide
you really do not want the changes you made, so you go back to SourceSafe and
perform an Undo Check Out on the file. You get the warning message stating that
all your changes will be lost if you perform an Undo Check Out. You click Yes
and Visual SourceSafe does not copy the changes in the local file back to the
server.

When you Get or Check Out the file again, Visual SourceSafe sees that the
timestamp on your local file is more recent than the timestamp on the last check
in. Visual SourceSafe does not perform the Get, and the local file is not
replaced. As a result, you see all the changes you thought you had discarded
instead of the unaltered copy you thought you retrieved by performing the Get.
