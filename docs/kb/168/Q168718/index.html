The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click on a folder, you may receive the following error message:

  The command you specified could not be carried out. The file
  &lt;path&gt;\mailbox.pst could not be accessed because another workstation
  has
  modified it. Close and then restart all mail-enabled applications.

This error message indicates that the connection between the client and the
server was lost after a certain period of time. This error was found to be
associated with specific types of Windows clients.

When you leave open, for an extended period of time, a Microsoft Exchange client
that uses a personal store file (PST) and runs on Novell Internetware Client 32
(NW 32), the client loses connection to the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks (MS
Mail PC) on a Novell server or connection to Exchange Server. The only way to
restore the connection is to log off and log back on to the network.

This problem happens in the earlier and the new versions of the NW 32 client.
This problem is not encountered when you use only the Microsoft Client for
Netware that ships with Windows 95. Some users need to use the NW 32 client in
order to run Novell's 4.x Netware Admin utility, to support Novell's Netware
Directory Services (NDS), and a few other things.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the three following procedures:

- Reinstall the Novell 32 Client for Netware by doing the following: The
  default is to upgrade the network driver interface specification (NDIS) to NW
  ODI. Instead, you should clear this check box so the client remains as NDIS.
  With this setup, the problem of losing connection to the PST file, placed on
  a Novell server, may not occur.

- If you move the PST file to a local drive, the problem should disappear. This
  may not be an acceptable solution, however, because the administrator may be
  running roving users and dial-up access, but it is sufficient proof that it
  is a network problem.

- Create an Exchange profile for the same user on a Microsoft Windows 95
  computer. This probably will eliminate the problem. If the problem
  disappears, then the problem is associated only with the Netware clients and
  not with the Exchange Server computer or the Exchange client.
