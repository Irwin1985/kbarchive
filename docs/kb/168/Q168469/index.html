- Fixes and Features included from Hotfix Update 1.0

Information on Installation:

This Hotfix Pack requires that you already have Routing and Remote Access Service
for Windows NT 4.0 Server installed on your system. Note that you must first
apply the Windows NT 4.0 PPTP Update before applying the RRAS hotfix 2.0. For
more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q167040 PPTP Performance Update for Windows NT 4.0 Release Notes

This release includes the features and fixes from Routing and Remote Access
Hotfix Update 1.0 and is packaged in an auto-install format. Copy the Hotfix to
a temporary directory, and double-click the executable name or type the
executable name "rrasfixi.exe" (without the quotation marks) for x86, or
"rrasfixa.exe" (without the quotation marks) for alpha at a command prompt to
install.

The files can also be extracted from the Hotfix Pack without installing them. To
do this, copy the Hotfix to a temporary directory, and type "rrasfixi /x"
(without the quotation marks) or "rrasfixa/x" (without the quotation marks) at a
command prompt. After extracting the files, the Hotfix can be installed by
typing "hotfix" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

To uninstall this update, type "HOTFIX -Y" (without the quotation marks) from the
directory you copied the files to.

Output of "HOTFIX -?":

  HOTFIX [-y] [-f] [-n] [-z] [-q] [-m] [-l]
     -y Perform uninstall (only with -m or -q)
     -f Force apps closed at shutdown
     -n Do not create uninstall directory
     -z Do not reboot when update completes
     -q Quiet or Unattended mode with no user interface
     -m Unattended mode with user interface
     -l List installed hotfixes

List of Issues Addressed:

NT Issues Performance Issues:

- This release includes an enhancement to TCP/IP that improves the performance
  of TCP-based applications over high latency networks, such as the Internet.

Routing Issues:

- Added new Demand dial filters. You can now keep demand dial interfaces from
  dialing by setting filters using the Routemon.exe command with a new
  "Filtertype= Dial" option. The new syntax for this is the same for setting
  Input and Output filters using Routemon.exe, and can be seen by typing
  "routemon ip set filter /?" (without the quotation marks) at a command
  prompt.

  The following is an example of the syntax used to prevent a demand dial
  interface from dialing:

  C:\&gt;routemon ip add filter myremoterouter dial 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
  0.0.0.0 any

  C:\&gt;routemon ip set filter myremoterouter dial forward

  NOTE: The first example above is one line; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

  For more information on using the Routemon.exe command to set filters, please
  see the Routing and Remote Access Administrator's Guide.

- Added the capability to filter fragmented IP packets. Two registry keys
  control this functionality.

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System|CurrentControlSet\IPFilterDriver
     \Parameters

     EnableFragmentChecking REG_DWORD

  Setting this to 1 enables fragment checks

     DefaultForwardFragments REG_DWORD

  Setting this to 0 causes the filterdriver to drop fragments if they do not
  match a previous header.

- Changes were applied to the Router's Remote Authentication Dial-In User
  Service (RADIUS) client to address a duplicate Acct-Session-Id accounting
  problem, as well as an issue that caused the reversal of the FramedIPAddress
  returned from a RADIUS server. In addition, the RADIUS client now sends the
  NAS-Port-Type and Acct- Session-Time attributes.

- Resolved issue that used to cause an Access Violation when adding a Virtual
  Interface right after configuring an Area under OSPF routing. Adjusted the
  RIP Authentication type to 2 instead of 1, per RFC 1388.

  NOTE: This update must be applied to all Routing and Remote Access routers if
  you are using RIP2 authentication.

- Resolved issue which could cause Mprouter to hang when doing an "ipconfig
  /release".

- Made a change that ensures that periodic RIP route updates resume each time a
  demand-dial interface is reactivated.

Known Problems in this Update:

- Although there is a checkbox in the Global IP Config dialog to enable/disable
  filtering, at this time the only functionality it has is to visually show you
  if any filters have been configured on your interface(s). Regardless, the
  filter driver is always enabled. In order to disable filtering on an
  interface, you must use the per interface option in the Interface IP Config
  dialog.

- Even though the "Filtertype= Dial" option has been properly configured for a
  demand dial interface, it might still be possible for that interface to dial.
  This only occurs if you are pinging from the command line of the Routing and
  RAS server in which the demand dial interface is configured.

Fixes and Features Included from Hotfix Update 1.0:

New Features Added in Hotfix 1.0:

- Allowing PPP clients to connect without authentication.

  This can be accomplished by altering the default registry key as shown:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman
     \PPP\ForceEncryptedPassword

  (DWORD) 3 allows the server to accept incoming PPP clients without
  authentication.

- Using MS-CHAP with RADIUS authentication.

  In order to enable MS-CHAP with RADIUS authentication, you must add a registry
  value

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman
     \PPP\CHAP\OfferMSCHAP

  and set it to (DWORD) 1.

  Once this is enabled every incoming PPP connection will be offered MS- CHAP,
  and MS-CHAP will be used to authenticate each PPP user against the RADIUS
  server that your RAS server is using.
