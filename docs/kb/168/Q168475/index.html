SUMMARY
=======

This article details how to create a "base" or Default User profile for all
users and how to place it on the Netlogon share. It is important to note that
this will only work for users that have a new user ID in a Windows NT 4.0 domain
and have not logged on with it before.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 follows the following discovery process for creating a new
profile:

- Is there a central (roaming) profile defined in User Manager for Domains?

- If yes, does the profile exist? If yes, use profile.

- If no, does this user have a local profile? If yes, use local.

- If no, does Default User exist on Netlogon share of validating Domain
  Controller? If yes, use it.

- If no, does Default User exist in WinNT\Profiles?

Follow these steps to create a Default User:

1. Log on to a workstation as a generic user (one that does not have
  Administrator rights in the domain). Set up your desktop and change the
  settings that you want to change. Log off the workstation. The profile is
  actually created at this point.

2. Log back onto the workstation as someone who has Administrator rights to the
  local computer, as well as in the domain. In the System tool in Control
  Panel, click the User Profiles tab. Select the user's profile that you
  created in the previous step.

3. Click Copy To, which will bring up a dialog box that allows you to specify
  where the profile is going to be copied, as well as being able to specify who
  is Permitted to Use this profile. To create the Default User Profile (base
  profile) you should permit the group Everyone to be able to use the profile.
  Next, in the blank box where it states Copy To:, specify the server name and
  the share name, as well as the name of the profile that you want to copy this
  profile to.

  It should be in this format:

  \\Servername\Sharename\Profilename.

  NOTE: The name of the profile will actually be a directory name and the entire
  directory and its subdirectories and files are the entire profile.

4. Copy this profile to the Netlogon share and rename the profile to Default
  User. This will enable Windows NT to create a new profile based on this
  profile for a user who does not already have a central or local profile.

  NOTE: This Default User profile will be used to create new Roaming Profiles as
  well as new local profiles.
