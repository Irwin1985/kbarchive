The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
- Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The automated procedure for creating an installation package with the Systems
Management Server Installer is called "repackaging." The repackaging feature of
the Systems Management Server Installer allows the administrator to install a
standard application on a reference computer, and have the installation
duplicated on desktops throughout the organization.

Repackaging begins by clicking Repackage to access the Repackage Installation
dialog box. In this dialog box, the path to the application's Setup program is
specified, along with any required command-line options.

Scan the Directories and Registry
---------------------------------

The Systems Management Server Installer monitors drives and directories during
the repackage process. By default, the Systems Management Server Installer
automatically designates to scan the Windows NT drive and all its
subdirectories, but it is possible to remove directories from the scan. For
example, if the computer has multiple hard-disk partitions, but the application
only installs files on one partition, configure the Systems Management Server
Installer to scan only the one drive. This is done by clicking Change in the
Repackage Installation dialog box. From the Repackage Installation dialog box,
drives and directories can be configured in the top portion of the Advanced
Settings dialog box.

During the installation of the application, which is completed during the
repackage procedure, it is possible for some temporary files, such as .log or
.tmp files, to be modified. The temporary files may not be necessary for the
installation to be successful, but rather a residual effect of the installation.
The Systems Management Server Installer can be configured to ignore the files
during the scanning process. Configuration of files to be ignored is
accomplished by clicking Change in the Repackage Installation dialog box. From
the Repackage Installation dialog box, files that should be ignored can be
configured in the bottom portion of the Advanced Settings dialog box.

The repackage process will also capture all changes made to the registry. Special
attention should be given to registry values that may change (for example, a
DHCP release and renew with a new address), and are not part of the
installation. Configure registry values to be ignored by clicking the Change
button in the Repackage Installation dialog box.

Run Installation
----------------

After the scanning of directories and the registry is complete, the Setup program
runs. The application should be installed and configured as required for the
end-user computer.

Scan the Directories and Registry Again
---------------------------------------

After the installation and configuration of the application, The Systems
Management Server Installer performs another scan of the configured drives and
directories, as well as the registry. An installation script is then produced
that references all the files copied, icons created, program groups or Start
menu items created, and registry entries modified.

The Systems Management Server Installer automatically scans the Windows NT drive
and all its subdirectories. These directories are displayed on the Repackage
Installation dialog box, so you only have to change it if it is not correct. If
you want to change it, click Change.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are some things to consider when repackaging an application:

Reference Computer
------------------

To ensure that a repackaged application will install correctly, your reference
(or test) computer should be as clean as possible. Many applications share
files, and if the original setup program detects these files, it may not
reinstall them. For example, if you want to repackage Microsoft Word and you use
a reference computer with Microsoft Excel on it for your repackage, some of the
shared DLL files and files in the Msapps directory may not be installed in the
repackage operation. Consequently, if Excel is not already installed on your
target computers, your repackaged Word will not install completely, and may fail
to run correctly.

Data Conversion
---------------

If the original setup program does any kind of upgrade or modification of data
files (such as user database files), the Repackager will fail to capture the
conversion. Consequently, the Systems Management Server Installer application
will not install correctly on the target computer. In cases where data
conversion occurs as part of the original setup, do not use the Repackager
feature.

Hardware Scans
--------------

If the original setup program does any kind of hardware detection, a repackaged
Systems Management Server Installer application may fail.

Shared Network Files
--------------------

If the original setup program makes any modifications to shared or network files,
special consideration should be given to the Repackager setup. If the Repackager
makes modifications to shared files, the installation will probably fail. If the
Repackager references network files, the installation may fail. Extra testing
should be performed to ensure that the repackage will run on all clients and
under all logon names.
