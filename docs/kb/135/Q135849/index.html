Page 111: Technical Issues for Microsoft Protected-Mode Clients

Online Help: Planning for Shared Installations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fourth bulleted item of this topic states: "For protected-mode network
clients, you cannot use a PCI network adapter or ISA adapters on a PCI computer
for system startup over the network. This is because PCI adapters do not start
until the second booting of Windows 95. For shared installations, the adapter
must start on the first boot."

This item should state: "For protected-mode network clients, you cannot use a
PCI, EISA, or ISA Plug and Play network adapter for system startup over the
network. This is because these adapters do not start until the second booting of
Windows 95. For shared installations, the adapter must start on the first
boot."

Page 140: System Startup and Networking for Shared Installations

Online Help: System Startup and Networking for Shared Installations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 140 gives the following command:

  net logon generic_name password /y

This command only works for the Client for Microsoft Networks when connecting to
SBS shares on an SMB server.

Page 145: Custom Installations of Windows 95: The Issues

Online Help: Customizing Windows 95 with WRKGRP.INI Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This topic states that the Wrkgrp.ini file should be located in the shared folder
that contains the Windows 95 source files. This information is incorrect. The
Wrkgrp.ini file should be located in the System folder in the shared folder that
contains the Windows 95 source files.

Page 197: Initializing Static VxDs at Startup

Online Help: Initializing Static VxDs at Startup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last sentence of the first paragraph reads: "Notice, however, that if a VxD
file is in the Windows System\Vmm32 directory, Windows 95 loads it in addition
to the combined VxDs in Mrci2.vxd."

This sentence should read: "Notice, however, that if a VxD file is in the Windows
System\Vmm32 directory, Windows 95 loads it in addition to the combined VxDs in
Vmm32.vxd."

Page 202: Config.sys Settings Incorporated in Windows 95 Io.sys

Online Help: Io.sys: The Real-Mode Operating System
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Config.sys Settings Incorporated in Windows 95 Io.sys" topic states that the
default value for the "files=" setting is 60. This default is actually 30.

Page 204: MSDOS.SYS Values

Online Help: MSDOS.SYS: Special Startup Values
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the [Options] section, the entry that reads

  BootFailSafe=

should read:

  BootSafe=

Note: BootSafe=1 will boot your computer into safe mode.

Page 214: Changes to SYSTEM.INI

Online Help: Changes to SYSTEM.INI
------------------------------------------------------------------

In the "Entries Added to the [Boot] Section of SYSTEM.INI" section, the entry
that reads

  sound.drv=sound.drv

should read:

  sound.drv=mmsound.drv

Page 221: Installing Windows 95 for Dual Booting with Windows 3.x

Online Help: Installing Windows 95 for Dual Booting with Windows 3.x
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The note at the bottom of the page states:

NOTE: If you are using disk compression software, you need to copy IO.DOS,
MSDOS.DOS, COMMAND.DOS, CONFIG.DOS, and AUTOEXEC.BAT to your host drive also.

The reference to AUTOEXEC.BAT is incorrect. The note should read:

NOTE: If you are using disk compression software, you need to copy IO.DOS,
MSDOS.DOS, COMMAND.DOS, CONFIG.DOS, and AUTOEXEC.DOS to your host drive also.

Page 226: Installing Windows 95 over DR DOS

Online Help: Installing Windows 95 over DR DOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first bulleted item in this topic states: "Some DR DOS utilities can cause
compatibility problems with the Windows 95 real-mode kernel; Windows 95 Setup
uses rem to comment out any command lines in the configuration files that start
such utilities."

This item should state: "Some DR DOS utilities can cause compatibility problems
with the Windows 95 real-mode kernel; Windows 95 Setup removes or uses rem to
comment out any command lines in the configuration files that start such
utilities."

Page 292: Supporting Pass-Through Security for Peer Resource Sharing

Online Help: Supporting Pass-Through Security for Peer Resource Sharing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section states:

  If computers running Windows 95 will be providing File and Printer
  Sharing Services for NetWare Networks, then the NetWare server
  providing access validation must be configured with a special
  WINDOWS_PASSTHRU account. This special account is used to support
  pass-through validation for user-level security.

This statement is incorrect. A WINDOWS_PASSTHRU account is not needed as long as
the person logging on to the server has an account.

Page 303: Additional Settings for Client for NetWare Networks

Online Help: Additional Settings for Client for NetWare Networks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The "Setting maximum IPX packet size for the LIP protocol" section states, in
  part:

     ...add a registry value named MaxLIP and specify a binary or
     DWORD value that is the greatest value allowed on any one network
     segment.

  Note that the value should actually be a binary value entered in hexadecimal
  in reverse order. For example, if you want to specify a maximum packet size
  of 1024, enter 00 04 in the binary registry key. (1024 is 0400 in
  hexadecimal.)

- The "Turning off support for packet-burst protocol" section states:

  If you want to turn off support for the packet-burst protocol (which is
  enabled by default for File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks), set
  SupportBurst=0 in the following Registry key:

        Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Nwserver

  The registry key is actually:

     Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Nwredir

Page 340: Artisoft LANtastic, Configuration File Entries
--------------------------------------------------------

The Configuration File Entries show the System.ini file requiring the following
entry:

  [LANTASTIC]
  network_irq=15

This network_irq=15 entry is not required and Setup will remove it.

Page 354: Configuring Microsoft DLC with ODI Drivers
----------------------------------------------------

The third entry in the Autoexec.bat is listed as Odinhlp.exe.

The correct component name is Odihlp.exe.

Page 375: Using Login Scripts with Microsoft Networking
-------------------------------------------------------

Page 375 includes a table named Special Login Script Parameters. Windows NT login
variables, including those in this table, do not work in Windows 95. The table
contains the following parameters:

  %OS%
  %PROCESSOR%
  %USERDOMAIN%
  %USERNAME%

NOTE: The Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit Help file does not include this
table.

Page 392: To View Volumes on a Server

Online Help: Using Commands to Connect to NetWare Servers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last paragraph of the "To view volumes on a server" bulleted item states:
"Use the /network parameter to specify the volumes on the particular network you
want to view" and gives the following example:

  net view \\nwserver_name /network:nw

The /network parameter is not a valid option for the NET VIEW command.

Page 431: IPX/SPX Technical Notes on NetWare Networks

Online Help: IPX/SPX Technical Notes on NetWare Networks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second bulleted item of this section states:

SPX-II is a protocol definition for windowing and transmitting large packets over
SPX. You can run any SPX-II application under Windows 95 using the
IPX/SPX-compatible protocol. The related Novell-supplied file TLI.DLL must be
available on the computer to support SPX-II.

This item should read:

SPX-II is a protocol definition for windowing and transmitting large packets over
SPX. The IPX/SPX-compatible protocol included with Windows 95 (Nwlink.vxd) does
not support SPX-II. There are third-party dynamic link libraries (DLLs)
available that provide SPX-II support when you are using Nwlink.vxd. However, if
you are using a third-party DLL intended to provide SPX-II support and a program
communicates directly with Nwlink.vxd, SPX-II support is not available to that
program.

Page 457: Sources for Windows 95 System Management Tools

Online Help: Sources for Windows 95 System Management Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This topic states:

  When you install Windows 95 from the installation floppy disks, System
  Policy Editor is installed automatically with the operational system
  files. This tool can be used to modify INI files, CONFIG.SYS, and
  AUTOEXEC.BAT.

This statement is incorrect. The tool that is installed automatically is System
Configuration Editor, not System Policy Editor. You can use System Configuration
Editor to modify INI files and the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files.

System Policy Editor is included with the CD-ROM version of Windows 95 and is not
installed automatically.

Page 465: To Set Up User-Level Security on a Computer on a Microsoft
Network

Online Help: To Set Up User-Level Security on a Computer on a
Microsoft Network
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 states: "Type the name of the Windows NT domain or Windows NT workstation
where the user accounts reside, and then click OK."

This step is incorrect. You can type the name of a Windows NT domain or a Windows
NT server, but not a Windows NT workstation.

Page 488: Maintaining Roving User Profiles on Other Networks

Online Help: Maintaining Roving User Profiles on Other Networks
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Profiles] section states the following:

  [Profiles]
  Mary=\\bigserver\homedirs\mary
  John=\\bigserver\homedirs\john
  Pat=\\bigserver\homedirs\pat

This section should read:

  [Profiles]
  Mary=\\bigserver\homedirs\mary\user.dat
  John=\\bigserver\homedirs\john\user.dat
  Pat=\\bigserver\homedirs\pat\user.dat

The Resource Kit does not include these instructions:

- Before following the instructions for setting up a Windows 95 network client
  to maintain roaming user profiles on other networks, you first need to ensure
  that user profiles have been disabled. To do this, click Start, point to
  Settings, click Control Panel, double-click Passwords, click the User
  Profiles tab, click "All users of this PC use the same preferences and
  desktop settings," and then click OK.

- You must also add a DWORD value named "UseHomeDirectory" (without the
  quotation marks) to the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Network\Logon

  Set the data value for UseHomeDirectory to 0x00000000

- You must also add a STRING value named "SharedProfileList" (without the
  quotation marks) to the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Network\Logon

  Set the string value to \\server\share\profiles.ini

- After following the instructions for setting up a Windows 95 network client
  to maintain roaming user profiles on other networks, the last step is to
  enable user profiles. To do this, click Start, point to Settings, click
  Control Panel, double-click Passwords, click the User Profiles tab, click
  "Users can customize their preferences and desktop settings," and then click
  OK.

Page 570: Using File-System Troubleshooting Options

Online Help: Using File-System Troubleshooting Options
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first sentence of the "Disable All 32-bit Protected-Mode Disk Drivers"
section states: "This option ensures that no 32-bit disk drivers are loaded in
the system, except the floppy driver."

This section should read: "This option disables the 32-bit protected-mode floppy
disk driver (Hsflop.pdr), and floppy disk I/O is performed as in previous
versions of Windows."

Page 627: Mouse and Pointing Device Driver Overview

Online Help: Mouse and Pointing Device Driver Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This topic states:

  In addition to better mouse services, Windows 95 allows the use of
  serial ports COM1 through COM4 for connecting a mouse or other
  pointing device.

This topic should state:

  Windows 95 allows the use of serial ports COM1 and COM2 for connecting
  a mouse or other pointing device.

Page 687: To Preserve Long Filenames with Disk Utilities that do not
  Recognize Them

Online Help: To Preserve Long Filenames with Disk Utilities that do not
  Recognize Them
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps 5 and 6 for the "To preserve long filenames with disk utilities that do not
recognize them" state:

1. Turn tunneling on again, and then restart the computer.

2. At the command prompt, type lfnbk /r [drive] to restore long filenames.

These steps should be:

1. At the command prompt, type lfnbk /r [drive] to restore long filenames.

2. Turn tunneling on again, and then restart the computer.

Page 688: Technical Notes on Long Filenames

Online Help: Technical Notes on Long Filenames
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The "Long filenames cannot be used on SUBST drives" item is incorrect. Long
  file names can be used on SUBST drives.

- The "To use friendly alias names instead of numeric tails" item is incorrect.
  Windows 95 does not support the NameNumericTail setting. This setting causes
  problems for any programs (including Windows 95 Setup, Microsoft Plus! for
  Windows 95 Setup, and the Add/Remove Programs tool) that use the Program
  Files folder.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q148594 "NameNumericTail=0" Value Causes Problems for Some Programs

Page 689: Turning Off the Extended File System Features

Online Help: Technical Notes on Long Filenames
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Turning off the extended file system features" and "To enable the Windows
3.1 file system" sections are invalid because Windows 95 does not support this.
For example, if you edited the registry to include the Win31FileSystem key,
Windows 95 would ignored it.


Page 719: Creating an Apps.ini File

Online Help: Creating an Apps.ini File
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Creating An Apps.ini File section has two errors:

- The To Create An Apps.ini File topic does not include a step to add the
  [AppInstallList] section. These are the correct steps:

  1. Use a text editor to create a file that contains a list of applications
     using the following format:

        [AppInstallList]
        &lt;application name&gt; = [*] &lt;UNC path&gt;
        For &lt;application name&gt;, substitute the name that you want users
        to see on the Network Install tab. For &lt;UNC path&gt;, substitute the
        network location of the Setup application. If a Setup application
        cannot work with UNC names, include an asterisk before it. For
        example:

           word for windows=*\\applications\forusers\word60\setup.exe

  2. Save the Apps.ini file on a server to which users have read-only access.

- The "To display the applications listed in Apps.ini on the Network Install
  tab" topic incorrectly lists the registry key as:

     Hkey_Local_Machine/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Current Version

  You should actually add a string value named "appinstallpath" (without the
  quotation marks) to the following registry key:

     Hkey_Local_Machine/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/Current Version

  The data for the "appinstallpath" value should be the UNC path to the Apps.ini
  file, including the file name. For example:

     \\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;\&lt;installpath&gt;\apps.ini

Page 755: Limit on Number of Installed TrueType Fonts
-----------------------------------------------------

Page 755 states:

  Greater font flexibility. Because the fonts are stored in the
  registry, you can install an unlimited number of TrueType fonts.
  In addition, you can print almost 1000 fonts in any document.

This statement is not entirely true. Windows 95 does limit the number of fonts to
approximately 1000 for various reasons not related to registry size limits. The
exact number may vary depending on your configuration.

Page 766: Using DEC PrintServer Software for Windows 95

Online Help: Using DEC PrintServer Software for Windows 95
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The steps "To install PrintServer Software for Windows 95" state the following:

1. In the Network option in Control Panel, click Add.

2. In the Select Network Component Type dialog box, double-click Service.

3. In the Select Network Service dialog box, click DEC, and in the Network
  Services list, click DEC Print Server. Click OK.

These steps should state:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click Add Printer and follow the onscreen instructions.

3. In the list of Manufacturers, click Digital, and then click the appropriate
  DEC PrintServer in the list of Printers.

Page 777: Loading Fonts in Windows 95

Online Help: Loading Fonts in Windows 95
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Notes in the Loading Fonts In Windows 95 section states: "Because fonts are
stored in the Registry, there is no limit to the number of TrueType fonts that
can be installed. In addition, almost 1000 fonts can be used simultaneously, and
the same number can be printed in the same document."

This section should read: "Approximately 1000 TrueType fonts can be installed in
Windows 95. In addition, almost all of the installed fonts can be used
simultaneously, and the same number can be printed in the same document. The
1000-font maximum occurs because of the size of Registry keys and available
storage space for font names in GDI."

Page 782: Graphic images don't print correctly or output is garbled
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The first entry states: "Start the computer in Safe Mode, and then retry
printing."

This entry should be omitted. You can't print in Safe Mode (except to a file).

Page 783: Printing is slower than normal
----------------------------------------

The first entry states: "Start the computer in Safe Mode, and then retry
printing."

This entry should be omitted. You cannot print in Safe Mode (except to a file).

Page 784: To troubleshoot a computer that stalls while printing to a
         local printer and network printer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first entry states: "Start the computer in Safe Mode, and then retry
printing."

This entry should be omitted. You cannot print in Safe Mode (except to a file).

Page 847: To Choose Which Profile to Use at Startup
---------------------------------------------------

The "To choose which profile to use at startup" section includes 5 steps. This
topic should end after the note in step 3 on page 848. After this note, the
following information should appear on page 848:

Setting up a Microsoft Mail workgroup postoffice consists of the following
tasks:

- Deciding the location for the postoffice

- Deciding who will administer the postoffice

- Adding users and user information, such as office locations and passwords

- Sharing the postoffice with all users in the workgroup

To Set Up a Microsoft Mail Workgroup Postoffice:

1. In Control Panel, click the Microsoft Mail Postoffice icon.

2. In the Microsoft Workgroup Postoffice Admin dialog box, click Create A New
  Workgroup Postoffice, and then click Next.

&lt;The "Microsoft Workgroup Postoffice Admin" screen on page 848 appears
here&gt;

Step 4 on page 848 should be step 3.

Step 5 on page 848 should be step 4.

The rest of pages 848 and 849 is correct.

NOTE: The Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit Help file contains the correct
information for this topic.

Page 896: To Install SLIP

Online Help: Configuring a Windows 95 Dial-Up Client
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 of the "To Install SLIP" bulleted item states: "In the Install From Disk
dialog box, click the Browse button, and then type the path name to ADM
N\APPTOOLS\SLIP\RNAPLUS.INF."

Step 2 should read: "In the Install From Disk dialog box, click the Browse
button, and then type the path name to ADMIN\APPTOOLS\DSCRIPT\RNAPLUS.INF."

Page 899: Configuring a Windows 95 Dial-Up Server
-------------------------------------------------

This topic states: "Windows 95 must have special registry settings to act as an
IP router."

This information is incorrect. Microsoft does not support making changes to the
registry to enable Windows 95 to become an IP router. Microsoft Windows NT
Server version 3.5 can act as an IP router, but Microsoft Windows 95 cannot.
Windows 95 provides all the protocols you need to connect to the Internet, but
cannot act as an IP router.


Page 1019: Getting Started with Registry Editor

Online Help: Getting Started with Registry Editor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 1111: Incorrect Directory and Command List
-----------------------------------------------

Under the heading "Commands Not Included in Windows 95," there is a list of
commands located in the Other\Olddos folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

This folder name is incorrect; it should be Other\Oldmsdos. Also, some of the
commands are not present in this folder.

BACKUP was a file backup utility included with MS-DOS versions 2.0 through 5.0.
It was replaced by MSBACKUP in version 6.0. MSBACKUP is in the Other\Oldmsdos
folder, but BACKUP is not.

EDLIN was a line-oriented text editor included with MS-DOS versions 2.0 through
5.0. It was replaced by EDIT in MS-DOS version 5.0 and did not appear at all in
MS-DOS 6.0 or later. EDIT is also a Windows 95 command and is explained on page
1103 of the Windows 95 Resource Kit.

information.
