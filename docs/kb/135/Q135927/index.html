-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can specify how the Mail Gateway to MHS will function by using the
command-line options available with the gateway. These options are used in the
COMMAND option of the gateway definition on the MHS system.

You can find information on adding gateway definitions to the MHS system in the
Novell's MHS "Administrator's Guide."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The available MHS Gateway commands are as follows:


The available MHS Gateway commands are as follows:

Option         Definition
----------------------------------------------------------------------

-Dm            Drive option specifies the driver letter containing the
              Microsoft Mail data files. Drive letter M is the default
              drive, but in a case that Maildata is mapped to a different
              drive letter, that letter would need to be specified. For
              example, if Maildata was mapped to drive P, use -Dp.

-F             Dashed Address Format option is used with an MHS 1.11 host
              only. When this option is used, the MSMAIL address in the
              FROM field of an outgoing message is converted to the dashed
              address format. This is ignored if the gateway is on an MHS
              host 1.21 or later. Also when you use this option all
              components of the 10/10/10 address must be Name-8 strings.
              If not, the gateway will use full extended addressing.

-FS            Simple Address Format option specifies that the gateway
              should use the simple address format MAILBOX@GATEWAY when
              converting MSMAIL addresses to the MHS addresses. To use
              this option, the MAILBOX portion of the MSMAIL address must
              be in Name-8 string; otherwise the extended address format
              is used. Also the simple address format is only supported
              for users on a gateway postoffice. This option is ignore if
              the sender is on a downstream postoffice and the uses the
              default extended address format.

-H             Show All Headers option is used to force the display of all
              MHS headers in incoming mail. This option is normally only
              used in testing the gateway operation.

-HA            Expose Hidden Attachments option is used to expose the
              hidden attachments generated the MSMAIL system. These
              attachments contain information about OLE objects.

-In            Items option specifies the maximum number of mail messages
              to process each time the program is invoked by the MHS
              system. The default is I5 (5 messages). The maximum
              allowable setting is I50 (50 messages); anything greater
              is ignored.

-L[filename]   Log Error Messages option specifies the name of the file to
              which error messages will be logged. Type the full path,
              including the driver, directory, filename, and extension. If
              you do not specify a parameter or if you enter only -L,
              error messages are logged to the M:\LOG\MHSGATE.LOG (unless
              you specify another driver the -D option)

-Mn            Maximum Text Size option sets the maximum size of the
              messages text allowed by the gateway, where n is the maximum
              size in kilobytes. When a messages exceeds this size, the
              gateway converts the message text to an attachments. If you
              are using message encapsulation to send backboned mail (the
              default) and the message text exceeds the limit, the
              messages is not encapsulated.

-RE            Remove Encapsulation option is used to disable message
              encapsulation for outgoing mail. By default, all backboned
              mail (mail destined for postoffices defined as indirect via
              MHS and for which address mapping has been defined) is sent
              in encapsulated form to preserve all attributes of the
              MSMAIL message sent via MHS.

-Sn            Split Lines option allows you to specify where to split
              long message lines by entering the number of characters per
              line. MSMAIL can generate messages with lines up to 78
              characters. Some MHS user agents can handle lines up to 74
              characters. For outgoing mail (INPOST program), the default
              is to not split lines at all. For incoming mail (OUTPOST
              program), the default is to split lines at 78 characters.

-T             Use Mail Item Time option is recognized only by the OUTPOST
              program. For mail sent to MSMAIL from MHS, you can specify
              that you want to use the date, and time of the mail item
              getting received by the MSMAIL instead of the system date
              and time.

-V20           Backwards Compatibility option must be used if the Gateway
              to MHS is installed on a postoffice that uses version 2.1 or
              later of the External Mail program, but is also accessed by
              a version 2.0 External program or by any version 2.;0 MSMAIL
              gateway program. If you do not require compatibility with
              version 2.0 programs, do not use this option.

For additional information, see pages 19-21 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS
"Administrator's Guide."
