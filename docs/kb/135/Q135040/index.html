Last Modified: 24-MAR-2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Visual FoxPro packs a table to remove deleted records, any non-structural
index open at the time is closed. However, when a program subsequently uses the
table that depends on its indexed order, the program will not perform as
expected and may give unexpected error messages.

When Visual FoxPro packs a table to remove deleted records, any regular
structural compound index (one with the same name as the table and with a .cdx
extension) open at the time is not closed.

This is different from the behavior of previous versions of FoxPro.

WORKAROUND
==========

Explicitly re-open the index file and use the REINDEX command before proceeding
with the program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. The problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Type the following commands into a Visual FoxPro program, and then run it.

     ***  Program to demonstrate the effect of PACK
     ***  on open index files in Visual FoxPro
     ***  Test program named Testpack.prg

     CLEAR
     SET SAFETY OFF
     CLEAR ALL
     CLOSE ALL

     ********Creation of testfile
     DECLARE new_dbf[1,4]
     new_dbf[1,1] = "Pagenum"
     new_dbf[1,2] = "N"
     new_dbf[1,3] = 4
     new_dbf[1,4] = 0

     SELECT 0
     CREATE TABLE temptabl FROM ARRAY new_dbf   &amp;&amp; It's in USE
     INDEX ON Deleted() TAG Deleted             &amp;&amp; .CDX is also in USE
     INDEX ON Pagenum TAG Pagenum
     SET ORDER TO
     COPY TO Temptbl2 WITH PRODUCTION           &amp;&amp; On the disk so
     RENAME Temptbl2.dbf TO testfile.dbf        &amp;&amp; Can rename.
     RENAME Temptbl2.cdx TO testfile.pax        &amp;&amp; Now not structural.
     *  Index file has multiple tags. It is a non-structural compound
     *  index file. A single index file with the extension of .idx
     *  will also demonstrate the issue.

     USE testfile INDEX testfile.pax ALIAS testfile EXCLUSIVE
     SET ORDER TO

     **** Add some records then delete some
     SELECT testfile
     FOR q = -10 to 50                          &amp;&amp; 60 records
       APPEND BLANK
       REPLACE Pagenum WITH q
       IF q/3 == INT(q/3)                       &amp;&amp; Every third record
         DELETE
       ENDIF
     ENDFOR

     CLEAR
     WAIT WINDOW "About to display status." ;

     DISPLAY STATUS
     WAIT

       + chr(13) + ;
       "read it first - you're trying to use a closed index."
     SET ORDER TO 1
     BROWSE NOWAIT

     WAIT WINDOW "Every 3rd record was deleted. Packing removed them." ;
      + chr(13) + ;
      "But, as you have seen, the index file was closed." ;
      + chr(13) + ;
      "See if the index still exists. Watch the status bar."
     ERASE testfile.pax
     WAIT WINDOW "The message - File has been deleted - says" ;
       + chr(13) + ;
       "The index file was closed and could be deleted."
     CLOSE ALL

     ERASE temptabl.dbf  &amp;&amp; Clean up afterwards.
     ERASE temptabl.cdx
     ERASE temptbl2.dbf
     ERASE temptbl2.cdx
     ERASE testfile.dbf
     ERASE testfile.pax

     CLEAR
     RETURN
     ***** End of test program.
