-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form is changed from modeless to modal during run time, the form cannot
be closed (terminated).

NOTE: In Visual FoxPro 6.0, the Close icon of the control box in the upper right
corner of the form allows the form to close.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the form needs to be Modal, set the WindowType to Modal at design time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a form is changed to Modal at run time, it does not release when a Release
ThisForm or ThisForm.Release is issued. The only way to close the form is to
cancel the program.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Example One:

1. Create a form with the following command buttons:

  a. Command1 with Modal as the caption and the following code for Visual
     FoxPro 5.0:

        ThisForm.Visible=.F.
        ThisForm.Show(1)
        ThisForm.Visible=.T.

  b. Command2 with Release as the caption and ThisForm.Release in the Click
     event procedure.

     NOTE: Ensure that the form's WindowType property is set to 0-Modeless.

2. Run the form, and verify that the form is Modeless and that the Release
  button closes the form.

3. Run the form, and click the Modal button. Verify that the form is modal.
  Click the Release button. The form will not close.

4. Edit the form, and change the WindowType property to 1-Modal.

5. Run the form, verify that the form is modal. Then click the Release button.
  The form should close.

Example Two: Setting the modal property programatically before the program
executes causes the form to behave a little differently. Run the following
program with the form's WindowType property set to 1. Click the Release button
and verify that although the form is no longer visible, it has not closed.
However, defining the form as modeless and then changing it to modal by pressing
the Modal command button causes the form to remain on the screen.

       Caption    = "Modal Form Test"
       WindowType = 1 &amp;&amp; Change WindowType to 0 to start the form as Modeless

       ADD OBJECT Command1 AS CommandButton WITH ;
            Top     = 145, ;
            Left    = 31, ;
