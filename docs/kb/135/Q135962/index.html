The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When System Agent runs one of the disk tools (Compression Agent, Disk
Defragmenter, or ScanDisk), the tool may pause for user input. Typically, the
tool is prompting for the drive on which it should run, or is waiting for you to
click the Start button.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the System Agent-aware registry settings for the disk
tool are missing or damaged. If the disk tool does not have valid registry
settings, System Agent does not start the disk tool in unattended operation
mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use Registry Editor to verify that the correct registry settings exist for the
disk tool. The System Agent-aware registry settings are located in the following
registry branch:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Plus!\System Agent\SAGE

Each disk tool has a key beneath this branch. The keys for the disk tools are:

- Compression Agent

- Disk Defragmenter

- Low disk space notification

- ScanDisk for Windows

The following tables list the default values under these keys. These settings are
required to make the tools function in unattended operation mode.

Compression Agent
-----------------

  Type            Name             Data
  --------------------------------------------------
  String Value    Friendly Name    Compression Agent
  String Value    Program          CMPAGENT.EXE
  Binary Value    Settings         01

Disk Defragmenter
-----------------

  Type            Name             Data
  --------------------------------------------------
  String Value    Friendly Name    Disk Defragmenter
  String Value    Program          DEFRAG.EXE
  Binary Value    Settings         01

Low Disk Space Notification
---------------------------

  Type            Name             Data
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  String Value    Friendly Name    Low disk space notification
  String Value    Program          DISKALM.EXE
  Binary Value    Settings         01

ScanDisk for Windows
--------------------

  Type            Name             Data
  -----------------------------------------------------
  String Value    Friendly Name    ScanDisk for Windows
  String Value    Program          SCANDSKW.EXE
  Binary Value    Settings         01

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: You can also restore these settings by reinstalling System Agent. For
information about reinstalling System Agent without losing your current System
Agent settings, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q133191 Reinstalling System Agent Without Losing Scheduled Tasks


MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to the settings listed above, each key contains a Result Codes
subkey. The Result Codes subkey is not required to make a tool System Agent-
aware, but without these settings the Last Result column in System Agent and the
System Agent log file contains only code numbers. The following tables list the
result code settings for each disk tool. All of these settings are String
Values.
