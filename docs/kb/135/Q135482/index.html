HOW TO READ README FILES
========================

When you install Windows 95, all the readme files are copied to the
\Windows directory.

To open a readme file after you install Windows 95:
1. Click the Start menu.
2. Click Run.
3. Type the name of the readme file.

Even if you haven't installed Windows 95 yet, you can still open a
readme file.

To open a readme file before you install Windows 95:

If you purchased Windows 95 on floppy disks:
--------------------------------------------
1. Insert Disk 1 into drive A (or whatever drive you prefer).
2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following:

  a:extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab filename.txt

For example, if you want to open General.txt, you would type:

  a:extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab general.txt

3. Change to the \Windows directory.
4. At the command prompt, type the following:

  edit filename.txt

If you purchased Windows 95 on a CD-ROM:
----------------------------------------
1. Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive (drive x in this example).
2. Change to the \Win95 directory on your CD-ROM drive.
2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following:

  extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab filename.txt

For example, if you want to open General.txt, you would type:

  extract.exe /a /l c:\windows win95_02.cab general.txt

3. Change to the Windows directory on your C drive.
4. At the command prompt, type the following:

  edit filename.txt

UNINSTALLING WINDOWS 95
=======================

During Setup, you have the option of saving your system files so
that you can uninstall Windows 95 later. If you want to be able to
uninstall Windows 95 later, choose Yes. Setup will save your system
files in a hidden, compressed file. If you don't need to be able to
uninstall Windows 95 later, choose No.

You will not see this Setup option if:
- You are upgrading over an earlier version of Windows 95.
- You are installing to a new directory.
- You are running a version of MS-DOS earlier than 5.0.

NOTE:The uninstall files must be saved on a local hard drive. You
can't save them to a network drive or a floppy disk. If you have
multiple local drives, you will be able to select the one you want
to save the uninstall information on.

To uninstall Windows 95 and completely restore your computer to its
previous versions of MS-DOS and Windows 3.x, carry out the following
procedure:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
  Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95, and then click
  Remove.

Or, if you are having problems starting Windows 95, use your startup
disk to start your computer, and then run UNINSTAL from the startup
disk.

NOTE: The uninstall program needs to shut down Windows 95. If there is
a problem with this on your computer, restart your computer and press
F8 when you see the message "Starting Windows 95." Then choose Command
Prompt Only, and run UNINSTAL from the command prompt.

If Windows 95 is running and you want to remove the uninstall files to
free up 6 to 9 MB of disk space, carry out the following procedure:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
  Control Panel.
2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Old Windows 3.x/MS-DOS System
  Files, and then click Remove.

You will no longer be able to uninstall Windows 95.
