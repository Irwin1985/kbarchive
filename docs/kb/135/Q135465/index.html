1. Installing Network Client
----------------------------

If you are installing Microsoft Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS on a
computer that does not have MS-DOS installed, you will get the error "No Drivers
Present On This Disk" if you try to use the Windows Driver Library. You must
have MS-DOS installed on the computer.

If you have a Windows NT Server floppy disk set and you want to make extra copies
of Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS, note that the installation disk for this
client will only fit on a 3.5" floppy disk.

2. Setup PATH Problem With Microsoft Windows
--------------------------------------------

If you have Microsoft Windows installed on your computer before you install
Network Client, the Network Client Setup program may incorrectly alter the PATH
line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The PATH line should include the Windows directory. Check this line after you
install Network Client. If the Windows directory was removed from the PATH, add
it back in.

3. If You Have an 8088 Processor
--------------------------------

You must use the basic redirector if your computer has an 8088 processor. The
full redirector is the default, so you must choose the basic redirector when you
install.

4. Setup Requires 429K Available Memory
---------------------------------------

In order to run Network Client Setup, you must have 429K of available
conventional memory.

5. Setup is Slow on Some Computers
----------------------------------

On some computers, particularly those with 8088 processors, Network Client Setup
may appear to pause for as long as five minutes. Do not restart your computer.

6. Network Client Cannot Be Set Up on DoubleDisk Drive
------------------------------------------------------

You cannot use Network Client on a Vertisoft Systems DoubleDisk drive. You must
set up Network Client on another type of drive.

7.  Windows 3.x Setup Network Choice
------------------------------------

If you have installed Microsoft Network Client 3.0 and then later install Windows
3.x, the Windows Setup program asks you to choose your network type from a list.
"Network Client" does not appear on the list because it is newer than Windows
3.x. Instead, choose "LAN Manager 2.1."

8. If COMMAND.COM is Not in Root Directory
------------------------------------------

Network Client will not start if your COMMAND.COM file is not in the root
directory of your startup drive, unless you have a SHELL command in your
CONFIG.SYS file that specifies the location of COMMAND.COM. For information
about the COMMAND and SHELL commands, see your MS-DOS documentation.

9. Using INTERLNK and INTERSVR
------------------------------

Do not use the MS-DOS INTERLNK or INTERSVR commands with Network Client.

10. Using TSRs with Network Client
----------------------------------

If you start any terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) and you are using
the basic redirector, you might be unable to unload the basic redirector.

11. Named Pipes and Enhanced Mode Windows
-----------------------------------------

Asynchronous named pipes are not supported on Microsoft Network Client when the
client is running under enhanced mode Windows. All other client APIs are
supported, including NetBIOS, TCP/IP, and IPX/SPX.

12. Using Qualitas Maximize or Quarterdeck Optimize
---------------------------------------------------

In some rare situations, Qualitas(R) Maximize and Quarterdeck(R) Optimize may
attempt to load some Network Client commands into the upper memory area. If this
causes problems, use Maximize or Optimize in manual mode and do not use it to
load Network Client commands into the upper memory area. Network Client
automatically loads its commands into the upper memory area, if there is enough
space. For information about using manual mode, see your Maximize or Optimize
documentation.

13. Using QEMM Lastdrive
------------------------

If you add drive letters by using QEMM(R) Lastdrive, and then use Network Client
to connect to one of them, the connection will be successful but no information
about the shared resources on it will be displayed.

14. Making the Pop-up Interface Visible on a Monochrome Monitor
---------------------------------------------------------------

To make the Network Client pop-up interface appear in monochrome mode, type MODE
MONO at the MS-DOS command prompt before you display the pop-up interface, or
include the MODE MONO command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

15. Enabling Validated Logons to Windows NT Server and LAN Manager
   Domains
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must run the Network Client full redirector to have your user name and
password validated by a Microsoft Windows NT Server or LAN Manager server.

16. Network Settings in SYSTEM.INI
----------------------------------

The [Network] section of your SYSTEM.INI file contains the following settings:

 filesharing=    Does not apply to Network Client.

 printsharing=   Does not apply to Network Client.

 autologon=      Determines whether Network Client will automatically
                 prompt you for logon when it starts.

 computername=   The name of your computer.

 lanroot=        The directory in which you installed Network Client.

 username=       The username used by default at logon.

 workgroup=      The workgroup name.  Note that this may be different
                 from the "logondomain" setting.

 reconnect=      Determines whether Network Client restores previous
                 connections when it starts.

 dospophotkey=   Determines the key you press (with CTRL+ALT) to start
                 the pop-up interface. The default is N, meaning that you
                 press CTRL+ALT+N.

 lmlogon=        Determines whether Network Client prompts you for a
                 domain logon when you log on. Set this to 1 if you need
                 to log on to a Windows NT Server or LAN Manager domain.

 logondomain=    The name of the Windows NT Server or LAN Manager
                 domain.

 preferredredir= The redirector that starts by default when you
                 type the NET START command.

 autostart=      If you choose a network adapter during setup, and specify
                 the startup option Run Network Client Logon, autostart
                 determines which redirector you are using. If you select
                 No Network Adapter from the adapter list, or Do Not Run
                 Network Client from the startup options, autostart has
                 no value, but the NET START command still appears in
                 your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

 maxconnections= Does not apply to Network Client.

17. NWLink Supports IPX Only
----------------------------

The NWLink protocol shipped with Microsoft Network Client supports only IPX. SPX
is not supported.

18. Installing the MS-DLC Protocol
----------------------------------

If you install the MS-DLC protocol, you must edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to add
"/dynamic" to the NET INITIALIZE line. The line should be:

  net initialize /dynamic

If one does not already exist, add a NETBIND line after all lines in AUTOEXEC.BAT
that load network drivers. The line should simply be:

  netbind

19. Installing Remote Access Service 1.1a
-----------------------------------------

To use RAS, you must use the Network Client full redirector.

After creating the RAS 1.1a disks, run the Network Client Setup program. Do not
use the setup program provided with RAS 1.1a to configure your network
settings.

1. In the Network Client directory, run SETUP.EXE.

2. Choose Change Network Settings, and then select Add Adapter.

3. Select Microsoft Remote Network Access Driver from the list of adapters, and
  then choose The Listed Options Are Correct.

4. After running Setup, run the RASCOPY.BAT batch file. It will prompt you for
  the Remote Access Service disk 1 and disk 2.

To disable remote access, remove Microsoft Remote Network Access Driver from the
list of adapters. To re-enable it, follow steps 1 through 3.

When the Remote Access files are installed, a RAS directory is created in your
Network Client directory. Use the SETUP.EXE program in this directory only to
configure your modem, not to configure network settings. In particular, do not
select Enable Remote Access or Remove Remote Access when running SETUP.EXE from
the RAS directory.

20. Browsing the Network Requires a Windows for Workgroups or
   Windows NT Computer on the Network
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network Client does not provide a browse master. In order for you to browse the
network, a browse master must be present. Therefore, a computer running Windows
for Workgroups or Windows NT must be on the network and belong to the same
workgroup as the computer running Network Client. See the Windows for Workgroups
3.11 Resource Kit for information on making the Windows for Workgroups machine a
browse master.

Note that this does not prevent you from connecting to a shared resource. You
will just need to know the name of the server and share beforehand in order to
connect to it.

21. IPCONFIG.EXE and Controlling DHCP Leases
--------------------------------------------

The IPCONFIG.EXE utility provides DHCP configuration information. The version of
IPCONFIG.EXE provided with the Microsoft Network Client does not support
command-line switches for controlling DHCP address leases; you must use the DHCP
Administration Utility instead.

Specifically, the Network Client IPCONFIG.EXE utility does not support the
following switches, which are available in the IPCONFIG.EXE utilities for
Windows for Workgroups and for Windows NT:

  IPCONFIG /release
  IPCONFIG /renew
  IPCONFIG /?
  IPCONFIG /all

22. Specifying WINS Servers
---------------------------

If your MS-DOS client uses DHCP (the default setting for MS-DOS TCP/IP), it will
automatically receive the address for the WINS server. If you want to statically
configure your WINS server IP address, you must edit the client's PROTOCOL.INI
file and add the IP address into the [TCPIP] section.

For example, if you have 2 WINS servers available, add them into the [TCPIP]
section as shown in the example below. Note that there are no dots (.) in the IP
addresses.

  [TCPIP]

  WINS_SERVER0 = 11 101 13 53 WINS_SERVER1 = 11 101 12 198

Name queries will be sent to the WINS servers in the order in which they appear
in the .INI file. The IPCONFIG command may show a different order of WINS
servers (or even different WINS servers altogether) -- these are the WINS server
names sent by DHCP, and the PROTOCOL.INI settings override them.

23. Differences in MS-DOS TCP/IP
--------------------------------

There is a difference in functionality available in TCP/IP for Windows for
Workgroups, and Windows NT Workstation and Server, versus MS-DOS TCP/IP.
Specifically, an MS-DOS TCP/IP client does not:

  support DNS resolution using WINS
  support WINS resolution using DNS
  register its name with the WINS database; it does queries only
  act as a WINS proxy node
  have multihomed support
  support IGMP

24. Logging On With TCP/IP Across a Router
------------------------------------------

If the domain controller is across a router from the Network Client computer, you
must add a line to the client's LMHOSTS file for logons to be validated. The
line is of the following form:

  www.xxx.yyy.zzz SRV_NAME #DOM:DOM_NAME

  where

  www.xxx.yyy.zzz is the IP address of the domain controller SRV_NAME is the
  NetBIOS name of the domain controller DOM_NAME is the name of the domain

You must also ensure that the domain controller can contact the client, using one
of the following methods:

  Enter the client's IP address and name in the domain controller's LMHOSTS
  file.

  Register the client with a WINS server that is accessible by the domain
  controller. (Network Client computers do not automatically register with WINS
  servers; they only query the WINS servers.)

  Use the LAN Manager 2.1a (and higher) "TCP/IP Extensions for LAN Manager," a
  hub/node service that runs on LAN Manager servers to integrate domains across
  routers.

25. Overview of Windows Sockets
-------------------------------

Microsoft TCP/IP includes support for Windows Sockets on Microsoft Windows and
Workgroups for Windows workstations. A socket provides an end point to a
connection; two sockets form a complete path. A socket works as a bi-directional
pipe for incoming and outgoing data. The Windows Sockets API is a networking API
tailored for use by programmers using the Microsoft Windows operating system.
Windows Sockets is a public specification based on Berkeley UNIX sockets and
aims to:

- Provide a familiar networking API to programmers using Windows or UNIX.

- Offer binary compatibility between heterogeneous Windows-based TCP/IP stack
  and utilities vendors.

- Support both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

If you are running an application that uses Windows Sockets, be sure to enable
Windows Sockets when you configure Microsoft TCP/IP. If you are unsure whether
any of your applications use Windows Sockets, refer to the documentation
included with that vendor's application.

==========================================================================

26. Setting DNR and Sockets Settings
------------------------------------

If you specify the MS TCP/IP protocol during setup, you will now see an
additional dialog box after you have used the Advanced button in the MS-TCP/IP
Configuration dialog box. This new dialog box, DNR and Sockets Settings, is used
only if your MS TCP/IP network has a domain name service (DNS) server. If your
network has a DNS and you choose to configure the Domain Name Resolver (DNR)
parameters, the DNR module will be loaded with your sockets and Telnet
applications to resolve hostname-to-IP address mappings. This allows you to
specify remote computers by computername without knowing specific IP addresses.
If you use this dialog box, these are the values you will need to supply:

Username
Your username.

Hostname

  The computername your workstation will report when using the remote services.
  The default is your LAN Manager computername.

Primary Nameserver IP Address

  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult first when
  resolving computername-to-IP address mappings.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server address
  automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do specify an address
  here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Secondary Nameserver IP Address

  The IP address of the DNS server you want the DNR to consult when resolving
  computername-to-IP address mappings if the request to the primary nameserver
  fails.

  If you use DHCP, the DHCP server typically provides a DNS server address
  automatically; you can leave this entry blank. If you do specify an address
  here, it overrides the address provided by DHCP.

Domain Name Suffix

  The suffix appended to any computername for DNS processing. Your network
  administrator can tell you what to enter here.

Enable Windows Sockets

  Mark this checkbox if you want Sockets to be invoked from the AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file.

Number of Sockets

  The maximum number of sockets that can be made available to applications at
  any one time. The range is 1 to 22 sockets.

  Note: Some applications may use more than one socket to provide a service.
  Consider this when trying to maximize available memory. The total number of
  sockets and NetBIOS sessions combined must not exceed 22.
