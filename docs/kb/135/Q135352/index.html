  A. All files have been upgraded with version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC
  Networks. A comprehensive list of all files upgraded due to fixes or
  otherwise revised is as follows:

  Client (version 3.5.2000.4086)

  MSMAIL.EXE
  MAPI.DLL
  MSSFS.DLL
  SCHEDMSG.DLL
  Microsoft Mail (Macintosh workstation)

  Server (version 3.5 for .EXE)

  ADMIN.EXE
  EXTERNAL.EXE
  ASYNC.OVL
  X25ATLAN.OVL
  X25EICON.OVL
  IMPORT.EXE
  REBUILD.EXE
  SRVMAIN.EXE

  For more information, see Q132059 "Summary List of Mail for PC Networks 3.5
  Bug Fixes" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

3. Q. Will the MTA and MMTA run under Windows NT?

  A. Version 3.2x of the mail transfer agent (MTA) is designed and tested to run
  on an MS-DOS-based operating system. Version 3.2x of the Mail Multitasking
  MTA (MMTA) is designed and tested to run on OS/2 and 2.x operating system.

  The 3.2x MTA is not supported under any circumstances under Windows NT. The
  3.2x MMTA is supported doing LAN-based transfers only under the Windows NT
  operating system. The MMTA is not supported doing asynchronous transfers
  because the MMTA must access hardware directly, and this is not possible
  under Windows NT.

  Transferring via X.25 is not supported either for the MMTA on Windows NT, as
  there was not an X.25 driver for Windows NT. Only version 3.5 of the Mail
  Multitasking MMTA for Windows NT is supported in an NT environment.

4. Q. What is the purpose of inbox shadowing?

  A. The Inbox Shadowing feature instructs Mail for Windows to synchronize its
  inbox with the other Microsoft for PC Networks workstations[ASCII 146]
  inboxes.

  For example, Mail marks each inbox message once as synchronized. When you
  delete a message from the Mail for Windows inbox, it will be deleted from the
  inbox for each other client.

  For more information, see Q96718, "Description and Use of Inbox Shadowing," in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base.


5. Q. How can I perform maintenance on the Mail for PC Networks database?

  A. The "Database Maintenance Utilities" document describes operational details
  for utilities used to repair and maintain the database for Microsoft Mail for
  PC Networks. The procedures described apply to versions 2.1 and later of
  Microsoft Mail except where noted.

  To obtain this document and the utilities in the United States, ftp to the
  following site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/pcmail-public/WA0641/

6. Q. What integrity or diagnostic tests can be run against my mail message file
  (MMF)?

  A. There are two utilities that you can run on the MMF: integrity check and
  compression.

  To run the integrity check:

  NOTE: Do not invoke the MMF integrity check unless you know your MMF is
  corrupt. There is a possibility, depending on the contents of an attachment,
  that the Mail client will improperly remove part or all of the attachment.

  Hold the SHIFT key down while you are entering Mail for Windows to check the
  integrity of the MMF.

  To run the compression:

  Hold the F5 key down while you are entering Mail for Windows to recover space
  occupied by deleted objects in the MMF.

  For more information, see Q112265, "Using F5 or SHIFT Key to Start Mail
  Utilities," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

7. Q. I have run MOVEUSER.EXE, and now a number of users cannot access the mail
  server. What is the problem?

  A. This problem indicates that an ADMIN.EXE password recover has been executed
  on the user's mail message file (MMF) before you moved the user with
  MOVEUSER.EXE. As a result, the password was not carried over to the new mail
  server.

  For more information, see Q117650, "MOVEUSER.EXE Causes Invalid MMF After
  Password Reset," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

8. Q. Is there a utility available that will allow me to perform housekeeping on
  server-based mail message files (MMFs)?

  A. Yes. Microsoft provides MMFCLEAN.EXE, a Windows-based application, to purge
  mail from MMFs.

  For more information, see Q117693, "Microsoft Mail MMFCLEAN.EXE Utility," in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

9. Q. How can I optimize Mail connections via Remote Access Service (RAS)?

  A. Microsoft Mail for Windows is supported over RAS; although it will be much
  slower than if you access Mail directly over a network. (Version 3.2 of
  Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows provides faster access.) If you need to use
  Mail for Windows over RAS, you should compose and read messages offline.

  For more information, see Q119581, "Using Mail Over RAS," in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base.

10. Q. Why do I get the error "This account is not a valid user of this message
  file" when I log in to the Windows client?

  A. You will receive the error when the criteria contained in the Mail Message
  File (MMF) does not match your information on the postoffice. When this
  message is seen, it indicates that you are being properly validated by the
  postoffice, and the information returned from the postoffice does not match
  what is in the MMF.

  For more information, see Q130096, "Err Msg: This Account Is Not a Valid User
  of this...," in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

11. Q. Can I have more than one Directory Synchronization (Dir- Sync) server
  within my organization?

  A. No. Requestors can be registered with only one Dir-Sync server. Also, the
  Dir-Sync server cannot be registered as a requestor with another Dir-Sync
  server.

  For more information about the Dir-Sync process, please see Q96060,
  "Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

12. Q. Can the MS-DOS Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) files be used on the
  OS/2 platform with the Multitasking MTA (MMTA)?

  A. Yes. The Dir-Sync files (IMPORT.EXE, NSDA.EXE, REBUILD.EXE, REQMAIN.EXE,
  and SRVMAIN.EXE) are "bound" applications. As a result, they can be run on
  multiple platforms, such as MS- DOS and OS/2.

  All Dir-Sync files, except DISPATCH.EXE, can be run in these environments.

13. Q. What is the MAIL.DAT file?

  A. The MAIL.DAT is a file created when Advanced Security is installed on the
  postoffice. This file contains the location of the postoffice data files.
  The file is encrypted so users cannot see the location of the data files;
  thus, they can not tamper with them.

  The MAIL.DAT file must reside in the Mail executable directory. If you remove
  the file, your postoffice no longer has the advanced security features, and
  users must establish a drive connection to the Maildata share to use the
  Mail program.

  For more information about the MAIL.DAT file, refer to Chapter 2 of the Mail
  for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide."

14. Q. How can two or more users run Microsoft Mail from one workstation?

  A. To run multiple Mail clients from the same workstation, make the
  MSMAIL.INI file read-only. As a result, each person who logs in to the
  workstation will have to enter his or her name and password information to
  access the Mail account.

15. Q. How can I create groups on one postoffice that span multiple
  postoffices?

  To set up this environment so that the least amount of maintenance is needed,
  do the following:

  1. Create a group on each postoffice titled, for example,

  All PO# Users

     where # is the postoffice number. Each group should contain ALL local
     users, but NO external users.

  2. Export the updated address lists among all the postoffices (or let the
     directory synchronization (Dir- Sync) cycle complete).

     NOTE: If a group only contains users on the local postoffice, it can
     participate in Dir-Sync.

  3. After the Dir-Sync cycle is complete, from the Administrator program on
     each postoffice, merge the group names from the other postoffices into the
     local postoffice address list (POL) using the Address, Create command.

  4. Create a group on EACH postoffice, for example,

  All Users at ABC Company

     The group should contain all local users (the same users as in step 1
     above) AND the All PO# Users group names from the other postoffices.

     Notes:

      - Once the groups in step 4 have been created, you should not export the
        address list again. Doing so will create duplicate group names on the
        Global Address List (GAL).

      - Because this group will contain two external addresses, it will not
        participate in Dir-Sync.

  For more information on automating groups, see Q103379, "How to Create Groups
  Spanning Multiple Postoffices" and Q124044 "Replicating Postoffice Address
  List Groups Between POs" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

16. Q. How can I create group folders from Mail for Windows?

  A. Group folders cannot be created in the Windows client. They must be
  created in the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS- DOS workstation in order
  for the Windows client to use them.

17. Q. My Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) cycle is one hour off the week
  before Daylight Saving Time begins. How can I correct this?

  A. The PROCESS.GLB is not Daylight Saving Time (DST) aware, but the Dispatch
  process is. As a result, when Dispatch queries the PROCESS.GLB schedule
  table, it calculates each process up to a week (604,800 seconds) in advance.
  The week before DST, Dispatch interprets the table as one week plus one hour
  different; however the difference is not noted in the PROCESS.GLB schedule.

  To correct this, either re-adjust the times in the Administrator[ASCII 146]s
  program (ADMIN.EXE) to update the PROCESS.GLB file, or use the TimeZone
  (-TZ) variable on the External command line.

  For more information, see Q101753 [ASCII 147]When to Use the Time Zone Option
  with Dir-Sync[ASCII 148] in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

18. Q. How do I configure Mail when a shared version of Microsoft Windows is
  installed on my network server?

  A. The information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q107444 "Running
  Windows Client from the Network" outlines the procedures for users to run
  Mail for Windows from the network without storing Mail files on their local
  workstations.

  The following procedures are outlined in the article so that the network
  administrator can set up Mail so users can run Mail for Windows from the
  network without storing Mail files on their local workstations.

   - "Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Same Directory" explains how
     to set up Mail for Windows when users run both Microsoft Windows and
     version 3.2a of Mail for Windows from the same network directory.

   - "Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Different Directories"
     explains how to set up Mail for Windows when users run both Windows and
     Mail for Windows from different network directories.

   - "Running Windows Locally and Mail from the Network" explains how to set up
     Mail for Windows when users run Windows locally and run Mail for Windows
     from the network.

   - "Running Windows from the Network and Mail Locally" explains how to set up
     Mail for Windows when users run Windows from the network and run Mail for
     Windows locally.

19. Q. What are the differences between the Windows for Workgroups version of
  Mail and retail Mail?

  A. The Workgroups Mail postoffice architecture is similar to the architecture
  for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This is so users with connectivity needs
  beyond their workgroup can easily upgrade.

  The postoffice structure and Windows client are identical except for the
  following:

   - No Demo files are in the workgroup postoffice. Microsoft Mail for PC
     Networks does include these files.

   - No spell checker is supplied with Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

   - The postoffice in Windows for Workgroups does not support connections to
     external postoffices or gateways. For example, a Windows for Workgroups
     postoffice cannot connect to another postoffice or gateway.

   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes support for global aliases or
     network group names while Windows for Workgroups Mail does not.

   - The default ADMIN.TPL and ADMIN.INF files in Windows for Workgroups Mail
     are created with predefined user information in the workgroup postoffice.
     For example, the user templates included in Windows for Workgroups Mail
     contain template information regarding Phone number #1, Phone number #2,
     Office, Department, and Notes. These must be created separately in
     Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration program not
     created in Windows for Workgroups Mail. In Windows for Workgroups, the
     administration program is accessed via the Mail menu in the Windows Mail
     client.

   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks includes an administration utility that is
     used to administer and configure the postoffice. The ADMIN.EXE program can
     be used to configure and administer the postoffice from any workstation on
     the network running MS-DOS. In Windows for Workgroups, the administration
     program is accessed via the Mail menu in the Windows Mail client. Only the
     administrator can log on under his or her account and administer the
     postoffice on the workstation only.

   - The Mail client included with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version
     3.11 is designed to work with Microsoft At Work PC Fax. However, At Work
     Fax is not supported with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.

  For more information, see Q94178, "Differences Between Windows for Workgroups
  Mail &amp; PC Mail." in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
