-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT multi-homed computer registers with one of two Windows Internet
Naming Service (WINS) servers that are replicating with each other. If you
change the IP addresses of the Windows NT multi-homed computer and register with
another WINS server, the previous records on the first WINS server are not
updated. Therefore, the new registration corresponds to the previous IP
addresses.

CAUSE
=====

An active multi-homed unique replica does not replace an active multi- homed
replica in a WINS database if the owner's identifications are different (the two
records are owned by different WINS servers, neither of them being the WINS
server that pulled the replica).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

To work around this problem:

1. Create a static entry for the multi-homed computer in the first WINS server.

2. Enter the new IP addresses for the static entry.

  Inserting a static record is acceptable, because MigrateOn is set by default
  on a WINS server. If the node registers again with a new address, assuming
  the old static address has become obsolete, the new registration or its
  replicas will overwrite the old static entry.

3. Ensure that MigrateOn is set by selecting the WINS server Advanced Settings
  configuration.

After the records are replicated to the WINS servers, the previous registration
records, that are not used, are overwritten.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
