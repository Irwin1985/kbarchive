The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server Installer includes a "Check Disk Space" script item
that verifies if there is enough free space on a specified disk drive to install
all of the files included in an SMS Installer .exe installation. You can include
a "Check Disk Space" script item (with no options selected) to accomplish this
task.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is also an option to reserve additional space in the item above and beyond
what the Systems Management Server Installer calculates the files included in
the installation script would take.
When you specify the following in a Check Disk Space script item, an additional
300 megabytes of disk space is required for the installation.

- Component Variable field: (leave blank)

- Status Variable field: STATUS

Under the Reserve Space section:

- The first Disk Variable field: DESTDRIVE (where DESTDRIVE = C:)

- The first Extra Space field: 307200

The following two sections list the scenarios for interactive and silent
installations:

Interactive Installations
-------------------------

In an interactive installation, if there is at least 307,200 kilobytes on the
DESTDRIVE (C:), the script continues, and the STATUS variable is set to "".

If there is not, the user is presented with the following dialog box (there is no
way to suppress this except for running the .exe with the /S switch):

The software requires an additional xxx K bytes free on the C: drive to install.  Please remove any unnecessary files and try again.&lt;BR/&gt;

The user is then presented with the option to Abort, Retry, or Ignore:

- If the user chooses Abort, the installation is cancelled.

- If the user chooses Ignore, the STATUS variable is set to 'I' and the
  installation continues.

- If the user chooses Retry, the STATUS variable is set to 'R' and the
  installation continues.

  NOTE: If there is no STATUS variable specified, then the Check Free Space
  script item is repeated until the user aborts or enough space is freed to
  perform the installation.

You can use the contents of the variable STATUS with an If statement to verify
what was chosen and customize your script accordingly.

For example, if STATUS is set to R, retry the Check Free Disk Space until it
succeeds. If STATUS is set to I, provide the user with a dialog for ignoring the
error and then continue the installation. If STATUS is "" (there is enough
space), proceed with the installation.

Silent Installations
--------------------

In a silent Installation (using the /s switch), if there is not sufficient disk
space calculated based on the Check Disk Space script item settings, the
installation will be cancelled unless the "Do Not Cancel During Silent
Installation" option is checked.


If the Installation is not cancelled and continues on in silent mode, the STATUS
variable is set to I. Using an IF statement, this may be used as a way to
determine if enough disk space existed in silent mode, log the status to the
installation log and halt silently through a script action.

If there are any INSTALL FILE script items, the total of the files installed is
added to the "Extra Space" amount specified.

For example, if the script includes INSTALL FILE script items that installs
10,000 kilobytes of files, and you have specified 307,200 in the "Extra Space"
field, the amount required is 307,200 + 10,000. This is the free disk space
required for the destination drive. Adjust the "Extra Space" value accordingly.

If you only want to check to determine if there is enough space for the files
installed only by the installation script, leave the "Disk Variable" and "Extra
Space" fields blank.

The following is a sample script excerpt that illustrates the scenarios discussed
in this article:
