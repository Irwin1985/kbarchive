- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible that the message transfer agent (MTA) may enter an uncontrollable
state. In some instances, it cannot be stopped with the interface in the Control
Panel, Services tool. This may be caused by a corrupted message entering the MTA
database for processing or by a corruption within the MTA database itself.
Another possible cause is an excessively large message entering the server from
the Internet. Messages are not processed by the MTA while it is in this state,
and they queue up in their respective queues.

RESOLUTION
==========

While the MTA is in this uncontrollable state and cannot be stopped through
normal procedures, the Exchange Server Administrator program itself may not be
accessible. In fact, when you try to access the Administrator program, you may
see a Busy icon. Furthermore, if you try to stop the System Attendant service,
it may also be in an uncontrollable state.

To resolve this issue:

1. Try to stop the MTA through the Control Panel, Services tool. Give it enough
  time (five minutes at least) to make sure the service has actually stopped
  responding. If it does not stop gracefully, proceed with the next step.

2. Use the Windows NT Task Manager, and on the Processes tab, find the EMSMTA
  process. Try to end the process by clicking the End Process button at the
  bottom right corner. Make sure you are logged on using the Exchange Site
  service account while performing this step.

3. Note the process ID for the EMSMTA process from the Processes tab in the PID
  column. Use the Kill.exe utility to kill the MTA at this point. The Kill.exe
  utility can be found on the Windows NT Resource Kit CD. From a command prompt
  type:

  "Kill &lt;Process ID found in task manager's PID column&gt;" (without the
  quotation marks)

-or-

  "Kill emsmta" (without the quotation marks)

4. After the MTA is stopped or killed, run Mtacheck.exe twice. Mtacheck may find
  corrupted messages or queues. If it does, run it again until it says
  "Database clean. No errors detected." For additional information on running
  Mtacheck, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q148284 XCON: When and How to use the Mtacheck Utility

  Q149017 XCON: MTACheck Event IDs and Command Line Syntax

  Q163326 XCON: How and Why to Run Mtacheck

5. Re-start the MTA. The service should start and begin processing mail.
  Processing the backlog may be slow depending on the size of the queue.

If there are several thousand messages, it may be helpful to run Mtacheck with
the /rd switch. This takes some of the processing load from the MTA. The deleted
directory replication messages are regenerated by the Directory service.

NOTE: The MTA may not start if there is some higher-level corruption within the
MTA database or any other severe problems with the MTA. If this is the case,
please contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
