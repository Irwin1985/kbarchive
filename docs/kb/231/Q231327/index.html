The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows 95 Year 2000 Upgrade is not displayed in the Add/Remove Programs
tool after it is installed. It is not displayed because it should not be
removed.

To determine whether the upgrade is installed, check for the presence of the
Y2kw95.txt file in the Windows folder. You can also check the following files to
verify that the files are the correct ones:

File           Date      Time     Size      Version

Winfile.exe    2/19/99   10:55a   155,456   4.00.951

Y2kw95.txt     2/19/99   10:55a    23,611   NA

NOTE: Files with an .osr or .w95 extension are specific to the Windows version
and are renamed with the appropriate extension as shown below:

  Command.com
  Xcopy.exe
  Xcopy32.exe

IMPORTANT: If other products or updates have been applied, certain files may not
be replaced by this update. For example, if you have Microsoft Internet Explorer
4 with the Windows Desktop Update component installed (or you install it when
you are prompted by the Year 2000 Update), the Shell32.dll file listed above is
not installed with the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update installation. Manually
replacing the Internet Explorer 4 version of the Shell32.dll file with the
version included in this update can result in "fatal" problems at Windows
startup or a blank desktop. Under no circumstances should a file that is not
overwritten by the Year 2000 Update be manually updated. Because of this,
Microsoft recommends that if you are unsure of the status of the update that you
simply reinstall it to verify its integrity. Later versions of any of the above
files will not be updated by the Year 2000 Update. This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A previous version of the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update (named Win95y2k.exe), only
updates the Winfile.exe and Command.com files and adds "Windows 95 Year 2000
Update" to the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. The latest version of
this software update (W95y2k.exe) removes this item from the Add/Remove Programs
tool.

A more comprehensive Year 2000 Update (named W95y2k.exe) has since been released
(for additional details and download information, see Q225050 as noted in the
"References" section below). In addition to this, a follow-up named Windows 95
Year 2000 Corporate Update (Corpupd.exe) has also been made available (for
additional details and download information, see Q229862 as noted in the
"References" section below).

Activation of the "Windows 95 Year 2000 Update" option in the Add/Remove Programs
tool results in the computer becoming non-year 2000 compliant. For this reason,
Microsoft recommends that you obtain and install the Windows 95 Year 2000
Corporate Update.

To determine which version of the update is installed, check the Add/Remove
Programs tool. If the update is listed, the older patch is installed and should
be updated. Check for the Y2kw95.txt file in the Windows folder to verify that
the newer update is installed.

Note that the Microsoft Year 2000 Product Analyzer tool available on the
Microsoft Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure &amp; Resource Center Web site was
released before the Windows 95 Year 2000 Upgrade and does not detect the update
after it is installed. Checking file versions is the only reliable way to detect
that the update is installed.

Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q225050 and Q229862, as noted in the
"References" section below, contain additional information about these Windows
95 year 2000 updates and the registry.

The W95y2k.exe file is for all versions of Windows 95, and automatically installs
the appropriate files for the version of Windows 95 you are using.
