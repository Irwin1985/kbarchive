SUMMARY
=======

If you run the Application Connector on a Lotus Notes database and some or all
of the data does not migrate to Exchange Server and Outlook, you need to verify
that the Connector has a valid and complete property map template (PFT) to use.
The Connector uses the PFT to map fields in Notes forms to properties in
Exchange Server forms, and migrates data accordingly. If a Notes field cannot be
mapped to an Exchange Server field, the data is skipped.

There are two ways to generate a PFT file: by using the Generate Template option
in the Application Connector, or by running the Lotus Notes Application
Conversion Assistant. The Application Connector only generates PFTs, which
require no customization for simple Notes databases, for example, a document
library. If the database has been customized, you must first run the Application
Conversion Assistant before you attempt to migrate any data with the Application
Connector. And you must use that PFT when you set up the connection. To use the
Application Conversion Assistant's PFT, allow the Application Connector to
generate a template, then choose Edit Template. Delete all the text and paste
the entire contents of the Application Conversion Assistant's PFT into it, or
copy the file generated by the Application Conversion Assistant to the
Application Connector program directory.

The Application Conversion Assistant analyzes the Notes database design and
creates comparable forms in an Exchange Server public folder. Certain design
elements do not translate between programs. Therefore, you should thoroughly
review the generated Outlook forms and make any design modifications you
require. Run the Application Connector only when you are satisfied with the form
design. If you add or change any fields in your Outlook forms, you must reflect
those changes in the PFT file by manually editing it. Check thoroughly for
syntax errors. The general format of the PFT is as follows:

The Prop Map entries in the [Form Map] section lists each Notes form, its
corresponding Outlook message class, and the associated Prop Map for the
entries. For each Prop Map entry there must be a section following that maps
every Outlook field to its associated Notes field -- make sure these match,
because if the Application Connector does not find a section for each Prop Map
instance, that section is skipped and the data is not be migrated. For instance,
in the example below, Form1 (representing the Notes form called SD and the
Outlook message class called IPM.Post.Sales.Document) maps to Prop Map-SD. There
must be a section header with that exact name below or that section will be
skipped by the Application Connector.

[Form Map]

Form1=SD; IPM.Post.Sales Document; Prop Map-SD
Form2=Chart; IPM.Post.Chart; Prop Map-Chart

[Prop Map-SD]

PropX1=BOTH; MySalesDoc; text; MySalesDoc; PT_STRING8; ;
PropX2=BOTH; MySaleDate; time; MySaleDate; PT_SYSTIME; ;

[Prop Map-Chart]

Prop1=BOTH; Body; richtext; 0x10090102; ;
PropX1=BOTH; ChartTitle; text; ChartTitle; PT_STRING8; ;

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on troubleshooting the Application Connector, set logging
to the Debug level. To set logging levels, in the Exchange Server Administration
program, on the Options menu, click Logging.
