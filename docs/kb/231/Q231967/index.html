SYMPTOMS
========

In a disaster recovery situation, when the only backup available is a few days
old, there is no mechanism for determining whether the best procedure is to
restore the old backup, or to try running the utilities (Eseutil and Isinteg) to
repair the database. The problem is that the utilities can end up removing
information (pages) from the database, and there no way of telling which actual
users (mailboxes) have been affected. Determining which users are affected by
the repair may be useful in making the decision to try and repair the database,
as opposed to restoring the old backup.

This modification is no substitute for a correctly implemented disaster recovery
strategy. Restoring from a recent backup should always be the preferred method
for coping with a disaster recovery scenario.

CAUSE
=====

Isinteg has been modified to additionally dump the Mailbox table of the
database. Previously the Isinteg -dump option would dump the Index Age and
Folder tables, but now it also dumps the Mailbox table.

This additional information can be used in the following manner to manually
determine which users have lost information from a database repair.

- After running Eseutil to repair the database, that is, "eseutil /p
  &lt;database name&gt; /v /x" (without the quotation marks), check the display
  and Repair.txt file in the same directory. If you see lines in the file such
  as:

  Inserting page 62 into BadPages table
  Creating new FDP with 3 pages starting at 246
  Table Msg (14). new pgnoFDP is 246

  It indicates that bad pages have been found in the database and moved to a
  different table for deletion.

- When running Isinteg to check the integrity of the database, that is "isinteg
  -pri -fix -detailed -verbose -test alltests" (without the quotation marks),
  check the Isinteg.pri file in the same directory. If you see lines such as:

  Fix: MsgFolder 1 (FID=0001-000000000144, MID=0001-000000000167,
  INID=0001-0000000010E9): Deleting this MsgFolder row

  It indicates from which folder (indicated by the FID) has been repaired.

- Now run Isinteg in dump mode, that is, "isinteg -pri -dump" (without the
  quotation marks), and check the Isinteg.pri file in the same directory. Look
  up the FID in the dump of the Folder table and obtain the Root FID of the
  folder:

  [36] Folder FID=0001-000000000144
  Parent FID=0001-000000000141
  Root FID=0001-000000000140
  ACL ID=0000-000000000000
  Folder Type=1
  Msg Count=0
  Msgs Unread=0
  Msgs Submitted=0
  Rcv Count=4
  Subfolders=0
  Name=Inbox
  Comment=
  Restriction=
  Search FIDs=0001-000000000401
  Recursive FIDs=
  Search Backlinks=0001-000000000401
  Categ FIDs=

  Look up the Root FID in the dump of the Mailbox table and obtain the details
  of a user who has lost information as a result of the database repair, for
  example:

  [3] RootFID=0001-000000000140
  Owner DN=???
  GUID=5BC414D6 1BFED211 B9C20080 C7C0C499
  Display Name=Mailbox - John Doe
  Comment=
  Sentmail FID=542D-6530362B5136
  Subtree=0001-000000000141
  Inbox=0001-000000000142
  Outbox=0001-000000000143
  Sentmail=0001-000000000144
  Finder=0001-000000000146
  DAF=0001-000000000147
  Spooler Q=0001-000000000148
  Size=(ec:ecNotFound-MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND)
  Localized=TRUE
