- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to log on to a server
that is running Routing and Remote Access, you may be unable to connect to the
Internet.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if you configure the VPN connection to use the default
gateway on the remote network. This setting overrides the default gateway
settings that you specify in your Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure the client computers to use the default gateway
setting on the local network for Internet traffic and a static route on the
remote network for VPN-based traffic.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Step 1: Configure the  Server That Is Running  Routing and Remote Access to Use a Static IP Address Pool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 2000 Server:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  "Routing and Remote Access".

2. Right-click the server that is running Routing and Remote Access, and then
  click Properties.

3. Click the IP tab, click "Static address pool", and then click Add.

4. Type the start of the Internet Protocol (IP) address range in the "Start IP
  address" box, type the end of the IP address range in the "End IP address"
  box, and then click OK.

  NOTE: Configure a pool of static IP addresses on a different network segment
  than the network segment on which the internal local area network (LAN)
  exists.

5. Click to select the "Enable IP routing" check box (if it is not already
  selected).

6. Click OK.

7. Enable TCP/IP forwarding.

For additional information about how to enable IP forwarding, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q230082 How to Enable TCP/IP Forwarding in Windows 2000

Windows NT Server 4.0:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Network.

2. Click the Services tab, click Remote Access Service in the Network Services
  list, and then click Properties.

3. Click Network, click to select the TCP/IP check box (if it is not already
  selected), and then click Configure next to TCP/IP.

4. Click "Use static address pool".

5. Type the start of the IP address range in the "Begin" box, type the end of
  the IP address range in the "End" box.

  NOTE: Configure a pool of static IP addresses on a different network segment
  than the network segment on which the internal LAN exists.

6. If you want to exclude a range of IP addresses from the static address pool,
  type the starting IP address of the range that you want to exclude in the
  From box, type the ending IP address of the range that you want to exclude in
  the To box, and then click Add.

7. Click OK, click OK, and then click Continue.

8. Click the Protocols tab, click TCP/IP Protocol, click Properties, click the
  Routing tab, and then click to select the Enable IP Forwarding check box (if
  it is not already selected).

9. Click OK, and then click Close.

10. Click Yes to restart the computer.

Step 2: Configure the VPN Client TCP/IP Properties
--------------------------------------------------

To disable the "Use Default Gateway on Remote Network" setting in the VPN dial-up
connection item on the client computer:

1. Double-click My Computer, and then click the "Network and Dial-up
  Connections" link.

2. Right-click the VPN connection that you want to change, and then click
  Properties.

3. Click the Networking tab, click "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" in the
  "Components checked are used by this connection" list, and then click
  Properties.

4. Click Advanced, and then click to clear the "Use default gateway on remote
  network" check box.

5. Click OK, click OK, and then click OK.

Step 3: Connect to the Server That Is Running  Routing and Remote Access
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the client computer, connect to the Internet, and then establish a VPN
connection to the server that is running Routing and Remote Access.

NOTE: You cannot connect to resources on the remote network because you have
disabled the "Use Default Gateway on Remote Network" setting in the VPN TCP/IP
configuration.

Step 4: Add a Static Route on the Client
----------------------------------------

Add a static route on the client computer that uses the following configuration:

- The remote network is the destination.

- The correct subnet mask is used for the remote network.

- The first IP address from the static IP address pool that you configured in
  the "Step 1: Configure the Server That Is Running Routing and Remote Access
  to Use a Static IP Address Pool" section of this article is the gateway.

  NOTE: The Routing and Remote Access server assigns this first IP address to
  its wide area network (WAN) Miniport driver.

For additional information about how to add a static route, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140859 TCP/IP Routing Basics for Windows NT

For example, to add a static route to a network that has the IP address of
192.168.10.0, the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and the gateway (the first IP
address of the range assigned to the static IP address pool) of 192.168.1.1,
type the following command at the command prompt, and then press ENTER:

  route -p add 192.168.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

NOTE: If you use the -p switch with Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0, the route is
made "persistent." Use this switch to ensure that the routing entry is preserved
when the computer is restarted.

NOTE: The -p switch is not supported on either Microsoft Windows Millennium
Edition-based, Microsoft Windows 98-based, or Microsoft Windows 95-based
computers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, create a batch file that contains the necessary route
add command, and then configure it to run each time that a client connects to
the VPN Server.
