-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience a problem when the Sender component of the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Executive service has begun transmission of a package to a remote
SMS server site. During the current site-sending job, the Sender component may
not accept changes to the Address properties.

Example
-------

The sender has begun sending a 600 megabyte (MB) file to a remote site, and the
address for that remote site has a 50 percent bandwidth-use throttle or rate
limit. If the rate limit is changed to 100 percent during the sending process,
the sender thread does not detect the change to the address properties. When
this occurs, the sender thread continues to send at the 50 percent limit.

This limitation applies to both the rate limit and the outbox availability
schedule. Because of this, if the schedule had been closed for this address
after sending had begun in the earlier example, the large package file would
still be sent to the remote site. The sender does not stop sending data to the
destination site until it has completed the sending of any package that is
currently in progress.

Even if you try to stop the SMS Executive service, in progress send requests do
not stop, and the SMS Executive service does not stop until the current sending
job is done.

CAUSE
=====

The sender thread loads an address' rate limit and schedule upon creation, and
it does not refresh the address information while the package and instruction
file are being sent. Because of this, the sender adjusts the sending rate
according to the schedule when the thread is started, but it does not adjust for
any changes that occur after the thread has been created.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English SMS 2.0 Post SP3 version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date         Time   Version        Size     File name    Platform
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  01-Mar-2001  22:05  2.0.1493.3273   37,136  Connras.dll  Alpha 
  01-Mar-2001  22:05  2.0.1493.3273  212,240  Sender.dll   Alpha 
  01-Mar-2001  22:05  2.0.1493.3273   23,920  Connras.dll  Intel
  01-Mar-2001  22:05  2.0.1493.3273  134,048  Sender.dll   Intel

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains these files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Hotfix Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Apply this fix to all sites in the SMS hierarchy in which the sender needs to
respond immediately to a change in the schedule or the bandwidth setting.

Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Note that
  Q317893.exe is a Microsoft SMS Installer script that updates specific files
  on your site server.

2. Log on to the site server by using an account with administrative rights.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q317893.exe tool, and then follow the directions in the wizard. You
  can run the file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Manually Installing the Hotfix:

1. Stop the SMS Site Component Manager and SMS Executive services on the site
  server.

2. Replace the Sender.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

3. Replace the Conras.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

4. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager and SMS Executive services.
