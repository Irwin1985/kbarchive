-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0, used with:
   - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Visual SourceSafe version 6.0a/b integration with Visual Studio .NET,
your connection may break if the solution file is not added to Source Code
Control (SCC).

NOTE: This behavior does not occur when you use Visual SourceSafe version 6.0c.

CAUSE
=====

SourceSafe 6.0a/b does not recognize the Visual Studio .NET extensions for
source control. As a result, SourceSafe writes the connection information to the
solution file (which is not under source control), instead of writing the
connection information to the Visual Studio .NET extensions.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change source control to unbind and then rebind to the original location. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Source Control, and then click Change Source Control.

2. When you receive a prompt, save the solution. The Change Source Control
  dialog box appears.

3. Unbind and then rebind to the original location. The following dialog box
  appears:

  Some projects have been bound to server locations that may be incorrect. A
  location may be incorrect either because it does not contain the majority of
  the projects' files or because those files are not in the correct location
  relative to the specified server folder. You should probably fix all the
  bindings in the solution. However, you may continue and bind these projects
  to the specified locations even when some may to be incorrect.

4. Click Continue with these bindings, and then ensure that you save the
  solution when you check in the project (on the File menu, click Save all).


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create two Visual SourceSafe users: set one without project extensions, and
  set the other with normal project extensions.

  To clear the project extensions, follow these steps:

  a. Open the SourceSafe explorer as the user for which you want to clear the
     extensions.

  b. On the Tools menu, click Options, click File Types, and then delete the
     file extensions that appear in the Create SCC file box.

  c. Close the explorer.

2. Create a solution that contains a project.

3. Add the project only to source control as a selection: on the File menu,
  click Source Control, click "Add selected projects to Source Control", and
  ensure that you are using the SourceSafe user that has SCC project
  extensions.

4. Close the shell, and then save the solution when you are prompted.

5. Start Visual Studio .NET.

6. On the File menu, click Source Control, and then click "Open from Source
  Control". Ensure that you use the user without SCC project file extensions,
  and that you open the project to a new location.

  You receive the following error message:

  The binding information for project WindowsApplication1 could not be
  retrieved from its source control provider. This project may have been placed
  under source control with a different provider configuration from the current
  one.

  To keep source control working for this project, Visual Studio will now check
  out the project file so that the binding information can be saved in it.
  However, if the check out fails and the project is closed without saving, the
  next time it is opened, it will appear to no longer be under source control.

7. Click OK, and then click Check out.

8. Check in the project.

  The project now seems to be checked in and corrected, and you may think that
  the connection information has been saved to the project file. In reality,
  the connection information was written to the solution file and it may be
  lost if you do not save the solution file.
