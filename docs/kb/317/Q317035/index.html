SYMPTOMS
========

A cross-site scripting (CSS) vulnerability exists in Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0, Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, and IIS 5.1. Through this
vulnerability, an attacker can send a request to an affected server that causes
a Web page that contains script to be sent to another user. The script executes
in the user's browser as though it comes from the third-party site, which lets
the script run by using the security settings that are appropriate to the
third-party Web site, and also permits the attacker to access any data that
belongs to the site.

This vulnerability can only be exploited if the user opens a Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) mail message or visited Web site of a malicious user. The code
cannot be "injected" into an existing session.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because a message that is returned when someone
requests a Web page that has been moved to a new location does not properly
validate all inputs before using them. Such a message is known as a redirect
response.

A successful attack can only be performed by using this message if the target of
the attack is running a browser other than Microsoft Internet Explorer.
