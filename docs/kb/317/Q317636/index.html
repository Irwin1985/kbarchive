The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released a Security Rollup Package (SRP) for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition, that includes the functionality from the
Post-Windows NT 4.0 SP6a Security Rollup Package
(http://support.microsoft.com/support/misc/kblookup.asp?ID=299444) and the
security patches that are described in the "More Information" section in this
article. This small, comprehensive, rollup of post-Service Pack 6 (SP6) fixes
provides an easier mechanism for managing the rollout of security fixes.

The SRP includes only security updates for Windows NT 4.0. It does not include
patches for any other products or operating systems. Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) is not intended for use on Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition, and is not supported. Microsoft recommends that
customers who run IIS 4.0 on Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition,
protect their systems by removing IIS 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

  Package Release Notes

Packages are available from the following Microsoft Web site (if your language is
not listed, please check back):

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/terminalserver/downloads/critical/q317636/default.asp

NOTE: This package requires Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, SP6
(http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/terminalserver/downloads/recommended/tsesp6/default.asp).

Release Date: April 24, 2002

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. After it is posted, the file is housed on
secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Fixes That Are Included in the SRP
----------------------------------

The SRP includes the following post-SP6 fixes that have been delivered by
Microsoft Security Bulletins
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/itsolutions/security/default.asp).
The SRP also includes some fixes that have not been previously described.
Because security bulletins are disruptive to customer's maintenance procedures,
Microsoft often issues them only when a security issue poses an immediate danger
to customer's computers. Issues that do not meet this standard are typically
addressed through other delivery vehicles such as service packs or, in this
case, the SRP.
