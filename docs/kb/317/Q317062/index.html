-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Host Account Manager to add a user account to an SNA Host Account
Cache database from a Windows NT or a Windows 2000 domain other than the domain
where the SNA Host Account Cache (HAC) database is located, you may receive the
following error message:

  There is no record of the selected user in the Host Account Cache. Please
  select a different account.

If you use the Host Integration Server 2000 command-line configuration utility
(Snacfg.exe) to add a user account to an SNA Host Account Cache database from a
Windows NT or a Windows 2000 domain other than the domain where the SNA Host
Account Cache (HAC) database is located, you may receive the following error
message:

  Cannot add &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt;. Error: Referenced WinNT user not
  found

CAUSE
=====

Before the SNA Host Account Cache service (Snaudb.exe) adds a user account to
the HAC database, Snaudb.exe calls a Win32 API to obtain detailed information
about the user account.

If the user account does not exist in the domain in which the SNA Host Account
Cache service is running, then the Win32 API call fails and you receive an error
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

File name    Date         Time      
------------------------------------
Snaudb.exe   03/12/2002   08:08am 

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many customers implement multiple domain models in their Windows NT or Windows
2000 environments. Please refer to the following Knowledge Base article for more
details about how to configure host security in a multiple domain environment:

  Q194695 How to Configure Host Security for a Multi-Domain Environment

The following is an example of a multiple domain model that implements the
Security Integration feature included with Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000.

The sample multiple domain model consists of a Windows 2000 Forest that includes
a parent domain named "Parent" and a child domain named "Child".

The Child domain contains one or more servers running HIS 2000. The Primary
Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator for the Child domain is running the following
Security Integration features:

- SNA Host Account Cache service
- SNA WinNT Account Synchronization service

NOTE: Each of these services is operating in a primary role. The SNA WinNT
Account Synchronization service also is installed on the remaining the domain
controllers (DCs) in the Child domain, but these DCs are configured in a backup
role.

The SNA WinNT Account Synchronization service also is installed on all of the DCs
in the Parent domain. The SNA WinNT Account Synchronization service on the PDC
Emulator in the Parent domain is configured manually to operate in a backup role
because there should be only one primary SNA WinNT Account Synchronization
service in a host security environment.

In this configuration, you can add user accounts to the HAC database in the Child
domain. The problem described previously occurs when you try to use Host Account
Manager or Snacfg.exe to add user accounts from the Parent domain to the HAC
database.
