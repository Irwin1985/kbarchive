SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to remotely control a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client,
you may see a gray screen instead of the desktop from the remote computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next SMS 2.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services

Web site:

may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

MORE INFORMATION

To Install the Hotfix
---------------------

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the SMS site server and on
each SMS Administrator console.

Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

  an SMS Installer file that updates specific files on your site server and
  computers that run the SMS Administrator console.

2. Log on to the site server or on to a computer that runs the SMS Administrator
  console by using an account with administrator permissions.

3. Make sure that the SMS Administrator console is not running.

4. Run Q317795.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard. You can run
  Q317795.exe in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Manually Installing the Hotfix:

To manually install the hotfix on a site server or on a computer that runs the
SMS Administrator console:

1. On the site server, make sure that the SMS Administrator console is not
  running.

2. Replace the Ldwmnt.dll file in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Bin\I386 folder with the
  version from the hotfix.
