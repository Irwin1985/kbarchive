-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, you may experience any
of the following issues if you use a CH Flight Yoke or CH Virtual Pilot Pro:

- When you launch a new flight, the plane pulls to right or left immediately
  after the cockpit is loaded.

  -or-

- The toe brakes may be extremely sensitive, and you cannot release the parking
  brake.

  -or-

- The throttle controls do not work.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can be caused by outdated or incorrectly configured CH driver
software.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, update CH Products software, calibrate your yoke and
pedals, and then rebuild the Fs2002.cfg file. To do this, follow these steps:

Update CH Products Software
---------------------------

Connect to the following CH Web site to download the newest version of CH
Products software:

  http://www.chproducts.com

Calibrate the Yoke and Pedals
-----------------------------

If you use a digital Microsoft SideWinder game controller with Microsoft
SideWinder Game Device software version 2.0 or later or Microsoft SideWinder
Game Controller software, the software calibrates the game controller
automatically.

To use Microsoft SideWinder Game Device software version 2.0 to test the
calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, and then click OK.

4. Close Control Panel.

Rebuild the Fs2002.cfg File
---------------------------

To rebuild the Fs2002.cfg file, press and hold down CTRL+SHIFT as you start
Flight Simulator and start a new flight. Continue to hold down CTRL+SHIFT until
the game is in Cockpit view.

NOTE: When you rebuild the Fs2002.cfg file, some of your joystick settings may
change.

If your game controller is installed properly and the Devices.cfg file contains
the default settings for your game controller, Flight Simulator 2002 adds the
appropriate entries for your game controller to the Fs2002.cfg file.

The Devices.cfg file contains the following joystick headings:

The settings under the SLEW headings determine how the game controller behaves in
Slew mode. The settings under the RUDDER headings determine how the game
controller behaves when the rudder is enabled. To enable the rudder settings,
click to select the Rudder check box on the Settings tab in the Game Controllers
tool in Control Panel.

NOTE: If your game controller is not defined in the Devices.cfg file, Flight
Simulator 2002 may not assign any actions to the buttons on your game
controller. For additional information about how to manually assign actions to
the buttons on your game controller, click the article number below to view the
