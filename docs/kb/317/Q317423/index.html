WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use any of the following methods.

- Determine which file is causing the problem, and then obtain an updated
  version of this file from the software manufacturer. For information about
  how to determine which file is causing the issue to occur, please see the
  "More Information" section of this article.

- Because this problem occurs only with computers that are running Microsoft
  Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98 or Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition
  (Me), you can upgrade to Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 2000.

- Turn off the software inventory on the client computer. For additional
  information about how to do so, click the article number below to view the
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: This method works on Intel platforms only.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. The Q317423.exe
  file is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on
  your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  permissions.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Start Q317423.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the
  program in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

How to Determine Which File Is Causing the Problem
--------------------------------------------------

1. Obtain and install Filemon (a utility that monitors file activity) from the
  following Sysinternals Web site:

  http://www.sysinternals.com

2. Start Filemon on a computer with this issue.

3. In the SMS tool in Control Panel, start the Software Inventory component from
  the Components tab.

4. Wait until you receive the "illegal operation" error message.

5. In Filemon, note of the last file that was accessed by Sinv32.exe.

6. In Windows Explorer, right-click the file you noted in step 5, and then click
  the Version tab. You should receive the "illegal operation" error message
  again.
