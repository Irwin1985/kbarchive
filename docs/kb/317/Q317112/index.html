-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) services that are running on the site server may
perform excessive directory accesses. This can generate unnecessary network
traffic. If you have enabled success auditing of directory service, the SMS
Service account may generate many event ID 565 entries in the Security event
log.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

To Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: This method is for only Intel-based computers.

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible from your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the update file (Q317112.exe) and platform folders to the new folder.
  The folder structure must be such that the program (.exe) file is located one
  folder "above" the platform folders.

3. From each of your primary SMS site servers in your environment, log on to
  your site server by using an account with administrative permissions.

4. Quit the SMS administrator console.

5. Run Q317112.exe, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

To Manually Update the SMS Site Server:

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfix files to the new folder.

3. From each of your primary SMS site servers in your environment, log on to
  your site server by using an account with administrative permissions.

4. Quit the SMS administrator console.

5. Stop all SMS services, including the Windows Management service.

  Note that with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) build 1085, the
  service name is changed to "Windows Management Instrumentation."

6. Make a backup copy of the following files:

  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

7. Copy these updated files from the disk or network share to the SMS
  administrator console folder:

  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

8. Restart the SMS services.

Additional Installation Information

To update remote site computers, such as an SMS administrator console, an SMS SQL
monitor, or an SMS provider that is not located on the site server, follow the
appropriate instructions.

  &lt;SMS_Admin_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe
  &lt;SMS_Admin_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

3. Copy these updated files from the disk or network share to the SMS
  administrator console folder:

  &lt;SMS_Admin_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

To Update a Remote SMS Provider Server:

NOTE: Before you install this update on your SMS provider server, you must
install it on the SMS site servers in your environment.

1. From the updated SMS site server, copy the following SMS provider files to a
  disk or network share:

  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

2. On the SMS Provider server, stop the following services:

  SMS_SQL_MONITOR_&lt;SERVERNAME&gt;
  Windows Management

Note that with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) build 1085, the service
name is changed to "Windows Management Instrumentation."

3. Make a backup copy of the files you are about to overwrite:

  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

4. Copy these updated files from the disk or network share to the SMS provider
  folder:

  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll

  Windows Management

Note that with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) build 1085, the service
name is changed to "Windows Management Instrumentation."

To Manually Update a Remote SMS SQL Monitor Server:

NOTE: Before you install this update on your SMS site database server, you must
install it on the SMS site servers in your environment.

  a disk or network share:

  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe
  &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll
