IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

A Lotus Notes client (versions 4.5 and 4.6) may receive the following error
message:

  Error loading Metafile

when you open a message sent from an Exchange client and delivered through either
the Exchange Notes Connector (Exchange Server 5.5 - NMC) or the LinkAge Notes
Connector (for Lotus Notes 3.2).

NOTE: For additional diagnostic symptoms of this issue, see the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q179197 XFOR: Notes Client Receives "Error Loading Metafile"

This problem can occur when all of the following statements are true:

- The message is composed using the Exchange client or the Outlook client.

- The message is composed using WordMail as the message editor.

- The Exchange Server message composition includes a screen capture
  (ALT+PRINTSCREEN or CTRL+PRINTSCREEN) pasted into (CTRL+V or by clicking
  Paste from the Edit menu) the message body. (Additionally, On the Insert
  menu, click Picture, then click From file[ASCII 133] can cause this same
  result.)

- The message is routed into Lotus Notes using the LinkAge Notes Connector (for
  Lotus Notes 3.2) with Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0, or using Exchange Server
  5.5 and its Exchange Note Connector.

CAUSE
=====

The Lotus Notes client's export\import filters do not properly convert inline
bitmaps within a Rich Text Format (RTF) structure into a valid Composite Data
structure.

WORKAROUND
==========

A Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro can be employed within the Exchange
client's enabling WordMail document template (Email.dot by default) to replace
the default Edit and Paste behavior of WordMail. A code sample is provided
below. Please read the MORE INFORMATION section and ALL the information about
this macro before using it.

Wide Web:

The following macro changes the default behavior of the Edit and Paste
functionality within any composition by using a document template (a Xxxxxxx.dot
file) that has this macro added to it.

It is recommended that you do the following:

1. Edit an existing Email.dot template.

2. Add the following VBA code as a macro named "EditPaste" (without the
  quotation marks).

3. Save the document template (possibly under a new name, for example,
  Emailnmc.dot).

4. Distribute the new template to Exchange clients that use WordMail.

5. Configure the Exchange or Outlook clients to use the new document template
  (see "Installing the template" below).

     *** Begin VBA code ***

         Set myDialog = Dialogs(wdDialogEditPasteSpecial)
         a$ = myDialog.Datatype
         If a$ &lt;&gt; "DIB" Then GoTo ZIG

      GoTo ZAG
      MsgBox "Unable to paste. Please re-copy the item and paste again.",
      vbInformation, "Microsoft Outlook"
      GoTo ZAG
      ZIG:
         Selection.Paste
      ZAG:
         Application.ScreenUpdating = True
      End Sub
     *** End VBA code ***

Using the Macro
---------------

The macro is engaged whenever the user clicks Paste from the Edit menu, or
alternatively whenever the user uses the Paste toolbar button or the shortcut
key combination CTRL+V. The macro's action remains transparent to the user.

The macro is selective about when, and if, it changes existing Edit and Paste
behavior. It only changes existing behavior if the data pasted is of datatype
DIB (device independent bitmap). Word identifies desktop screen captures as
DIBs. Images cut and pasted from other applications usually carry the
application's or object's OLE identity with them, and Word treats them as OLE
objects within the document or message composition.

The macro results in the screen capture being included in the document or message
as an OLE Word object instead of an inline bitmap within the RTF_Body. These
Word objects traverse the Connector for Lotus Notes and can be successfully
rendered within the Notes client.

Issues with Using this Macro
----------------------------

There are two issues with using this macro:

1. An OLE Word object tends to be somewhat larger than the inline bitmap of the
  same screen capture. Although the difference is not excessive, the required
  storage space, transfer time, and time for an Exchange client to display the
  message may be greater than for a comparable RTF inline bitmap.

2. After a screen capture is pasted into the message body, the clipboard buffer
  is overwritten. If you intend to paste multiple copies of the SAME screen
  capture into this message or additional messages, you must re-capture the
  desired screenshot and paste it into the message. This is to prevent a
  subsequent paste action from introducing an inline bitmap object that would
  result in the message, once again, not being rendered in the Notes client.

Installing the Template
-----------------------

Manual installation of a new template requires the following steps:

1. Copy the new template file to the user's computer. The default location for
  Email.dot is &lt;install-drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office. If
  the new template is named Email.dot, and it is allowed to overwrite the
  existing Email.dot, no further configuration is necessary besides restarting
  the client.

2. Configure the client to use the template: For Outlook, perform the following
  steps:

  a. On the Tools menu, click Options, then click the Email tab.

  b. Click Template.

  c. Locate and specify the template file to be used. Click Apply.

  For Exchange Inbox:

  a. On the Compose menu, click WordMail options...

  b. Click Add.

  c. Locate and specify the template file to be used. Click Add.

  d. Select the new template from the list, and select the Set As Default
     Template check box. Click Close.

Automated installation:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

With automated methods for installing the template, for example, Microsoft
Systems Management Server, you must place the file in the desired location and
specify the full path and file name to the template in the following registry
value:

For Office 98:

  HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Stationary

For Office 95:

  HKEY_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Office\7.0\Word\Stationary

  Default Template:REG_SZ:&lt;full-path-and-filename-to-document-template&gt;

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the Exchange Notes Connector to improve interoperability
between Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange Server.

To obtain this feature, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


This feature was first included in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.



STATUS
======

Lotus Notes is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The WordMail default action for pasting screen captures into an e-mail
composition is to paste the capture (recognized by WordMail as a device
independent bitmap [DIB]) from the clipboard into the message body as an inline
bitmap within the Rich Text Format (RTF) body of the composition. Inline bitmaps
are fully supported by the current RTF specification, and RTF is a native
document format of Microsoft Exchange Server.

The Lotus Notes native document format is Composite Data (CD). The Lotus Notes
client provides Export\Import filters (Nxrtf.dll and Nirtf.dll), which include
transforms for converting RTF-to-CD and vice versa. The Exchange Notes Connector
and the earlier LinkAge Notes Connector rely on the functionality available in
these Notes DLLs for conversion of RTF-to-CD (Exchange message body converted
from Exchange Server to Notes) and CD-to- RTF (Notes message body converted from
Notes to Exchange Server). Lotus Development has not updated these conversion
routines to support the current RTF specification, and the routines do not
properly handle RTF structures with inline bitmaps within the RTF_Body. The
result is that a message that cannot be rendered can be delivered to the Notes
recipient.
