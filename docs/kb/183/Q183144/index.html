1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR MICROSOFT ENCARTA ENCYCLOPEDIA
-----------------------------------------------------------

What you need to use Encarta 98 Encyclopedia:

To install and use Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia you need:

- A Power Macintosh or a Macintosh with a 25Mhz, 68030 or faster processor
  (includes Macintosh IIci, LCIII, Performa 450 and later models)

- System 7.1 or later

- 8 MB of RAM running System 7.1, 16 MB of RAM running System 7.5 or later

- 43 MB of available hard disk space

- 8 MB of available hard disk space for Microsoft Encarta Research
  Organizer

- Research Organizer requires an additional 3MB of RAM while the
  encyclopedia is running

- A double-speed or faster CD-ROM drive

- A monitor supporting 256-colors at a 640x480 or higher resolution

To use Encarta Yearbook, Web Links, and monthly online updates, you need:

- A modem (9600 bps or faster)

- Access to the Internet

- 4 MB of additional hard-disk space, plus 1 MB for each monthly update

---------------
2. MEMORY USE
---------------

Memory management and settings to enhance Encarta 98 Encyclopedia's
performance

Encarta Encyclopedia needs at least 5 MB of RAM to operate; however, the
multimedia components run better if more memory is available. On systems
with the minimum recommended 8 MB of RAM, certain encyclopedia features
are not be available. For optimum performace, use Encarta Encyclopedia on
a system with at least 16 MB of RAM.

If your computer has 8 MB of RAM, and if the system software uses more
than 3 MB of RAM, you may need to adjust the way memory is used so that
Encarta Encyclopedia runs properly. If you use System 7.5 or higher, your
system software may take up more than 7 MB of RAM. For System 7.5 or
higher systems, 16 MB of RAM is recommended.

The following are general suggestions for enhancing memory use:

- Run only one application at a time. If other applications are running,
  close them, then restart Encarta Encyclopedia.

- Reduce the amount of memory used by your system software. To do this,
  from the Apple menu, choose Finder, and then select About This Macintosh
  (or About This Computer if you're using System 7.5.5 or higher). The
  Largest Unused Block should be greater than 5000K to run Encarta
  Encyclopedia. If the only item listed is System Software and the Largest
  Unused Block is less than 5000K, reduce the amount of memory used by
  your system software. For details on adjusting memory, see your
  Macintosh documentation or follow the general suggestions below.

- Open the Memory Control Panel and set the Disk Cache setting to the
  lowest amount possible.

- You can make more memory available by removing fonts and sounds you
  aren't using. However, do not remove the Arial, Symbol, Times New Roman,
  MS Reference, and HM Phonetic fonts because these are required by
  Encarta Encyclopedia.

- Third-party system extensions such as screen savers, fax software,
  desktop pictures, utilities that modify menus, and other system
  enhancements increase the amount of memory consumed by your system
  software. Removing some or all of these extensions increases the amount
  of memory available to applications and minimizes the risk of conflict.
  Save anything you remove from your System Folder and place it in a
  separate folder on your computer's hard disk so that you can replace it
  later. You can use Apple's Extension Manager or an equivalent
  third-party utility to do this. Do not remove the CD-ROM driver
  software, or QuickTime components because these extensions are necessary
  to run Encarta Encyclopedia.

- Turning on Virtual Memory increases the amount of memory available by
  using space on your computer's hard drive to simulate RAM. Although
  using virtual memory may slow down performance, the extra available
  memory may cause applications like Encarta Encyclopedia to be allocated
  more memory at start up or allow more applications to be run
  simultaneously. When Virtual Memory is turned off, Encarta
  Encyclopedia's memory requirements may increase by 7MB. To turn on
  Virtual Memory, from the Apple menu, choose Control Panels, and then
  choose Memory. In the Memory Control Panel, click the On button under
  Virtual Memory. Then restart your computer.

  WARNING: Allocating less than 7,000K for Encarta Encyclopedia's memory
  requirements may cause the program to perform poorly. For example, you
  may not be able to play video clips or enlarge images if the
  encyclopedia runs out of memory.

For additional Mac OS memory management support, contact Apple Computer,
Inc.

Low memory symptoms and solutions:

Following are examples of some low memory symptoms and possible solutions
to these problems.

Symptom: Incorrect or oddly-sized characters displayed in article text.

Reason: Encarta Encyclopedia uses a variety of fonts to display special
characters in article text. If there is not enough memory to load one of
these fonts, your computer substitutes a "best fit" font from one that
already is in memory. Encarta Encyclopedia requires the following fonts:
Arial, Times New Roman, Symbol, MS Reference, and HM Phonetic.

Solution: First ensure that the correct fonts are in your System Folder.
If any required fonts are missing, reinstall Encarta Encyclopedia
Encyclopedia from Disc 1. If all the required fonts are properly
installed, there may not be enough free system memory to display the
custom fonts. Try the adjustments described previously to increase system
memory.

Symptom: When enlarging an image, I get an empty box or an error message
saying the encyclopedia is "Unable to Load Image."

Reason: A single image needs up to 300K of memory to display in 256-color
mode and 900K in Millions of Colors. If the enlarged image also has sound,
more memory is required.

Solution: Close any windows, list boxes, or minimized features you may
have open (More Info, Outline, Pinpointer, MindMaze, Collages, etc.), and
then try again. If this doesn't work, you can quit and restart Encarta
Encyclopedia, or try the adjustments described previously to increase
system memory.

Symptom: When printing from the encyclopedia, the pages are blank or
partial pages are printed.

Reason: Printing requires creating a duplicate layout for the printer
because the printer has different margins from the screen. Some of the
articles in Encarta Encyclopedia are thousands of words long and having
two copies of a long article or large image in memory at the same time can
use up your computer's available memory.

Solution: Close any windows, list boxes, or minimized features you may
have open (More Info, Outline, Pinpointer, MindMaze, Collages, etc.), and
then try again. If this doesn't work, you can quit and restart Encarta
Encyclopedia, or try the adjustments described previously to increase
system memory. Or you can copy the topic to the Clipboard, quit Encarta,
then paste it into your word processing program to print it.

----------------
3. PERFORMANCE
----------------

Ways to improve Encarta Encyclopedia's performance:

If Encarta Encyclopedia seems to run slowly or if audio and video clips
are choppy or interrupted, try the following tips to improve performance.

- If less than 6 MB of memory are free when you start the encyclopedia,
  you may notice some performance problems. See the previous section,
  MEMORY USE.

- Increase the preferred size for Encarta Encyclopedia's memory
  allocation. The encyclopedia is set to a suggested memory size of 7000K.
  If there is sufficient additional memory available to run Encarta, you
  can increase the amount of memory the program requests by selecting the
  Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia application icon on your hard drive,
  choosing Get Info from the File menu, and changing the preferred size in
  the area titled "Memory Requirements."

  NOTE: If Encarta Encyclopedia is running or busy, you may not be able to
  change the memory allocation. In this case, quit Encarta, and then try
  again, or restart your computer and try again.

- Encarta Encyclopedia may run slowly if you use Virtual Memory to expand
  available memory. For best performance on a 68k Macintosh, turn off
  Virtual Memory or reduce its allocated size in the Memory control panel.
  On a Power Macintosh, running with without Virtual Memory, Encarta
  Encyclopedia will require twice as much memory. Virtual Memory is
  recommended on a Power Macintosh.

- If you are using FWB CD-ROM Toolkit on your computer, you may have
  difficulty swapping discs and playing media.

- Encarta Encyclopedia is designed to for use with a CD-ROM drive that has
  a 150K/sec or faster transfer rate. A double-speed CD-ROM drive or one
  with a faster transfer rate will provide even better performance in some
  areas. If your CD-ROM drive has a sustained transfer rate less than
  150K/sec, it may not be able to supply audio and video information to
  the Macintosh at the speed required. The only solution is to upgrade to
  a faster CD-ROM drive. If you suspect there is a problem with your
  drive, ensure that the drive is terminated properly and that the
  software is installed properly. For details on SCSI termination, see
  your Macintosh or CD-ROM drive documentation, or contact your Apple
  dealer.

- Dirty or scratched compact discs can cause your CD-ROM drive to perform
  poorly. Other symptoms include "Cannot Read" error messages and
  continual spinning of the CD-ROM (which appears to cause the computer to
  freeze). Make sure the bottom surface of the Encarta Encyclopedia discs
  are clean and undamaged.

-----------------------------------------
4. SCREEN SIZES AND COLOR CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------------

How to make Encarta 98 Encyclopedia look its best:

- Encarta Encyclopedia checks to ensure that your computer's monitor is
  set for at least 256 colors. If your monitor is set to a lower
  configuration, and if the settings can be adjusted to 256 colors, the
  encyclopedia prompts you to change the settings.

- Encarta Encyclopedia will run on any 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch) or
  higher resolution Macintosh compatible monitor, although Encarta's video
  clips and still images look best in 16-bit color (thousands of colors)
  or 24-bit color (millions of colors).

  NOTE: If your computer is set to use 24-bit color (millions of colors),
  encyclopedia performance is slower and Encarta Encyclopedia uses memory
  more quickly. If your Macintosh is set to this color mode and you get
  out-of-memory messages, you can increase the amount of memory Encarta
  Encyclopedia requests. Just click the Microsoft Encarta 98 icon, choose
  Get Info from the File menu, and then change the preferred size under
  "Memory Requirements."

- Encarta Encyclopedia is not designed to run in black and white, 16
  colors, or on monitors that display less than 640x480 pixels, for
  example, Color Classics, most PowerBooks and all 12-inch Apple
  monitors.

-------------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
-------------------

Audio problems and solutions:

If sounds do not play or are interrupted, check the following:

- Sounds will be inaudible if the sound level is turned down to far. To
  set the sound level, open the Sound control panel and adjust the speaker
  volume to a comfortable sound level. If you set the sound level to
  maximum, you may get sound distortion. If you have external speakers,
  ensure that they are connected properly and turned on. You can usually
  adjust sound level with the external speaker volume knob as well as with
  the Sound Control Panel.

- If Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds may be choppy. When Virtual
  Memory is turned on, sounds are sometimes temporarily stored on the hard
  disk rather than in physical RAM. For the best performance, turn off
  Virtual Memory. To turn off, from the Apple menu, choose Control Panels,
  and then choose Memory. In the Memory Control Panel, click the Off
  button under Virtual Memory. Then restart your computer.

  NOTE: You must have enough RAM to run your system software, Encarta
  Encyclopedia, and any other applications you want with Virtual Memory
  turned off. Also note that it may not be appropriate to turn off Virtual
  Memory on a Power Macintosh. Please see your Apple documentation for
  more information about Power Macintoshes and Virtual Memory.

- In low memory situations, sounds may not load or play. If you cannot get
  a sound to play and you are sure that the Sound Control Panel is set
  correctly, or if you are receiving error messages, you may need to
  allocate more memory to Encarta Encyclopedia. See the MEMORY USE section
  for suggestions improving memory management.

- Some encyclopedia sounds are stored on the disc in a compressed format.
  To play these sounds, the sound must be read from the disc, and then
  decompressed. Older or slower Macintoshes (such as the Macintosh IIci
  and Macintosh LC III) may experience interruptions in audio playback.

- Version 1.5.1 of Connectix RAM Doubler has a known bug that prevents
  audio and video clips from playing properly on Power Macintosh models.
  To obtain upgrade information, contact Connectix Corporation. For RAM
  Doubler support see http://www.connectix.com.

- There are some incompatibilites with Now Menus and Encarta Encyclopedia
  audio. Avoid adjusting the volume of the audio via the Now Menus
  customized menus while Encarta Encyclopedia is running. For Now Menus
  support see http://www.nowsoft.com.

-------------------------
6. PRINTING AND COPYING
-------------------------

How to print and copy information from Encarta 98 Encyclopedia:

You can print or copy from any article within Encarta Encyclopedia by
selecting a range of text and choosing the appropriate command from the
Edit menu.  To paste images and text together into your word processor -
use the Paset Special command found in most word processor's Edit menus.

- If you are planning to paste the text into your word processor, you may
  switch to it via the tools submenu under Features from the Main Article
  screen. If you have choosen a word processor in the Encarta
  Encyclopedia preferences, it will be opened for you. If you have not
  picked a word processor, SimpleText will open. If you have choosen a
  word processor in your preferences and it doesn't open or SimpleText
  opens, then there is something preventing your word processor from
  launching. See Section 2 on memory use to make sure there is enough free
  RAM for your word processor. If your computer has sufficient RAM
  available check to see that your word processor launches when you double
  click the icon.

If you find that printed text is improperly formatted or that special
characters do not print correctly, try the following:

- Turn off background printing. Encarta Encyclopedia stores custom
  TrueType fonts within the application. This allows Encarta Encyclopedia
  access to these custom fonts without taking up space on your computer's
  hard drive. However, because many printer drivers start a separate
  application to print jobs in the background, printing errors may result
  when background printing is turned on. To turn off background printing,
  from the Apple menu, choose Chooser, click the active printer, and then
  click the Off button under background printing.

  NOTE: If you install the Encarta Encyclopedia fonts, background printing
  is fully supported. To install these fonts, start the Installer on the
  Encarta Encyclopedia disc 1, choose Customize from the popup menu,
  select Encarta TrueType Fonts, and then press RETURN.

--------------------
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------

Known problems and ways to work around them:

The following is an overview of problems you may encounter using Encarta
Encyclopedia:

- Wrong or Multiple Versions of QuickTime

  During installation, the Installer checks the versions of QuickTime and
  Sound Manager present on your Macintosh, and, if necessary, replaces
  them with newer versions. However, the Installer cannot remove older
  versions if you or another installer program have renamed them. For
  example, if you renamed an older version of QuickTime to "Old
  QuickTime", the Encarta 98 Installer would install a newer version of
  QuickTime, but would not find and remove the older version.

  The same would happen if another installer application placed a file
  named "QuickTime 2.0" in the Extensions folder. The only QuickTime files
  found in the Extensions folder should be named, QuickTime, QuickTime
  PowerPlug (Power Mac only), QuickTime Musical Instruments and QuickTime
  Settings. To fix this problem, manually remove any renamed copies of
  these system components and restart your Macintosh. Encarta Encyclopedia
  will not start unless QuickTime 2.5 is installed and enabled.

- If you are having difficulty launching Encarta, it may be because 32-bit
  addressing is turned off. To turn on 32-bit addressing, from the Apple
  menu, choose Control Panels, and then choose Memory. In the Memory
  Control Panel, click the On button for 32-bit addressing. Then restart
  your computer.

- Problems Running Encarta on System 7.0

  Due to an incompatibility among Microsoft Encarta, Apple Guide 2.0, and
  versions of System 7.0, access to the Encarta Guide from within the
  Encarta Encyclopedia application has been disabled with this
  configuration. To fix this problem, upgrade to System 7.1 or later.

- When you copy images or articles from Encarta, they sometimes contain
  both text and pictures. Microsoft Word and Adobe PageMaker don't allow
  you to use the Paste command if the Clipboard contains both text and
  images. Instead, use the Paste Special command, then choose whether you
  wish to paste the text or picture.

- Difficulty installing Encarta Encyclopedia or changing Encarta's memory
  partition -- To minimize the number of extensions that Microsoft
  Encarta Encyclopedia must install in your computer's System Folder, the
  encyclopedia has several built-in PowerPC shared libraries. These
  libraries can stay open even after you quit the application. As a
  result, you should restart your Macintosh if you want to delete the
  Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia application or edit the application's
  memory partition sizes in Get Info.

- Do not use the control strip to change monitor resolution settings while
  Encarta is running because there are conflicts between the control strip
  and Shockwave.

- Speak Article isn't reading the articles or has a choppy voice.

  All the Apple PlainTalk components must be installed for Speak Article
  to work properly. If Speak Article is silent - reinstall Encarta 98
  Encyclopedia from CD 1.

  If you have a Macintosh with a 68030 processor (such as an LCIII) there
  are other voices that may sound better. Try Ben, Boris, Brenda, Mariel,
  Marvin, Mr. Hughes, Otis, Robovox, Votron, or Xeno.

- Internet Connections

  Depending on your Internet connection, it may take up to several minutes
  for your browser to successfully connect with a site that you have
  launched from the Internet Directory. Wait to see if the connection is
  successful before you initiate another link. Attempting to connect with
  multiple Internet sites simultaneously is not recommended.

Additional updated troubleshooting information is available for Encarta
Encyclopedia on the World Wide Web. You can use the Encarta Encyclopedia
Help page, which contains the latest information about using and

8. SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT ENCARTA 98 ENCYCLOPEDIA AND THE INTERNET
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

How Encarta Encyclopedia uses Internet Config to access the Internet:

To use the World Wide Web Links in Encarta Encyclopedia, you need access
to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

You may already have an ISP through your employer or academic institution.
However, if you want to use the Internet for personal use, you may need to
find an ISP that sells Internet access to the general public. If you use
an ISP with proprietary software, be sure to ask if they have a Macintosh
version - some are Windows only - and find out if the Macintosh version
has similar features to the Windows version.

Most Macintosh users access the Internet with their modem through a SLIP
or PPP account using a freeware control panel. There also are commercial
versions, and Apple has recently released its own PPP control panel
designed for use with Open Transport 1.1.2 or later. You will use SLIP or
PPP based upon the software you use and which protocol your ISP supports.
PPP is the more flexible protocol and has lately become more prevalent.
These accounts enable you to run graphic Internet applications that work
and feel like Macintosh applications should. If your computer has enough
memory, you can run several Internet programs concurrently with Encarta
Encyclopedia.

Setting up a SLIP/PPP control panel and configuring the MacTCP or the
TCP/IP control panel (included with Open Transport in System 7.5.2 and
later) can be a bit overwhelming. Your ISP should walk you through this
process, providing critical information including DNS addresses and search
domains, as well as the essential phone numbers and modem settings to get
you up and running.

When Encarta Encyclopedia launches an Internet application, the browser
assumes that you have a TCP/IP connection already established. Some
SLIP/PPP control panels automatically dial up and initiate a session when
you launch an Internet application, but often the time lag required for
dialing and negotiating the connection exceeds the timeout on the request.
So it's a good idea to connect to your ISP before you use the Encarta
Encyclopedia Internet Directory or other encyclopedia features that
connect you to the Internet.

Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, it may take several
minutes for your Web browser to connect to a site that you've launched
from Encarta Encyclopedia. You should wait to see if the connection is
successful before attempting to initiate another link. Attempting to
connect with multiple Internet sites simultaneously is not recommended.

Encarta Encyclopedia uses software called Internet Config to determine
which Web browser should be used to connect to the Web. If you aren't
currently using Internet Config, it will be installed for you when you run
the Encarta 98 Installer. Also your Internet Preferences will be preset to
use Internet Explorer to handle the following Internet resource types: Web
(http), FTP (ftp), Gopher (gopher), Email (mailto) and Usenet News Groups
(news). If you want to use a different browser or override any of these
defaults, you can start the Internet Config application and change the
Helper application for that resource type. Internet Explorer 3.01 is
available for you to install from your Encarta Research Organizer disk.

NOTE: For more information on Internet Config, please see the user
documentation provided in the Internet Config 1.3 folder.

Tips on downloading Encarta updates:

To keep your encyclopedia current, you should connect to the Encarta Web
site every month to download new installments of Yearbook updates, Web
Links and the Month in Review. Each monthly update file is free. You can
download the updates to your hard disk and integrate them into the Encarta
Encyclopedia. The Encarta Installer copies a sample update installment -
July 1997 - that you can display right away and use to become familiar
with these update features.

In-depth instructions for downloading updates are provided within the
Downloads screen. However, here are some tips on streamlining the
downloading process on your Macintosh:

- When you click to download an update file in your Web browser, Internet
  Config can identify Encarta update files based on the file extension and
  set the file's type and creator. Next it automatically launches Encarta
  98 Encyclopedia to integrate the update. The file mapping entry for this
  feature is included in the preconfigured Internet Preferences and
  Internet Explorer preferences installed on your computer's hard drive.
  If you're already using Internet Config, Encarta 98 Encyclopedia
  automatically adds this file mapping entry to your existing Internet
  Preferences file the first time you launch Encarta. If you use an
  Internet Config application like Internet Explorer or Anarchie,
  downloading updates is as simple as clicking the filename, waiting for
  the file to download, and following the directions displayed on your
  screen.

  NOTE: If you use a Web browser that isn't fully Internet Config enabled,
  you need to save the file in the Updates folder (in the Encarta 98
  Encyclopedia folder on your hard drive), and then integrate the update
  using the Integrate button on the Downloads screen. If you want to
  connect by typing a URL into your browser, you will need to connect to:

     http://encarta.msn.com/teleport/fromCD98/download.asp

- Encarta updates should be downloaded with binary encoding, not plain
  text. Most Web browsers and FTP clients default to this mode.

- The same update files are used for both the Windows and Macintosh
  versions of Encarta 98 Encyclopedia Deluxe Edition. Since the update
  file is internally compressed and has no resource fork, you don't need
  to use StuffIt Expander to decompress or decode the archives posted
  online.

- Make sure you have enough free disk space to download and integrate the
  update file. In the process of integrating the update, Encarta will
  decompress and copy the information within the update file to several
  internal databases, then delete the original file when the integration
  is complete. Consequently, you need enough free space on your computer's
  hard disk for at least two complete copies of the update file.

- Be sure to only download update files for the North American version of
  Encarta 98 Encyclopedia Deluxe Edition. Update files for Encarta 96 or
  97 Encyclopedia, Standard or International releases can not be
  integrated with content on your encyclopedia CD-ROMs.

- If your computer doesn't have enough memory to run both Encarta 98 and a
  web browser at the same time, you can still update your encyclopedia.

  To do so, please follow these instructions:

  1. Connect to http://encarta.msn.com/teleport/fromCD98/downloads.asp

  2. Find the month you are interested and double click to start download.

  3. If you are using Internet Explorer 3.01 and it attempts to
     automatically launch Encarta, you will need to "disassociate" the
     file type since Internet Explorer and Encarta are designed to work
     together. To do this, simply go to your browser preferences list, and
     select the File Helpers control panel. Then delete the "Yearbook
     Update" description from the list. You should now be able to download
     without automatically launching Encarta.

How to choose a Browser with Internet Config:

If Internet Config is not set up properly, you may see the following error
message:

  Internet Config is not properly installed. Please launch Internet
  Config and ensure that you have a valid helper application selected
  for this Internet resource type.

Or you may click an Internet Link in Encarta Encyclopedia and have nothing
happen.

If this happens, use Internet Config to select your HTTP Helper
application. To select the helper application, use the following
procedure.

1. Find and open the Internet Config 1.3 folder on your computer's hard
  drive.

2. Double-click the Internet Config application icon.

3. In the Window menu, choose the Helpers item.
