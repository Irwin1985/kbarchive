MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xii: About the CD-ROMs Section Mentions Items That Do Not Exist
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Several items mentioned in the section titled "About the CD-ROMs" are not
included on the companion disc.

Corrections:
Page xii, paragraph 2, sentence 2:
Change: "...contains the files, simulations, and course Web page needed..."
To: "...contains the files and simulations needed..."

Page xii, paragraph 5:
Remove paragraph beginning with "The Supplemental Course Material..."

Page xii, paragraph 6:
Remove paragraph beginning with "Many of the demonstrations..."


Page 16: Typo
-------------

On page 16, under "Designing Your Network Using Directory Services", in the third

Pentium


Page 27: Text Correction
------------------------

Page 27, third paragraph:
Change: "If you want to participate on the Internet you must use a unique IP
addresses."
To: "If you want to participate on the Internet you must use a unique IP
address."


Page 40: Corrections to text in last paragraph
----------------------------------------------

In order to make question 2, on page 43, and the corresponding answer on page
605, clearly understood, the last paragraph on page 40 will need to be changed.

Change the last paragraph, starting at the second sentence, from:
"Generally, you can calculate the amount of RAM required for an account database
as 2.5 times the size of the database. The following table shows some examples
of RAM requirements for different database sizes."

To:
"Generally, you can calculate the minimum amount of RAM required for an account
database as 2.5 times the size of the database. The following table shows some
general guidelines for RAM requirements for different database sizes."


Page 41: Label table as Hardware Guidelines
-------------------------------------------

The table at the top of page 41 needs to be labeled as "Hardware Guidelines" to
correspond with references to it on page 605.


Page 43: The answer to question 2 is based on Hardware Guidelines
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2 on page 43 should be modified so that the answer is based on the
Hardware Guidelines rather than the formula 2.5 times the size of the database.

Change:
"Based on the hardware used, what is the largest directory database file size?"

To:
"Based on the hardware used, and the Hardware Guidelines, what is the largest
directory database file size?"


Page 44: Text Clarification
---------------------------

Page 44, under the subheading Designing The Directory Services Structure For
Miller Textiles:

The four primary sites are Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Portland. Corporate
headquarters is located in Boston.


Page 47: Additional text needed to clarify exercise
---------------------------------------------------

Additional text is necessary to clarify the exercise on pages 46 and 47.

Add the following text to the end of the first paragraph on page 47:
"This region supports 20,000 users; 6,000 are in Singapore, the others are
distributed evenly among subsidiaries."

Add hint to the bottom of the page.
[HINT]: Singapore is considered both headquarters and a subsidiary. Make sure you
don't count it twice.


Page 48: Regini.exe Should Not Be Listed Under Lesson Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------

On page 48, under the Lesson Summary section titled "For More Information",
Regini.exe is listed but has not been mentioned in Chapter 1. It is not
addressed until Chapter 3.
This reference should be deleted as it is already referenced in the Chapter 3,
Lesson 4, Summary.


Page 54: Question 3 refers to an Application Server
---------------------------------------------------

On page 54, in question 3, change the wording to alleviate confusion between a
File and Print Servers and an Application Servers.

Change:
"What resource has the greatest impact on an application file server's system
performance?"

To:
"What resource has the greatest impact on an application server's system
performance?"


Page 58: Yes Is The Default Value For Domain Controllers Only
-------------------------------------------------------------

On page 58, the second paragrah under "Configure the Computer as Follows" should
state that Yes is the default value for a Primary Domain Controller or a Backup
Domain Controller. The default value for NT Server running as "Stand Alone" is
Auto.

Change:
"Yes is the default value on a computer running Windows NT Server."

To:
"Yes is the default value on a computer running Windows NT Server as a Primary
Domain Controller or a Backup Domain Controller."


Page 64: Diagram Correction
---------------------------

Diagram on page 64:

Change: "Domain A"
To: "Network segment A"

Change: "Domain B"
To: "Network segment B"

Change: "Domain C"
To: "Network segment C"


Page 73: Misplaced illustration
-------------------------------

The illustration on page 73 is a duplicate of the illustration on page 155, and
is not applicable to the surrounding text.


Page 82: Text Errors
--------------------

Page 82, paragraph 6, sentence 2:
Change: "...only if they belong to a trusting domain."
To: "...only if they belong to a trusted domain."

In the last sentence of the first paragraph, change "trusted domain", to
"trusting domain".
Sentence should read:
"Members of this group can administer the domain, the servers and workstations of
the domain, and a trusting domain that has added the Domain Admins global group
from this domain to the Administrators local group in the trusting domain."


Page 104: Text Correction
-------------------------

Page 104, question 6:
Change: "If a user logs on to a domain that has System Policy Editor, but System
Policy Editor has not been defined for that user, what happens next?"
To: "If a user logs on to a domain that has system policy, but system policy has
not been defined for that user, what happens next?"


Page 110: Diagram needs suitable labeling of objects
----------------------------------------------------

On page 110, the diagram of the Synchronization Process should include
appropriate labeling so that the description above the diagram is easier to
understand.


Page 115: Diagram mislabeled
----------------------------

On Page 115, in the diagram at the top of the page, the domain controller on the
left, where arrows 1 and 3 end, has been wrongly labeled as BDC. It should be
PDC.


Page 123: First group in diagram should be Administrators
---------------------------------------------------------

On Page 123, in the diagram toward the bottom of the page, the first local group
in the shaded list on the left is shown as Administration. It should be
Administrators.


Page 126: In the illustration, the domain on the left should be Trusted not Trusting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the illustration on page 126, both domains are labeled as Trusting. The domain
on the left should be the Trusted Domain.


Page 155: Change Text for Bottom Illustration
---------------------------------------------

Change the text on the bottom of page 155, under the illustration to read:

All subdirectories of the export directory are replicated. Place your export
files in the correct subdirectory. Note that files in the export directory
itself will not be relocated.


Page 164: Text Correction
-------------------------

Page 164, under the subheading Windows 95 Tools:
Change: "Server Manager for Domains."
To: "Server Manager."


Page 172: Typos
---------------

The last bulleted item on page 172 contains two typos.
Change:
"If there is no Client or Scope level settings for a DHCP Option, then the Global
level settings will take affect."

To:
"If there are no Client or Scope level settings for a DHCP Option, then the
Global level settings will take effect."


Page 177: Question revisions
----------------------------

Page 177, question 1:
Change: "List two disadvantages of using TCP/IP and two advantages of using
DHCP."
To: "List two disadvantages of using static TCP/IP addresses and two advantages
of using DHCP assigned addresses."

Answer to question 2 is not covered in the material.
The answer to question 2 is IPCONFIG. However, IPCONFIG is not discussed in the
lesson.

The following information should be added to the lesson material:
To view IP information on a Windows NT client, use the IPCONFIG utility.


Page 178: Questions not covered in material and not answered
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 178, the second part of question 5 is not covered in the material and is
not answered in the back of the book on page 616.

Question 6 is also not covered in the material and is not answered in the back of
the book on page 616.


Page 191: Question 1 Should Say NetBIOS Instead of NWLink
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 191, in Question 1, change NWLink to NetBIOS. This also needs to be
changed on page 617, where the question is listed again with the answer.

Change:
"How is WINS used with NWLink?"

To:
"How is WINS used with NetBIOS?"


Page 210: Misplaced illustration
--------------------------------

The illustration at the top of page 210 should be move to replace the
illustration at the bottom of the page. The illustration on the bottom of page
210 is a duplicate of the illustration on page 211. The appropriate illustration
will then need to be inserted above the text on page 210.


Page 278: Contradiction
-----------------------

The first bullet point on page 278 states that if the Pages/sec value has
extended periods with the number of pages per second over five, memory may be a
bottleneck in the system. The chart on page 279 states that the acceptable
average range of pages/sec is 0-20.

Strictly speaking, the chart on page 279 is correct. However, in general the
value should be much lower than 20. 5 pages/sec is a better target to shoot
for.


Page 287: Text Correction
-------------------------

Page 287, first paragraph:
Change: "To full understand how to find network bottlenecks"
To: "To fully understand how to find network bottlenecks"


Page 289: Typographical Error

Change: "Mulitipy A by B"
To: "Multiply A by B"


Page 328: Table Items Out of Place
----------------------------------

The second item in the table on page 328 is out of place. This line needs to be
shifted to the left.

The second item under Function should be Remote Capturing. The second item under
Network Monitor (Simple) should be Not available. The second item under Network
Monitor (Full) should be Yes.


Page 365: Typo in Question 10
-----------------------------

On page 365, in question 10, delete the first "this".

Change:
"How much traffic was generated by this resolving this name?"

To:
"How much traffic was generated by resolving this name?"


Page 420: Text correction
-------------------------

The "Hint" in #4 should be changed from:
"Hint: check HTTP: Request Method in frame 6."

To:
"Hint: check the lower third of the Summary window for frame 6."

The "Hint" in #5 should be changed from:
"Hint: check HTTP: Uniform Resource Identifier in frame 6."
To:
"Hint: check the lower third of the Summary window for frame 6."

error was logged in the Event Log, but Windows NT completed startup.

would be logged in the Event Log, but Windows NT would complete startup
anyway."


Page 570: Text Correction
-------------------------

Page 570, last paragraph:
Change: "Local Security Administration (Lsass.exe)"
To: "Local Security Authority Subsystem (Lsass.exe)"


Page 590: Typo in Note
----------------------
