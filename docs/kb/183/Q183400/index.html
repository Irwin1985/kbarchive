The events shown above may be, but are not necessarily, a result of a corrupted
information store. Consequently, in some cases the suggested option does not
repair the problem associated with the event log ID and description. If the
suggested test does not resolve the problem, Microsoft Technical Support will
direct you to other diagnostic methods.
