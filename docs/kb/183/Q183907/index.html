The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.0a, 7.5

SYMPTOMS
========

The time on your Windows 95 or Windows NT system may change at the wrong time
when exiting Daylight Saving time. Typically this would be noticed when using
Microsoft Schedule+ v7.x, which may incorrectly report appointment times being
out by an hour during the month of March.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Schedule+ and Outlook (Win16) maintains its own time zone table, independent of
the time zone information within Windows 95 and Windows NT. The transition dates
for daylight saving are stored within the Windows 95 and the Windows NT
registries. These dates may require updating from time to time when local
governments or authorities make changes to Daylight Saving Time transition dates
&amp; times.

As an example, the Daylight Saving Time transition times for the end of Daylight
Saving in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra (Australian Eastern Time) were changed
in 1995, from the beginning of March to the last Sunday in March. This has also
recently occurred in Adelaide.

When the "Automatically Adjust for Daylight Saving Time" checkbox is selected the
additional hour that is added to operating system's offset to GMT is removed
when the transition date and time is reached.

This article provides you with the information to update all Australian time
zones as detailed below, and provides the tools to make further adjustments:

  LOCATION       DAYLIGHT SAVING START      DAYLIGHT SAVING END
  Adelaide       Last Sunday Oct.        Last Sunday Mar.
  Hobart         First Sunday Oct.       Last Sunday Mar.
  Sydney         Last Sunday Oct.        Last Sunday Mar.
  Melbourne      Last Sunday Oct.        Last Sunday Mar.
  Canberra       Last Sunday Oct.        Last Sunday Mar.
  Perth          Does not participate in Daylight Saving
  Brisbane       Does not participate in Daylight Saving
  Darwin         Does not participate in Daylight Saving

Time zone transition details for all international time zones on each workstation
in any given location within an organization should be correct on all computers.
This is of particular significance to those who travel across time zone
boundaries.

Schedule+ and Outlook (Win16 platform) use their own internal time zone
information, and require the time zone information supplied by the operating
system to be identical to that which they supply. When the time zone information
between the operating system and Schedule+ conflicts, appointments may appear at
a time difference of an hour to when they actually are scheduled. If your
environment uses only Outlook (32-bit), and your operating system time zone is
correct, then this problem should not exist.


Important: Please note that if the system time is changed through the Date/Time
utility in Control Panel, between the hours of 01:00 and 02:00 on the day of a
scheduled Daylight Saving Time transition, the system time will change again at
02:00.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5, 3.51,
4.0, Windows 95 and Schedule+ 7.0, 7.5.You may be required to perform one of the
actions below to ensure Daylight Saving times are correct on your machines so
you do not experience any anomalies with scheduled appointments appearing an
hour earlier or later than they should appear.

Windows NT:
-----------

- You can use the graphical TZEDIT tool to interactively modify the daylight
  savings start &amp; end date for an existing time zone. This is available in
  the Windows NT Resource Kit Supplement 2.

-or-

- A supported fix, TZ-NT.EXE which is available from
  http://www.microsoft.com.au/download/timezone/tz-nt.zip in the form of an
  executable program that may be run within Windows Explorer, from the command
  line, or called from within a logon script. This program will set the
  Australian Daylight Saving Time transition dates and times to the values in
  the table above. You can also obtain those solutions by contacting Microsoft
  Technical Support in Australia on 13 20 58.

Windows 95:
-----------

1. You can use the graphical TZEDIT tool to interactively modify the Daylight
  Saving Time start and end date for an existing time zone. This is available
  on the Windows 95 OSR2 compact disc. For more information, please see the
  following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q158195 Time Zone Editor Available on OEM Service Release 2 CD-ROM

-or-

2. TZ-INF.EXE can provide the facility to correct the problem in an unattended
  mode. It is available at:

  http://www.microsoft.com.au/download/timezone/tz-inf.zip

  Instructions on how to apply this update are provided within this file.

-or-

3. A supported fix, TZ_WIN95X.EXE is available from:

  http://www.microsoft.com.au/download/timezone/tz_win9x.zip

  This fix is in the form of a setup program that you can execute within Windows
  Explorer, from the command line, or inside a logon script. This program will
  set the Australian Daylight Saving Time transition dates and times to the
  values in the table above.

The previously mentioned solutions can also be obtained by contacting Microsoft
Technical Support in Australia on 13 20 58.

Schedule+:
----------

1. Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0a. A
  support fix is available for Schedule+ 7.0a, but has not been fully
  regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
  specific problem. Unless you are specifically impacted by this problem,
  Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange version
  4.0 Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
  for supply of this hotfix.

2. Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ 7.5. This
  problem has been corrected in the Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 2 for
  Microsoft Exchange version 5.0. This service pack is available from:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg5.0/SP2

NOTE: The above address key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

Outlook 97:
-----------

You will not experience any problem in Outlook for the Win16 platform with the
wrong Daylight Saving Time transition dates that are described in this article.
Because it works from internal Daylight Saving Time tables, much the same as
Schedule+, these tables have the potential to get outdated. Future changes to
Daylight Saving Time transition dates and times should be monitored closely.
