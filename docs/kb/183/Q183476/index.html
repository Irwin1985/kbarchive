SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 includes an updated version of the Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service that was included with Microsoft Internet
Information Server version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Newly Exposed Functionality in SMTP
-----------------------------------

The Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 release of the SMTP service includes the
following new functionality:

- SMTP supports the ETRN and authenticated TURN commands for dequeuing mail
  over dial-up connections.

- SMTP supports multiple virtual servers, or sites.

Perform the following steps to enable this functionality:

1. Create a text file with the following text:

        set obj = GetObject ( "IIS://localhost/smtpsvc" )
        obj.Put "SmtpServiceVersion", 2
        obj.SetInfo

  NOTE: This is an Active Directory Service Interface (ADSI) script that updates
  a value in the metabase:

2. Save this file as Enable.vbs.

3. From a command prompt, type the following and then press ENTER:

  cscript enable.vbs


Holding Mail for Hosts with Dial-up Connections
-----------------------------------------------

Microsoft SMTP service can queue mail for SMTP hosts that only connect
periodically to the service to send and download messages. There are two
mechanisms by which a host such as Microsoft Exchange 5.5 can dequeue mail that
is being held for it: ETRN and authenticated TURN. Which of these is used
depends mainly on how the connecting host receives its IP address: if the
connecting host has a static IP address, ETRN is the method of choice; whereas,
if the connecting host has a dynamically allocated IP address (obtained through
DHCP), authenticated TURN is preferable.

Configuring ETRN for a Remote Domain
------------------------------------

When using the ETRN command, a host making a dial-up connection opens an SMTP
session with Microsoft SMTP Service, issues the ETRN command, and closes the
session (but not the connection). Microsoft SMTP Service then obtains the
(static) IP addresses for the domains on the ETRN command from DNS, opens new
SMTP sessions back to those domains, and sends the queued mail over those
sessions. You can indicate that mail for a given domain is to be held for ETRN
by following the following steps.

NOTE: This feature is not available in SMTP Service Manager (HTML).

To Enable ETRN Transmissions for a Remote Domain:

1. In Internet Service Manager, right-click the Domains container, point to New,
  and then click Domain.

2. Use the New Domain wizard to create a new remote domain.

3. Click the Domain Properties property sheet for the domain.

4. Under Remote, click Queue messages for Remote Triggered Delivery.

Configuring Authenticated TURN for a Remote Domain
--------------------------------------------------

When using the authenticated TURN command to dequeue mail, a host makes a dial-up
connection, opens an SMTP session, authenticates to Microsoft SMTP service,
issues the TURN command, and leaves the session open. Microsoft SMTP Service
then "turns" the existing SMTP session (rather than opening a new one) and sends
the queued mail to the connecting host in that session. The domains whose
messages are dequeued are determined from the account ID of the connecting host
obtained during the authentication process.

You create a domain for authenticated TURN in the same way you create one for
ETRN.

NOTE: This feature is not available in SMTP Service Manager (HTML).

To Enable Authenticated TURN Transmissions for a Remote Domain:

1. In Internet Service Manager, right-click the Domains container, point to New,
  and then click Domain.

2. Use the New Domain wizard to create a new remote domain.

3. Click the Domain Properties property sheet for the domain.

4. Under Remote, click Queue messages for Remote Triggered Delivery.

To Set the Account ID that can TURN a Domain:

In order to enable authenticated TURN, you must set the correspondence between
the account ID of the host that will be dequeuing the mail and the domains that
it is allowed to dequeue. This is done by running an ADSI script that sets the
appropriate values in the metabase. For each domain that is to be TURNed, you
must:

1. Set AuthTurnList with the username of the account authorized to TURN.

2. Set RouteAction to the value "514" to enable authenticated TURN support.

The following ADSI script creates a domain (TEST.com) in the SMTP server instance
number two and sets it up to be turned by an account named TESTSERVER. (This
script assumes that you have not created the domain yet.)

     Dim DomainContainerObj, NewDomainObj
     Dim domainName, domainPath, serverInstance, userName
     serverInstance = "2"
     domainName = "test.com"
     userName = "testserver"
     domainPath = "IIS://LocalHost/SMTPSVC/" &amp; serverInstance &amp; "/domain"
     Set DomainContainerObj = GetObject(domainPath)
     Set NewDomObj = DomainContainerObj.Create ("IIsSmtpDomain", domainName)
     NewDomObj.KeyType = "IIsSmtpDomain"
     NewDomObj.Put "AuthTURNList", userName
     NewDomObj.Put "RouteAction", 514
     NewDomObj.SetInfo

Creating and Identifying SMTP Sites
-----------------------------------

You can create multiple SMTP sites in Microsoft SMTP Service. This section
describes how to create, identify, and delete sites.

About SMTP Sites
----------------

You can configure your system to include several physical servers that run
Microsoft SMTP Service. After the servers are set up, you can manage them
through Internet Service Manager by setting up an SMTP site for each server. You
can also set up multiple sites on one computer to manage resources on one
physical server. This allows you to set different administrative and security
options for the domains configured for the site.

Setup creates a default site for Microsoft SMTP Service. You can change the name
of the default site and any others that you create.

Use the property sheets to configure site options. You can then use the Domain
Properties property sheet to override some settings for specific domains. These
options are described in other sections of the documentation.

Creating an SMTP Site
---------------------

You can use the New SMTP Site Wizard to create a new site. Using the wizard, you
can name the site, set a port and IP address, identify the default directory
location, and designate the default domain. The wizard creates a site using
default settings. If you want to configure the site differently, use the
property sheets to change the settings.

NOTE: Depending on your configuration, you may not be able to use the same
inbound port for a new site. If you use an IP address for a new site that is
already being used for another site, you must designate a different port for the
new site. If you have different IP addresses for each site, you can use the same
port for each site. The SMTP site will fail to start if you have duplicate IP
addresses and duplicate port settings. You can identify the port on the SMTP
Site property sheet.

To Create an SMTP Site:

1. In Internet Service Manager, expand the directory hierarchy and select an
  existing SMTP site.

2. On the Action menu, point to New, and then click Site.

3. Follow the instructions in the New SMTP Site Wizard to set up the site.

4. Configure the site.

Renaming an SMTP Site
---------------------

Each SMTP site has a display name in Internet Service Manager. The default SMTP
site name is assigned during Setup. When you create a site, you designate the
display name in the wizard. You can change a site name using the following
steps.

To Rename an SMTP Site:

1. Select the site you want to rename.

2. Click the SMTP Site property sheet.

3. In the Description box, type a new site name.

Designating an SMTP Site IP Address
-----------------------------------

Each SMTP site has an IP address. The address differs depending on your hardware
configuration. If you have one physical server with multiple sites, you can use
the same IP address for all sites. However, the TCP port must be different for
each site. Alternatively, you can have multiple physical servers, each with a
separate site in Internet Service Manager. In this case, you must have different
IP addresses for the sites. You can then use the same TCP port for more than one
site because the IP address is different for each site.

To Designate an IP Address:

1. Select the site you want to configure.

2. Click the SMTP Site property sheet.

3. In the IP address box, select the IP address for the site. The site can
  respond to connection requests for all IP addresses configured on the
  computer.

Deleting an SMTP Site
---------------------

You can remove any site other than the default site. If you designated a custom
location for the Microsoft SMTP Service default directories during Setup, those
directories also need to be deleted or moved. There are several default
directories set up for each site. For the default site, these are placed in the
Mailroot folder by default during Setup.

NOTE: Before deleting a site, pause Microsoft SMTP Service so the delivery queues
can be cleared and queued messages can be delivered. If you do not clear the
queues before deleting a site, undelivered messages remain in the default
folders for the site. In this instance, you must manually move messages to a
different location for processing.

To Delete an SMTP Site:

1. In Internet Service Manager, expand the directory hierarchy and select the
  SMTP site that you want to delete.

2. On the Action menu, click Delete.

3. Delete or move the Microsoft SMTP Service default folders for the site you
  removed.
