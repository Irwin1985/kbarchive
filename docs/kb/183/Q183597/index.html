-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have more than one information service in your user profile that
supports the same address type and the highest listed information service is
either offline or not functioning, outbound messages may appear to be stuck in
the outbox.

This problem is usually seen with Internet (SMTP) messages.

CAUSE
=====

Recipient addresses for outbound messages are processed by information services
that are stored in the client profile and listed under Tools/Services/Delivery.
When an e-mail message is addressed, the client checks the Delivery list to see
which services match the address type of the message.

For Internet (SMTP) messages, there are three possible information services that
could be matched for sending mail. They are:

- Microsoft Exchange Transport (and Microsoft Exchange Remote Transport)

- Microsoft Mail if there is an SMTP or AT&amp;T mail gateway installed on the
  Mail server.

- Internet Mail if the client is used to connect to a POP3 server to read mail
  and an SMTP server to send mail.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have a profile that has more than one information service that can
process the same message, you need to confirm that the service is functioning
properly or change the order in which the service is chosen.

Example:

You have a profile that has both Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Mail
information services and you want outbound Internet mail to go through Exchange
Server and not the Microsoft Mail SMTP Gateway.

1. From the Tools menu, choose Services and then Delivery.

2. Use the up and down arrows to move the Microsoft Exchange Transport so that
  it is higher than the Microsoft Mail service.

Outbound SMTP mail should now default to the Exchange server and not Microsoft
Mail.

Note: This behavior is not limited only to SMTP. Other protocols such as X.400
can also have multiple paths.

If you have a need to use two different information services at different times
you can create additional profiles for each service that you wish to use.
