-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 95-based or Windows NT-based computer that is configured with multiple
default gateways may be unable to connect to its logon server when the computer
starts.

CAUSE
=====

If the first default gateway is unavailable, the logon process does not trigger
dead gateway detection. Without a domain controller on the local network
segment, you are unable to log on to the domain.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Install and configure a domain controller on the local network segment.

- Install a routing protocol on your Windows NT-based computer, such as Routing
  Information Protocol (RIP) for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
  Protocol (TCP/IP) on Windows NT Server or Silent RIP for Windows NT
  Workstation. For more information, please see the following articles in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q172514 Silent RIP for IP Available for Windows NT Workstation

  Q169161 Registry Parameters for RIP for IP version 1

  NOTE: Silent RIP is not available for Windows 95.


- For Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 98-based computers, you can enable
  the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Internet Router Discovery
  Protocol (IRDP) packets on all of your routers. The following text is an
  excerpt from Request for Comments (RFC) 1256:

     The ICMP router discovery messages are called "Router
     Advertisements" and "Router Solicitations. " Each router
     periodically multicasts a Router Advertisement from each of its
     multicast interfaces, announcing the IP address(es) of that
     interface. Hosts discover the addresses of their neighboring
     routers simply by listening for advertisements.

  This is one way of testing for dead gateways. This solution requires that
  routers be configured to send IRDP packets, but currently has not been
  implemented in Windows NT 4.0. Windows 95 requires a Windows Socket update 2,
  while Windows 98 natively supports IRDP.


  For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q182108 Availability of Windows Sockets 2.0 for Windows 95

For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q223756 IRDP Client Support Added to Windows NT 4.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

Switching to the second gateway occurs only if there is already an existing
connection-oriented TCP session over the route to the first configured gateway.
Connectionless datagram-based traffic such as an ICMP or Network Basic
Input/Output System (NetBIOS) packet does not trigger the change to a secondary
gateway.

For more information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge base:

  Q128978 Dead Gateway Detection in TCP/IP for Windows NT

  Q171564 TCP/IP Dead Gateway Detection Algorithm Updated for Windows NT

You can obtain additional information from RFC 816, "Fault Isolation and
Recovery."
