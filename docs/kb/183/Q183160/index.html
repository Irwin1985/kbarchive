SYMPTOMS
========

When you create phone books using the Phone Book Administrator (PBA) on a
computer running Internet Explorer, certain countries or regions do not appear
in the Connection Manager list.

CAUSE
=====

When you update a phone book that contains a different country/region name than
the one included in the PBA, those countries or regions do not appear when you
use the 32-bit version of TAPI. This problem only occurs in a minority of cases
where the country or region name has changed recently. For example, Zaire
recently changed its name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This problem
occurs because Internet Explorer has a newer country/region file then TAPI or
Phone Book Administrator.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the hot fix described below or manually update the country/region codes by
performing the following steps:

Note: Updating the Country/Region List Connection Point Services included in
Windows NT 4 Option Pack can apply to the TAPI country/region list used by
Connection Point Services.

Note: You may want to edit the country or region list to reflect changes in
country/region names or country/region dialing codes. The TAPI dialing codes are
updated with each release. Therefore, you may want or need to edit the
Countries/Regions list supplied with Connection Point Services.

To add or edit a country/region:

1. For each country or region code you edit, change the related OP to another
  temporary country or region. Use the Connection Point Administration tool to
  edit each affected POP. Perform this step when you change country or region
  codes. If you are only editing the country/region name, you can skip this
  step.

2. Open your Phone Book database with Microsoft Access 95 or Access 97. This
  database is an Access MDB file stored in the Connection Point Admin
  directory. The file has the same Phone Book name as displayed in the
  Connection Point Administration tool.

3. Open the Datasheet view of the Country/Region table. This table contains two
  fields, CountryNumber and CountryName. The first is a unique integer value
  corresponding to the TAPI code. The CountryName is a 60-character text field
  that contains the country or region name. Values in the CountryName field are
  localized.

4. Find the country or region you want to edit, and change the value(s) of the
  data fields.

5. Close the Datasheet view of the Country/Region table and close the Phone Book
  database window.

6. Using the Connection Point Administration tool, assign each POP edited in
  step 1 to the correct country or region. Your new phone book releases will
  now contain the updated country/region names and country/region codes. A user
  will receive the updated country/region information with their next phone
  book update.

Country/Region Edits:

The following list of country/region entries should be updated. The current code
and country/region name is given followed by the correct values.

  Current                    Change To
  -------                    ---------
  3302, Monaco               377, Monaco
  298, Faroe Islands         298, Faeroe Islands
  853, Macao                 853, Macau SAR
  &lt;missing&gt;                  800, International Freephone Service
  &lt;missing&gt;                  870, INMARSAT
