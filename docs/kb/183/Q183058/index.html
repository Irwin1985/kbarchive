-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to modify the default display name and alias for
custom recipients that are created when you perform directory synchronization
(dirsync) between Lotus cc:Mail and Microsoft Exchange Server. When you migrate
users from cc:Mail to Exchange Server and these custom recipients are converted
to mailboxes, the display names and aliases for the custom recipients are
maintained.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Modifying the Display Name
--------------------------

When you perform dirsync between cc:Mail and Exchange Server, the default display
name for custom recipients that are created is the user's first name and last
name, separated by a space. To modify the display name that is used, follow
these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the "Dir Synch display name rule" registry value under the following
  key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC
     \Parameters

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Click String on the Edit menu, type a new rule, and then click OK. The
  following table lists the rules that can be used:

     Rule     Purpose
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     %&lt;n&gt;F    Includes the first &lt;n&gt; characters of the user's first name.
              If the &lt;n&gt; component is not used, the entire first name is
              included. For example, to include the first five characters
              of the first name, type "%5F" (without quotation marks). To
              include the entire first name, type "%F" (without quotation
              marks).

     %&lt;n&gt;L    Includes the first &lt;n&gt; characters of the user's last name.
              If the &lt;n&gt; component is not used, the entire first name is
              included. For example, to include the first five characters
              of the last name, type "%5L" (without quotation marks). To
              include the entire last name, type "%L" (without quotation
              marks).

     %I       Includes the user's middle initial.

     &lt;text&gt;   Includes &lt;text&gt;. For example, to include "cc:Mail User,"
              type "cc:Mail User" (without quotation marks). To include a
              space, press SPACE BAR. Note that this rule can only be
              used at the end of the string.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

Modifying the Alias
-------------------

When you perform dirsync between cc:Mail and Exchange Server, the default alias
for custom recipients that are created is the user's first name and the first
character of their last name. To modify the alias that is used, follow these
steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the "Dir Synch alias name rule" registry value under the following key
  in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC
     \Parameters

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Click String on the Edit menu, type a new rule, and then click OK. The table
  in the "Modifying the Display Name" section above lists the rules that can be
  used.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
