SUMMARY
=======

You can list Windows, including Child Windows, using the GetWindow API. However,
an application that calls GetWindow to perform this task risks being caught in
an infinite loop or referencing a handle to a window that has been destroyed.
Using EnumWindows for top-level Windows and EnumChildWindows for Child Windows
or EnumThreadWindows for all non-child windows associated with a thread is a
preferred method and is demonstrated in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

EnumWindows enumerates all top-level Windows, but not Child Windows. The
EnumChildWindows function does not enumerate top-level windows owned by the
specified window nor does it enumerate any other owned windows. The
EnumThreadWindows function enumerates all non-child windows associated with a
thread. This sample uses all three to list the Class and Title of Windows it
finds. Note that while all Windows have a Class, not all have a Title.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two CommandButtons and a TextBox.

3. Copy the following code into the Form's module:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim lRet As Long, lParam As Long
           Dim lhWnd As Long

           lhWnd = Me.hwnd  ' Find the Form's Child Windows
           ' Comment the line above and uncomment the line below to
           ' enumerate Windows for the DeskTop rather than for the Form
           'lhWnd = GetDesktopWindow()  ' Find the Desktop's Child Windows
           ' enumerate the list
           lRet = EnumChildWindows(lhWnd, AddressOf EnumChildProc, lParam)
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command2_Click()
           Dim lRet As Long
           Dim lParam As Long

           'enumerate the list
           lRet = EnumWindows(AddressOf EnumWinProc, lParam)
           ' How many Windows did we find?
           Debug.Print TopCount; " Total Top level Windows"
           Debug.Print ChildCount; " Total Child Windows"
           Debug.Print ThreadCount; " Total Thread Windows"
           Debug.Print "For a grand total of "; TopCount + _
           ChildCount + ThreadCount; " Windows!"
        End Sub

4. Add a Module with the following code:

        Option Explicit

        Type RECT
           Left As Long
           Top As Long
           Right As Long
           Bottom As Long
        End Type

        Declare Function GetWindowRect Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
           lpRect As RECT) As Long

        Declare Function MoveWindow Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
           ByVal x As Long, ByVal y As Long, ByVal nWidth As Long, _
           ByVal nHeight As Long, ByVal bRepaint As Long) As Long

        Declare Function GetDesktopWindow Lib "user32" () As Long

        Declare Function EnumWindows Lib "user32" _
           (ByVal lpEnumFunc As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

        Declare Function EnumChildWindows Lib "user32" (ByVal hWndParent _
           As Long, ByVal lpEnumFunc As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

        Declare Function EnumThreadWindows Lib "user32" (ByVal dwThreadId _
           As Long, ByVal lpfn As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

        Declare Function GetWindowThreadProcessId Lib "user32" _
           (ByVal hwnd As Long, lpdwProcessId As Long) As Long

        Declare Function GetClassName Lib "user32" Alias "GetClassNameA" _
           (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal lpClassName As String, _
           ByVal nMaxCount As Long) As Long

        Declare Function GetWindowText Lib "user32" Alias "GetWindowTextA" _
           (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal lpString As String, _
           ByVal cch As Long) As Long

        Public TopCount As Integer     ' Number of Top level Windows
        Public ChildCount As Integer   ' Number of Child Windows
        Public ThreadCount As Integer  ' Number of Thread Windows

        Function EnumWinProc(ByVal lhWnd As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) _
           As Long
           Dim RetVal As Long, ProcessID As Long, ThreadID As Long
           Dim WinClassBuf As String * 255, WinTitleBuf As String * 255
           Dim WinClass As String, WinTitle As String

           RetVal = GetClassName(lhWnd, WinClassBuf, 255)
           WinClass = StripNulls(WinClassBuf)  ' remove extra Nulls &amp; spaces
           RetVal = GetWindowText(lhWnd, WinTitleBuf, 255)
           WinTitle = StripNulls(WinTitleBuf)
           TopCount = TopCount + 1
           ' see the Windows Class and Title for each top level Window
           Debug.Print "Top level Class = "; WinClass; ", Title = "; WinTitle
           ' Usually either enumerate Child or Thread Windows, not both.
           ' In this example, EnumThreadWindows may produce a very long list!
           RetVal = EnumChildWindows(lhWnd, AddressOf EnumChildProc, lParam)
           ThreadID = GetWindowThreadProcessId(lhWnd, ProcessID)
           RetVal = EnumThreadWindows(ThreadID, AddressOf EnumThreadProc, _
           lParam)
           EnumWinProc = True
        End Function

        Function EnumChildProc(ByVal lhWnd As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) _
           As Long
           Dim RetVal As Long
           Dim WinClassBuf As String * 255, WinTitleBuf As String * 255
           Dim WinClass As String, WinTitle As String
           Dim WinRect As RECT
           Dim WinWidth As Long, WinHeight As Long

           RetVal = GetClassName(lhWnd, WinClassBuf, 255)
           WinClass = StripNulls(WinClassBuf)  ' remove extra Nulls &amp; spaces
           RetVal = GetWindowText(lhWnd, WinTitleBuf, 255)
           WinTitle = StripNulls(WinTitleBuf)
           ChildCount = ChildCount + 1
           ' see the Windows Class and Title for each Child Window enumerated
           Debug.Print "   Child Class = "; WinClass; ", Title = "; WinTitle
           ' You can find any type of Window by searching for its WinClass
           If WinClass = "ThunderTextBox" Then    ' TextBox Window
              RetVal = GetWindowRect(lhWnd, WinRect)  ' get current size
              WinWidth = WinRect.Right - WinRect.Left ' keep current width
              WinHeight = (WinRect.Bottom - WinRect.Top) * 2 ' double height
              RetVal = MoveWindow(lhWnd, 0, 0, WinWidth, WinHeight, True)
              EnumChildProc = False
           Else
              EnumChildProc = True
           End If
        End Function

        Function EnumThreadProc(ByVal lhWnd As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) _
           As Long
           Dim RetVal As Long
           Dim WinClassBuf As String * 255, WinTitleBuf As String * 255
           Dim WinClass As String, WinTitle As String

           RetVal = GetClassName(lhWnd, WinClassBuf, 255)
           WinClass = StripNulls(WinClassBuf)  ' remove extra Nulls &amp; spaces
           RetVal = GetWindowText(lhWnd, WinTitleBuf, 255)
           WinTitle = StripNulls(WinTitleBuf)
           ThreadCount = ThreadCount + 1
           ' see the Windows Class and Title for top level Window
           Debug.Print "Thread Window Class = "; WinClass; ", Title = "; _
           WinTitle
           EnumThreadProc = True
        End Function

        Public Function StripNulls(OriginalStr As String) As String
           ' This removes the extra Nulls so String comparisons will work
           If (InStr(OriginalStr, Chr(0)) &gt; 0) Then
              OriginalStr = Left(OriginalStr, InStr(OriginalStr, Chr(0)) - 1)
           End If
           StripNulls = OriginalStr
        End Function

5. Run the project and click on Command1. This enumerates the Form's child
  Windows until it finds the TextBox, then doubles the height of the TextBox
  and moves it to position 0, 0 (upper-left of the Form.)

6. Click on Command2. It now lists the Class and Title (if there is one) for all
  top-level Windows, for their Child Windows, and any non-child Windows
  associated with their threads, to the Immediate Window. Note that this can be
  a very long list and may take a minute to complete.

7. From the Run Menu, choose End, or click the END button to stop the program.
  Change the code in Sub Command1_Click according to the comments to pass the
  handle from GetDesktopWindow. Run the project and click on Command1 to
  enumerate all child Windows of the DeskTop. Note that this procedure can take
  some time to complete.
