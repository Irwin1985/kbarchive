SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to modify the display name of Lotus Notes users as they appear in
the Exchange Server Global Address List (GAL). Also, you can have Exchange
Server users displayed differently in the Lotus Notes Address Book (NAB).

This article explains how to get Lotus Notes users to be displayed in
&lt;LastName, FirstName&gt; format in Exchange Server. Similarly, steps may be
taken to make display name changes when Exchange Server users are propagated
into Lotus Notes. However, it is not recommended that the default mapping from
Exchange Server to Lotus Notes be changed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, in Exchange Server, Lotus Notes users are displayed in &lt;FirstName
LastName&gt; format. Exchange Server users are displayed in &lt;FirstName
LastName&gt; format.

In Lotus Notes, Notes users are displayed in &lt;LastName, FirstName&gt; format.
Exchange Server users are displayed in &lt;LastName, FirstName&gt; format.

One of the following files is usually involved:

- If modifying the display name of Lotus Notes users in Exchange Server,

  Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Dxamex\Mapnotes.tbl - Lotus Notes to Exchange Server
  directory synchronization

- If modifying the display name of Exchange Server users in Lotus Notes,

  Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Dxanotes\Mapmex.tbl - Exchange Server to Lotus Notes
  directory synchronization

Listing of default Mapnotes.tbl:

  Alias = ISEQUAL( ShortName, "", SUBSTR( FullName, 1, 64 ), ShortName )
  FullName = X500( FullName, "CN" )
  TA = "NOTES:" Strip( FullName, ";", "L", "R" ) "@" MailDomain
  DN = UNID
  FirstName = FirstName
  LastName = LastName
  Company=Company
  Department = Department
  Office = Location
  Initials = Initials

Listing of modified Mapnotes.tbl:

  Alias = ISEQUAL( ShortName, "", SUBSTR( FullName, 1, 64 ), ShortName )

     ;Default rule:
     ;FullName = X500( FullName, "CN" )

     ;Changed rule.  This rule changes the display name of Notes users to
     ;appear as &lt;LastName, FirstName&gt; in the Exchange Server GAL. It
     ;preserves the Display name of Notes Groups.

  FullName = ISEQUAL( ShortName, "", X500( FullName, "CN" ), X500( LastName ", " FirstName, "CN" ))

  TA = "NOTES:" Strip( FullName, ";", "L", "R" ) "@" MailDomain
  DN = UNID
  FirstName = FirstName
  LastName = LastName
  Company = Company
  Department = Department
  Office = Location
  Initials = Initials

As always, before making any changes, it is a good idea to make a backup copy of
the file(s) you are about to modify. Then follow these steps:

1. Change the 'FullName' mapping rule as shown in the file listing above.

2. Copy the modified Mapnotes.tbl into your Exchsrvr\Connect\ Exchconn\Dxamex
  directory, replacing the existing file.

  The next step may be done at off peak hours, so the impact to your messaging
  environment is minimal.

3. Run Lotus Notes to Exchange Server directory synchronization. Click Immediate
  Full Reload on the Directory Synchronization tab of the Notes Connector
  property page.

The Lotus Notes users originally appearing in Exchange Server as &lt;FirstName
LastName&gt; should change to the &lt;LastName, FirstName&gt; format. It is not
necessary to clear the current container you have for Lotus Notes users.

It is not recommended to change the default mapping from Exchange Server to Lotus
Notes of the FullName field. The FullName field is used for replying to the
message. If you change this format, when a Notes user addresses an Exchange
Server user from the address book, the e-mail will likely not go through because
the recipient address will not exactly match the Lotus Notes proxy in Exchange
Server of that Exchange Server user.

When you open the address book itself, that is, Names.nsf, you see a view in
which the first column is not an actual field in the person document. Notes
combines the first name and last name and displays them together under the Name
column.

Take care to distinguish whether you are looking at an actual field of the
document that you would like changed (in which case you may not be able to make
changes for the above reason), or whether you are looking at a view, which you
can certainly modify if you have the permission.
