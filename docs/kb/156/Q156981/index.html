SUMMARY
=======

In order to restrict end user access to specific IP addresses in FrontPage, the
Author and Administrator IP restrictions must be at least as rigorous as the End
User restrictions.

In FrontPage Explorer, if you click the End User tab in the Web Permissions
dialog box (on the Tools menu, click Permissions) and apply an IP address
restriction, FrontPage may still allow browsing to the Web from a restricted IP
address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The security model of FrontPage assumes each successive group (End Users,
Authors, and Administrators) is comprised of a subset of members from the group
below it. In other words, all Authors must be End Users, and all Administrators
must be Authors. This allows Administrators to automatically have authoring and
browsing rights, and allows Authors to also browse the Web. Because authoring
and administration of a FrontPage Web must be done through a browsing session,
any IP restriction applied to End Users must also apply to the Administrators
and Authors groups to prevent browsing. FrontPage doesn't challenge the user for
a name and password to grant access to a higher level of permission until an
authoring operation is attempted; therefore, all accounts initially are
connected to the Web server with End User security.

FrontPage offers the capability to define a separate IP restriction to each
group, but each successive level must have an equal or tighter restriction.
Because Administrators also have the right to author and browse, and since
authors also have the right to browse, it may be helpful to think of the IP
restrictions settings as being cumulative. For example, in a Web with the
following IP restriction

  Administrators: *.*.*.*
  Authors:        244.24.*.*
  End Users:      244.24.57.*

End Users will be able to browse from any computer on the network. Another way to
interpret the above table is as follows:

  244.24.57.*  is granted the right to browse
  244.24.*.*   is granted the right to browse and the right to Author
  *.*.*.*      is granted the right to browse, the right to author, and
               the right to administer

If the FrontPage Web has the following restrictions,

  Administrators: 244.24.57.*
  Authors:        244.24.*.*
  End Users:      244.24.*.*

then only End users with IP addresses beginning with 244.24 can browse the Web,
Authors can only come from 244.24.*.*, and Administrators can only come from
244.24.57.*. Another way to interpret the IP restrictions above is as follows:

  244.24.*.*   is granted the right to browse
  244.24.*.*   is granted the right to browse and the right to author
  244.24.57.*  is granted the right to browse, the right to author, and
               the right to administer

Note: The Microsoft Internet Information Server does not grant the right to
assign IP restrictions on a per directory basis. The IP restrictions dialog box
on a FrontPage Web being hosted on an IIS server will be disabled.
