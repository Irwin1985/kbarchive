SYMPTOMS
========

When you start either FrontPage Explorer or FrontPage Editor, you may see any of
the following errors messages:

  There is no open Web to receive this page. Please open a Web, and then save
  this page again

  -or-

  FrontPage Explorer caused an access violation.

  -or-

  Cannot get the To Do List from the Server.

  -or-

  Server error: _vti_bin/_vti_adm does not refer to a page in this Web
  Ole32.dll caused an invalid page fault.

  -or-

  Unable to connect to the FrontPage Explorer.

  -or-

  Unable to connect to the FrontPage Editor.

  -or-

  FPEDITOR caused an invalid page fault in module Ole32.dll.

  -or-

  FPEDITOR caused an invalid page fault in module Mfc40.dll.

These problems are likely to occur when you start FrontPage Editor from FrontPage
Explorer, or when you save a file from FrontPage Editor back to a Web, or when
you use the FrontPage Editor toolbar button to return to the FrontPage
Explorer.

Note that other error conditions may produce similar error messages.


CAUSE
=====

There are two common causes for these errors when working with FrontPage.

First check your computer name in either the Identification tab of the Network
Properties or in the Networks Control Panel. Also check the host name for your
computer on the DNS tab of the TCP/IP properties sheet. If either of these names
contains non-alphanumeric characters (except for periods in a DNS host name or
dashes in a computer name), FrontPage may be unable to resolve the name to a
valid program on your computer. This happens with FrontPage running under
Windows NT and Windows 95, and Windows 3.x (for FrontPage 1.0).

If the computer name does not contain an illegal character, but you are still
receiving these errors, your Windows 95 system may need to be updated with the
OLE Update for Windows 95.

STATUS
======

Computer names with non-alphanumeric characters are illegal computer names in
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Since FrontPage uses
TCP/IP for authoring operations, illegal TCP/IP names generate errors.

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Illegal Character in Computer Name
--------------------------------------------

Take the illegal character out of the computer name. For example, if your
computer's name is

  My@Work or my@work.mycompany.com

then rename it to

  My-Work or my-work.mycompany.com

NOTE: If other computers on your network are using shares you have created or
have links pointing to your Web pages, those computers may need to re-establish
those connections or links.

Method 2: No Illegal Characters in Computer Name, Windows 95 Systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the OLE32 update from

  http://www.microsoft.com/Windows95/downloads/contents/wurecommended/s_wuservicepacks/w95ole32update/default.asp?site=95

NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site address may
change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft home page at the
following address:

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q138384 "@" Character in Computer Name Causes OLE Error Messages


If you attempt to name computer running Windows NT 4.0 with a restricted
character, you receive an error message that indicates that your computer name
will not be accessible via internet protocols and will create a substition of a
"-" character for every unacceptable character. In additon, Microsoft Windows NT
4.0 does not allow you to enter a restricted character into the DNS Host Name.
Windows NT 3.51 does not permit you to enter a restricted character in a DNS
name.

Windows NT WINS Services automatically substitutes "-" characters for illegal
characters in the computer name in the WINS database. This may not actually
prevent these error messages from appearing because FrontPage uses the DNS name
if it is present.

FrontPage uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol to communicate
between FrontPage Editor or FrontPage Explorer components of the program and the
Web server session. HTTP is a component of the TCP/IP protocol, and
non-alphanumeric characters other than a hyphen or a period are illegal in
TCP/IP names. The "." character is reserved for separating host names from
domain names.
