-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a CONFIG.FPW configuration file is marked as Included within the Project
Manager and this project is built into an EXE file, the -C Command line cannot
be used to override the built-in CONFIG.FPW.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem in one of two ways:

- Do not add the CONFIG.FPW to the project. Or, add it to the project but mark
  it Excluded. The CONFIG.FPW must be provided as a separate file but it can be
  overridden with a -c or -c&lt;other config filename&gt;.

-or-

- Give the configuration file a name other than CONFIG.FPW. The configuration
  file must always be specified on the Command line to be utilized but can be
  overridden by specifying -c or -c&lt;other config filename&gt;.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project, TEST.PJX.

2. Add a main program, TEST.PRG, with the following contents:

     =Messagebox("Main program!")

3. Create a CONFIG.FPW file with the following contents:

     TITLE=Built in CONFIG was used

4. Add the CONFIG.FPW file to the project as a Text File. It will be marked
  Included by default.

5. Build an executable, TEST.EXE.

6. Create an alternate config file, OTHER.FPW, with the following contents:

     TITLE=Alternate CONFIG

7. From the Win95 RUN menu, execute:

  C:\&lt;directory with EXE&gt;\TEST.EXE -cOTHER.FPW

Despite the -c to override the built-in CONFIG file, the main Visual FoxPro
window appears with the title of "Built in CONFIG was used," demonstrating that
the built-in CONFIG.FPW file was used rather than OTHER.FPW.

There are two methods to work around the problem in the above example.

Method 1:
---------

Under step 4 above, add the following:

  4a. In the Project Manager, right-click on the Config file and select
      Exclude.

Method 2:
---------

Change step 3 above to read:

1. Create a MYCONFIG.FPW file with the following contents:

        TITLE=Built in CONFIG was used

Change step 4 above to read:

1. Add the MYCONFIG.FPW file to the project as a Text File. It will be marked
  Included by default.

Now the built-in configuration file, MYCONFIG.FPW, can be utilized only by
specifying the configuration file, such as C:\&lt;directory with
EXE&gt;\TEST.EXE -cMYCONFIG.FPW. Use of -c will cause no configuration file to
be used, and -cOTHER.FPW will allow OTHER.FPW to be used.
