SUMMARY
=======

Network virus scanning software packages can cause network errors when installed
on Windows NT Server. These packages can also cause problems when upgrading to
Windows NT Server 4.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Third-party network virus scanning software can be installed on Windows NT
Server to check files for viruses as they are copied to and from a server. These
programs are installed as a service and they act at the file system level.


These services will often run fine until a seemingly unrelated change, like
adding a fault tolerant set or installing a service pack, is made to the server.
Often the users will report that similarly configured servers run the same
scanning software without a problem.

Common symptoms that suggest a problem with virus scanning software include
clients mysteriously being disconnected or being unable to connect to the server
in question, or users being unable to save or retrieve files. Often clients
trying to access a server will get the message "Not enough server storage is
available to process this command" when trying to attach to a server.

If the network connection problems are present and a virus scanning product is
installed, disabling the scanning service will confirm that the problem is the
virus scanning software. Sometimes it may be necessary to disable the service
and restart the server. If the virus scanning service is determined to be the
problem, contact the manufacture of software in question.

When upgrading a server to Windows NT 4.0 it is advisable to disable the virus
scanning services, because Stop 0x00000050 error messages (blue screens) and
other system problems have been observed after upgrading systems with these
services installed. The software vendor or manufacturer should be contacted
before upgrading a server to find out what procedures or updates are necessary
when upgrading to Windows NT 4.0.
