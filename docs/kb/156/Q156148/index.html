SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses playing multiplayer games of NBA Full Court Press.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network and modem games work best when you choose the Typical installation
option during Full Court Press setup.

During a modem multiplayer game, it may take the client machine (the machine that
joins the game) a few minutes to download the stats and settings of the game to
be played.

If you have problems with modem games, reconfigure your modem as a standard
28,800 baud or 14,400 baud modem instead of any modem-specific configuration you
may be using.

Changing controllers in the middle of a multiplayer game may cause you to lose
game synchronization. You can, however, change the configuration of your
controllers.

During a multiplayer game, the game may pause, even though no one has
intentionally paused the game. A "Pause" message may or may not appear in the
title bar of the game play window. Full Court Press is synchronizing the game
among the users. Usually the game will cancel the pause once it has synchronized
the users. If the game does not cancel the pause after about 10 seconds, try
manually canceling the pause by pressing the PAUSE key.

If you do not have enough hard drive space to install Full Court Press, you may
get the following error message during installation:

  Can't load &lt;filename&gt; Place the Full Court Press compact disc in
  the CD-ROM drive. If it is already in the drive, run Setup again
  to fix your installation.

Full Court Press is trying to load this file, but you may not have enough room on
your hard drive to create any new swap files. Make sure you have enough space on
your hard drive, then try reinstalling.
