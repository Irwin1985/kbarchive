ABOUT MANIC MARBLES
-------------------

Microsoft Marbles is a wacky three-dimensional game where bizarre marbles
characters try to knock, and avoid being knocked off different playing fields.
The trick is the playing fields are out to get you too. Up to four people can
play on one computer with the Microsoft SideWinder Game pad. Each marble has
special offensive and defensive capabilities. Every marble has the ability to
charge at an opponent. Also each player has the ability to jump. The jump option
helps you avoid charging marbles or playing field objects. In addition to theses
core abilities, each marble has its own unique abilities. For information about
the Manic Marbles characters, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q156119 Manic Marbles Trial Version: Characters Summary

The retail version will have:

- 20+ playing fields

- 9 Unique Characters

- Single Player Tournament

- Multi-player Tournament

- Special Bonus Rounds

INSTALLING AND RUNNING MICROSOFT MARBLES
----------------------------------------

1. To run Manic Marbles, insert the SideWinder game pad compact disc into your
  CD-ROM drive.

  If your CD-ROM drive doesn't support AutoPlay or you've disabled AutoPlay, you
  can start Manic Marbles as follows:

  a. Double-click the My Computer icon on the desktop.

  b. Double-click the CD-ROM drive icon.

  c. Double-click the Marbles folder.

  d. Double-click the Setup icon.

  If you have already installed Microsoft Marbles, click the Start button, point
  to Programs, point to Microsoft Kids, and click Microsoft Marbles. The game
  starts automatically.

2. On the Main Menu, click New Game, and press the ENTER key.

3. On the Character Selection screen use the arrow keys or the D-pad on the game
  pad to scroll through the different characters.

4. Press A on the keyboard or game pad to select your character. Press B on your
  keyboard or game pad to view information about the character. For information
  about the Manic Marbles characters, see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q156119 Manic Marbles Trial Version: Characters Summary

NOTE: You can only select the characters with the white background. The other
characters are only available in the full retail version.

The game defaults to one human player and three computer players. The computer
selects the remaining players available. For information about changing the
Manic Marbles game setup, see the "Game Setup" section in this article.

The game starts automatically after all characters are selected.

TIPS ON PLAYING
---------------

The following are basic tips on how to play Manic Marbles trial version:

- Move your player around the field by pressing the D button on your Sidewinder
  Game pad.

- Avoid other players and obstacles by moving and jumping.

- Use your character's special offensive and defensive options to knock your
  opponents off the playing field or into danger areas.

- Keep moving, you'll be tougher to hit.

- If someone charges at you, try to jump out of the way.

- Know the danger areas on each playing field.

- Know your opponents strengths and weaknesses.

- Don't stand by danger areas for too long (see the "Danger Areas" section in
  this article for more information).

Win all three games to become the Microsoft Marbles champion. You can change the
number of wins, difficulty, level choice and volume in the "Options" section of
the game.

Game Setup:

In Game Setup you can change the following items:

- Number of players, human or computer

- Multi-player or Team

- Input device selection (Game pad, Keyboard)

- Input configuration

Danger Areas:

Every playing field has special marks to help the player recognize safe and
dangerous areas. At the start of each round, all areas of the playing fields are
safe for 5 seconds. Before the end of the 5 seconds, the danger areas will start
flashing to warn the players that they are about to turn on. This helps players
from dying very quickly at the beginning of the game.

Green Stripes:

A green glow along the edge of a playing field indicates a safe area. If an edge
is marked by a green glow, you will not fall off the edge of the playing field.

Black/White Stripes:

Yellow and black stripes indicate possible danger. These stripes indicate areas
that could harm your marble. These stripes surround breakaway glass, collapsing
walls, and fences.

Yellow/Black Stripes:

Yellow and black stripes indicate danger. Your marble will be harmed if it enters
these areas. These stripes surround ends of playing fields, lava pits, trap
doors.

Second Chance Controls:

One of the great features of Microsoft Marbles is that you are never out of the
game. Even if your marble falls off the playing field, you still can play, using
the power of Second Chance control. Every playing field has special Second
Chance controls. These include controlling trap doors, pinball bumpers, and
elevators. You can't personally win a round using Second Chance controls, but in
Team Mode you can help your teammate win the round and get the point for your
team. (See each individual playing field for individual Second Chance control).
