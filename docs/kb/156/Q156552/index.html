SUMMARY
=======

With the introduction of Offline Views, Visual FoxPro has brought together
tables and views in a different way. This article explains these differences and
new functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Offline views are actually a table and view depending on which clause you use
with the USE command (USE, USE ADMIN, or USE ONLINE).

When you create an offline view with the CREATEOFFLINE command, it is possible to
have five new files that belong to the offline view (not counting the database's
.dbc file).

Example 1
---------

The table that the view is built from does not contain a MEMO or GENERAL field:

     CREATEOFFLINE('view1')

The view1.dbf, view1.tbf, and view1.tdx files are created.

Example 2
---------

The table that the view is built from does contain a MEMO or GENERAL field:

     CREATEOFFLINE('view1')

The view1.dbf, view1.tbf, view1.tdx, view1.tpt, and view1.fpt files are created.

The USE command by itself with the offline view actually uses a table(for
example, view1.dbf) that was created from the CREATEOFFLINE command. Even though
users are using a table, they can only set the BUFFERING mode to OPTIMISTIC ROW
or OPTIMISTIC TABLE buffering. In this mode the users are also allowed to place
a INDEX on the offline view. Once the offline view is used ONLINE or in ADMIN
mode, the index is dropped and a new one has to be created the next time the
users use the offline view with the USE command.

When the users use the ADMIN or ONLINE clause with the USE command, they are now
using a view. While using the offline view with either of these two clauses, the
users are not allowed to change the BUFFERING mode or to place a INDEX on the
offline view. The ADMIN clause does not try to reestablish a link back to the
server, while the ONLINE clause does.

Offline views are allowed to have Relations (SET RELATION TO), but they cannot be
used with referential integrity. Other commands that cannot be used with offline
views are PACK, ZAP, MODIFY, and REQUERY.

If you are taking the offline view away from the database, you should copy all
the files mentioned above along with the database's .dbc file.

Additional query words: buffering admin createoffline
