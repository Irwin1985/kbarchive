-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When choosing Head To Head game on two directly connected computers, you get the
following error message:

  A valid TCP/IP connection is required for Two Player play.

RESOLUTION
==========

Your computer must be configured to use an Internet Protocol(IP) Address to play
a head-to-head game in Close Combat. This article explains how to configure the
necessary TCP/IP settings for two Macintosh computers directly connected to one
another.

You must configure an IP Address for each of the two machines to play a
head-to-head game in Close Combat.

NOTE: Because you are not playing across a network, these IP Addresses do not
have to be addresses assigned by a network system administrator or by an
Internet service provider. They can be any series of numbers you and your
opponent choose (for example, 111.11.111.111 for one machine and another IP
address for the other machine). Any series of numbers will work. Make a note of
the numbers you choose. You will need to know these numbers later.

For head-to-head play, each player must have a Close Combat compact disc.

Use the following steps to configure your IP Address for head-to-head play on the
Macintosh:

1. Go to Control Panels.

2. Select TCP/IP.

3. Connect via: Ethernet.

4. Configure: Manually.

5. Type "&lt;xxx.xx.xxx.xxx&gt;" (without the quotation marks) in the IP Address
  field (where &lt;xxx.xx.xxx.xxx&gt; is the numbers you chose.)

6. Close TCP/IP. If prompted to Save, click Save.

7. You may get a dialog box that says

  You have not provided a subnet mask value. TCP/IP will use a default subnet
  mask that corresponds to your IP address.

8. Click Continue.

9. Open Close Combat.

10. Select Head to Head Play (button with two heads). The Two Player Options
  dialog box should open.

11. Type your opponent's IP address in the Remote IP Address field. (Remember:
  This can be any number the two of you have agreed upon.)

12. If you are initiating the connection, then choose that option. If you are
  waiting for your opponent to connect with your machine, then choose that
  option. (In this instance, this article will assume that you are initiating
  the connection. The other player must enter your IP address in his/her
  Remote IP Address field, click Wait For Connection, and then click OK. You
  may hear a message saying, "Waiting for connection."

13. On the machine that is initiating connection, click Begin. The Initiating
  Game With Address "xxx.xx.xxx.xxx" dialog box appears. After a few seconds,
  you and your opponent should hear "Connection Established."

14. Both players should select Begin.

15. You should both hear, synchronizing machines.

16. You may both deploy your troops and begin playing Close Combat.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you still experience problems initiating a head-to-head game after you have
properly configured your computer, make sure your machine cables are properly
connected.
