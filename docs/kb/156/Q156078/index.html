SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the RegMaid utility. You can obtain the RegMaid utility
from the Microsoft Download Center (see the "More Information" section).

The RegMaid utility is designed to clean up invalid registry entries that are
caused by deleting OLE projects that are created with Visual C++ and Microsoft
Foundation Classes (MFC).

MORE INFORMATION
================

RegMaid provides information about entries that are believed to be problematic
within the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT: CLSID, ProgId, TypeLib, and Interface sections of
the registry. This information is in a report form of a list view, where the
user can make multiple row selections. Once selections have been made, the user
can then delete them from the registry. Although RegMaid does not currently have
an Archive and Restore capability, it does provide a printed report mechanism
for each of the four views.

The CLSID section considers an entry to contain a problem if any handler or
server file entry cannot be found by the system. This can occur if a server has
been registered over the net and the network connection has been broken. An
entry might also be listed if the server has been moved or deleted. The CLSID
section provides the most information about the entry that is listed to help you
wisely chose the entries to remove.

The ProgId section tries to match its CLSID entry with one in
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID. The typical entry being searched in the registry is of
the format HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Some ProgId\CLSID. If the entry under
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT does not contain a CLSID sub-entry, then it is ignored. This
ensures that only ProgIds are listed. The clean-up process is identical to that
of the CLSID section.

The TypeLib section looks for references to .tlb files and if one is found in the
registry that cannot be found in the system then the entry is listed as
problematic. As with the CLSID section, the files in question are listed.

The final section is the Interface portion of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. In this section
each entry with a TypeLib entry is compared to the entries in
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib, and if a match is not found, the entry is listed
here. This entry has the least amount of information available for deciding
which registry entries to delete. In fact, the only information available are
the TypeLib and Interface GUIDs. However, because this section is highly
dependent on the TypeLib section, it should be safe to delete these entries as
long as you have resolved the TypeLib issues first.

NOTE: Use the -d option when running RegMaid.exe to decompress the file and
re-create the proper directory structure.

NOTE: As of February 10, 1998, there is a new version of RegMaid.exe (version
1.1). It greatly reduces the number of erroneous listings that are caused by
RegMaid's inability to find a server file, including:

- Handling of long file names.

- Handling of environmental variables in the path.

- Confusion caused by multiple data entries for the server.
