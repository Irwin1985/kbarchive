The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

By default, unattended setup does not provide a way to control what accessory
applications are installed in the Accessories program group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To control which accessory applications are installed in the Accessories program
group, you must modify the application's information (.inf) file.

WARNING: Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files;
therefore, Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this
article. Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to
function as described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

Each application or group of applications on the Accessories menu has an
associated information (.inf) file. Each .inf file uses the InstallType variable
to determine whether or not the application is to be installed. The InstallType
variable has three possible values:

   0 = Manual only
  10 = Typical or Custom
  14 = Typical, Custom, or Portable

The following .inf files use the InstallType variable. You can find the list of
.inf files in the [BaseWinOptionsInfs] section of the Syssetup.inf file.

  accessor.inf
  communic.inf
  games.inf
  imagevue.inf
  mmopt.inf
  multimed.inf
  optional.inf
  pinball.inf
  wordpad.inf

The following example is the section for FreeCell from the Games.inf file for
Windows NT Server 4.0. By default, games are not installed on the server.
Because unattended setup uses Typical as the installation type, you can specify
a value of 10 can be used for FreeCell's InstallType. By default, the
InstallType for Free Cell is 0.

  [Freecell]
  OptionDesc              = %Freecell_DESC%
  Tip                     = %Freecell_TIP%
  IconIndex               = 62 ;Windows mini-icon for dialogs
  Parent                  = Games
  ;
  ; The following value is the one to change.
  ; To install FreeCell, change InstallType from 0 to 10.
  ;
  InstallType             = 0 ;Manual only
  CopyFiles               = FreecellCopyFilesSys, FreecellCopyFilesHelp
  AddReg                  = FreecellAddReg
  UpdateInis              = FreecellInis
  Uninstall               = FreecellUninstall
  Upgrade                 = FreecellUpgrade
  Detect                  = %11%\freecell.exe

To take advantage of the InstallType variable for manual or unattended
installations of Windows NT, a certain amount of preparation is needed.

1. Copy the contents of the I386 directory from the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc
  to a distribution share.

2. For each .inf file that you need to modify, first expand the original .inf
  file and rename the compressed .in_ file, using the following commands:

  EXPAND GAMES.IN_ GAMES.INF
  RENAME GAMES.IN_ GAMES.SAV

  NOTE: You need to use the Windows NT version of Expand.exe.

3. Edit the .inf file and change the InstallType value, as outlined above.

      0 = Manual only
     10 = Typical or Custom
     14 = Typical, Custom, or Portable
