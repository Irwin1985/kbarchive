SYMPTOMS
========

The file name of the document does not appear on the document title bar after
you save the document.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following workarounds:

- After the Word document has been saved, close and reopen the document. The
  file name now appears on the document title bar.

  NOTE: The caption does not appear on the document title bar when the file is
  re-opened. The caption is only present when you create a new document from
  any of the templates that ship with Word.

-or-

- Using the Visual Basic Editor, you can remark out the line in the macro code
  that is causing the file name to not appear on the document title bar. To
  remark out this line, follow these steps:

  obligations or warranties, either expressed or implied, by Microsoft.

  1. Open the template that is experiencing the problem.

  2. Press ALT+F11 to start the Visual Basic Editor.

  3. Expand the TemplateProject for the template you have opened by clicking on
     the plus sign next to TemplateProject(templatename).

  4. Expand Microsoft Word Objects by clicking on the plus sign next to
     Microsoft Word Objects.

  5. Double-click ThisDocument to open the code window.

  6. Type an apostrophe in front of the line of code that reads as follows:

  ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption = ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Caption &amp;" - Report"

     The apostrophe comments out the line so that it is not read in the code.

  7. Quit the Visual Basic Editor.

  8. Save the template you have opened.

  The file name should now appear on the document title bar when you save a
  document that has been opened based on one of these templates.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word uses a new feature that inserts a caption on the Word document
title bar. The caption feature helps you remember what type of template the
document is based on. This caption appears whenever a document is created using
any of the Word shipped templates.

The file name is not updated on the title bar of the document window when the
file is saved. Word saves the document correctly; the title bar is not updated
with the correct file name.

The following templates exhibit this problem:

- Contemporary Fax.dot

- Contemporary Memo.dot

- Contemporary Report.dot

- Elegant Fax.dot

- Elegant Memo.dot

- Elegant Report.dot

- Fax Wizard.wiz

- Memo Wizard.wiz

- Newsletter Wizard.wiz

- Pleading Wizard.wiz

- Professional Fax.dot

- Professional Memo.dot

- Professional Report.dot

- Resume Wizard.wiz
