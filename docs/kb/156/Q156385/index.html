-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With some Systems Management Server site configurations, an Apple Macintosh
computer may exhibit errors and appear to stop responding when the initial
Systems Management Server inventory is taken on that system.

This problem occurs when the Systems Management Server site server is located in
a different AppleTalk zone than the Macintosh client.

CAUSE
=====

During the initial installation of the Systems Management Server client, the
Domain.ini file is copied to the client. This file is later modified and renamed
to Sms.ini. When the Macintosh restarts, the INVMAC program runs and attempts to
connect to a Systems Management Server in the AppleTalk zone specified in the
Domain.ini file to finalize the configuration and to report the initial
inventory.

By default, the Domain.ini file contains an asterisk (*) that signifies that the
Macintosh can find the Systems Management Server site server in the Macintosh's
default zone. If the computer running Systems Management Server that the
Macintosh is reporting to resides in a different zone than the Macintosh, this
process fails.

The AppleTalk zone information is gathered by the Invwin32.exe inventory agent
residing on the Systems Management Server site server, and is written to the
registry at the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Identificaiton

With Systems Management Server 1.2, this information is not always written to the
registry properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use Regedt32 to modify the Systems Management Server registry to contain the
AppleTalk zone name.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT or Microsoft Systems
Management Server to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
resulting from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your
own risk.

1. Open Regedt32.

2. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Identification.

3. Add a new value called "AppleTalk Zone Name" (without the quotation marks),
  and make the Data Type REG_SZ. Add the correct AppleTalk zone name for the
  value.

When the Systems Management Server Maintenance Manager service starts its next
watchdog cycle, the new registry entry will be picked up, and the Domain.ini
file will be modified. Once this file has been modified, Macintosh computers can
be installed, and will inventory properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining
the Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
