Getting World Atlas to run at its best

NOTE: Do not remove the World Atlas disc from your CD-ROM drive while
you run World Atlas.

Make sure your CD-ROM drive gives you peak performance
To make sure that Windows is set to run your CD-ROM drive at its best,
follow these steps:
1.  Click My Computer with the right mouse-button.
2.  Click Properties and click the Performance tab with the left mouse
   button.
3.  Click the File System button and then click the CD-ROM tab.
   Make sure that the Supplemental cache size is set to Large and
   that the Optimize access pattern for is correctly set for the type
   of CD-ROM drive your system has. Look in your computer or CD-ROM
   manual to find out what this setting should be.

You need free disk space to run World Atlas

World Atlas requires a certain amount of free disk space for it to
function properly with the operating system. The amount required is
dependent on the operating system used (Windows 95 or Windows NT),
the amount of memory (or RAM) your computer has, and the memory settings
for the computer.
In general, the more RAM you have the less free disk space you need.
World Atlas works best with at least 32 megabytes (MB) of free disk
space if you use Windows with the default settings and have Windows
manage the memory. However, these are the minimum requirements, based
on the amount of RAM your computer has:
-  8 MB or less of RAM: you must have 24 MB of free disk space.
-  9 to 16 MB of RAM: you must have 16 MB of free disk space.
-  Greater than 16 MB of RAM: you must have 10 MB of free disk space.

Suggestions, please!
Map suggestions
World Atlas provides the most extensive world atlas database ever
compiled in print or on CD-ROM. The lowest display altitudes in World
Atlas give you an incredibly detailed view of the world, where you will
find many small features. Some of these small features have been drawn
from comprehensive databases of geographic locations that have been
built by various government agencies. Some of these databases were never
intended to be viewed at such a close range, and you may see some
anomalies in their positioning and naming. Despite these issues, our
cartographers decided to include them so that you can, for the first
time, have access to the rich data that is available from these agencies.
You will find these places identified in World Atlas with a special
symbol.

We value your feedback on map features. If you have suggestions for
helping us improve the World Atlas map, please send them to:

Solving World Atlas problems

Register as a World Atlas user
Right after you set up World Atlas on your computer, the Setup program
gives you the choice of registering on-line if you have a modem. If this
on-line registration doesn't work, you can run the Setup program again
to register or mail in the registration card that comes in the World
Atlas box.

Pictures and video don't look their best

Here are a couple of things to try if pictures look grainy or flawed,
or if videos are garbled:
- You can fix most problems by updating the driver that lets Windows
 and your video card communicate. Look for the manufacturer's phone
 number in the manual that came with your computer or video card and
 request a new driver. Or, you might get an updated video driver from
 the Microsoft Download Service, an electronic bulletin board that
 you can access via modem at (206) 936-6735.
- You can improve video quality by changing the video display mode.
 Keep in mind, however, that the quality of the maps both on screen
 and in print will suffer.
1. In Windows, click Start and point to Settings.
2. Click Control Panel and double-click Display.
3. Click the Settings tab.
4. Click 256 Color under Color palette and move the slider to 640 by
  480 pixels for Desktop area.
5. Click OK.

You don't see the place you're looking for on the map

With a million place names, World Atlas can show only a limited number
at one time without making the map too crowded. Follow these steps if
you want to find a place you don't see:
1. Click Find  on the toolbar on the top of the program window and
  then click Places.
2. Type the name of the place you want to visit. Notice the list move
  as you type.
3. If the place name is highlighted, press ENTER. Or, click the place
  name on the list to go there. World Atlas will draw the map again,
  and the place you're looking for will almost always appear.

If you are in a map style that doesn't allow you to zoom in close enough
to see the place you want, switch to the comprehensive map style and try
the steps above again.

Sound

If you're uncomfortable trying any of the following suggestions on your
own, you may want to ask your dealer or a more experienced friend to help.

You don't hear any sound

Start with the solutions (and a brief explanation of the problem) in the
on-line help.   If those suggestions don't solve the problem, try these:
- Make sure the sound card is pressed securely into its slot.
- Make sure the sound card switches and settings are correct-that is,
 the sound card was installed properly. Refer to the manual of your
 computer system or the sound card manual for help.
- Make sure the sound card doesn't conflict with other hardware by
 using the Hardware Conflict Troubleshooter that was designed
 specifically to help with hardware conflicts in Windows.
1. In Windows, click Start and then click Help.
2. Double-click Troubleshooting.
3. Double-click If you have a hardware conflict and follow the
  directions on your screen.

Sound is distorted, skips, or cuts off

Start with the solutions (and a brief explanation of the problem) in the
on-line help.   If those suggestions don't solve the problem, try these:
- If the sound is distorted, try adjusting the sound card volume with
 a program that is often called a "mixer." To get to the mixer,
 double-click the Volume Control (it's a little speaker in the lower-
 right corner of your screen). Turn down the volume with the volume
 slider under Volume Control and then close the Volume Control box.
- If the sound occasionally skips or cuts off, the CD-ROM drive
 probably isn't fast enough-World Atlas requires a double-speed
 drive. You can keep using your CD-ROM drive, but you will continue
 to hear the sound break up or skip. Or you can upgrade your CD-ROM
 drive.
- Most sound cards can play only one sound at a time. Some sound-
 producing programs, like a screen saver or any program that makes a
 sound in the background, may take over the sound capability of your
 computer and interrupt World Atlas sounds. If you suspect you have
 such a program, do not run it at the same time as World Atlas.
- If you have a Media Vision(tm) Pro Audio 16 sound card and the sound is
 scratchy, the Direct Memory Access (DMA) may be set too low. A DMA
 setting of 7 will correct any scratchy sounds. For instructions on
 how to change the DMA settings, refer to your sound card manual.

World Atlas stops running suddenly

You may find that sometimes World Atlas freezes up, the screen goes
blank, or World Atlas tells you it can't find data.

You may be having problems with your video display
See "Pictures and video don't look their best" in this document for two
possible solutions.

You may be having problems with your CD-ROM drive
Check the drive itself. Here are three things to try.
-  Make sure the World Atlas CD-ROM disc is inserted into the CD-ROM
  drive. (World Atlas won't run at all unless the disc is in the
  drive.
-  Make sure that the drive is connected to your computer correctly
  and is functioning from Windows. To find out, double-click My
  Computer on the desktop and then double-click the drive with a
  picture of the CD-ROM disc (usually drive D). Windows will tell you
  if it's "not available."
-  If you have an external CD-ROM drive, make sure the power is turned
  on.
If, after you try these three things, World Atlas still tells you it
can't find data, check to see if your CD-ROM drive is installed properly.
Refer to the manual that came with your computer system or CD-ROM drive
for help, or contact the company that supplied the drive.

Look for a hardware conflict. Make sure the CD-ROM drive doesn't conflict
with other hardware by using the Hardware Conflict Troubleshooter.
1. In Windows, click Start and then click Help.
2. Double-click Troubleshooting.
3. Double-click If you have a hardware conflict and follow the
  directions on your screen.

You may be having problems with a ReelMagic(tm) sound card
With this sound card, the sounds the program makes when you click the
mouse button freeze World Atlas; this also happens with the media player.
Call Sigma Designs(r), the sound card manufacturer, for a new sound card
driver (the program that lets Windows and your sound card communicate).

If you're using Intellipoint software with your Microsoft mouse
The Snap to feature can cause the mouse cursor to jump around on the
screen when you do certain things in the World Atlas. To fix the
cursor problem, turn off the Snap to feature following these steps:
1. In Windows, click Start and point to Settings.
2. Click Control Panel and double-click Mouse.
  In the lower right corner of the Mouse Properties box, you'll see
  Microsoft Intellipoint mentioned.
3. Click the Activity tab and click Snap to so there's no "x" in the
  box.
4. Click OK.
Pasting text from Encarta Atlas into another application doesn't look
correct.
Encarta Atlas copies article text as tables into other programs. If
the article doesn't look the same as it does within Atlas, try copying
the article by using Edit/Paste Special and choose the unformatted
option, if this is available.
