SUMMARY
=======

The SETLS program is run from the Smsls.bat and Smsls.cmd files. The Smsls.ini
file is used by SETLS to determine which domain to add the current workstation
to.

The Smsls.ini file enables the administrator to map computers to a specific
domain, regardless of which domain the computer actually logs on to. The
Smsls.ini file is used to provide additional control over what domain and server
the setup and inventory programs are run from.

NOTE: Systems Management Server allows the creation of Systems Management Server
domain names that may or may not correspond to Windows NT domains. When mapping
computers to specific domains, actual Windows NT domain names must be used.


The following sections are available for use in the Smsls.ini file:

[WIN.INI]
This section enables workstations running Windows to use the domain specified by
the [SMS] section of the workstation's Win.ini file. The [WIN.INI] section of
the Smsls.ini file requires no entries. To set the workstation's Systems
Management Server domain, the administrator creates an [SMS] section in the
Win.ini file (at the workstation running Windows), and adds the domain entry to
that section.

[other domain]
This section enables workstations running Enhanced LAN Manager 2.x to use the
domains in the OTHDOMAINS entry of the WORKSTATION section of the workstation's
Lanman.ini file to map to a Systems Management Server domain. The SETLS program
tries to map a domain in the OTHDOMAINS entry starting with the first domain in
the OTHDOMAINS entry. In the Smsls.ini file, you add the [OTHER DOMAIN] section
with entries that map the domain entries for the OTHDOMAINS in the Lanman.ini
file of the workstation to Systems Management Server domains.

[workgroup]
This section enables workstations running Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups,
Windows95, or MS-DOS Workgroup Connection to map the workgroup set on the
workstation to a Systems Management Server domain. This section also allows
Windows NT clients that are members of a Windows NT resource domain to be mapped
to that domain in the Systems Management Server hierarchy.

[domain]
This section enables workstations running Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups,
MS-DOS Workgroup Connection, or Enhanced LAN Manager 2.x to map the domain where
the workstation user is currently logged on to a Systems Management Server
domain.

[machine]
This section enables workstations running Windows NT, Windows for Workgroups,
MS-DOS Workgroup Connection, or Enhanced LAN Manager 2.x to map individual
computers to a Systems Management Server domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several methods available for mapping domains, and any number or
combination of the methods may be used. The Smsls.ini file will be searched
sequentially from top to bottom. The first method that provides a server will be
used; then the search stops. The administrator may organize the sections to set
the desired priorities.

SETLS will get the information for the current computer that corresponds to the
section being examined (for example, the machine name and workgroup
information). SETLS compares the current value to the entries in that section.
When a match is found, the domain on the right-hand side of the equal sign ("=")
is used.

The following examples show different entries in the Smsls.ini file:

- To Map a Domain to a Logon Server:

        [DOMAIN]
        PSUEDOMAIN=\\SMS1

  The server name must be preceded by a double backslash (\\). In this example,
  workstations that have logged into PSUEDOMAIN are mapped to the server SMS1.

- To Map Individual Computers to a Domain:

        [MACHINE]
        TIM1=PSUEDOMAIN
        BRIANL3=PSUEDOMAIN

  In this example, the computers TIM1 and BRIANL3 are mapped to the PSUEDOMAIN
  domain.

- To Map One Domain to Another Domain:

        [DOMAIN]
        CSUEWEST=PSUEDOMAIN
        CSUEEAST=PSUEDOMAIN

  In this example, users logging on to the CSUEWEST and CSUEEAST domains will be
  mapped to the PSUEDOMAIN.

- To Map a Lan Manager Domain to a Windows NT domain:

        [OTHER DOMAIN]
        CSUESOUTH=PSUEDOMAIN

  In this example, computers in the CSUESOUTH domain are mapped to the
  PSUEDOMAIN domain.

Systems Management Server 1.2 Enhancements
------------------------------------------

In Systems Management Server version 1.2, additional functionality was added to
support mapping a client to a Systems Management Server domain and site
combination, or to a specific logon server. There are three additional types of
mapping available in each section.

- To Map a Workgroup to a Domain:

        [WORKGROUP]
        CSUETEST=CSUECORP
        CSUDEV=CSUECORP

  In this example, the computers running Windows in the CSETEST and CSUDEV
  workgroups are mapped to the CSUECORP domain, and Windows NT clients whose
  machine accounts are in the CSETEST and CSUDEV domains will be mapped to the
  CSUECORP domain.


- To Map a Computer to a Logon Server:

  [MACHINE]
  CL7=\\SERVER1

  In this example, the client CL7 is mapped to the server SERVER1.

- To Map a Domain to a Site:

  [DOMAIN]
  WESTERN=CORP:S01

  In this example, clients in the WESTERN domain are mapped to the CORP domain's
  site S01.

These enhancements now allow logon scripts to be used where there are multiple
sites within a single Windows NT domain. In addition, a client can be mapped
directly to a specified server. This allows the administrator to specify which
Systems Management Server logon server will be used in domains where there are
multiple domain controllers.

For more information on the Smsls.ini file and its options, see Installing Sites
in the Administrator's Guide.
