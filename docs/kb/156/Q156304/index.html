-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start the Microsoft Exchange client with a new profile in offline mode
for the first time, the following error message appears:

  The set of folders could not be opened. You must connect to your Microsoft
  Exchange Server computer with the current profile before you can synchronize
  your folders with your offline folder file.

When you click OK, the Microsoft Exchange client opens, but any attempt to access
your mailbox results in the same error message.

The offline folder file (.OST) must be fully synchronized with the computer
running Microsoft Exchange Server in online mode before it can be used offline.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when you use the Inbox Setup Wizard to create a profile and answer
Yes to the Microsoft Exchange Server service question "Do you travel with this
computer?" The result is that a default offline folder file is created in the
system directory (that is, C:\WINDOWS\ EXCHANGE.OST for Windows or SYSTEM
FOLDER, PREFERENCES, EXCHANGE PROFILES, OFFLINE FOLDERS for Macintosh operating
systems) and the option "Choose the connection type when starting" is selected.

When you start the Microsoft Exchange client using this profile, you are
presented with the choice to connect or work offline. If you choose to work
offline, and you have not yet synchronized the .OST file, the error message
appears.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange client using this profile and connect in online
  mode to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server by one of the
  following methods:

   - For both Windows and Macintosh users: Use the client on a computer that is
     connected to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server by a LAN.

  -OR-

   - For Windows users only: Establish a dial-up connection to the computer
     running Microsoft Exchange Server prior to starting the Microsoft Exchange
     client.

2. On the Tools menu, click Synchronize and click All Folders. Allow the
  synchronization of all folders to complete before proceding.

3. Exit and log off and restart the Microsoft Exchange client in offline mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must log on to Windows 95 in order to access your offline folders. This
might simply be the Windows login or a network client like the Client for
Microsoft Networks login. Regardless, if you bypass this login (hitting Escape
or selecting Cancel) then you will not have access to the Offline Folder File.
