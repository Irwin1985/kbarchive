-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Magic School Bus Explores the World of
Animals, you may receive the following error message:

- The Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals CD-ROM is not inserted in
  your CD-ROM drive.

- The PowerToys FlexiCD tool or another program that plays CD audio is
  currently running on your computer.

- The CD Audio driver on your computer is damaged or not configured correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented. If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Insert the Program CD-ROM into Your CD-ROM Drive
------------------------------------------------

Insert the Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals CD-ROM into your CD-ROM
drive, and then attempt to restart the program.

Clean Boot Your Computer
------------------------

To clean boot your computer, use the appropriate steps for your version of
Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 98:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click System Information.

2. On the Tools menu, click System Configuration Utility.

3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:

   - Process Config.sys File
   - Process Autoexec.bat File
   - Process Winstart.bat File (if available)
   - Process Win.ini File

Microsoft Windows 95:

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, and then select Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

2. At the command prompt, type "win" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER. Press and hold down the SHIFT key until the Windows startup
  sequence is complete. This prevents any programs from being loaded
  automatically when Windows starts.

3. Quit all running programs except Explorer and Systray. To do this, follow
  these steps:

  a. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

  b. Click the program you want to quit, and then click End Task.

  c. If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not
     responding, click End Task again.

  Repeat this step until you have quit all programs except Explorer and Systray.

4. Disable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer. For
  information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
  documentation for the program.
