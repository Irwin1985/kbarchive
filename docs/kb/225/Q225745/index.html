SYMPTOMS
========

Administrators can remove any share or NTFS security permissions from a shared
device, including their own permissions to a device. In many cases, this action
could remove the only group that had permission to the resource. This
effectively leaves the shared device with no way to gain access at all, similar
to setting Everyone with "No Access".

As a safeguard, Windows NT prompts the administrator with this warning message
when removing the last user or group from NTFS security permissions to a
resource:

  You have denied everyone access to C:\share-name. Nobody will be able to
  access C:\share-name and only the owner will be able to change the
  permissions.
  Do you wish to continue?
  Yes
  No

Here is the warning message displayed when removing the last user or group from
Share permissions to a resource:

  You have denied everyone access to (Folder name). Nobody will be able to
  access (Folder name) and only the owner will be able to change the
  permissions.
  Do you wish to continue?
  Yes
  No

After performing this operation, any attempt to gain access to the folder yields
the following error message:

  C:\share-name is not accessible.
  Access is Denied.
  Retry
  Cancel

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs by design of the Windows NT operating system. The
Administrator can add and remove any user's or group's permissions to a
resource.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem and correct the Share permissions of a shared resource:

1. Double-click on My Computer to display the computer's resources.

2. Click on the share resource, example C:\Share_name.

3. On the File menu, click Properties.

4. Click the Share tab.

5. Click Permissions.

6. View the groups and users along with their permissions. Change existing share
  permissions using the Type of Access list.

7. If the group or user is not listed, click Add.

8. Select the appropriate group or user from the list by double-clicking on the
  name, then use the Type of Access list to select Full Control.

9. Click OK, and view the results on the previous screen. Click OK, and then
  click OK again on the main Properties dialog box.

10. Test the access from a client workstation to validate the shared
  permissions.

To Correct the NTFS security permissions by either adding appropriate permissions
or to Take Ownership of a shared resource:

1. Double-click My Computer to display the computer's resources.

2. Click the share resource. For example, C:\Share-name.

3. On the File menu, click Properties.

4. Click Security tab.

5. Click either the Permissions button or the Ownership button, depending on the
  desired result. Try the permissions button first.

6. View the groups and users as well as their permissions. Change existing
  permissions by using the Type of Access list.

7. If the group or user is not listed, click Add.

8. Click the appropriate group or user from the list by double-clicking on the
  name, then use the Type of Access list to select Full Control

9. Click OK, view the results on the previous screen, and then click on the
  appropriate check boxes for "Replace Permissions on Subdirectories" and
  "Replace Permissions on Existing Files". These both apply the permissions
  from the share point to sub-folders and files.

10. Then click OK, and CLICK OK again on the Main Properties page.

11. Test the access privileges to validate the NTFS permissions.

If the appropriate level of permissions has not been recovered:

1. Take Ownership is appropriate.

2. Follow steps 1 - 4 from the NTFS permissions section above.

3. Click the Ownership button.

4. A dialog box appears and displays:

  Directory Name: D:\
  Owner: Administrators
  Close
  Take Ownership
  Help

5. Click the Take Ownership button.

6. This causes the following error message to be displayed:

  One or more of the items selected is a directory. Do you want to take
  ownership of all the files and contained in the selected directories?
  Yes
  No
  Cancel

7. Click Yes, which makes the Administrators the owner of the whole directory
  structure and all of the files in it.

  Taking Ownership is also a good way to gain access to the home folder of a
  user that has left the organization. The Administrator can take ownership of
  the resource and then assigns permissions to a new user.

Note: This will also work if you install in a separate hard drive (if you cannot
boot into the system), conduct a parallel install, and then take ownership.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrators always have the ability to add themselves back to the share or
modify NTFS permissions to a shared resource. An administrator can also "Take
Ownership" of the device if all permissions have been lost.
