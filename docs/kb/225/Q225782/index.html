The information in this article applies to:

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a locally mapped shared and the IRPStackSize parameter is set too
low, you may receive the following error message:

  Not enough server storage is available to process this command.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur in the following operating systems:

- Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) or earlier

- Windows NT Terminal Server 4.0 without Service Pack 4 (SP4)

NOTE: This problem can also occur with service packs after SP3 on Windows NT 4.0
if you install certain software such as Norton AntiVirus software.

Depending on the hardware configuration of the specific computer, the default
value may not be large enough for the SRV service to properly administer shared
folders on some of the physical drives. You may see one or both of the following
event messages:

  Event ID: 2011
  Source: SRV
  Description: The server's configuration parameter "irpstacksize" is too small
  for the server to use a local device. Please increase the value of this
  parameter.

  Event ID: 0
  Source SRV
  Description: Description for Event ID 0 could not be found. It contains the
  insertion string \device\LanManServer.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can increase the IRPStackSize value. You must first add this value to the
following key if it is not already present:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters

  Value Name: IRPStackSize
  Data Type: DWORD
  Default: 0x4
  Maximum: 0xC

Increasing this value requires some memory from the non-allocated memory pool,
but the impact should not be noticeable.

NOTE: It is not always advisable to set the IRPStackSize value to its maximum of
12. Generally, you should start the value at 4 and work your way up, increasing
the value by 1 each time. The problem may still occur if the value is too high.

This error message may also occur after installing or uninstalling virus-scanning
software. You may want to remove the virus-scanning software or increase the
IRPStackSize if you need to use the software.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default IRPStackSize for Windows NT 4.0 SP3 and earlier and Windows NT
Terminal Server 4.0 is 4. The default value for SP4 is 11.
