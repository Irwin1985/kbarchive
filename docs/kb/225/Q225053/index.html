=======================================

I. 	Installation Notes
---------------------------------------

A. System Requirements
   You need 10 MB free disk space to install the Windows 95 
   Year 2000 Update. The Installation of Internet Explorer Service pack 
   2 (not necessary for all systems), if selected, will require     approximately 80 MB free disk space.

B. This Year 2000 Update is for Windows 95 only 
   This Update is not intended for use on and will not install on 
   computers running Windows 98, Windows NT, or Windows 2000. For 
   international versions of Windows 95, download and install the 
   appropriate language version for your location.

C. Before You Install the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update 
   Because the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update updates your system files 
   and requires you to restart your computer during installation, you 
   should save and close all open documents and close all programs 
   before installing the Update.

D. Anti-virus software and Installing the Year 2000 Update
   Because the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update updates some system files it 
   is recommended that you disable any anti-virus software that is 
   running. If you chose not to disable this software please accept the 
   changes made to the Command.com file when prompted by the anti-virus 
   software during installation of the Update or after restarting your 
   machine. 

II.	Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------
A. Downloading and Extracting the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update
   If you download the update from the Web site, be sure to read the 
   release notes completely before you extract and install the 
   Windows 95 Year 2000 Update. 

   After you download the Update, a compressed executable file 
   named W95y2k.exe appears on your hard drive. This executable 
   file contains the files you need to update your Windows 95 system 
   for the year 2000.

  To extract the file and install the year 2000 updates:
   1. Locate the W95y2k.exe file on your hard drive with 
      Windows Explorer
   2. Double click the file.
   3. Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

B. Advanced Installation Options
   There are several installation options available to advanced users 
   when installing the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update. You can view these 
   options at any time by clicking Start, clicking Run, typing 
   W95y2k.exe /? and then clicking OK.

   To use the optional installation parameters below, type
   W95y2k.exe &lt;option&gt;

   /Q - Quiet mode (skips all user prompts) - Useful for silent 
           installations in batch setups.
   /T: &lt;full path&gt; - Specifies a temporary working folder.
   /C - Extract files only to the folder when used also with /T - 
           Allows an administrator to download files into a specified 
           location.
   /C: &lt;cmd&gt; - Override install command defined by author (see below)

C. Additional Installation Options for Administrators
   System Administrators or Advanced users may want to simplify the 
   process of rolling out this Year 2000 Update by utilizing the 
   following options.

The syntax for the following options is:
   
   W95y2k.exe /C:"y2ksetup &lt;option&gt;" 
   Note: you must include the quotes as indicated.

  /ii - Ignore Internet Explorer version, and only install core year 
        2000 files
  /ai - Always launch Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2 setup, and
        run silently
  /nr - Never reboot, without prompting.
  /ar - Always reboot, without prompting.

D. Create a new Windows 95 Startup Disk
   After the installation of the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update you 
   should create a new Emergency Startup Disk that will reflect the 
   changes made. 

   1. Insert original startup disk in Drive A 
   2. Click on Start / Programs / MS-DOS Prompt 
   3. Type "Sys a:" without the quotes (you will receive a message 
      stating system transferred when process is complete).

   If you do not have a startup disk, do the following: 
   1. Insert blank floppy into Drive A. 
   2. Click on Start / Settings / Control Panel.
   3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs
   4. Click on the Startup Disk tab 
   5. Click Create Disk... 

III. 	Release Notes
---------------------------------------

A. If You Reinstall Windows 95
   If you have to reinstall the Windows 95 operating system, you will 
   lose the benefits of the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update installation. 
   Any time you have to reinstall Windows 95, run the Windows 95 Year 
   2000 Update installation again.

B. Windows 95 Startup Disk
   Follow the instructions above in section II to create a new Startup 
   Disk (also called Emergency Boot Disk) after installing the Year 
   2000 Update.
  
   If you do not update your Startup Disk, using it to replace the boot 
   files on your system (using the SYS command) will install a version 
   of the system file Command.com which has not been updated for year 
   2000. You can run the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update again to install 
   the correct version of Command.com on your system. 

C. Changes to Network Settings
   This update installs a new year 2000-ready version of the file vdhcp.386. 
   This network system file will be overwritten by an older version from your 
   Windows 95 CD or disks if you make changes to your networking settings. 
   For instance, if you install a new network adaptor, setup an online service, 
   or make changes in Control Panel\Network, your original version of 
   vdhcp.386 will be copied to your system.
   If this occurs, run the Windows 95 Year 2000 Update again to install the 
   correct version of vdhcp.386.   

IV. 	What Are the Year 2000 Issues in Windows 95? 
-------------------------------------------------

The issues listed below are resolved by installing this Update.

1.  Find "File or Folders" Dialog (shell32.dll)
    The Date tab in Find "File or Folders" dialog displays the year 
    in YY format. This format results in incorrect displays for years 
    greater than 2000. For example, entering 03/20/2003 will 
    incorrectly display 03/20/C3. However this does not effect the 
    search. When searching for files changed within a certain date 
    range, enter a 2-digit or 4-digit date and the search will be 
    performed based on the dates entered. This file will be updated 
    only if you are running Windows 95 version 950 or 950a. This 
    issue does not exist in later Windows 95 versions.

2.  Windows File Manager (winfile.exe) 
    Windows File Manager does not display or sort dates beyond the 
    year 2000 correctly. When using Windows File Manager to view the 
    contents of folders, and you have selected to view "all file 
    details", the dates of files created in the year 2000 and beyond 
    may appear as follows:

    January 1st, 2000 would appear as 1/1/;1

    February 3rd, 2023 would appear as 2/3/&gt;3

    March 5th, 2036 would appear as 3/5/=6

3.  Command Interpreter (command.com)
    The DATE command (internal to COMMAND.COM) does not 
    correctly handle 2-digit dates from 00-79. Entering 2-digit dates 
    within this range returns the error "Invalid Date".

4.  Date/Time Picker (comctl32.dll). 
    Previously, when you set your Regional Settings in the Control 
    Panel to handle years as two digits, the Date/Time Picker function 
    did not correctly reflect the date.  This update addresses that 
    issue.

5.  Phone Dialer applet (dialer.exe)
    The Show View Call Log option doesn't display the date properly 
    after successful completion of a telephone call. If the system 
    date is adjusted to the year 2000, the date is displayed as 100,
    101,102, and so on. 

    For example, in the year 2000, you make a call using the Dialer 
    applet. The log file created or appended to after the completion 
    of the phone connection displays the year portion of the call date 
    incorrectly, such as 101, 102, 103, and so on.

6.  Time and Date Control Panel applet  (timedate.cpl)
    When you select the date February 29 and change the year using the 
    up and down arrows in the Date/Time Properties dialog box, the 
    calendar displays February 29 every year, whether it's a leap year 
    or not. This is a display issue in the applet.

7.  DHCP Virtual Driver (vdhcp.386)
    Winipcfg /all - IP Leases obtained on or after 3/01/2000 are 
    reported as being obtained the previous day. The system date is 
    displayed properly but the DHCP client reports a date one day 
    prior. 

    For example, if you log on to a LAN after March 1, 2000, and you 
    run Winipcfg /all from Start\Run or Ipconfig /all from a DOS VM, 
    the lease obtained date is one day behind. After 2/28/2000, the 
    lease obtained date is one day behind the expected date.

8.  Microsoft Foundation Class Library file (mfc40.dll)
    After the year 2000, programs that use the built in operators of 
    the COleDateTime class may incorrectly parse a date . For example, 
    02/05/2000 may display as 2/05/100. Microsoft has modified the 
    COleDateTime class so that it is less sensitive to program 
    assumptions.

9.  DOS Xcopy (xcopy.exe, xcopy32.exe)
    When using xcopy in real mode with the optional parameter /D:date, 
    xcopy does not accept years entered as two digits, except for the 
    years 80 through 99. The message "Invalid date" is displayed. When
    using xcopy in protected mode (from within Windows) two-digit 
    dates are accepted but are recognized as being within the 20th 
    century (02/05/01 is seen as 02/05/1901).

10. Microsoft Run Time Library file (msvcrt40.dll) 
    Some applications that utilize this runtime library may behave 
    as if the current time is one hour earlier than the correct time 
    shown on the Windows clock. The problem will continue for one 
    week from April 1 through April 8, 2001, after which these 
    applications will shift to daylight savings time and again be in 
    sync with the operating system. The problem results from the fact 
    that April 1, 2001, falls on a Sunday, which confused a small 
    algorithm in the run time library file that checks for the start 
    of daylight savings time.This is not a year 2000 issue but rather 
    a daylight savings time issue. It could occur in the years 1973, 
    1979, 1984, 1990, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2018, 2029, and 2035. What is 
    common about these years is that April 1st falls on a Sunday.

11. OLE AUTOMATION (oleaut32.dll, olepro32.dll, stdole2.tlb, asycfilt.dll) 
    The Microsoft Automation library contains routines for interpreting 
    two digit years and provides a convenient way for applications to 
    create unambiguous (serial) dates. In Windows 95 the current two 
    digit year cutoff is 1999. This means that two digit years beginning 
    with 00 will be interpreted as being in the 20th century, i.e. 1/1/00 
    is converted to 1/1/1900


V.	Updating Microsoft Internet Explorer
------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 95 Year 2000 Update will check your system for Microsoft 
Internet Explorer.  If a version of Internet Explorer prior to version 
4.01 Service Pack 2 is detected you will see a message explaining that it 
is necessary to install Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2 to correct 
several minor year 2000 issues. If you are already using Internet Explorer 
version 4.01 Service Pack 2 or a later version of Internet Explorer, or if 
you do not use Microsoft Internet Explorer as your browser, the Internet 
Explorer components below do not need to be updated. 
For more information about Microsoft Internet Explorer and year 2000 go to
http:www.microsoft.com/ie 

Note: The download time for Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2 can be 
about 2 hours for a Standard installation, depending on the speed of your 
Internet connection.

If you are using a version of Internet Explorer prior to 4.01 Service 
Pack 2 the issues listed below are corrected by installing this Update.

For Internet Explorer 4.0X the following issues are addressed:

1. Microsoft Virtual Machine
   Year 2000 issues have been reported in connection with Java 
   virtual machines based on the Sun Microsystems Java Development 
   Kit versions 1.1.1 through 1.1.5. Applications written in Java 
   that make use of the java.txt.SimpleDateFormat class library may 
   handle 4-digit dates incorrectly.

   For example, if you have a Java applet or application that uses 
   SimpleDateFormat and you enter four digits for the year, the date 
   functions may truncate the year and use only the first two digits 
   (for example, 2000 might become 20).

2. Microsoft Wallet (actpmnt.ocx)
   When entering credit card information in versions of Microsoft 
   Wallet earlier than version 2.1.1383, you must enter the month, 
   day, and year for expiration dates beyond the year 2000. Otherwise, 
   information may not be handled as expected. 

   For example, entering a credit card with an expiration date of 
   1/01 is handled as January 1 of the current year. This behavior 
   was changed in Microsoft Wallet version 2.1.1383 and later.  

3. Microsoft Data Access (msdadc.dll, msadce.dll)
   The msdadc.dll file is part of the OLE DB core components and a 
   part of the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). If you code 
   to ADO, and your ADO Recordset includes Date data types, such as 
   adDate, adDBDate, adFileTime, or adDBTimeStamp, and you're using 
   a date format in which periods are used instead of slashes for 
   date separator (for example, 01.01.98 instead of 01/01/98), and 
   you specify a year less than 60, then Data Convert (msdadc.dll) 
   might translate your date as a time. 
   For example, 01.01.01 (January 1, 2001) might be converted to 
   01:01:01 (December 30, 1899, 1:01:01A.M.).

   For more information about OLE DB compliance, visit the Microsoft 
   Web site at http://www.microsoft.com/year2000.

   1. Click Product Guide.
   2. In Compliance Information for Microsoft Products, select 
      Microsoft OLE DB. Under Data Access, select Microsoft OLE DB.
   3. Click Search, and the latest compliance documentation will be 
      displayed.

For Internet Explorer 3.0x the following issues are addressed:

1. If a web site uses a cookie with a 2-digit year of "00", Internet 
   Explorer recognized the cookie as expired. Cookies with 4-digit 
   expiration dates, or expiration dates before and after the year 
   2000 are not affected. 

2. If a web server communicates a 2-digit year of "00" in its HTTP/1.0 
   header, Internet Explorer will recognize pages on that site as 
   expired and not cache them locally. Browsing of the site will work 
   normally while connected, but will not be available for offline 
   browsing. HTTP/1.1 headers, headers with a 4-digit year, or headers 
   containing 2-digit years before and after the year 2000 are not 
   affected. 

3. If you change your control panel settings (International -&gt; Use 
   Century format (1990 vs 90)) and browse to an FTP server with files 
   created in 2000 (according to the server), IE will display the files 
   as created in 1900. 

4. The Javascript getYear() function/method calculates the year "00" 
   (2000) as "100", and the year "01" (2001) as "101" etc. Scripts 
   will need modifications to work around this issue. 

1. The date function (java.util.date) in the Microsoft VM based on Sun 
   Microsystems Java Development Kit 1.0.2 does not interpret two digit 
   dates correctly. The function maps a two-digit date to the 1900s and 
   doesn't take into consideration the year 2000.

Note:
During the setup of Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2, if you choose 
the Installation Option "Browser Only Installation" rather than the 
default "Standard Installation", the updated files that correct the above 
year 2000 issues will not be installed. The "Browser Only Installation" 
will install only a subset of the entire Internet Explorer Service Pack 
and will not update your system for the above year 2000 issues. You 
should choose either the default Installation Option of "Standard 
Installation" or choose "Full Installation" to ensure that all updated 
files and Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2 components are installed 
on your system.


VI. 	Additional Issues
-------------------------------------
A. Microsoft Jet Database Engine 3.0 and Microsoft OFFICE 95
   When you try to synchronize two members of a replica set that was 
   created before the year 2000, and the current date on your computer 
   is after the year 2000, a synchronization message might appear. This 
   is because of how the expression service mishandles date entries in 
   the MSysExchangeLog table in replicas. When a replica set created 
   before the year 2000 is compacted after the year 2000, exchange 
   information relating to synchronizations after the year 2000 is 
   deleted from the MSysExchangeLog table. After this information is 
   deleted, the generation information in the MSysExchangeLog table and 
   the MSysGenHistory table does not match, and the replicas cannot be 
   synchronized. To resolve this issue, download the latest Microsoft 
   Office 95 Service Release from the Microsoft Web site at 
   http://office.microsoft.com.
