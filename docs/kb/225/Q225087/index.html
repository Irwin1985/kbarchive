IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article is a guide for writing custom .ADM files for use with System Policy
Editor. System Policy Editor's interface, comprised of all of the books, check
boxes, and text boxes you see when you open a computer or user of group policy,
is created with a template. The system policy template, or ADM file, is a simple
program that instructs System Policy Editor what books, check boxes, and other
input controls to present to the administrator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Templates Specify the Registry Change 
-------------------------------------

There are two default templates included when you install Windows NT. They are
Common.adm and Winnt.adm. These files use the Class, Keyname, and Valuename
variables to allow you to manipulate specific Windows NT policy activities on
computers running Windows NT. The following is an explanation of these variables
and how they can be used to create your own policy files.

- CLASS (Machine or User)

  The Machine or User keywords are used in the following manner:

   - The Machine keyword controls the entries in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive.

   - The User keyword controls the entries in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive.

CLASS (Machine or User): The CLASS variable specifies the handle registry key
where the policy is implemented. There are two handle keys that can be modified
by System Policy Editor: LOCAL_MACHINE and CURRENT_USER. CLASS MACHINE specifies
a LOCAL_MACHINE policy change and CLASS USER specifies a CURRENT_USER policy
change.

When you open the Winnt.adm file, the CLASS MACHINE entry appears at the
beginning. Every policy after that is implemented in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and
appears as a computer policy in the System Policy Editor interface. Below the
CLASS MACHINE entry in the Winnt.adm file, the CLASS USER command appears. From
this point forward, policies are implemented in HKEY_CURRENT_USER and appear as
a user or group policy in the System Policy Editor interface.

- KEYNAME

   - Remaining path to change a registry value

  KEYNAME: The KEYNAME variable specifies the remaining path to the location
  where the registry value is added or changed. For example:

  CATEGORY !!Login_Policies

  POLICY !!LogonBanner

  

  KEYNAME "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"

  PART !!LogonBanner_Caption

  

  

  EDITTEXT
  VALUENAME "LegalNoticeCaption"
  MAXLEN 255
  DEFAULT !!LogonBanner_DefCaption
  END PART

  PART !!LogonBanner_Text

  

  

  EDITTEXT
  VALUENAME "LegalNoticeText"
  MAXLEN 255
  DEFAULT !!LogonBanner_DefText
  END PART

  END POLICY

  The location of this change in the registry is the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive as
  specific by the CLASS variable. The key location, Software\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon, is specified by the KEYNAME variable.

- VALUENAME

   - The Value keyword is created or changed in the registry.

      - REG_SZ (default)

      - NUMERIC = DWORD or BINARY data change

  VALUENAME: The VALUENAME variable specifies the values of the registry keys
  that are added or changed. In the example above, the logon banner policy
  requires two registry changes. The value LegalNoticeCaption is added or
  changed and the value LegalNoticeText is added or changed in the example
  above.

  By default, the string value type is REG_SZ. You can override that setting by
  adding the keyword NUMERIC. All numeric values are typed into a policy
  template in a decimal format. The value is then stored in the registry as
  BINARY and DWORD.

  Remember that the data stored in those values is determined by the
  administrator and whatever that person types into the text boxes in System
  Policy Editor.

Converting a Registry Change into ADM Keywords
----------------------------------------------

The biggest challenge may be finding a useful registry change that you want to
distribute. For example, take the following change that allows you to move the
printer spool folder. Remember that before you point the spool to a new folder,
that folder must be created. You can then make the following change to the
registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the DefaultSpoolDirectory value under the following key in the
  registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click String, type "X:\&lt;Pathname&gt;" (without the
  quotation marks) (for example, D:\Printing), and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

This change to the registry must be converted into a template format so that HKEY
becomes CLASS (Machine or User), Key becomes KEYNAME, and Value becomes
VALUENAME (followed by NUMERIC if the type is BINARY or DWORD).

Creating an ADM File:

ADM files can be created with any text editor.

Create a file following the block-structure syntax of the *.adm language:

- Quotation marks around terms with spaces

- Block structures have a beginning and an end

- Save with *.adm extension (not .txt)

To create a ADM file template:

1. Start NotePad or any text editor to create your template.

2. Create an .ADM file following the rules outlined above. For example:

  CLASS MACHINE

  CATEGORY "How To Test"

  

  POLICY "Change Spool Directory"

  

  

  KEYNAME "System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers"
  PART "Spool Directory"
  EDITTEXT
  VALUENAME "DefaultSpoolDirectory"
  END PART

  

  END POLICY

  END CATEGORY

Spacing does not matter. If a name has a space in it, it must be surrounded by
quotation marks. As a good practice, surround all labels, keynames, and
valuenames with quotation marks. Remember to save the file with a .ADM
extension.

Loading the Template into System Policy Editor:

1. Start the System Policy Editor tool. Click Start, point to Programs, point to
  Administrative Tools, and then click System Policy Editor. An empty window is
  displayed. If any icons are displayed, click Closeon the File menu. You must
  quit the program as you cannot load another .ADM file while any policy files
  (or the registry) are open for editing or viewing purposes.

2. On the Options menu, click Policy Template to display the Policy Template
  Options window. Notice the two .ADM files discussed earlier are already
  loaded.

3. Click Add, go to the location of the file to be loaded, click the file, click
  Open, and then click OK.

4. On the File menu, click New Policy to display the System Policy Editor
  window.

5. Double-click Default Computer because the .ADM file uses the CLASS MACHINE
  variable and keyword, which is for the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry hive.

The How To Test entry that was created earlier is now displayed. You can now set
this entry with a system policy that affects whatever computers you choose.

REFERENCES
==========

Terms and Abbreviations
-----------------------

System Policy Editor (SPE): The tool needed to load the .pol file and apply .adm
files.

ADM files: The templates used to change current registry settings.

!!Strings: The text variables in the .adm file.

CATEGORY: The "Books" of Policy Groupings.

POLICY: Used to create the check box entry needed to alter registry values.

PART: Used for the Input Control of the required policy.

The Winnt.adm file creates the interface used in the example above. The following
list explains the keywords that create the interface.

!!STRINGS: The are several lines that begin with "!!". The "!!" denotes a string
variable and is followed by the variables name, !!stringname. The strings are
defined at the bottom of the policy template. If you scroll to the bottom of the
file, you see a section similar to the following:

  [strings]
  System = Windows NT System
  Login_Policies = Logon
  LogonBanner_DefText = "&lt;User created text&gt;" (without the quotation
  marks)

The variable !!SYSTEM in the body of the template maps to Windows NT System,
which is visible in the interface. Having a section of strings allows the
descriptions to be replaced easily. This is particularly useful when you
translate the files into other languages. Otherwise, you may just want to embedd
the text in the body of the template.

CATEGORY: This defines a grouping of similar policies. The CATEGORY keyword
creates an expandable and collapsible book in the SPE interface, and CATEGORIES
can nest within each other. CATEGORY is used solely for organizational purposes,
and you can create as many or as few categories as you require.

POLICY: This keyword creates the check box entry which, if selected, creates an
instruction for a registry change. If cleared, it creates an instruction for a
different registry change (usually a deletion). If the check box is unavailable,
it does not create an instruction in the policy file.

PARTs: Some registry changes are accomplished by implementing or clearing a
policy. Other registry changes are more complex. For example, to create a logon
banner (the policy), an administrator must indicate what goes in the title bar
of the window and what goes in the body of the window. These additional pieces
of information are gathered by the PARTs variable.

PART: This creates an input control in the lower part of the policy dialog box. A
large variety of control windows can be created with this.

CATEGORY, POLICY, and PART create the backbone of the SPE interface. Each is a
container. CATEGORY can contain categories and policies. POLICIES can contain
parts. Because this is a structured programming language, when you begin one
structure or container, you also need to end it.

END - END CATEGORY, END POLICY, and END PART: An END command is required to
designate the end of each of the respective structures. You do not need to name
the category that is ending. It is determined based on the nesting level.
Starting and ending each container properly provides for the correct nested
structures.

Types of PARTs: There are numerous types of PARTs, which allows you to be
creative in designing system policies. For example, the logon banner caption and
text are both text boxes. This input control is created with the keyword
EDITTEXT, which itself is modified with the optional keywords MAXLEN (to
designate the maximum length of input), and DEFAULT (to create a default,
suggested data for the administrator's input). So the SPE interface is created
with CATEGORIES, POLICIES, and PARTS. An administrator indicates preferences by
implementing or clearing policies, and sometimes typing information into input
controls called PARTs.
