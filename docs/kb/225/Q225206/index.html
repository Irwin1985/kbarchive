SUMMARY

The purpose of this article is to provide some tips on basic troubleshooting of
mail delivery problems caused by recent network changes.

Problem
-------

After working properly for some time, the Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent
(MTA) may have difficulties sending messages to other servers in the same
Exchange Server site. This may be because the Exchange Server computer's
connection to the network infrastructure has changed. The following events may
be logged when the network connectivity has been changed, and the MTA
experiences remote procedure call (RPC) errors when trying to connect to other
Exchange Servers computers:

  Application Log Events:

  Event ID: 1153
  Description:
  An interoperability error occurred. A reliable transport service element
  (RTSE) error occurred. Incorrect session protocol data unit (SPDU).
  SPDU ID 29, SPDU field in error 41. [PLATFORM RTSE 34 151](14)

  Event ID: 1209
  Description:
  Unable to recognize an internal message identifier (LPI) from entity. The
  incorrect LPI is 108-1-5. Control block index 32. [PLATFORM KERNEL 27 62]
  (14)

  Event ID: 1198
  Description:
  An error occurred while processing an association to entity.
  Presentation error: state check failure. Current state 0, service type 20,
  service flavor 2 Control block index 33. The association will be terminated
  and restarted if necessary. [PLATFORM KERNEL 31 108] (14)

  Event ID: 1222
  Description:
  An error occurred while processing an association with entity. Session error:
  state check failure. Current state 7. NIST defined current event 6. Control
  block index 33. The association will be terminated and restarted if
  necessary. [PLATFORM KERNEL 31 82] (14)

  Event ID 1001:
  There has been an association error with entity:. The internal connection
  handle (LPT) is incorrect. The incorrect LPI is 1-13-33.
  Control block index 2004 [PLATFORM RTSE 34 146] (14)

  Event ID 9277: The MTA has issued an RPC Cancel call for thread 1, Locality
  Table

  ncacn_ip_tcp:166.35.134.1[1092] BASE IL] (14)

  Event ID: 9322
  Description:
  An interface error has occurred. An MtaBindBack over RPC has failed.
  Locality Table (LTAB) index: 213, NT/MTA error code: 9260. Comms error BASE
  IL, Bind error INCOMING RPC, Remote Server Name 106, Protocol String 507 [%7
  %8 %9 %10] (14)

  Event ID: 25
  Description:
  An internal error occurred while transferring a message or report.
  [2474Receive RT-TRANSFER ind Send - pop-mta has the turn MTA XFER-IN 21 58]
  (14)

  Event ID: 1131
  Description:
  An interoperability error occurred with entity
  /O=ORG/OU=USAE001/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=BRB45/CN=MICROSOFT MTA. A
  reliable transport service element (RTSE) error occurred. There is an
  incorrect internal connector handle (LPI) on the message. The incorrect LPI
  is 1-13-37. Control block index 2004. [PLATFORM RTSE 33 147] (14)

The MTA may log the above events when the Exchange Server computer's connection
to the network infrastructure is unreliable.

Examples of where network configuration may cause message delivery problems:

- The Exchange Server computer has been moved to a new Ethernet switch port
  that auto-senses network speed. However, the Exchange Server computer's
  network interface card (NIC) is configured to force full-duplex communication
  at 100-megabit network transfer speeds.

- Both the Ethernet switch port and the Exchange Server computer's NIC are
  configured to force 100-MB full-duplex communication. However, the Ethernet
  switch or the network card may be having trouble communicating at that rate
  or using full-duplex transmissions.

The following are some tips to troubleshoot network connectivity as a cause for
message delivery problems:

1. If there is another nearly identical Exchange Server computer connected to
  the same model of Ethernet switch as the problem server, try trading the
  Exchange Server computers' switch ports. If after doing so, the problem
  server can successfully send and receive mail, compare the configurations of
  the two Ethernet switch port for differences.

2. If step 1 does not resolve the issue, then compare the two Exchange Server
  computers' network card configurations to see if there are differences. Also
  verify that the same version or date of the network card driver is being used
  on both servers. Change the problem server's network card configuration to be
  the same as that of the working Exchange Server computer.

3. If there is not an identical working Exchange Server computer to examine for
  comparisons or if mail flow must be established immediately, connect the
  problem Exchange Server computer to a half-duplex 10-MB Ethernet switch port
  or hub to see if mail flow can be established.

In the Exchange Server's system event log, you may observe the following event
IDs:

  Event ID: 5716
  Description:
  The partial synchronization replication of the SAM database from the primary
  domain controller failed with the following error: "The remote procedure call
  failed."

  Event ID: 3013
  Description:
  The redirector has timed out a request to Server01.

  Event ID: 5719
  Description:
  No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain LCORP. (This event is
  expected and can be ignored when booting with the 'No Net' Hardware Profile.)
  The following error occurred: "There are currently no logon servers available
  to service the logon request."

These events indicate that the Windows NT services such as the replication
service are experiencing similar difficulties using the network.
