SUMMARY
=======

This "More Information" section of this article lists Polaris SNA Link Service
and Device Driver error codes that may be posted to the event log.

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Event 23

These codes correspond to a connection failure reported by the link service
to SNA Server.  SNA Server posts an Event 23 message containing one of the
following outage codes:

Common codes:

0003 - Mainframe disconnected connection.  This can happen when the
      mainframe is IPLed or the PU is deactivated in VTAM.
0004 - Unable to open the link, probably because it is not online with the
      mainframe.
0005 - There was a fault on the channel.

These codes indicate an operating-system failure or link service program error:

0001 - ProcessLink Wait failed.
0002 - Unable to query driver event.
0008 - Driver reported an unknown event.
0009 - Driver was unable to send the reply to the XID.
000B - WriteFileEx failed - we could not send a write buffer to the
      driver (mainframe read data).
000C - ReadFileEx failed - we could not send a read buffer to the
      driver (mainframe write data).
000D - Unable to expand a packet into elements.
000E - Unable to expand XID into elements.
000F - Invalid SNA event on hold queue.

For the following codes, refer to the driver errors below:

001A
001B
001C
001D
0019
0020

For example, if you see code 0020, you should look for it in the list
below.  In the case of 0020, which is really 0x20 (hex), it means
system reset.  

Event 394

These errors correspond to errors reported by the driver to the link
service and usually appear as Event 394 from the SNA CHANNEL Link.
The message includes the text "Device Driver Reported Error XX."  As
mentioned above, some of these errors are also reported as the link
failure code in Event 23.

Polaris 3174 Device Driver Error Codes

(1) Hardware or software problem.  If hard rebooting does not fix it
   or it occurs regularly, then there is probably a serious problem
   that we should be made aware of.

(2) This error code is not currently used.

0x00 - Normal status

0x01 - Invalid device for call (1)

0x02 - Invalid state (1)

0x03 - InExec is set (1)

0x04 - InExec did not clear (1)

0x05 - Invalid Buffer size (1)

0x06 - Unable to set event (1)

0x07 - Failed DownLoadM
      The driver could not download the microcode.
      ESCON: down6900.bin
      BUS &amp; TAG: downms.bin

0x08 - Failed DownLoadX
      The driver could not download the FPGA
      ESCON: down960f.bin
      BUS &amp; TAG: downxs.bin

0x09 - Failed NonInteractive Diag

0x0A - Invalid number of devices configured
      Likely too many devices have been configured in the link
      service configuration.

0x0B - Did not find unit (1)

0x0C - The channel interface could not go online because the channel is down.
      Make sure all devices are varied online.

0x0D - ChExec did not clear (1)

0x0E - CuExec did not clear (1)

0x0F - Could not insert Queue. (1)

0x10 - Could not go online because online switch is offline.
      Check the online switch.

0x11 - Unexpected InitFunc error. (1)

0x12 - DRQ did not clear. (1)

0x13 - Fifo did not set. (1)

0x14 - WAITDMA did not clear. (1)

0x15 - Wrong state to set up DMA. (2)

0x16 - Unexpected ChFunc error. (1)

0x17 - Unable to call IoAllocateAdapterChannel. (1)

0x18 - No MDl available. (1)

0x19 - Offline due to SYSRESET.
      The mainframe issued a system reset.

0x1A - Offline due to ILIFUNC. (1)
      The driver issued an illegal function to the board.

0x1B - Offline due to FAULT (ESCON).

0x1C - Offline due to SWITCH.
      The Offline switch was put in the offline position while the
      board was online.

0x1D - Offline due to TOUT.
      The board went offline because the driver was unable to respond
      to an interrupt within a few seconds.  This can happen if the
      Windows NT Server is frozen for a few seconds or more, which in turn
      could be caused by excessive network traffic or a network outage.

0x1E - Selective reset
      May indicate a protocol problem, wrong device address or
      invalid status from the Channel Interface.

0x1F - Interface disconnect
      The Channel has sent an Interface Disconnect frame.  The
      Channel Interface has aborted the current operation.

0x20 - System Reset (ESCON).  Indicates that all devices associated with an
      image need to be reset.  The Channel Interface does not go offline.
      This can happen when the mainframe is being IPLed, or perhaps when
      the CHPID is taken down.

0x21 - Error retry req (ESCON) (2)

0x22 - Selective reset with UC (ESCON)
      Selective Reset with Unit Check.  Usually indicates a sequence
      problem, wrong device address, invalid status or other channel
      error.

0x23 - Data Transfer Parity Error (B/T)

0x24 - Command Parity Error (B/T)

0x25 - Command Retry rejected error
      Channel did not accept Command Retry.

0x26 - Selective reset with overrun Error (ESCON)
      Selective-Reset w/ Overrun.  Usually indicates a sequence
      problem, wrong device address, invalid status or other channel
      error.  Should not normally occur.

0x27 - Data streaming error (B/T)

0x28 - command table error (1)

0x29 - retry count expired (ESCON)
      Could indicate that a command was unable to complete due to a
      link level failure and the link level retry count expired or
      if status is attempted when the path to a control unit image is
      no longer valid.  The Channel Interface will go offline when
      this error occurs.

0x30 - Bad status (1)

0x31 - Unexpected CuFunc error (1)

0x32 - PMF_VALID or PMF_ASTABED not set (ESCON)
      The driver was told to go ready on a device that is on an image
      that is not defined to the board.

0x33 - DMA not done (2)

0x34 - Wrong Read Start
      VTAM issued a READ START command that was not expected.  If the
      driver is configured to resend data, then it will.

0x35 - Wrong Write Start (2)

0x36 - Invalid Control Unit Image (ESCON)

0x37 - Unable to get microcode traces

0x38 - Read Start before the end of a read chain

0x39 - not enough map registers (2)

0x40 - not enough map registers (2)

0x41 - could not allocate retransmit buffer

0x42 - previous DMA not done (2)

0x43 - DMA not done (2)

0x44 - illegal command
      The driver received a command from the mainframe that is not
      defined for a 3174.

0x45 - invalid LPDB (2)

0x46 - spurious interrupt
      The board interrupted the driver but when the driver tried
      to determine the reason for the interrupt none was found.

0x47 - link error (ESCON)
      An error occurred during ESCON link level frame processing.

0x48 - link level recoverable error (ESCON)
      ESCON link level errors occurred but were recovered from.

0x49 - CHEXEC cleared while waiting for FIFO OK (1)

0x4A - spurious interrupt
      The board interrupted the driver but when the driver tried
      to determine the reason for the interrupt none was found.

0x4B - unknown CUERR (1)

0x4C - unexpected READ
      The mainframe issued a READ even though we have no buffers
      available.  The mainframe should not issue a READ until we
      send a status indicating that we have buffers available.

0x4D - unexpected WRITE START
      VTAM issued a WRITE START command that was not expected.  This
      could indicate that VTAM is resending data or that the
      SNA Server has been stopped and started without the PU being
      deactivated on the mainframe.  This is only a problem if it
      occurs repeatedly while PUs are active.

0x4E - wait for INEXEC to clear while getting MCode trace #1 (1)

0x4F - wait for INEXEC to clear while getting MCode trace #2 (1)

0x50 - wait for INEXEC to clear while getting MCode trace #3 (1)

0x51 - invalid header while getting MCode trace (1)

0x52 - wait for INEXEC to clear while getting MCode trace #4 (1)

0x53 - wait for INEXEC to clear while getting MCode trace #5 (1)

0x54 - illegal unaligned DMA (1)

0x55 - unaligned read buffer passed down (mainframe write) (1)

0x56 - unaligned write buffer passed down (mainframe read) (1)

0xE0 - Tried to change global parameters while online (1)

0xE1 - Online switch is offline

0xE2 - Tried to go online when with no valid addresses specified (1)

0xE3 - Invalid image address specified for online (1)

0xE4 - No image address specified in the image table for online (1)

0xE5 - Illegal path management function code (1)

0xE6 - Microcode programming error (1)

0xE7 - Channel is down

0xE8 - Link level error detected

0xE9 - Unable to add image

0xEA - Cannot enable FPGA for download

0xEB - FPGA configuration failed
