-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Move Server Wizard may stop responding if it is
run on a dedicated Exchange Server public folder server that the private
information store has been removed from (by using the Exchange Server
Administrator program).

CAUSE
=====

The Move Server Wizard does not verify that a private information store exists
before the wizard runs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, stop the Exchange Server Information Store service,
rename the current Mdbdata folder to Mdbdata.old, and then create a new folder
with the name Mdbdata. This is acceptable in this case because the Move Server
Wizard is used to change only the Dir.edb databases; the Move Server Wizard does
not modify or move the public folders. In addition, this server does not use the
private information store.

After you create the new empty Mdbdata folder and restart the Microsoft Exchange
Server Information Store service, Exchange Server creates a new private database
(Priv.edb) and public database (Pub.edb), and may also create log files if
logging is set to the same drive as the databases.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you run the Move Server Wizard on a dedicated public folder server, make
sure that you create a verified full online backup and use the Microsoft
Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook to copy the public folder contents.

If the sole purpose of a server is to be a dedicated public folder server, you
can remove the private information store from the server. The primary function
of the Move Server Wizard is to update objects in the directory and private
information store. If the private information store has been removed, the Move
Server Wizard only modifies the directory database. You do not receive any error
messages until the end of the move, when the wizard tries to start the
information store. When Exchange Server tries to restart the information store,
the following error message is displayed several times:

  Microsoft Exchange Move Server Wizard
  The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely
  fashion.
  Microsoft Windows NT
  ID no 0xc002041d

The following error message may also be displayed:

  Microsoft Exchange Move Server Wizard
  A fatal error occurred. Exchange move server was unable to recover from this
  error. You must restore this server from backup. Error c002041d.

When you open Services in Control Panel, the Information Store service is not
running. When you try to start the Information Store service, the following
error message is displayed:

  The Microsoft Exchange Information Store Service returned service specific
  error 1276.

The following event may also be logged in the application event log:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: Service Control Manager
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 7024
  Description: "The Microsoft Exchange Information Store Service returned
  service specific error 1276."
