-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an e-mail message to a known Exchange Server address, you may
receive a non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the following:

  

  Date: Mon, 17 Jan 2000 16:49:25 -0500
  From: System Administrator&lt;postmaster@testdomain.Microsoft.com&gt;
  To: user@testdomain2.microsoft.com
  Subject: Undeliverable: test

  Your message

 To:      testuser@microsoft.com
 Subject: test
 Sent:    Mon, 17 Jan 2000 16:48:45 -0500

  did not reach the following recipient(s):

  testuser@microsoft.com on Mon, 17 Jan 2000 16:49:22 -0500
   The recipient name is ambiguous.  
     The MTS-ID of the original message is: c=US;a= 
  ;p=Microsoft;l=user110001172149D1FCA2JL
   MSEXCH:IMS:Microsoft:testdomain:SERVER1 0 (000C0595) Ambiguous Recipient

You may also receive the following error message when you try to create a
recipient by using the Exchange Server Administrator program:

  This e-mail address already exists in this organization Microsoft Exchange
  Administrator ID no: c10312e7

If the message is SMTP based, an event ID 10000 similar to the following may also
be logged in the application event log of a server that hosts an Internet Mail
Service:

  Event ID: 10000
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Type: Error
  Category: Addressing
  Description: A message was not delivered because the following address was not
  unique:
  testuser@microsoft.com

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because addresses must be unique across an Exchange Server
organization, and so an address (for example, testuser@testdomain.microsoft.com)
can only exist once in the organization. However, if the same address is created
on two separate servers before replication is established or before replication
has time to finish, it is possible to have two objects with the same address.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, export the global address list from the server that is
producing the error. Make sure that you include mailboxes, distribution lists,
and custom recipients, as well as hidden objects. Also make sure that "E-mail
Addresses" and "Secondary-Proxy-Addresses" exist in the header of the export
file with the other fields to be exported. Import the .csv file that is created
into Microsoft Excel and search for the location of the conflicting directory
entries. You can then alter or delete the objects, as appropriate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about how to export the directory, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q155414 XADM: Bulk Import/Export FAQ

If the initial export does not produce the objects that you want, you may need to
export the e-mail addresses that are associated with Public Folder objects. For
additional information about how to export the e-mail addresses that are
associated with Public Folder objects, click the article number below to view
