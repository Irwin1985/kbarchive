The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server

SYMPTOMS
========

On March 31, 2000, Microsoft re-released this patch to address a variant of this
vulnerability. In addition to the information below, the latest variant, even
after applying the original patch, could allow a malicious user to read the
source of selected files on the server that normally get server-side processing
(most notably, .ASP files). While the original vulnerability affects Windows NT
4.0 and Windows 2000, this variant only affects Windows NT 4.0. You do not need
to reapply the patch to Windows 2000-based computers.

The ISAPI filter that implements the hit-highlighting (also known as "WebHits")
functionality does not adequately constrain what files can be requested. If you
provide a deliberately-malformed argument in a request to hit-highlight a
document, it is possible to escape the virtual folder. This can allow someone
without permissions to read any file residing on the same logical drive of the
server that contains the Web Root folder. It does not allow anyone without
permissions to add or modify files.
