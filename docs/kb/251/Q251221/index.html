IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

You can configure WINS to pull or push only special groups (Internet Groups) and
domain&lt;0x1B&gt; names. This article describes how to configure specific
domains to replicate WINS databases.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

A domain&lt;0x1B&gt; name is a unique multi-homed name registered by the Primary
Domain Controller (PDC) of each domain.

Internet Groups are user defined groups that store up to 25 members.
By default a space character (0x20) is appended to the Internet group name as the
16th byte.

You can configure WINS servers to replicate only domain&lt;1B&gt; names or
Internet group names. This can be useful if you need to replicate names relevant
to certain DNS domains.
Domain specific information would not need to be replicated to other WINS
servers. Only 1B names and user defined groups would need to be replicated to
allow a client to query its WINS server to get information(DCs and members in
user defined Internet groups) that spans multiple DNS domains, one or more of
which are serviced by other WINS servers.

In order to configure this on the WINS server, use Registry Editor to add the
following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS\Partners

Add the following value to the registry key listed above:

  Value Name: ReplicationType
  Data Type:  REG_DWORD
  Value:      1

The registry value in this article applies to replication with all Pull and Push
partners of the local WINS server. In order to apply this to all its Pull
partners only, add the above registry value under the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS\Partners\Pull

In order to apply this to all its Push partners only, add the above registry
value under the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS\Partners\Push

In order to apply this to a specific Pull partner only, add the above registry
value under the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS\Partners\Pull\&lt;IP
  address of pull partner&gt;

In order to apply this to a specific PUSH partner only, add the above registry
value under the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WINS\Partners\Push\&lt;IP
  address of push partner&gt;

If the parameter is specified in more than one place, the lower one in the key
hierarchy supersedes the key above it. The default value of this parameter is 0
which means "replicate all records".

The replication protocol has been enhanced so that a partner can communicate its
desire for a subset of records (replication type) to the WINS server it wants to
pull from. The WINS that is sending records uses the replication type specified
for that partner unless it indicates default replication (replicate all records)
in which case it uses the replication type specified by the pulling WINS server.
When the "pulled from" WINS server is not running Windows NT version 4.0 or
later, it ignores the desired replication type of the partner and sends all
records. The pulling WINS then sifts through the records and stores only those
that are wanted in its database.

CAUTION: Use this feature of WINS only if it is absolutely necessary. Databases
can become out of synchronization when you apply this registry key value.
