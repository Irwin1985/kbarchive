-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Directory synchronization may stop working between a Lightspeed Gateway that
emulates a Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) postoffice and an Exchange Server computer
that is the directory synchronization server. The Microsoft Mail Interchange
(MSMI) is connected to a Lightspeed Gateway for Novell GroupWise. The system may
have been working correctly before it stopped working. The following error
message may be logged in the Windows NT Event Viewer if the diagnostic logging
is set to maximum:

  Event ID: 134
  Type: Error
  Source: MSExchangeDX
  Category: Event Handler
  Description: Error MH_RC_SESSION_BUSY returned by the MTA. (Thread 12).
  MH_RC_SESSION_BUSY. (DXA logging

The Directory Exchange Agent (DXA) messages may contain the following text:

  No updates to send. Nothing was requested.

To verify that you are experiencing the issue that is described in this article:

- Confirm that e-mail is flowing in both directions.

- Enable diagnostic logging on the DXA service and set diagnostic logging to
  maximum.

- Inquire about any recent changes to the network or the GroupWise mail side.

CAUSE
=====

The Lightspeed gateway uses File Format Application Programming Interface
(FFAPI) to communicate with the MS Mail Connector. This issue can occur if the
Lightspeed gateway does not pass the required parameters to the directory
synchronization server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Reconfigure the DXA by deleting and recreating the directory synchronization
  server and directory synchronization requestor objects on the Exchange Server
  computer.

2. Restart the DXA service, and check Event Viewer.

3. If you receive the event ID 134 error message, either apply Exchange Server
  4.0 Service Pack 3 or follow the procedures in following Microsoft Knowledge
  Base article:

  Q159295 XFOR: Exchange Dir-Sync Failing with Event ID 134

4. Use the Mtacheck utility to remove any messages in the DXA queue.

5. Verify that the system is operating properly; send an update request from the
  Lightspeed gateway and pause the DXA service by using Services in Control
  Panel. The updates should be sent successfully.
