The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A restored Exchange Server directory database receives changes from other
servers but does not send out its own changes.

You may also notice replication error 1224 in the Application Log from the source
MSExchangeDS.

CAUSE
=====

It may occasionally be necessary to restore a copy of the Exchange Server
directory that is days or weeks old. In a multi-server organization, the older
copy of the directory will be automatically "backsynced" with newer information
by other servers. The restored server sends special requests for synchronization
information to other servers, and waits for up to 16 hours for all responses to
be received.

After 16 hours, even if all responses needed to bring the directory into complete
synchronization have not been received, backsync expires. This timeout is
necessary because changes to organizational topology may cause some requests to
never be answered, and because while backsync is in progress, the restored
directory is not writable. This means that if an administrator tries to create a
new mailbox or make any other directory change while attached to the restored
server, a DS_E_BUSY error will be generated, and the change will not be saved.

Often, administrators will deliberately force backsync to expire almost
immediately to avoid DS_E_BUSY errors. This can be done by following the steps
in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q160850 DS_E_BUSY After Directory Service Restore

In cases where backsync does not complete or is deliberately aborted, the update
sequence numbers (USN) numbers on the restored server are lower than expected by
other servers in the site. USN numbers are the means by which Exchange
directories make decisions about which objects to replicate with each other.

The error 1224 indicates that the restored server received a replication request
from another server that referenced a USN value higher than the most current USN
value on the restored server.

If the discrepancy between the USN values is relatively small, this problem will
correct itself over a relatively short period of time. Each change replicated to
the restored server will increase the server's highest USN by 1, eventually
causing the restored server to "catch up" with the rest of the site.

The workarounds in this article may help resolve 1224 errors due to any cause,
not just the cause described in this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

The highest USN number on the restored server must be increased by some means
until it is at or above the USN number recorded for the restored server on other
servers in the site before replication from the restored server will begin
functioning again.

The easiest way to do this is with the Authrest utility appropriate to your
version of Exchange Server.

For Exchange Server 4.0, Authrest.exe is included on the installation CD.

For Exchange Server 5.0, obtain a version of Authrest.exe with a file version of
5.0.1458.60.

For Exchange Server 5.5, obtain a version of Authrest.exe with a file version of
5.5.1960.8.

Note that the version of Authrest.exe included on the Exchange Server 4.0, 5.0,
and 5.5 CDs actually works only for version 4.0. The Filever utility included on
the Exchange Server 5.5 CD may be used to verify Authrest.exe file versions.

Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information about Authrest
versions.

The "More Information" section of this article explains how to discover the size
of the discrepancy between USNs, along with the Authrest parameters that should
be used to correct the problem.

To use Authrest, you must stop Exchange services on the affected server during
the procedure. If that is not feasible, you may use the bulk export/import
feature to correct a USN problem without interrupting service. Using bulk import
is more complicated and may take longer to finish, but has the advantage of
requiring no server downtime. The "More Information" section of this article
explains both methods for increasing the USN.

During the time that the USN values are out of sync, avoid making administrative
changes while connected to the restored server. Bind to a different Exchange
Server computer to make changes even to objects homed on the restored server.
Such changes will replicate to the restored server, even though the restored
server still cannot replicate such changes to other servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The rest of this article will discuss:

- How to determine the size of the USN discrepancy
- How to use Authrest to correct this problem
- How USN numbers and Object-Version numbers interact during directory
  replication
- How to use export/import as an alternate method for correcting this problem
  without incurring any server downtime

To Determine the Size of the USN Discrepancy
--------------------------------------------

1. WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
  (admin/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to
  reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
  raw mode can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

  Run the Exchange Administrator program on the restored server (in this
  example, Server A) in raw mode: "(&lt;exchsrvr&gt;\bin\Admin.exe /r)"
  (without the quotation marks).

2. Create a new mailbox.

3. Select the new mailbox, and on the File menu, click Raw Properties.

  WARNING: Changing raw properties may leave your server unusable. Using raw
  mode to view attributes is safe. Use Cancel to exit all raw properties
  dialogs.

4. Note the numeric value of the USN-Changed attribute, and then click Cancel to
  cancel the Raw Properties dialog box.

5. Connect to another server in the site (Server B), and select the &lt;Site
  Name&gt; object.

6. On the File menu, click Raw Properties, and locate the Reps-From attribute.
  This attribute is multi-valued, and you will see a line for each server in
  the site, except the current server. A typical Reps-From line looks like
  this:

  0,112,16,8483,22C3A9375FF7D1118FB700C04FB94608,SERVERA

  Scroll to the right in the Attribute Value window to see the server name which
  appears at the end of each value. Select the restored server (Server A).

7. Click the Viewer button, and view the properties for Server A as a "Replica
  Link."

8. Note the USN value recorded here.

9. Compare the USN-Changed value taken from Server A's new mailbox with the USN
  recorded on Server B (for Server A).

  If the USN value from Server B's Reps-From is higher, then Server B will be
  unable to receive changes from Server A. The Server B value must be lower for
  replication to flow from A to B. If the value on B is in fact lower, there is
  a different cause for the replication problems than out of sync USN numbers,
  and this article will not help you.

  If you have multiple servers in your site, you can follow the above procedure
  for each of them to verify that no server in the site has a higher value
  listed for Server A than does Server A itself. If you have many servers in
  your site, a spot check of three or four should be sufficient to arrive at a
  probable "highest" value. The Reps-From values for Server A on all other
  servers will normally be very close to each other.

10. Subtract the USN-Changed value taken from the new mailbox on Server A from
  the largest Reps-From value obtained from any Server B in the site. The
  difference tells you how many changes must be applied to the directory on
  Server A before it will catch up with the rest of the site and thus be able
  to replicate changes out to the site.

  For example, if the difference is 1,000, you could increase the USN on Server
  A by making 1,000 administrative changes (such as adding or editing a field
  for a mailbox) while connected to Server A. The Authrest utility makes this
  unnecessary by mimicking the effects of making as many changes as needed.

To Correct a USN Discrepancy with Authrest
------------------------------------------

Stop the Exchange Directory Service and, from the server console, type the
following command:

  "AUTHREST 0 &lt;amount to increase the USN&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

For example, suppose that the discrepancy number you arrived at in step 10 above
was 1,000. Suppose you had also added 100 mailboxes to Server A before noticing
that they weren't replicating to the rest of the site. You might then choose to
set an Authrest value of 1,000 (the discrepancy amount) + 100 (the number of
changes you've made on Server A since restoring) + 500 (as a safety margin),
thus making your Authrest command line:

  AUTHREST 0 1600

NOTE: If you are using Authrest for Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0, it may be
necessary to run the utility from the &lt;Exchsrvr&gt;\Bin directory so that it
can find its supporting .dll files.

Notice that the first Authrest parameter was set to 0 in the above example. The
first Authrest parameter increments Object-Version values, while the second
parameter increments USN-Changed values. In the case discussed in this article,
you don't want to increase the Object-Version, just the USN. The reason why is
discussed at the end of this article.

Also be aware that the higher you set the USN increment amount, the more objects
will be replicated to other servers. If you were to use a number such as
100,000, you would likely transmit every single object in the directory to every
other server in the entire organization, thus creating a "replication storm."

If you set both Authrest parameters to high values, you will accomplish a truly
AUTHoritative RESTore, in which this server's version of each object replaces
every other server's version.

To Correct a USN Discrepancy using Export/Import
------------------------------------------------

1. Start the Exchange Administrator program, and create a new Recipients
  container (on the File menu, click New Other, and then Recipients Container).

2. Create a single mailbox in this container.

3. Export this mailbox to a .csv file (on the Tools menu, click Directory
  Export), selecting only this new container for export. This should give you a
  plain text .csv file with only two lines in it. The first line contains the
  export header fields, and the second line the specific mailbox information.

4. Open your exported file in Notepad or another plain text editor. Do not use
  Word Wrap--the file should appear as two long lines. (Be aware that if you
  use Word or Excel or some other application that performs format conversions,
  the file may be corrupted during editing or re-saving.)

5. Edit the file by copying and pasting the second line of the file
  repeatedly--create as many lines as the USN difference you wish to rectify.

  If the USN increment difference is very large (more than 10,000), the .csv
  file will also become very large. A typical .csv file with 100,000 lines will
  be 20 MB in size. Rather than creating such a massive text file, you can
  create a smaller one, and reimport that file into Exchange Server over and
  over.

  If you lose track of how many lines are in the file, you can save it and run
  this command to count lines:

  FIND /c "Mailbox" myfile.csv

  You need to have a close idea of how many lines are in the file, so that you
  don't increase the USN more than necessary.

6. Import the file by clicking Directory Import on the Tools menu in the
  Exchange Administrator program. This will cause the single mailbox repeatedly
  listed in the file to be reimported again and again, incrementing the USN for
  the server with each import. If you need to increase your USN by 100,000, and
  your file has 10,000 lines, import the same file ten times.

  If you are importing the file multiple times, use a simple batch file to
  automate the process. For example, if your .csv file has 10,000 lines, and
  you need to increment the USN by 50,000, create a five line batch file
  similar to the following:

  --------FIXUSN.BAT---------

  &lt;exchsrvr&gt;\bin\admin.exe /i myfile.csv
  &lt;exchsrvr&gt;\bin\admin.exe /i myfile.csv
  &lt;exchsrvr&gt;\bin\admin.exe /i myfile.csv
  &lt;exchsrvr&gt;\bin\admin.exe /i myfile.csv
  &lt;exchsrvr&gt;\bin\admin.exe /i myfile.csv

  You should count on at least two hours of import time for each 100,000 entries
  to be imported. This procedure has been tested successfully with 60-MB .csv
  files containing 300,000 lines.

Notes on this Procedure:

The reasons for creating a new mailbox rather than simply re-importing existing
mailboxes are twofold: first, to prevent Object-Versions from being changed on
existing mailboxes, and second, to minimize the amount of replication traffic
generated between servers by the process.

Try to schedule this process during off hours, as it will put the local directory
service under heavy load, which may affect server performance.

If your forced USN increment is much larger than necessary, it may cause all
existing objects on the server to be replicated to other servers. This can
create a "replication storm" that may last for several hours in a large
organization.

The rest of this article briefly discusses how replication uses USNs and
Object-Version values, and is provided as background for understanding why the
above procedures are effective.

How USN Values and Object-Version Values Interact in Directory Replication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The USN and the Object-Version play different roles in replication. The USN
levels determine whether or not one server will send any changes when requested
to do so by another server. The Object-Version determines whether those changes
will be applied or discarded once they are received by the requesting server. In
other words, the USN determines whether any change information at all will pass
between servers; the Object-Version determines what will be done with the change
list once it is received.

The Object-Version increments by one each time an object is changed and saved in
the Exchange Administrator program. When you create a new mailbox, its
Object-Version is 1. If you later add a fax number to the mailbox, the
Object-Version becomes 2. When an Exchange Server site's directory is fully
synchronized, the Object-Version for a particular object has the same value on
all servers.

The USN is also incremented each time an object is changed, but in a more
complicated way. While the Object-Version attribute is specific to each object,
the USN is specific to each server, although it is an attribute carried by each
object. The USN values for a given object will have different values on each
server in the site. How this works is best explained by an example:

Suppose you create Mailbox A. As the most recently changed object on the current
server, Mailbox A will carry the highest USN-Changed value of any object in the
server's directory (in this example, we will say the value is 1,000).

Then you create Mailbox B. Mailbox A's USN-Changed value remains 1,000, and
Mailbox B now carries a USN-Changed value of 1,001. Then you go back to Mailbox
A and add a fax number. Now Mailbox A once again carries the highest USN-Changed
value (1,002), while B is still showing 1,001. In essence, the highest USN is a
"hot potato" passed between objects in a directory as they are changed, and the
highest USN is carried by the last object changed. To discover what the highest
USN is on a given server, you must therefore change or create an object, and
examine its value.

With this basic understanding of Object-Versions and USNs, the following example
of directory replication from Server A to Server B should make sense:

1. Server B initiates a query to Server A for any new changes made to the
  directory on A. Any of several triggers can cause this request to be sent.
  The most obvious trigger is receipt of a notification from A that says, "I've
  made changes to my own directory; everybody come and get them."

In the absence of such change notifications, directories still periodically query
each other in case change notifications were missed. Exchange Server computers
do not "push" changes to each other blindly. They notify each other that changes
exist and then wait for the other servers to request changes. This allows each
server to request only the changes it really needs.

2. Server B looks at its own Reps-From entry for Server A and, in this example,
  sees that it lists a value of 1,000.

3. Server B composes a replication request that says, "Send me a copy of every
  object in your directory that currently carries a USN-Changed value greater
  than 1,000."

4. Server A scans its own directory, and finds Mailbox A and Mailbox B with
  USN-Changed values of 1,001 and 1,002, and sends copies of these objects to
  Server B.

5. If Server B already has a copy of these objects, it compares the
  Object-Version of its own copy with the one just sent. If the Object-Version
  of its own copy is lower than that of the one just sent, B replaces its copy
  with A's version.

  If B's own copy carries a higher Object-Version, then B discards A's object.
  If A's and B's copies have equal Object-Versions, then several tie-breaking
  rules are invoked to decide which copy to keep. (The tie-breakers are almost
  never important in hands-on troubleshooting of replication issues because you
  can easily break a tie yourself by making a minor change to an object to
  increase its Object-Version.)

6. Server B updates its Reps-From entry for A to 1,002. The next time it queries
  A, it will ask for all objects greater than 1,002. Reps-From is incremented
  regardless of whether the changes received were actually applied to B's
  directory.

NOTE: You can force a given server to query all other servers in the site for
changes from the General Properties page of
&lt;SiteName&gt;\Configuration\Servers\&lt;ServerName&gt;\Directory Service. The
Update Now button gives you the option of sending a query for objects based on
the current Reps-From values for other servers ("Update only new and modified
items"), or of querying as if the Reps-From value were 0 ("Refresh All Items in
the Directory").

Only if you suspect a large number of objects were mistakenly skipped in previous
replication should you select the second option. If a single object did not
replicate, it is much faster and generates far less network traffic to make a
minor change to the object, and update only new and modified objects.

Now, look back at the previous example of a directory replication cycle, and
consider what would have happened if Server B's Reps-From value for A had
initially been 1,500. It would have asked Server A for all objects from 1,501
on, and, would have gotten nothing back from Server A, whose latest object is
only at a USN of 1,002.

This is the situation created by restoring an older copy of the directory to
Server A when backsync isn't allowed to correct the situation. Until 500 more
changes in the site replicate in to Server A, none of A's changes will replicate
out.

While you need to increase the USN value in such situations, usually you do not
want to increase the Object-Version value. Why? Recall that the USN controls
whether replication changes are transmitted or not, while the Object-Version
controls whether replication changes are applied or not.

If you increase the Object-Version values on the restored server, then copies of
objects from that server--which are actually older--will overwrite copies of the
same objects on other servers--copies which are actually newer. Remember:
whoever has the highest Object-Version always wins.

Setting the first parameter of Authrest to 0 prevents Authrest from making
unwanted changes to Object-Version values. Running export/import only against a
test mailbox also prevents Object-Version values for your actual users from
being affected.
