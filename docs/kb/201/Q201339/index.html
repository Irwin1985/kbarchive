-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is not possible to bundle multiple channels using Routing and Remote Access
Service (RRAS), Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), and
third-party "one time password" authentication schemes, such as Security
Dynamic's SecurID.

Even if credentials are accepted for the first channel, the second channel fails
authentication and does not come up. Upon failure, the first channel remains
connected.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT is designed to always sends the same set of credentials for every
channel on a multilink connection. SecurID is designed never to accept the same
set of credentials twice. By design, they are incompatible.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you can do either of the following:

- If "one time password" is mandatory due to security issues, disable multilink
  at the client.

- If multilinking is desired, use Windows NT/Radius authentication.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RRAS Radius client is designed to always send the same set of credentials
for links bonded in a multilink connection, and it will always send one Access
Request for each link to the RADIUS server independent of the media or
authentication used. This assumes a static value for ID and password, which is
typical of Windows NT authentication.

SecurID generates a unique password every 60 seconds, and it will not accept the
same set of credentials more than once.

Therefore, if Windows NT is designed to always sends the same set of credentials,
and SecurID is designed never to accept the same set of credentials twice, these
products will not work together by design.

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
