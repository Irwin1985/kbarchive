SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access replicas of Microsoft Exchange Public Folders from a
Microsoft Exchange Client (Microsoft Exchange Client - Microsoft Outlook), you
may receive one of the following error messages:

  The folder could not be opened. The contents of this public folder are
  currently unavailable. Either the Microsoft Exchange Server computer
  servicing this public folder is down or the public folder has not been
  replicated to this site. See your administrator.

  -or-

  Unable to display the folder. The contents of this public folder are
  currently unavailable. Either the Microsoft Exchange Server computer
  servicing this public folder is down or the public folder has not been
  replicated to this site. See your administrator.

  -or-

  Unable to expand the folder. The set of folders could not be opened. The
  contents of this public folder are currently unavailable. Either the
  Microsoft Exchange Server computer servicing the public folder is down or the
  public folder has not been replicated to this site. See your administrator.

You may receive the following error message when you attempt to access the
properties of the Public Folder(s) from the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program:

  The folder could not be opened. The contents of this public folder are
  currently unavailable. Either the Microsoft Exchange Server Computer
  servicing this public folder is down or the public folder has not been
  replicated to this site. See your administrator.

When you view the replicas on the Instances of the Public Information Store, the
Public Folder(s) generating the error(s) appear on the right side in the
"Folders on this Information Store" dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

Replication between the Home Server and the Public Folder has not completed or
Replication has failed. Running Mtacheck.exe from the
&lt;drive&gt;:\Exchsrvr\Bin directory (where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter
where the Exchange System Files are located) with a /RP parameter on a server in
the organization might also cause this behavior because one of the functions
Mtacheck.exe performs is to remove public folder replication messages from the
Message Transfer Agent (MTA).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, after replication schedules have been confirmed and
the normal replication cycle has passed, if the replicas are still unavailable,
examine the Event Viewer application log first for public folder replication
errors. If there are no errors, try removing and re-creating a replica of this
public folder on your server. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Choose the "Public Information Store" on the Replica Server.

2. From the File menu, click Properties.

3. Click the Instance tab, remove the replica(s) of that folder(s) on your
  server, and then click OK.

4. Wait until the replica of the Public Folder(s) has been removed.

5. Click the "Public Information Store" on the Replica Server.

6. From the File menu, click Properties.

7. Click the Instance tab, add the replica(s) of that folder on your server, and
  then click OK.

The properties of the Public Folders should now be accessible from the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program and from the client.
