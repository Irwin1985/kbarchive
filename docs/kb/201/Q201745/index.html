SYMPTOMS
========

A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client may receive incorrect IP
Address from a BOOTP server.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows DHCP client broadcasts for a DHCP server to obtain valid IP
addresses and other configuration parameters. Third-party BOOTP Service may
intercept these request packets and incorrectly respond to them by mistake.
Windows clients are designed to broadcast a "Discovery" message and if a program
other than a DHCP server responds and takes the broadcasts "out of context", the
resolution must come from the offending program performing the "Offer" message,
not the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve any of these or related issues, contact the third-party vendor or
reconfigure the BOOTP service to not respond to packets of this nature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DHCP is an extension of the initial Bootstrap Protocol or BOOTP, which assigned
IP addresses from a database of physical addresses matching IP addresses. This
database is configured by an Administrator and has a high amount of overhead.
With the inception of DHCP, IP address assignment can be fully automated through
several different avenues.

There are a few differences in BOOTP and DHCP. BOOTP clients can use DHCP servers
and DHCP clients can make use of the BOOTP relay service. DHCP also has a DHCP
Class Identifier parameter. A requesting client populates this parameter and
sends it to the server. In turn, the server uses this parameter field for
selecting correct parameters (options) for the client.

A server or router with a BOOTP service running should not respond to a request
for which there are no reservations. In the case where dynamic BOOTP has been
implemented, then reservations must be made to prevent overlap in IP addressing.
If you implement a dynamic BOOTP server and a DHCP server on the same subnet, it
is the equivalent of two DHCP servers on the same subnet. This can cause denial
of IP addresses to clients as well as duplicate IP addresses on the network and
is not recommended.

For more information about DHCP and BOOTP, see RFC 1541, RFC 2131, RFC 1534 and
RFC 951. RFCs may be obtained over the Internet as follows:

Paper copies of all RFCs are available from the NIC, either individually or on a
subscription basis (for more information, contact NIC@NIC.DDN.MIL). Online
copies are available through FTP or Kermit from NIC.DDN.MIL as rfc/rfc####.txt
or rfc/rfc####.PS (#### is the RFC number without leading zeros).
