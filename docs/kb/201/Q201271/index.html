The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Depending on the components selected during installation, Setup creates a
default directory structure that stores the Exchange Server 5.5 program files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following subdirectories are located in the root Exchsrvr directory folder:

Note: Exchsrvr is the default root directory. This can be changed during
installation and thus the subdirectories appear under the root directory name
that was specified during Setup.

- Add-ins: Subdirectories for extensions to Exchange Server. The default
  installation contains dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) for the Microsoft Mail
  Connector, the Microsoft Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector, the Simple Mail
  Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and the Internet Mail Service.

- Address: Subdirectories for e-mail address proxy DLLs. The default
  installation contains DLLs for Microsoft Mail for PC and AppleTalk Networks
  (now known as Quarterdeck Mail), the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus
  cc:Mail, SMTP, and X.400 e-mail address generators.

- Bin: Components for Exchange Server and the Administrator program.

- Ccmcdata: A directory structure that serves as a temporary storage location
  to hold messages during transit. Connector for Lotus cc:Mail uses this
  temporary storage space to move messages between Lotus cc:Mail and Exchange
  Server. This directory is created only if you select to install the Connector
  for Lotus cc:Mail component during Setup.

- Connect: Components for various Exchange Server connectors. The default
  installation contains .exe files for the Internet Mail Service, the Microsoft
  Schedule+ Free/Busy Connector, Microsoft Mail for PC and AppleTalk Networks,
  Lotus cc:Mail, and translators for other languages.

- Docs: Online documentation. This directory is created only if you select to
  install the online documentation component during Setup.

- Dsadata: The directory database (Dir.edb) and Jet database logs (*.log).

- Dxadata: The Directory Exchange Agent database (Xdir.edb) for Microsoft Mail
  for PC Networks (MS Mail (PC)). This directory is created only if you set up
  directory synchronization with an MS Mail (PC) network, which requires you to
  install a Microsoft Mail Connector component during Setup.

- Imcdata: Working directories for the Internet Mail Service.

- Insdata: Working directories for the Internet News Service. This directory is
  created whether or not you select to install the Internet News Service
  component during Setup.

- Kmsdata: Working directory for the Key Management server (KM server). This
  directory contains the KM server database (Kmsmdb.edb) and Jet database logs
  (*.log). This directory is empty unless you select to install the KM server
  component during Setup.

- Mdbdata: The private information store (Priv.edb), the public information
  store (Pub.edb), and the Jet database logs (*.log).

- Mtadata: Configuration, template database, and log files for the message
  transfer agent (MTA).

- Res: DLL files for the Microsoft Windows NT Event Viewer and the Windows NT
  Performance Monitor.

- Tracking.log: Log files for the message-tracking feature of the Administrator
  program.

- Webdata: Outlook Web Access (OWA) components. This directory is created only
  if you select to install the OWA component during Setup.

- Webdata.bak: Backup files for the OWA components in the Webdata folder. This
  directory is created only if you select to install the OWA component during
  Setup.

- Webtemp: Temporary files for the OWA component. This directory is created
  only if you select to install the OWA component during Setup.
