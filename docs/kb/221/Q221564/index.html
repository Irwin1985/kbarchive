SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to completely remove Microsoft Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0 from your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The best way to remove a stand-alone installation of Visual SourceSafe 6.0 is to
use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. This will remove most of the
Visual SourceSafe components from your computer as well as all the registry
entries created during installation.

Also use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to remove Visual
SourceSafe from a Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise installation. However, you begin
this removal process by choosing Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise Edition in the
Add/Remove Programs dialog window.

NOTE: Simply deleting the Visual SourceSafe folder from your computer will not
remove related registry entries. Allowing these to remain can cause problems
with other applications, especially those that were integrated with Visual
SourceSafe.

To completely remove Visual SourceSafe 6.0 from your computer:

1. Remove the application using the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  If Visual SourceSafe was installed through the Visual Studio 6.0 component
  selection dialog box, you must clear the Visual SourceSafe checkbox first,
  and then continue with the installation process. It will register that you
  have made a change to the Visual Studio 6.0 installation and will continue
  with the uninstall of Visual SourceSafe.

2. NOTE: This step will delete your old database, so make a backup copy of any
  data you want to keep before you proceed.

  Delete the remaining SourceSafe items from your computer by deleting the
  Visual SourceSafe folder and its contents.

3. Empty the Recycle Bin.

  You must empty the Recycle Bin if you plan to reinstall Visual SourceSafe
  after you've removed it from your system. If you delete the Visual SourceSafe
  folder from your machine but forget to empty the Recycle Bin, the
  installation program will locate the deleted Visual SourceSafe folder in the
  Recycle Bin and treat it as an installed version of Visual SourceSafe.

IMPORTANT: If you are removing, then reinstalling Visual SourceSafe to fix a
problem with the way the application is operating, be sure to back up the
database prior to performing this procedure to minimize the possibility of
losing critical data.
