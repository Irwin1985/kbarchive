-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are logged on as an Exchange Server View-only Administrator at the site
level, you can delete an existing Organization Forms Library in the Exchange
Server Administrator program in the Forms Administrator on the Tools menu.

The View-only Administrator exists only at the site level in Exchange Server. A
View-only Administrator cannot delete objects on any level in Exchange Server. A
View-only Administrator can only view objects in Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

A View-only Administrator cannot actually delete the Organization Forms Library.
The Forms Administrator only seems to allow the View-only Administrator to
delete but the user's permissions are not actually checked. The Forms
Administrator does not notify you that you do not have permissions to delete a
form. You may seem to be able to delete a form, and the form is removed from the
Forms Administrator, but after you close and reopen the Forms Administrator, the
Forms Library is still there. It is not actually deleted.

The problem exists only in the Forms Administrator, and you cannot delete any
Form Libraries when you are logged on as a View-only Administrator.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may also seem to be able to create a new Organization Forms Library when you
are logged on as a View-only Administrator. If you create a new form, it appears
in the Forms Administrator, but after you close and reopen the Forms
Administrator, the new Organization Forms Library is not there. As described in
the "Resolution" section, the problem exists only in the Forms Administrator.
You do not have the right to delete or create an object when you are logged on
as a View-only Administrator, you only have the Logon right.

To delete an object, you need the Delete right, and to create an object, you need
the "Add child" right.
