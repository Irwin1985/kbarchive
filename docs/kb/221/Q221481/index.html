-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Systems Management Server 2.0 on a computer running Microsoft
Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) or later, you may receive the
following error:

  Setup cannot compile MOF file
  &lt;drive&gt;:\SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\Sms_schm.mof. Do you want to
  continue?

If you click Yes to this and all subsequent dialog boxes, you will see a series
of message boxes similar to the first that state that other MOF files cannot be
compiled: Smsprov.mof, Cmpprov.mof, Cppprof.mof, Pollprov.mof, and Netdisc.mof.
Setup then continues and ends with the message:

  SMS has successfully installed.

If you then view the Systems Management Server Administrator console, the site
database is displayed with a question mark.

You Have Not Yet Installed Systems Management Server 2.0 on Windows NT Server 4.0 SP5 or later
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not yet installed Systems Management Server 2.0 on a computer running
Windows NT Server 4.0 SP5, all you need to do is update the source that you are
going to install from.

Recovery Steps:

1. Copy the Systems Management Server 2.0 CD to a network share point.

2. Replace the Wbemsdk.exe file in the Smssetup\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; directory
  with the version obtained from the hotfix.

3. Install Systems Management Server 2.0 from the network share point you
  created in Step 1 of this procedure.

Recovery of a Systems Management Server 2.0 Primary Site Server
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you attempted to install a Systems Management Server 2.0 primary site server
on a computer running Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5 or later, error
messages were displayed indicating that the MOF files could not be compiled. If
you canceled the installation at this point, perform the three steps listed in
the "You Have Not Yet Installed Windows NT Server 4.0 SP5 or later" section of
this article. However, if you continued with the installation, the site is
currently inoperative but recoverable. In this case, perform the steps below.

Recovery Steps:

1. Replace the Wbemsdk.exe file in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt;
  directory with the version obtained from the hotfix.

2. Replace the Wbemsdk.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Wbem\&lt;Platform&gt; directory with the
  version obtained from the hotfix.

3. Replace the Compver.ini file in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Wbem
  directory with the version obtained from the hotfix.

4. Set up the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) server components. From a
  command prompt, type the following command, using the hotfixed version of
  Wbemsdk.exe:

  Wbemsdk.exe /s /server

5. Manually compile the MOF files that failed to compile by typing the following
  commands from a command prompt (press ENTER after each command):

  cd %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS_root&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\sms_schm.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS_root&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\smsprov.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS_root&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\cmprov.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS_root&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\cpprov.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS_root&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\pollprov.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS_root&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\netdisc.mof

  If the SQL Server is located on a computer other than the site server, then
  compile the .mof files located on that computer by typing the following from
  a command prompt:

  cd %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem
  Mofcomp x:\smsprov\mofs\&lt;sitecode&gt;\sms_schm.mof
  Mofcomp x:\smsprov\mofs\&lt;sitecode&gt;\smsprov.mof

  where x is the drive where Systems Management Server is installed or where the
  SMS Provider is installed on a remote SQL Server.

6. In the Systems Management Server Administrator console, the node under the
  Systems Management Server node will state that the connection failed. Delete
  that failed connection node by right-clicking it and then clicking Delete on
  the shortcut menu. Restore the node by right-clicking the Systems Management
  Server node, pointing to All Tasks, and then clicking Connect To Site
  Database on the shortcut menu. In the Site Database Connection Wizard, click
  Next, then select "Reconnect to the site database for this site server".
  Click Next and then click Finish to complete the wizard.

7. Restart the system.

Recovery of a Systems Management Server 2.0 Secondary Site Server
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you attempted to install a Systems Management Server 2.0 secondary site server
from the Systems Management Server 2.0 CD to a computer running Windows NT
Server 4.0 Service Pack 5 or later, error messages were displayed indicating
that the MOF files could not be compiled. If you canceled the installation at
this point, perform the three steps listed in the "You Have Not Yet Installed
Windows NT Server 4.0 SP5 or later" section of this article. However, if you
continued with the installation, the secondary site is functional but
performance and manageability of it from its parent site will suffer. In this
case, perform the steps below.

If you attempted to install a Systems Management Server 2.0 secondary site server
from a Systems Management Server 2.0 primary site server to a computer running
Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5 or later, the Smssetup.log file on the
secondary site server will indicate that the MOF files could not be compiled.
The error messages mentioned in the SYMPTOMS section of this article will not be
displayed. The secondary site is functional but performance and manageability of
it from its parent will suffer.

Recovery Steps:

1. On both the primary and secondary site servers, replace the Wbemsdk.exe file
  in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; directories with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

2. On both the primary and secondary site servers, replace the Wbemsdk.exe files
  in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Wbem\&lt;Platform&gt; directories
  with the version obtained from the hotfix.

3. On both the primary and secondary site servers, replace the Compver.ini file
  in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Wbem directory with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

4. On the secondary site server, set up the WMI server components. From a
  command prompt, type the following command, using the hotfixed version of
  Wbemsdk.exe:

  Wbemsdk.exe /s /server

5. On the secondary site server, manually compile the MOF files that failed to
  compile by typing the following commands from a command prompt (press ENTER
  after each command):

  cd %SystemRoot%\system32\wbem
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS root directory&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\sms_schm.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS root directory&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\cmprov.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS root directory&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\cpprov.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS root directory&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\pollprov.mof
  Mofcomp x:\&lt;SMS root directory&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\netdisc.mof

  where x is the drive where Systems Management Server is installed.

6. Restart the systems.

Recovery of a Systems Management Server 2.0 Client
--------------------------------------------------

If you attempted to install the Systems Management Server 2.0 client on a
computer running Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5, WMI and hardware
inventory will not install. All other client agents will function properly.

Recovery Steps:

1. On the site server(s), replace the Wbemsdk.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\bin\&lt;Platform&gt; directories with the version obtained
  from the hotfix.

2. On the site server(s), replace the Wbemsdk.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Wbem\&lt;Platform&gt; directories with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

3. On the site server(s), replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Wbem directory with the version obtained
  from the hotfix.

  Every 23 hours, the Client Configuration and Installation Manager (CCIM) will
  poll its site server(s). This will initiate the installation of WMI and
  hardware inventory.

4. Restart the systems.

NOTE: To verify the above fix without waiting 23 hours, perform the following
steps:

1. On one of the client computers, open Control Panel, double-click the Systems
  Management icon, and click the Components tab.

2. Select the Windows Management item and click the Repair Installation button.

3. After a short time, click the Refresh Status button. Windows Management
  should indicate its version as 698 and status as Installed.

4. Perform the same actions for the Hardware Inventory Agent item.

Recovery of a Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrator Console
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you attempted to install a Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrator console
on a computer running Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5, the administrative
console will not be functional.

Recovery Steps:

1. Remove the administrative console by running the Systems Management Server
  2.0 Setup program.

2. Perform the three steps listed in the "You Have Not Yet Installed Systems
  Management Server 2.0 on Windows NT Server 4.0 SP5 or later" section of this
  article.
