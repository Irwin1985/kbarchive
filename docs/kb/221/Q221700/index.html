-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the ActiveDoc class of an ActiveDocument, the CommandTargetExec event ignores
the value returned by the user in the RETURN command and returns CMD_OK under
all circumstances. This means that the ActiveDocument host (normally Internet
Explorer) assumes that the ActiveDocument handled any command called from the
menu that was passed to the ActiveDocument.

In addition, the return values defined in FoxPro.h are incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

While the FoxPro.h values can be corrected, they are still not handled correctly
in Visual FoxPro 6.0 Build 8167 (original release). You need to upgrade to
Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 for this functionality to work.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Project, (aDoc.pjx).

2. Create a new ADoc class (aDocTest in aDocClass.vcx) in aDoc.pjx.

3. Select FoxPro.h in the Class:Include File dialog box, and create the
  following procedures:

  PROCEDURE CommandTargetExec
  	LPARAMETERS nCommandID, nExecOption, eArgIn, eArgOut

  	*!* The DO CASE is overkill in this sample, but it 
  	*!* allows for handling different nCommandIDs.
  	DO CASE
  		CASE nCommandID = CMDID_PROPERTIES
  			RETURN CMD_NOTSUPPORTED
  	ENDCASE
  ENDPROC

  PROCEDURE Run
  	LPARAMETERS cHyperLinkTarget

  	DO FORM frmHiThere

  	READ EVENTS
  ENDPROC

4. Create a new Form (frmHiThere.scx) and drop a label on it. Set the properties
  as below and add the QueryUnload procedure:

  DEFINE CLASS frmhithere AS form

  	DoCreate = .T.
  	Caption = "Hi there!"
  	Name = "frmHiThere"

  	ADD OBJECT lblhithere AS label WITH ;
  		Caption = "Hi, neighbor, have a 'Gansett!", ;
  		Height = 17, ;
  		Left = 96, ;
  		Top = 96, ;
  		Width = 162, ;
  		Name = "lblHiThere"

  	PROCEDURE QueryUnload
  		*!* QueryUnload fires when the Close (x) button in 
  		*!* the upper right corner is clicked.

  		CLEAR EVENTS
  	ENDPROC
  ENDDEFINE

5. Build aDoc.pjx as an application (.APP).

6. Open Internet Explorer. Go to the File:Open menu item, and choose aDoc.app.
  Once it opens in the browser, choose File:Properties.

If the application was built with Visual FoxPro 6.0 Build 8167, nothing happens
because the ActiveDoc is improperly returning the "I handled it" value (CMD_OK).
When the application is built with Visual FoxPro 6.0 in Visual Studio 6.0
Service Pack 3, the About Visual FoxPro 6.0 Run-time dialog box appears.

The FoxPro.h file is found in the Visual FoxPro home directory (=HOME(1)).

The return values for CommandTargetExec are defined improperly.

The lines reading:

  *-- CommandTargetExec Return Values
  #DEFINE CMD_NOTSUPPORTED             2  &amp;&amp; Command is not supported by the Active Document
  #DEFINE CMD_DISABLED                 3  &amp;&amp; Command is disabled for the Active Document
  #DEFINE CMD_NOHELP                   4  &amp;&amp; No help is available for the command from the Active Document
  #DEFINE CMD_CANCELED                 5  &amp;&amp; The user canceled the execution of the command

should be:

  *-- CommandTargetExec Return Values
  #DEFINE CMD_NOTSUPPORTED             1  &amp;&amp; Command is not supported by the Active Document
  #DEFINE CMD_DISABLED                 2  &amp;&amp; Command is disabled for the Active Document
  #DEFINE CMD_NOHELP                   3  &amp;&amp; No help is available for the command from the Active Document
  #DEFINE CMD_CANCELED                 4  &amp;&amp; The user canceled the execution of the command
