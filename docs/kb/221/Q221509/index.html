-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This article only applies to Windows Terminal Server with Citrix Metaframe applied.

SYMPTOMS
========

Some workstation local print drivers pose problems for Windows NT Server,
Terminal Server Edition. If the drivers have not been properly tested on
Terminal Server, they can cause lockup problems on the server or even blue
screen error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The user usually has the ability to install local printers on his or her
workstation. When the user connects to a Terminal Server session, the local
printer is autocreated in the Terminal Server session. In very large companies,
it is hard to control what printers and print drivers the user is loading on his
or her local workstation.

As an example, the HP4000 print driver has caused problems on some Terminal
Server installations. The print queue can stop responding (hang) and the jobs
not print. The HP LaserJet 4 print driver has been shown to be very stable in
this environment, and can be used as a substitute for the HP4000 print driver.
To ensure that the HP LaserJet 4 driver is used ,if your user tries to load the
HP4000 print driver or any other incompatible driver on his or her local
workstation, there is a work around to set the default printer driver used on
the Terminal Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a file on the Terminal server that can be modified to make the
disparate printer driver names appear to be equal, and this will set a default
print driver that works properly on the Terminal server.

To make this modification, follow these steps:

1. You need to know ahead of time the exact name of the print driver in question
  that can potentially be loaded on the client workstation. You can find this
  out by loading the print driver on a test workstation in local mode, not a
  Terminal Server session, and then doing the following:

  a. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Printers.

  b. Select the printer that has proven to be a problem and right-click it.

  c. Select Properties and then click the Details tab.

  d. Write down the name of the printer driver. On computers running Windows 95
     and Windows 98, the driver is listed in the "Print using the following
     driver" box. On computers running Windows NT, the "Driver" box is on the
     General tab. The print driver name can vary on the workstation, depending
     on the operating system. Make sure you have the right driver name for the
     client workstation that is being used.

     For example, if you see "HP LaserJet 4000 Series PCL 5e", write this name
     down, paying attention to all punctuation and case sensitivity.

2. On the Terminal Server computer, click Start, click Settings, and then click
  Printers.

3. Double-click the Add Printer icon, select My Computer, and then click Next.

4. In the Available Ports list box, select LPT1, and then click Next.

5. In the left pane, select the Manufacturer of the printer you have installed
  on your workstation. In the right pane, scroll to the model of the printer
  you want the Terminal Server to load as the default driver.

  For example, "HP LaserJet 4". This is the server printer driver name that you
  want to use as the default printer. Write this name down.

6. Open the Wtsuprn.txt file. This file is located in the %SystemRoot%\System32
  folder. The file is as follows:

==========================================================================
; WTSUPRN.TXT 
;
; this is a template for wtsuprn.inf -- rename this file to wtsuprn.inf
;
; this file provides a mapping for client printers which have a name
; different from the server printer.  this file is necessary since many
; printers for Win95 are different from their WinNT equivalent.
;
; Note: the driver for the server printer must be installed.  See the
; WinFrame Concepts and Planning Guide.

;"HP LaserJet 4/4M"                          = "HP LaserJet 4"
;"HP LaserJet 4P/4MP"                        = "HP LaserJet 4P"
;"HP LaserJet 4 Plus/4M Plus"                = "HP LaserJet 4 Plus"
;"HP LaserJet 4Si/4Si MX"                    = "HP LaserJet 4Si"
;"HP LaserJet 4V/4MV"                        = "HP LaserJet 4V"
;"HP LaserJet 5/5M - Enhanced"               = "HP LaserJet 5"
;"HP LaserJet 5/5M - Standard"               = "HP LaserJet 5"
;"HP LaserJet 5/5M PostScript"               = "HP LaserJet 5"
;"HP LaserJet 5L (PCL)"                      = "HP LaserJet 5L"
;"HP LaserJet 5P/5MP (HP)"                   = "HP LaserJet 5P"
==========================================================================

  Use this exact format to enter the previous information that you gathered from
  the workstation and the server. Leave out the semicolon (;), this is to
  remark the line out.

  Make sure you type the right driver under the proper column. Client name would
  be the workstation; server name is the Terminal Server.

  For example:

"HP LaserJet 4000 Series PCL 5e"	     = "HP LaserJet 4"

7. Save this file with a .inf extension and then close the Wtsuprn.txt file.
  From now on, if you have to add any other printers, add them to the
  Wtsuprn.inf file.

8. Log off of the Terminal Server computer and log back on. Log on to your
  client workstation to a Terminal Server session and you should now see your
  printer autocreated in the Terminal Server session printers folder and be
  able to print back to your local printer.

Installing a New, Non-Native print driver.
------------------------------------------

When you need to install a new print driver to your workstation, you will also
have to install a print driver to the Terminal Server computer. Install the
printer on the server as a local printer. Upon completion of the printer
installation, delete the printer icon from the printer folder. The printer
driver will be installed on the server an when you connect the workstation to
the Terminal Server, the new printer will be autocreated. If the printer driver
names are different for the workstation (client) and the server, follow the same
procedure as above to make them equal.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This will work for your printing needs. The only drawback is that some of the
functionality of the replaced printer driver on the server may not work on the
newer printer. If you have concerns about this, contact the manufacturer of the
printer.
