SYMPTOMS
========

As the structured storage file increases in size, it takes more time to save
than expected.

From a developer's point of view, this is what would be occuring in his or her
code:

  

  Create root storage in  STGM_TRANSACTED mode.
  Create a single substorage on the root in STGM_DIRECT mode.

  Loop  for a lot of iterations, say 3000.
  Create a new stream.
  Write some data, 150 KB for instance, to stream.
  Commit root, say every 200 iterations, though loop.
  Release stream.
  Goto start of loop.

The commit on the root will become very slow as the file gets larger. After 2,800
150-KB streams have been written, the commit on the root for the last 200
streams takes about 16 minutes. During the commit operation, 100 percent of the
CPU is being consumed and no disk activity occurs. It is only just before the
commit returns that there will be large amounts of disk activity.

RESOLUTION
==========
