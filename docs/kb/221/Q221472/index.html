-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Service Pack 4 for Windows NT 4.0 introduced the Security Configuration Manager
(SCM) utility.

NOTE: This utility is not installed by default with SP4 but must be installed
seperately.

SCM installs a new Access Control List (ACL) Editor, the tool used to set
permissions on files. When moving files within the same partition on an NTFS
volume, the resulting permissions of the files moved are not what would be
previously expected.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Prior to the new ACL Editor, permissions were retained for files that were moved
within the same partition. When files are moved within the same partition, the
entries in the Master File Table are simply modified; therefore, the ACL does
not have to be re-created.

With the new ACL Editor, you need to take into account the inheritance bit.

When files are moved within the same partition and the inherited permissions of
the new parent do not conflict with the old parent, there is no problem. The
problem occurs when there is a conflict between the permissions being inherited
from the new parent and the old parent.

For example:

  C:
    \Dir1
    \Dir2
         \SubDir

Permissions are as follows:

  Dir1 : Admins=FC; Users=Change; Power Users=Change
  Dir2 : Admins=FC; Users=Read
  SubDir : Inherit=On; (Admins=FC; Users=Read) inherited from parent
  ('Inherit=On' means that the inheritance check box is selected.)

If SubDir is moved to Dir1, the permissions are as follows in ACL Editor for
SubDir:

  Inherit=Off; Administrators=Full; Users=Read

Both Users and Administrators are unavailable, as if they are set to still
inherit permissions, the permissions are also not editable. If you reset the
permissions (make a change) on the parent, the child's permissions will be
available and can be edited.

Expected behavior should be:

- Move will not change the security; that is, SubDir will continue to have the
  inherited information from Dir2.

- Making change to Dir1 permissions should make SubDir protected (inherit=off)
  and all the permissions should become explicit but remain the same as they
  were before the move.
