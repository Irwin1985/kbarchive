-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, used with:
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an SNA Windows NT client attempts to connect to an SNA Server that is running
on a non-trusted Windows 2000 Server-based computer with the Guest account
enabled, the SNA client fails to connect, and you receive the following error
message:

  ERROR #1003
  SnaBase could not open a sponsor connection to server [Servername]

However, if an SNA Windows 95 or Windows 98 client is used, and the Guest account
is explicitly used on the same non-trusted Windows 2000 Server-based computer,
the connection succeeds.

If an SNA Server Distributed Link Service (for example, SnaRem1) attempts to
connect through an SNA Server link service that is running on a non-trusted
Windows 2000 Server-based computer, the connection may stay in a pending state,
and the following event is logged:

  Event ID: 705
  Source: SNA DLC Link Service
  Description: Logon Failed
  EXPLANATION
  Connection request failed due to data security.
  Access denied -- Error Code: 43

On the Windows 2000-based computer, the SnaBase Service logs the following event
whenever the Distributed Link Service attempts to connect (approximately every
10-20 seconds):

  Event ID: 705
  Source: SNA Base Service
  Description: Logon Failed.
  EXPLANATION
  Access denied on client-server or Distributed Link Service connection
  request.

  Unknown user name or bad password from client [computername] --- Error Code :
  4097

  ACTION
  Contact your network support personnel.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 2000 implements stricter Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) security
during client logon than Windows NT 4.0, which prevents failover to the Guest
account if the ISC_REQ_INTEGRITY option is requested during the Security Support
Provider Interface (SSPI) logon process. Because the SNA client requests this
option, a non-trusted user's NTLM logon fails on Windows 2000 even when the
Guest account is enabled. However, if the Guest account is explicitly specified
(by using the SNA Windows 95 or Windows 98 client Advanced options, which are
not available in the SNA Windows NT client), the logon succeeds because it is
clear that Guest access is being requested.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

To work around the problem, the SNA client or Distributed Link Service must use a
user account and password that exists in the target Windows 2000 domain. Or, if
you are using the SNA Windows 95 or Windows 98 client, you can configure the
client to connect explicitly as the Guest user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows 2000 Service Pack 2. The English version of this fix should have the
following file attributes or later:
