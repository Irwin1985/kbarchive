-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.0 SP1, 5.0 SP2, 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Exchange Server Information Store service, the
service may not start, you may receive Jet Error 1276 (ecDomainError), and Event
ID 1088 may be logged. Typically, to troubleshoot this type of error you need to
reinstall Exchange Server and use the organization and site name that are
displayed in the event ID 1088 error message. However, after you reinstall
Exchange Server the information store may still be unable to start and may log
the same events, but in the description of this event ID 1088 the Distinguished
Name (DN) of the directory and the message database are reversed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Priv.edb and the Pub.edb databases have different
DNs. This typically occurs if you install Exchange Server with an organization
or site name that does not match the information stores that you are restoring,
and you only restore either the Priv.edb or the Pub.edb database. When you try
to start the restored Priv.edb or Pub.edb database, the restored database DN
does not match the DN of the directory and the restored database logs the
following event:

  Event ID: 1088
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: General

  The information store could not be loaded because the distinguished name(DN)of
  message database
  /O=&lt;org_name&gt;/OU=&lt;site_name&gt;/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN= does not match the
  DN of directory
  /O=&lt;org_name&gt;/OU=&lt;site_name&gt;/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=.

  The database may have been restored to a computer that is in an organization
  or site different than the original database.

Note that only one of the .edb files is restored, and that the other .edb file
has the correct DN associated to the current directory. This issue occurs
because to troubleshoot this type of problem, you typically need to back up the
Mdbdata directory, remove Exchange Server, and then reinstall Exchange Server
with the organization and site name of the DN value that the event ID 1088 error
message contains. When you install Exchange Server with a new organization and
site name, the DN of the directory matches the .edb file that you originally
restored, but the other .edb file DN is incorrect. When you attempt to start the
information store, it logs an event ID 1088 error message in which the directory
DN and the message database DN have switched from the previous event ID 1088
error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Note the source of the event ID 1005 error message. For example:

  Event ID: 1005
  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Error
  Category: General
  Description:
  Unable to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store. Error 0x4fc.

  When you attempt to start the information store, the information store starts
  the private information store first. Therefore, if the source of event ID
  1005 error message is MSExchangeIS Private, the DN in the directory is not
  working on the Priv.edb database. Note that the Information Store service
  stops processing at this point, so the Pub.edb database DN may not match the
  directory either (make sure that the DN in the directory is correct). If the
  source of the event ID 1005 error message is MSExchangeIS Public, the DN of
  the Priv.edb database is correct and the DN of the Pub.edb database is
  incorrect.

2. Make sure that you restore both the Priv.edb and the Pub.edb database files
  from the same backup set (or that the Priv.edb and the Pub.edb database files
  at least have DNs that match) and that you reinstall Exchange Server with the
  DN that matches the .edb files.
