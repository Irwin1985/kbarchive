SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the possible causes of data corruption in Visual FoxPro. The
article also includes some tools for fixing data corruption.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although this is by no means a complete list of every possible cause of
corruption, it is meant to be a starting point for troubleshooting data
corruption problems in Visual FoxPro.

Possible causes for data corruption are:

- Abnormal termination of the application while manipulating data. This would
  include loss of power, voltage spikes, internal consistency errors, page
  faults, and fatal exception errors.

- Substandard or faulty network components: Because FoxPro handles data so
  quickly, it can stress the network. These components may include network
  drivers, network interface cards, cabling, hubs, and switches.

- Data storage components: Storage devices should be checked regularly for
  errors and fragmentation.

- File locking issues: If one user performs an action that results in a table's
  memo file being locked, and a second user attempts to open the same table and
  access the memo field information, the second user may open the memo file
  with an incorrect blocksize, resulting in memo file corruption. See the
  "References" section in this article for details.

- Conflicting software: Software such as Antivirus packages, screen savers, and
  terminate-and-stay-resident applications (TSRs) can cause conflicts with
  Visual FoxPro that could cause data corruption.

- Incompatible video drivers: Certain video drivers can cause FoxPro to become
  unstable and terminate abnormally. See the "References" section in this
  article for more details.

- Network Settings and Service Packs: Make sure that your servers are running
  the latest service packs, check client settings (such as caching), and even
  try switching network client drivers (such as from the Novell Netware client
  to the Microsoft client for Netware).
