The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you uninstall the Exchange Server Mailbox Manager service, there may still
be mailbox resources left behind for this service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first time that the Mailbox Manager service is started, the Mailbox Manager
service creates a mailbox on the server that is called "Microsoft Exchange
Server Mailbox Manager for &lt;server_name&gt;."

If you simply uninstall the Mailbox Manager service, you do not remove this
mailbox from the Mailbox Resources container.

If you click the mailbox, you receive the following error message:

  The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be because replication
  has not completed.
  Microsoft Exchange Directory
  ID no: c1010aae.

To remove this mailbox, you need to use the Exchange Server Administrator program
in raw mode.

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

To remove the mailbox:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by typing the
  following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Connect to the server that the mailbox that you want to remove is located on.

3. Locate the Mailbox Resources container in which the mailbox you want to
  delete is located. The Mailbox Resources container has a parent container
  that is called the Private Information Store container. Click the Private
  Information Store container, and then click Raw Properties on the File menu.

4. Under the object attributes, click Obj-Dist-Name, and then select the entire
  value under Edit Value. Make sure that you have selected the entire value,
  and then press CTRL+C to copy that value. The value should look very similar
  to the following:

  (/o=&lt;organization&gt;/ou=&lt;site&gt;/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=&lt;server_name&gt;/cn=Microsoft
  Private MDB)

  Note that only your &lt;organization&gt;, &lt;site&gt;, and
  &lt;server_name&gt; values should be different. Click Cancel.

5. Click the Add-ins container, click New on the File menu, click Other, and
  then click Raw Object.

6. Click Mailbox, and then click OK.

7. Click Delivery Mechanism, type "0" (without the quotation marks) in the Edit
  Value box, and then click Set.

8. Click Directory Name, type "MCAserver_name" (without the quotation marks) in
  the Edit Value box, and then click Set (where server_name is the name of your
  server). For example, if your server is named MICROSOFT1, you would type
  "MCAMICROSOFT1" (without the quotation marks).

9. Under "List attributes of type", click NonExisting.

10. Under Object Attributes, click Home-MDB.

11. In the Edit Value box, paste the full distinguished name of the home
  Messaging Database (MDB) where the mailbox that you want to delete is
  located (this is the data that you copied in step 4). To paste this full
  distinguished name in the Edit Value box, press CTRL+V. Click Set.

12. Click Apply, and then click OK.

13. In the Add-Ins container, click the MCA&lt;server_name&gt; object, and then
  press the DELETE key. Click Yes to confirm the deletion.

14. Look in the Mailbox Resources container. The "Microsoft Exchange Server
  Mailbox Manager for &lt;server_name&gt;" mailbox should be gone. You need to
  update the screen by pressing the F5 key before the mailbox disappears.
