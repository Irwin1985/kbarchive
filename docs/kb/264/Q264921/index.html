SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the different authentication methods available in IIS for
both Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. For a more complete description of the
information discussed in this article, please refer to the Windows NT 4.0 and
Windows 2000 Resource Guides.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Authentication Methods Available for Windows NT 4.0
---------------------------------------------------

Anonymous - No logon is required and anyone is allowed to gain access to data
that is protected with this method. The server uses a built in account
(IUSR_[machine name] by default) to control the permissions on the files. The
browser does not send any credentials or user info with this type of request.

- Browsers Supported: Any
- Limitations: None
- User Rights Required: The anonymous user account defined on the server must
  have "Log On Locally" permissions.
- Encryption Type: None

Basic (Clear Text) - The server requests the user to log on and a dialog box
appears in the browser that allows the user to enter the credentials that are
needed. These credentials must match the user credentials defined on the files
that the user is attempting to access.

- Browsers Supported: Any
- Limitations: Not very secure. Passwords are easily deciphered.
- User Rights Required: The user account must have "Log On Locally"
  permissions.
- Encryption Type: Base 64 Encoding (not true encryption)

Windows NT Challenge/Response - The server requests the user to log on. If the
browser supports Windows NT Challenge/Response, it automatically sends the
user's credentials if the user is logged on. If the domain that the user is on
is different than the server's domain, or if the user is not logged on, a dialog
box appears requesting the credentials to send. Windows NT Challenge/Response
uses an algorithm to generate a hash based on the user's credentials and the
computer that the user is using. It then sends this hash to the server. The
browser does not send the user's password across to the server.

- Browsers Supported: Internet Explorer versions 3.01 and later
- Limitations: Requires point-to-point connection. Usually, a circuit is closed
  after a "401 unauthorized " error message; however, when negotiating a
  Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication sequence (which requires
  multiple round trips), the server keeps the circuit open for the duration of
  the sequence after the client has indicated that it will use Windows NT
  Challenge/Response. CERN proxies and certain other Internet devices prevent
  this from working. Also, Windows NT Challenge/Response does not support
  double-hop impersonations (in that once passed to the IIS server, the same
  credentials cannot be passed to a back-end server for authentication).
- User Rights Required: The user account that is accessing the server must have
  "Access this computer from the network" permissions.
- Encryption Type: NTLM Hash algorithm that is also uuencoded.

Orders of Precedence: When the browser makes a request, it always considers the
first request to be Anonymous. Therefore, it does not send any credentials. If
the server does not accept Anonymous OR if the Anonymous user account set on the
server does not have permissions to the file being requested, the IIS server
responds with an "Access Denied" error message and sends a list of the
authentication types that are supported by using one of the following
scenarios:

- If Windows NT Challenge/Response is the only supported method (or if
  Anonymous fails), then the browser must support this method to communicate
  with the server. Otherwise, it cannot negotiate with the server and the user
  receives an "Access Denied" error message.
- If Basic is the only supported method (or if Anonymous fails), then a dialog
  box appears in the browser to get the credentials, and then passes these
  credentials to the server. It attempts to send these credentials up to three
  times. If these all fail, the browser is not connected to the server.
- If both Basic and Windows NT Challenge/Response are supported, the browser
  determines which method is used. If the browser supports Windows NT
  Challenge/Response, it uses this method and does not fall back to Basic. If
  Windows NT Challenge/Response is not supported, the browser uses Basic.

NOTES:

- When your browser establishes a connection with a Web site by using Basic or
  NTLM authentication, it does not fall back to Anonymous during the rest of
  that session with the server. If you try to connect to a Web page that is
  marked for Anonymous only after authenticating, you will be denied. (This may
  or may not hold true for Netscape).
- When Internet Explorer has established a connection with the server by using
  Basic or NTLM authentication, it passes the credentials for every new request
  for the duration of the session.

Authentication Methods Available for Windows 2000
-------------------------------------------------

Anonymous - No logon is required and anyone is allowed to gain access to data
protected with this method. The server uses a built in account (IUSR_[machine
name] by default) to control the permissions on the files. The browser does not
send any credentials or user info with this type of request.

- Browsers Supported: Any
- Limitations: None
- User Rights Required: The Anonymous user account defined on the server must
  have "Log On Locally" permissions.
- Encryption Type: None

Basic (Clear Text) - The server requests the user to log on and a dialog box
appears in the browser that allows the user to enter the credentials that are
needed. These credentials must match the user credentials defined on the files
that the user is attempting to access.

- Browsers Supported: Any
- Limitations: Not extremely secure. Passwords are easily deciphered.
- User Rights Required: The user account must have "Log on Locally" rights
- Encryption Type: Base 64 Encoding (not true encryption)

Digest - The server requests the user to log on and also sends a NONCE used to
encrypt the password. The browser uses the NONCE to encrypt the password and
sends this to the server. The server then encrypts its own copy of the user's
password and compares the two. If they match and the user has permissions,
access is granted.

- Browsers Supported: Internet Explorer 5 only
- Limitations: Not as secure as Integrated. Requires the server to have access
  to an Active Directory Server that is set up for Digest Authentication.
- User Rights Required: Requires passwords to have "Save password as encrypted
  Clear Text"
- Encryption Type: Based on NONCE sent by server.

  Q222028 Setting Up Digest Authentication for Use with IIS 5.0

Fortezza - To use Fortezza security with IIS 5.0, you need to have an appropriate
Cryptographic API Service Provider (CSP) file from a Fortezza provider such as
http://www.spyrus.com.

Windows Integrated (split into two sub categories)
Kerberos - The server requests a user to log on. If the browser supports
Kerberos, The following takes place:

- IIS requests authentication.
- If the client has not logged on to a domain, a dialog box appears in Internet
  Explorer requesting credentials, and then contacts the KDC to request and
  receive a Ticket Granting Ticket. It then sends the Ticket Granting Ticket
  along with information about the IIS server to the KDC.
- If the IE Client has already successfully logged into the domain and received
  a Ticket Granting Ticket, it sends this ticket along with info about the IIS
  server to the KDC
- The KDC issues the client a Resource Ticket.
- The Client passes this ticket to the IIS server.

Kerberos uses tickets generated at a Ticket Granting Server (KDC) to
authenticate. It sends this ticket to the IIS server. The browser does NOT send
the user's password across to the server.

- Browsers Supported: Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and above
- Limitations: the server must have access to an Active Directory server. Both
  the server and the client must have a trusted connection to a KDC.
- User Rights Required: The Anonymous user account defined on the server must
  have "Log On Locally" permissions.
- Encryption type: Encrypted ticket.

Windows NT Challenge/Response - The server requests the user to log on. If the
browser supports Windows NT Challenge/Response, it automatically sends the
user's credentials if the user is logged on. If the domain that the user is on
is different than the server's domain, or if the user is not logged on, a dialog
box appears in Internet Explorer requesting the credentials to send. Windows NT
Challenge/Response uses an algorithm to generate a hash based on the user's
credentials and the computer that the user is using. It then sends this hash to
the server. The browser does not send the user's password across to the server.

- Browsers Supported: Internet Explorer versions 3.01 and later.
- Limitations: Requires point-to-point connection. Typically, a circuit is
  closed after a "401 unauthorized " error message; however, when negotiating
  an Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication sequence (which requires
  multiple round trips), the server keeps the circuit open for the duration of
  the sequence after the client has indicated that it will use Windows NT
  Challenge/Response. CERN proxies and certain other Internet devices prevent
  this from working. Also, Windows NT Challenge/Response does not support
  double-hop impersonations (meaning that once passed to the IIS server, the
  same credentials cannot be passed to a back-end server for authentication,
  for example, when IIS uses Windows NT Challenge/Response, it cannot then
  authenticate the user against a SQL Server database on another computer by
  using SQL Integrated security).
- User Rights Required: The user account accessing the server must have "Access
  this computer from the network " permissions.
- Encryption Type: NTLM Hash algorithm that is also uuencoded.

Orders of Precedence: When the browser makes a request, it always considers the
first request to be Anonymous. Therefore, it does not send any credentials. If
the server does not accept Anonymous or if the Anonymous user account set on the
server does not have permissions to the file being requested, the IIS server
responds with an "Access Denied" error message and sends a list of the
authentication types that are supported by using one of the following
scenarios:

- If Windows Integrated is the only supported method (or if Anonymous fails),
  then the browser must support this method to communicate with the server. The
  server tries Kerberos first, and if this fails, then the server falls back to
  Windows NT Challenge/Response. If this fails, the server does not try any of
  the other methods.
- If Basic is the only supported method (or if Anonymous fails), then a dialog
  box appears in the to get the credentials, and then passes these to the
  server. It attempts to send the credentials up to three times. If these all
  fail, the browser does not connect to the server.
- If both Basic and Windows Integrated are supported, the browser determines
  which method is used. If the browser supports Kerberos or Windows NT
  Challenge/Response, it uses this method. It does not fall back to Basic. If
  Windows NT Challenge/Response and Kerberos are not supported, the browser
  uses Basic, Digest, or Fortezza if it supports these. The order of precedence
  here is Basic, Digest, and then Fortezza.

NOTES:

- When your browser establishes a connection with a Web site by using Basic or
  Windows Integrated authentication, it does not fall back to Anonymous during
  the rest of that session with the server. If you try to connect to a Web page
  that is marked for Anonymous only after authenticating, you are denied. (This
  may or may not hold true for Netscape).
- When Internet Explorer has established a connection with the server by using
  an authentication method other than Anonymous, it automatically passes the
  credentials for every new request during the duration of the session.
