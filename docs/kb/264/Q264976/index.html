SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Boot32wn.exe tool or another process on a Systems Management
Server (SMS)-based client computer, the computer service may be very slow. The
following errors may be reported in the Wn_logon.log file:

  Writing local TCF file C:\WINDOWS\MS\SMS\CORE\DATA\temp.tcf
  $$&lt;C:\WINDOWS\MS\SMS\CORE\BIN\BOOT32WN.EXE&gt;

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the client belongs to a site where the logon script has
been modified to run Smsls.bat during the logon process. According to the log
file, the computer attempts to connect again after 10 minutes. It continues to
attempt to connect seven times. This process causes the client to run slowly for
the first 70 minutes that it is logged on to the site.

The error may result from a corrupt Copylog.tcf file on the primary domain
controller (PDC) or another domain controller. You can find the .tcf file on any
SMSLOGON share in the Config folder. If possible, check the domain controller
that authenticated the client during its last logon attempt.

A normal Copylog.tcf file contains the following entries in the File Source
section:

  [FILE SOURCE]
  x86.bin\smsboot1.exe=ZZZ
  x86.bin\boot32wn.exe=ZZZ
  X86.BIN\CLICORE.EXE=ZZZ
  x86.bin\00000409\SMSMan.exe=ZZZ
  x86.bin\boot16wn.exe=ZZZ

  ALPHA\MSVCRT.DLL=ZZZ
  SITES\ZZZ\NETCONF.NCF=ZZZ
  SITES\ZZZ\caplist.ini=ZZZ
  x86.bin\00000409\RegNec98.exe=ZZZ

The following text is from the File Source section in a corrupt Copylog.tcf
file:

  [FILE SOURCE]
  SITES\ZZZ\cli_inst.cfg=ZZZ
  SITES\ZZZ\NETCONF.NCF=ZZZ
  SITES\ZZZ\caplist.ini=ZZZ

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

Method One
----------

1. Copy the Copylog.tcf file to another folder and open the file with a text
  editor such as Microsoft Notepad.

  NOTE: If you have an existing logon point that has not been written over or if
  you have a copy from a good backup, then you should be able to restore the
  file easily.

2. Revise the file so that the entries match the entries that are listed in a
  normal Copylog.tcf file.

3. Set all of the site code entries to that of the senior site.

4. Save the revised Copylog.tcf file in the Config folder in the SMSLOGON share
  on the PDC.

5. Start the Logon Server Manager's update cycle. The correct file then
  overwrites the corrupt .tcf files in the domain.

Method Two
----------

1. Delete the files that are referenced in the .tcf file from the PDC's SMSLOGON
  share.

2. Force the Logon Server Manager cycle to run on the senior site. The deleted
  files are then replaced and the entries are written back to the .tcf file
  again.

The .tcf file is not generated by the senior site, rather it is generated by the
Logon Server Manager cycle from each site. The Logon Server Manager from each
site builds a list of files that it needs on the PDC's logon point and then
writes this list to its unique .lcf file. The Logon Server Manager then writes
the .lcf file to the Smslogon\Sitescfg folder. First, the PDC is updated on the
senior site, and then each logon point is updated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue can be caused by different versions of the Nt_logon.dll file that
exist among sites installed in the same domain. This situation may occur if you
apply any fix on a site that includes an updated Nt_logon.dll file. Until SMS
Service Pack 2 (SP2), the Logon Server Manager did not check to verify the
entries in the .tcf file. Currently, the entries are verified by the Logon
Server Manager and under certain conditions, for example, if there is a line
missing from the .tcf file, incorrect syntax, a missing file, newer files being
written, or a different site code, the line is updated by the Logon Server
Manager.
