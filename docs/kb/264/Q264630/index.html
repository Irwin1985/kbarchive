SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, you
may experience the following issues:

Issue 1
-------

When multiple sites control a domain and SMS sites are not upgraded
simultaneously, the Smslogon\Config\Copylog.tcf file is modified by the Service
Pack 1 (SP1) site as well as the SP2 site. If the SP1 site modifies the
Copylog.tcf file last (by using Microsoft Windows NT Logon Server Manager), it
updates and changes most of the entries in the Copylog.tcf file.

The Copylog.tcf file is used to indicate which site supplied the logon point's
client boundaries (specially Clicore.exe). An SP1 site without the update can
change the Copylog.tcf file to indicate that it supplied the logon point's
Clicore file, even though it did not copy the file. The incorrect SP1
Clicore.exe entry in the Copylog.tcf file causes problems for new installations
as well as existing SP1 clients when they are using the logon point. This
situation prevents new clients from being installed and causes SP1 clients to
copy the SP2 Clicore.exe file, which results in a mixed installation state. Some
common conditions seen on the client and in the client logs when in a mixed
installation state include:

- Components are in a "Repair Pending" state.

- The Software Advertisement Program Wizard and Manager are unable to run.

- A Required .dll file, Clilog.dll, is not found.

Issue 2
-------

When two sites share site boundaries and both sites use Remote Installation, SP1
sites are unable to install SP1 components onto SP2 clients.

The updates listed in articles Q252718 and Q252717 in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base add functionality to the Client Configuration Manager (CCM) and
Ccmbtldr.exe components that verify that the client does not have files from a
later release. The SP1 update prevents SP1 from attempting to remotely install
on SP2 clients. This functionality is included with SP2 and this will not be an
issue for future service pack releases.

Applying the update after this problem is already occurring stops it from
retrying to install onto the client, but existing Client Configuration Requests
(CCR) that have already started processing attempt every hour for a total of 7
days before they time out. Not applying the update does not cause clients to get
into a mixed installation state. Only the issues described in articles Q251070
and Q249077 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (the Copylog.tcf issue) causes
clients to get into a mixed installation state. Common issues observed on
clients include:

- Software advertisements do not reach the clients.

- Orphaned clients that do not recover from mixed installation.


CAUSE
=====

These issues can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

- Required SMS updates to SMS sites that exist in the same domain were not
  installed before you upgraded to SP2 for SMS:

   - Issue 1: These issues can occur if you did not install the updates listed
     in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:

SMS 2.0 (No Service Pack) Sites:

  Q251070 SMS: Copylog.tcf Does Not Show Site that Updated Logon Point

SP1 Sites:

  Q249077 SMS: SP1:Copylog.tcf Does Not Show Site that Updated Logon Point

   - Issue 2: These issues can occur if you did not install the updates listed
     in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:

SMS 2.0 (No Service Pack) Sites:

  Q252718 SMS: CCM Avoids Installation Attempts on SP2 Clients

SP1 Sites:

  Q252717 SMS: SP1: CCM Avoids Installation Attempts on SP2 Clients

- All SMS sites in a domain are not or were not upgraded beginning with the
  central parent site within several hours of each other.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve these issues, use the appropriate method.

Issue 1
-------

- Applying the update after a client is in the mixed state does not repair the
  clients that are in a mixed state. Also, applying the updates before
  upgrading to SP2 prevents new installations to clients that are assigned to a
  SP1 site until the client's assigned site is upgraded to SP2. If the client
  has two sites and one is at SP1 and the other is at SP2, the client upgrades
  successfully to SP2.

- If for some reason the updates cannot be applied to remote systems for some
  period of time due to distance, or unavailability of technical support
  personnel at the remote location, you can remotely edit the Copylog.tcf file:

  1. Edit the Copylog.tcf file on the primary domain controller (PDC) in the
     \\PDC\SMSLOGON\Config folder by using a text editor such as Notepad.exe,
     and modify the following line

  X86.BIN\CLICORE.EXE=&lt;XXX&gt;

     where &lt;XXX&gt; is the site code for the SP2 site.

  2. Change the permissions on the Copylog.tcf file to Read Only and assign
     Full Control permission only to a domain user account that has Domain
     Admin privileges, however, do not use the Administrator or the SMS service
     account. Also, assign Read privileges to the Everyone group. Note that new
     installations to clients which fall into the subnet boundary for an SP1
     site do not occur until the SP1 site assigned is upgraded to SP2.

     NOTE: After you upgrade the site to SP2, change the file permissions back
     to their original permissions.

  3. Upgrade all sites to SP2, which repairs and upgrades the clients when they
     are in the mixed mode, except in some cases where the user who is logged
     on is not a local Administrator on the computer.

Issue 2
-------

- Applying the update after CCM attempts to install onto the SP2 client
  resolves the problem and prevents further occurrences, however all of the
  files in the Ccrretry.box file need to be deleted as well or the installation
  attempts are retried every hour for 7 days.

- Upgrade all sites to SP2 which permits remote installations to succeed on
  clients with SP2 files.

- Rename the Ccm.dll file to Ccm.old on the SMS SP1 servers, which prevents it
  from downloading the new Clicore.exe file. However, remote installation for
  all clients stops.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Planning for the Upgrade to Service Pack 2
------------------------------------------

If the SMS 2.0 sites are all going to be upgraded within a 2-hour to 3-hour
period, it is unlikely for mixed installations to occur on clients. A weekend
upgrade may be a good idea if the updates cannot be applied to all sites
quickly.
