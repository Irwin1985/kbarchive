SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how class factories are registered in an OLE local server
created using MFC. This topic is discussed with respect to whether a single
instance of an application can service multiple clients or whether a separate
instance will be launched for each request made by a client.

The class factory specifically attached to the document template behaves
differently based on whether it's a default SDI (single document interface) or
an MDI (multiple document interface) application. Other generic class factories
behave according to how they are registered with OLE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MFC provides an interface implementation for the class factory (IClassFactory)
in a class called COleObjectFactory, which serves as a generic type of factory.
In addition, MFC also provides a specific class factory called
COleTemplateServer, derived from COleObjectFactory, to create documents using
the framework's document/view architecture.

In the case of a local server, the class factories have to be registered with OLE
so that other applications can connect to them. In MFC, all the class factories
of a server are typically registered in CWinApp::InitInstance by calling the
static function COleObjectFactory::RegisterAll(). This function calls
COleObjectFactory::Register() for each of the class factories, which in turn
calls CoRegisterClassObject in the case of a local server. In the case of an
inproc server, there is no need to register the class factories with OLE because
COM loads the DLL (that is, the server) and invokes a well- known entry-point,
called DllGetClassObject, to retrieve an IClassFactory interface.

When a client requests that a server create an instance of an object, the
decision to use a running instance of the server, if one is available, or to
launch another instance of the server is made by OLE depending on how the class
factory for the object is registered. The determining factor is the fourth
parameter to CoRegisterClassObject, which specifies how many objects can be
created using this class factory. If REGCLS_SINGLEUSE is specified, OLE will
launch another instance of the application each time a client requests an
instance of an object class. If REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE is specified, one instance of
the application can service any number of objects.

MDI applications use the same main frame window (that is, the same instance of
the application) and create a new MDI child window for each request made by a
client to create an object instance. When a client calls CoCreateInstance to
create a document window object exposed by COleTemplateServer, a new MDI child
window is created using the same MDI frame window. MFC implements this concept
by passing in FALSE as the m_bMultiInstance parameter to the ConnectTemplate
function of COleTemplateServer. This registers the class factory as single
instance by passing REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE to CoRegisterClassObject.

SDI applications, on the other hand, can manage only one document window at a
time. Hence, SDI applications are by default single use only; that is, a
separate instance (or a document window) is created for each call to
CoCreateInstance made by a client. This is implemented in an MFC application by
passing in TRUE as the m_bMultiInstance parameter to
COleTemplateServer::ConnectTemplate, which registers the class factory as
multiple instance by passing REGCLS_SINGLEUSE to CoRegisterClassObject.

Generic class factories that are used to create any C++ object are registered as
single- or multiple-use based on how the constructor for COleObjectFactory is
invoked. The constructor takes a bMultiInstance parameter that specifies whether
the class factory is registered as REGCLS_SINGLEUSE (bMultiInstance == TRUE) or
REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE (bMultiInstance == FALSE).

When ClassWizard is used to add OLE-creatable classes to an MFC application, it
adds the DECLARE_OLECREATE and IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE macros. DECLARE_OLECREATE
declares a static object of type COleObjectFactory, and IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE
creates this object by invoking the constructor of COleObjectFactory with the
bMultiInstance parameter set to FALSE. In other words, ClassWizard registers the
generic class factory as REGCLS_MULTIPLEUSE. Hence by default, a single instance
of an OLE-creatable class generated by ClassWizard can serve multiple requests
to create an instance of this object class.

This behavior can be altered by replacing IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE with a custom
macro, say MY_IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE, which invokes the COleObjectFactory
constructor with the bMultiInstance parameter set to TRUE, which will then
register a REGCLS_SINGLEUSE class factory. For example:

  #define MY_IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE(class_name, external_name, l, w1, w2,
          b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8) \ 
          COleObjectFactory class_name::factory(class_name::guid, \ 
          RUNTIME_CLASS(class_name), TRUE, _T(external_name)); \ 
          const GUID CDECL class_name::guid = \ 
          { l, w1, w2, { b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8 } }; \ 

  MY_IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE(CMyClass, "Test", 0xc9c99ae0, 0xad41, 0x101b,
                         0x83, 0xea, 0x0, 0x0, 0x83, 0x78, 0xac, 0x8b)

The CLSID used in this macro call should be replaced with the actual CLSID
assigned for this particular object, which can be found in the original
IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE macro.
