SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create the basic framework of a working Visual
Basic 4.0 add-in.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creating a Minimal Add-in
-------------------------

At its minimum, a Visual Basic add-in is an OLE automation server that provides
an object with both ConnectAddin and DisconnectAddin methods. The server can be
written in any language that can create OLE automation servers.

The steps to create the minimal add-in using Visual Basic 4.0 are documented in
this article. Then, this article shows you how to make some basic enhancements
that the majority of add-ins will need.

1. Start Project:

  The first step in creating the minimal add-in is to start a new project. The
  minimal add-in does not need the default form; so, remove the form from the
  project.

2. Create Sub Main:

  The minimal add-in needs a starting point. So, add a new standard (.BAS)
  module to the project. Then, add an empty Sub Main procedure to the module:

     Sub Main()

     End Sub

3. Create a Class:

  The heart of the add-in is the public-creatable OLE automation object. The
  following are the steps for creating this object:

  a. Add a new Class (.cls) module to the project.

  b. Set the following properties on the new class:

     Property                Value
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     Instancing              2 - Creatable MultiUse
     Name                    MinimalAddIn
     Public                  True
 

4. Expose ConnectAddIn and DisconnectAddIn Methods:

  When the automation manager loads an add-in, it looks for and calls the
  ConnectAddin method. The add-in manager passes an instance of the Application
  object to the ConnectAddin method. The add-in can then use this object for
  automating the Visual Basic design environment. In the minimal add-in, show a
  message in this method of the class with the following code:

     Public Sub ConnectAddIn(VBInstance As Object)
        MsgBox "ConnectAddIn"
     End Sub

  Similarly, the add-in manager looks for and calls the DisconnectAddIn method
  when unloading an add-in. In the minimal add-in, show a message in this
  method of the class with the following code:

     Public Sub DisconnectAddIn()
        MsgBox "DisconnectAddIn"
     End Sub

5. Set the Project Options:

  At this point you have added all the code necessary for the minimal add-in.
  However, you need to set the project options to expose this project as an OLE
  automation server. Set the following in the Tools/Options dialog box:

  Option                  Value
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Start up Form           Sub Main
  Project Name            Example
  Start Mode              OLE Server
  Error Trapping          Break in Class Module

6. Make Add-In available to Add-In Manager:

  Now you need to make the minimal add-in available to the Add-In manager. The
  add-in looks in Vb.ini under either the Add-Ins16 or Add-Ins32 section
  depending on whether you are running the 16-bit or 32-bit versions of Visual
  Basic. The add-in manager looks for available add-ins in the form of
  ProgID=n, where ProgID is the OLE Automation ProgID for your class and n is 0
  or 1. 0 means the add-in is available but Visual Basic doesn't have it
  loaded. 1 means that the add-in is or should be loaded. For the minimal add-
  in in 32-bit Visual Basic, you need to add the following to the Vb.ini:

     [Add-Ins32]
     Example.MinimalAddIn=0

7. Testing the Add-In:

  That is it for the minimal add-in. Now you can test it. Go ahead and start up
  the add-in by running the project. To test it you must start up a second
  instance of Visual Basic. In the second instance, bring up the Add-In Manager
  dialog box. There should be a check box with ProgID Example.MinimalAddin next
  to it. Check the box and click OK. The Add-In Manager will call the
  ConnectAddin method of the minimal add-in and the add- in will display the
  message box "ConnectAddIn."

  Now go back to the Add-In Manager in the second instance of Visual Basic.
  Clear Example.MinimalAddin and click OK. The Add-In Manager will call the
  DisconnectAddIn method and the add-in will display the message box
  "DisconnectAddIn."

Expanding the Minimal Add-in
----------------------------

The minimal add-in demonstrated the absolute minimum requirements for creating an
add-in. However, there are some basic things that most add-ins need to do. In
this section you will expand upon the minimal add-in to create a basic add-in
that automatically adds itself to Vb.ini and adds a menu to the Visual Basic
Add-In menu.

1. Reference VBIDE:

  In the minimal add-in you did not use the Visual Basic IDE add-in object
  model. Any add-in that needs to program the IDE must add a reference to the
  "Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Development Environment" object library. Almost
  all add-ins need to add a reference to this library. For the basic add-in, we
  need to use the library to declare variables and to add a menu. So, add a
  reference to this library in the Tools/References dialog box.

2. Change the Class Name:

  To help distinguish the basic add-in from the minimal add-in, change the Name
  property of the class module to BasicAddIn.

3. Store the Instance of the Application Object:

  Most add-ins need to store the instance of the Application object that is
  passed in through the ConnectAddIn method so that it can be used later to
  automate the IDE. For the basic add-in, this means that you need to declare
  an object in the class to store the instance. To do this you need to add the
  following to the general declarations section of the class:

     Private ThisInstance As VBIDE.Application

  When the ConnectAddIn method is called, the ThisInstance variable needs to be
  set to the instance passed in. To do this, change the ConnectAddIn method to
  the following:

     Public Sub ConnectAddIn(VBInstance As Object)
        Set ThisInstance = VBInstance
     End Sub

4. Adding and Removing a MenuLine:

  The majority of add-ins also need to add a menu item to the Add-In menu so
  that users can trigger some functionality in their add-in. In the basic add-
  in, you simply show a message if the user clicks the menu item. Before adding
  the code to create the menu, you need to add two variables to the general
  declarations section of the class:

     Private AddInMenuLine As VBIDE.MenuLine
     Private hMenuLine As Long

  The AddInMenuLine object is used to store a reference to the newly created
  menu and the hMenuLine is used to store a handle that will be discussed
  shortly.

  Now you can add the code necessary for adding the MenuLine to the ConnectAddIn
  method:

     Set AddInMenuLine = ThisInstance.AddInMenu.MenuItems.Add("Basic Add-In")

  This adds a MenuLine to the Add-In menu with the caption "Basic Add-In" and
  sets a reference to the object.

  After adding the MenuLine you need to connect the MenuLine to an event
  handler. In this case the AfterClick event of the MenuLine object is what you
  want to handle. First you need to create an event handler for the AfterClick
  in the class. The AfterClick event handler should look like the following:

     Public Sub AfterClick()
        MsgBox "Basic Add-In Example"
     End Sub

  Now that you have an event handler you need to add code to the ConnectAddIn
  method that connects the MenuLine to the class. To do this you need to call
  the ConnectEvents method of the MenuLine object. This method returns a handle
  that we will use later to disconnect the event handler. Here is the code for
  connecting the events to the class:

     hMenuLine = AddInMenuLine.ConnectEvents(Me)

  You also need to add code to the DisconnectAddIn method that disconnects the
  event handler and removes the MenuLine. The events are disconnected by
  calling the DisconnectEvents method of the MenuLine object and the MenuLine
  is removed by calling the Remove method of the MenuItems collection:

     AddInMenuLine.DisconnectEvents hMenuLine
     ThisInstance.AddInMenu.MenuItems.Remove AddInMenuLine

  At this point, the entire class module should look something like the
  following:

    Option Explicit

    Private ThisInstance As VBIDE.Application
    Private AddInMenuLine As VBIDE.MenuLine
    Private hMenuLine As Long

    Public Sub ConnectAddIn(VBInstance As Object)
       Set ThisInstance = VBInstance
        Set AddInMenuLine = ThisInstance.AddInMenu.MenuItems.Add("Basic Add-_ 
                                                               In")
       hMenuLine = AddInMenuLine.ConnectEvents(Me)
    End Sub

    Public Sub DisconnectAddIn(Mode As Integer)
       AddInMenuLine.DisconnectEvents hMenuLine
       ThisInstance.AddInMenu.MenuItems.Remove AddInMenuLine
    End Sub

    Public Sub AfterClick()
       MsgBox "Basic Add-In Example"
    End Sub

5. Automatically Adding Add-In to Vb.ini:

  In the minimal add-in, you added the add-in to the Vb.ini by hand. However, it
  is much easier for the user to install the add-in if it does this
  automatically. To do this requires the use of GetPrivateProfileString to
  check if it has already been added and WritePrivateProfileString to add it if
  it isn't there. A good place to put this code is in the Sub Main for EXE
  servers. However, for DLL servers, the Sub Main is not executed so this does
  not work. If you are creating a DLL server you will have to put this code
  somewhere else, such as in your setup program:

     #If Win16 Then
        Declare Function WritePrivateProfileString Lib "KERNEL" ( _
           ByVal AppName As String, ByVal KeyName As String, _
           ByVal keydefault As String, ByVal FileName As String) As Integer
        Declare Function GetPrivateProfileString Lib "KERNEL" ( _
           ByVal AppName As String, ByVal KeyName As String, _
           ByVal keydefault As String, ByVal ReturnString As String, _
           ByVal NumBytes As Integer, ByVal FileName As String) As Integer
     #ElseIf Win32 Then
        Declare Function WritePrivateProfileString Lib "KERNEL32" _
           Alias "WritePrivateProfileStringA" (ByVal AppName As String, _
           ByVal KeyName As String, ByVal keydefault As String, _
           ByVal FileName As String) As Long
        Declare Function GetPrivateProfileString Lib "KERNEL32" _
           Alias "GetPrivateProfileStringA" (ByVal AppName As String, _
           ByVal KeyName As String, ByVal keydefault As String, _
           ByVal ReturnString As String, ByVal NumBytes As Long, _
           ByVal FileName As String) As Long
     #End If

     Sub Main()
        #If Win16 Then
           Const Section = "Add-Ins16"
        #ElseIf Win32 Then
           Const Section = "Add-Ins32"
        #End If
        Const BufSize = 255

        Dim Ret As Variant
        Dim RetStr As String

        'Check to see if the entry is already in the Vb.ini file.
        'Add if not.

        RetStr = Space(BufSize)
        Ret = GetPrivateProfileString(Section, "Example.BasicAddin", _
           "NotFound", RetStr, BufSize, "VB.INI")
        RetStr = Left(RetStr, Ret)
        If RetStr = "NotFound" Then
           WritePrivateProfileString Section, "Example.BasicAddin", _
              "0", "VB.INI"
        End If
     End Sub

6. Testing the Basic Add-In:

  At this point the basic Add-in has been created. To test it, run the project.

  Then, start a second instance of Visual Basic. From the second instance, go to
  the Add-In manager and check Example.BasicAddIn. Then go to the Visual Basic
  Add-In menu. You should see a newly added menu item under the Visual Basic
  Add-In menu. Click the menu and the message box should be displayed.
