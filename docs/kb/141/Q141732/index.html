SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a second Adaptec 154x SCSI controller in your computer running
Windows NT version 3.51 with Service Pack 2 or 3, the driver fails to attach to
the second adapter and the following events from the AHA154x are logged in the
System log:

  A conflict has been detected between two drivers which claimed two
  overlapping memory regions. Driver Aha154x, with device
  &lt;\Device\ScsiPort1.Translated&gt;, claimed a memory range with starting
  address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and length in data address 0x30.

  At the locations in the data area you will find the BIOS address of the first
  adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The driver attempts to use the same BIOS area for the second adapter as it did
for the first one, even if the second adapters BIOS is disabled or at a
different address. Because this address is already in use by the first adapter,
the drivers fails.

The adapter allocates the BIOS area, however, Windows NT does not use it to
prevent problems with other adapters possibly using that memory addresses (for
example, network adapter cards).

WORKAROUND
==========

If you did not encounter any problems with the driver from the Windows NT 3.51
release, use that driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
