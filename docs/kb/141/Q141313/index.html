- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b

SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows, FoxPro executables have an .exe extension, and it is possible to
have one executable call another. FoxPro for Macintosh executables are not built
with the .exe extension by default. FoxPro for Macintosh executables have no
extension by default. Executables built with no extension cannot be called by
another executable. A "file not found" message is returned. To allow an
executable to call another executable, place an .exe extension on the name of
the called executable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps demonstrate how one executable file can call another
executable on the Macintosh.

1. Create a project called FIRST with one program that contains code similar to
  this:

     WAIT WINDOW "ONE"
     DO SECOND

2. Create a project called SECOND with one program that contains:

     WAIT WINDOW "TWO"

3. Build both projects so that the executables are both in the same folder.

4. Close FoxPro, and open the folder containing the two executables.
  Double-click the executable called FIRST. When it tries to execute the line
  DO SECOND, the message "File 'Second' does not exist" will appear.

5. Replace the line DO SECOND with DO SECOND.EXE. When building the second
  executable give it the name SECOND.EXE. The first executable will now be able
  to call the second executable successfully.

Also note that if the calling executable (FIRST) is built after the called
executable (SECOND), the message "Unable to find proc./func. SECOND" will appear
during the build. When the .exe extension is added to the executable it will be
placed in the project as an application and marked as excluded.
