SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines self-help support options available for Windows 95 users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many of the self-help support options mentioned in the this article make
reference to the Microsoft Knowledge Base and the Microsoft Download Center.
Below is a brief description of each.

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

The Microsoft Knowledge Base is the same database that Microsoft Support
Engineers use to provide you with answers over the phone. The database contains
more than 50,000 detailed articles with technical information about Microsoft
products, bug and fix lists, documentation errors, and answers to the most
commonly asked technical support questions.

Microsoft Download Center:

The Microsoft Download Center contains hundreds of free software add-ons, bug
fixes, peripheral drivers, software updates, and programming aids. Included are
two Windows 95 Help files called the Windows 95 Support Assistant, which
contains information and troubleshooting advice on pre-setup, setup, and
networking, and the Hardware Compatibility List, which lists all the PC systems
and peripherals compatible with Windows 95.

Built-in Support
----------------

There are a variety of new and enhanced support tools built into Windows 95.
These tools are designed to answer many of your questions on how to use Windows
95.

Windows 95 Tour:

When you start Windows 95 you see the Welcome Screen, which contains a Windows
Tour button. Choosing this button launches a 10-minute interactive tour that
will save you time and quickly get you up and running with Windows 95's new
features.

Windows Help System:

You can find the answers to many of your questions about using Windows 95's new
features right on the Start button. The Windows 95 online Help system is vastly
improved over earlier versions and is much more task oriented. The new Windows
95 online Help system has jumps that take you directly to features being
described and the Help window remains on the screen to provide you a continual
source of reference. The Windows 95 Help system contains Wizards that direct you
through such operations as installing printers and establishing Dial-Up
Networking connections. The new Help file also contains troubleshooting guides
and tips and tricks on how to use Windows 95.

Question Mark Buttons:

Many dialog boxes in Windows 95 contain a question mark button that you can use
to get information about any item in the dialog box. When you click this button,
the cursor changes to a context help pointer. You can then point to any item in
the dialog box that you want information about and click it. When you do,
Windows 95 displays a detailed description of the item.

Read Me Files:

When you install Windows 95, Setup copies several Read Me files to the Windows 95
folder. These Read Me files contain complementary or late- breaking information
that supplements the Microsoft Windows 95 documentation.

Windows 95 Resource Kit:

An online version of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit and some of the tools
included with the Resource Kit are included on the Windows 95 CD-ROM (in the
Admin\Reskit\Helpfile folder) and in the CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95
Upgrade. The CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade includes many files
that are included in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, but not in the floppy
disk version. If you have the floppy disk version of Windows 95, please see the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for information about obtaining the
CD-ROM Extras for Windows 95 Upgrade:

  Q135315 CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

Internet:

You can access the Microsoft Download Center and other technical and support
information from the Microsoft Windows 95 home page located at the following
World Wide Web (WWW) address:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows

Support Assistant is a no-cost tool developed by Microsoft's Product Support
Services (PSS) organization and the User Education group. Support Assistant runs
with Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 95, and contains the
following content:

- Solutions to the most frequently asked support questions.

- Sections of the Windows 95 Resource Kit describing the use of Windows 95 with
  NetWare and other third-party networks.

- Over 100 Knowledge Base (KB) articles written by PSS Engineers describing
  procedures, productivity tips and tricks, and specific product issues
  associated with Setup and networking with Windows 95.

- Walk-through troubleshooters dealing with Setup, networking, and hardware
  issues.

- A glossary of Windows 95 commonly used terms.

- A reference guide to products and services available to customers to help
  them understand and take advantage of Windows 95's special features.

Windows 95 System Check is a tool that can be used to ensure that your existing
hardware meets the minimum requirements to run Windows 95. This tool checks for
processor type, hard disk space, RAM, and certain programs that are known to
cause problems during installation.

The Windows 95 Software Compatibility List (SCL) lists programs that are
compatible with Windows 95.

The Windows 95 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) contains a list of computer
systems and peripherals that are compatible with Windows 95. The HCL lists
products that meet the "Designed for Windows 95" logo requirements, which
include Plug and Play support and support for 32-bit Windows 95 drivers. The HCL
also lists products that are compatible with Windows 95--products that have been
tested and work with Windows 95, but do not meet the logo requirements. Finally,
the HCL makes clear which device drivers are located on the Windows 95 disks,
CD-ROM, or online services. To view the HCL, visit the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl/

The Microsoft Knowledge Base is available at the following WWW address:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support

The Microsoft FTP site is a repository for the Microsoft Download Center,
Microsoft Knowledge Base, Windows 95 Resource Kit tools, and other Microsoft
product information. The Microsoft FTP site is located at ftp.microsoft.com.

information about Windows 95 via Internet e-mail. To subscribe to WinNews, send
