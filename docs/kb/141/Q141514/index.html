-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows 95-based computer using the Microsoft Client for Microsoft
Networks attempts to connect to a multihomed server with the TCP/IP protocol
using WINS to find the most accessible IP address to make the connection, an IP
address may be chosen that is not in fact the most accessible address.

The Windows 95 client may not connect, or may connect to an IP address that does
not have the best performance.

CAUSE
=====

When a server using the TCP/IP protocol is multihomed (meaning that it uses
multiple IP addresses), the WINS server lists all of these address for clients
to use to connect to the server. The client chooses the address that is the most
accessible, typically favoring an address that is local (not on a different
subnet).

In Windows 95, there is an error in the algorithm used to determine which of
these addresses is the most accessible, so that the client often does not choose
the local IP address. Sometimes, the client cannot connect using the chosen
address.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================


A server using the TCP/IP protocol is said to be multihomed if it has multiple
network adapters, either on the same network or on separate subnets, each with
its own IP address.

Some customers may use systems that bill users for network usage, identifying
users by which network they connect from. This problem would create inaccurate
billing information for such customers.

For additional information about issues with multi-homed servers and WINS, please
