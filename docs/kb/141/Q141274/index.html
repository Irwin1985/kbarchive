-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0 
   - Microsoft OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Although OLE controls are used with certain control containers (such as
Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0), the Serialize function for the control-
derived class is not called. These containers allow the control to store its
persistent information either by using the property sets or by using the
IPersistPropertyBag interface. Both these methods call
COleControl::DoPropExchange directly without calling the control's Serialize
function.

The resolution section of this article discusses a technique that you can use in
the DoPropExchange method to store CObject-derived objects.

CAUSE
=====

COleControl::Serialize is called by the framework when an OLE control container
uses one of the following persistent storage interfaces for loading and saving
the control: IPersistStorage, IPersistStreamInit, or IPersistMemory.

If a control container uses any other method to store the control's persistent
information, then Serialize for the control-derived class will not be called.
Microsoft Visual Basic, for example, uses either IPersistPropertyBag or property
sets to store the persistent information for an OLE control; therefore, the
Serialize function for a control is not called when Visual Basic is used as the
control container.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although there is no direct support for serializing CObject-derived objects in
COleControl::DoPropExchange, you might want to use the following technique to
store objects in an OLE control:

1. Allocate a block of memory with GlobalAlloc.

     // cbGuess is a guess of how much memory will be needed.
     // If more is needed, CSharedFile will reallocate.
     HGLOBAL hMem = GlobalAlloc(GPTR, cbGuess);
     BYTE *pbMem = (BYTE *)hMem;

2. Construct an instance of CSharedFile and attach it to the memory block,
  starting four bytes in. Because the CSharedFile class is not yet documented,
  include afxpriv.h:

     CSharedFile file;
     file.Attach(pMem + sizeof(DWORD), cbGuess - sizeof(DWORD));

3. Construct an instance of CArchive on the file:

     CArchive ar(&amp;file, CArchive::store);

4. Write the CObject-derived objects into the archive:

     // store data in the archive
     // for example, if m_myObject is a CObject-derived object, then
     m_myObject.Serialize(ar);

5. Get the length of the file and write it into the first DWORD of the memory
  block:

     *(DWORD*)pbMem = file.GetLength();

6. Pass the memory block to PX_Blob:

     PX_Blob(pPX, _T("MyObjects"), hMem);

This code could be used for loading the objects back out of the blob. For more
information about how to use PX_Blob to serialize/de-serialize data, Please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q137333 DOCERR: How to Use the PX_Blob Function

To get optimal performance in IPersistStreamInit, ensure that the OLE control
maintains a separate Serialize method that writes the CObjects directly to its
archive. Care should be taken to save all of the control's persistent data in
both Serialize and DoPropExchange.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An OLE control generated using ControlWizard can read and write its persistent
state using one of the following interfaces: IPersistMemory, IPersistStorage,
IPersistStreamInit, IPersistPropertyBag (not implemented in versions before
Visual C++ 4.x), and IDataObject through the property sets implementation. Each
of these interfaces with the exception of IPersistPropertyBag and IDataObject
call COleControl::Serialize passing in a CArchive. This archive could be used to
store CObject-derived objects as part of the control's persistence.

Some OLE control containers (like Microsoft Visual Basic) use the "save as text"
mechanism in order to allow as much of the OLE control's state to be represented
in a human-readable format. For optimizing this mechanism, the interfaces
IPropertyBag and IPersistPropertyBag are used and therefore are recommended for
containers like Visual Basic. IPropertyBag is implemented by the container and
is roughly analogous to IStream. IPersistPropertyBag is implemented by controls
and is roughly analogous to IPersistStream(Init).

Visual Basic uses the control's IPersistPropertyBag interface, if one is
implemented by the control, or it uses the property sets. Property sets are
communicated from and to the control through IDataObject::GetData and
IDataObject::SetData, implemented by the control. Note that OLE controls
generated using earlier versions of Visual C++ don't provide an implementation
for IPersistPropertyBag.

The implementation provided by the MFC framework for IPersistPropertyBag and
property sets directly call COleControl::DoPropExchange passing in an instance
of either CPropbagPropExchange or CPropsetPropExchange respectively.
