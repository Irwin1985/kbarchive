SUMMARY
=======

VSWAP32 demonstrates methods of switching between multiple views on a single
document in a single-document interface (SDI) application. VSWAP32 displays two
form views and a normal view that displays the list of data collected in the two
form views.

NOTE: This is the 32-bit version of this sample. There is also a 16-bit version
available called VSWAP.EXE.

This sample application demonstrates using DDX/DDV (dialog data exchange/dialog
data validation), with correct document updating and data validation when
switching between views. It also correctly catches unsaved/unvalidated data when
the application is closed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most important implementations of this are in:

  CVswapApp::InitInstance
  CVswapApp::SwitchView
  CVswapApp::SaveActiveViewsData

The standard InitInstance code creates an initial document template, document,
and view during the call to ProcessShellCommand. The code added to the end of
InitInstance creates the view objects for the extra views used in this
application and stores their pointers in a CVswapApp member array. It then
cycles through a loop which creates the windows for the view objects. Each view
window is created with a unique child window ID and a CCreateContext object that
associates each view with the same CDocument object, which was created by
ProcessShellCommand. Finally, the sample code triggers the OnInitialUpdate for
the extra views.

In this sample, both views persist for the lifetime of the application; however,
the application could create the new view dynamically.

The SwitchView function created in this sample swaps the current view with a
previously hidden view. It accomplishes this by first switching their child
window IDs. This step is necessary because MFC relies on the standard view pane
having the child window ID of AFX_IDW_PANE_FIRST. The rest of the code hides the
current view and tells MFC to repaint and begin using the new view.

The SaveActiveViewsData is used to save the information from the active view to
the document object. It is called by SwitchView whenever a view is switched.
SaveActiveViewsData subsequently calls SetToDoc, which actually updates the data
from the form view to the document by using MFC's DDX/DDV mechanisms in
DoDataExchange.

Sample Code
-----------

  The SwitchView function is included here as a reference.

        CView* CVswapApp::SwitchView( UINT nIndex )
        {
            ASSERT( nIndex &gt;=0 &amp;&amp; nIndex &lt; NUMVIEWS );

            CView* pNewView = m_pViews[nIndex];

            CView* pActiveView =
            ((CFrameWnd*) m_pMainWnd)-&gt;GetActiveView();

            if ( !pActiveView )    // No currently active view.
                return NULL;

            if ( pNewView == pActiveView )    // Already there.
                return pActiveView;

            // Update Doc's data if needed
            // Don't change view if data validation fails
            if ( ! SaveActiveViewsData() )
            {
                return pActiveView;
            }

            m_nCurView = nIndex;    // Store the new current view's index.

            // Exchange view window ID's so RecalcLayout() works.
            UINT temp = ::GetWindowLong(pActiveView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID);
            ::SetWindowLong(pActiveView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID,
                  ::GetWindowLong(pNewView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID));
            ::SetWindowLong(pNewView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID, temp);

            // Display and update the new current view - hide the old one.
            pActiveView-&gt;ShowWindow(SW_HIDE);
            pNewView-&gt;ShowWindow(SW_SHOW);
            ((CFrameWnd*) m_pMainWnd)-&gt;SetActiveView(pNewView);
            ((CFrameWnd*) m_pMainWnd)-&gt;RecalcLayout();
            pNewView-&gt;Invalidate();
            return pActiveView;
        }
