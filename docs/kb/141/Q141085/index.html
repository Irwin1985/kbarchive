SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Hardcore Visual Basic, ISBN 1-55615-667-7.
These errors have been corrected in the second edition of the book.

For information about known errors and corrections in the second edition of
"Hardcore Visual Basic", please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q173840 Hardcore Visual Basic 2nd Ed. Comments and Corrections

The following topics are covered:

- CD-ROM: Various installation issues

- WIN32.TLB: Type library errors cause sample function to fail

- Page 4: DoCommon should be DoUncommon

- Page 87: VBUTIL16.DLL doesn't have type library

- Pages 89-119: Miscellaneous minor corrections

- Page 128: Performance bug in sorting algorithm

- Page 246, 249: Corrections to Callback server information

- Page 246, 464: Book title reference updated

- Page 302: Bad description of events on a hidden pictureBox

- Page 424, 425: You can remove item from collection by key

- Page 545: Wrong interface for Quick View

- Page 577: ItemDblClick unnecessarily complicated

Installation for the "Hardcore Visual Basic" CD-ROM can be confusing because
there are three different setup files in the root directory of the CD-ROM:
Setup.exe, Setup16.exe, and Setup32.exe. Setup.exe automatically detects and
executes the proper setup program for the target computer.

To properly install the files in Windows 95 or Windows NT:

1. Click the Start button, then click Run.

2. Type "d:\setup" (without the quotation marks) into the Run input box. Replace
  d: with the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive if necessary.

To properly install the files in Windows 3.1:

1. In the Program Manager, click File, then click Run.

2. Type "d:\setup" (without the quotation marks) into the Run input box. Replace
  d: with the drive

letter of your CD-ROM drive if necessary.
NOTE: You must have Visual Basic 4.0 installed on your computer before attempting
to install the files from the "Hardcore Visual Basic" CD-ROM. Otherwise errors
will occur.

WIN32.TLB: Type library errors cause sample function to fail
------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the constants in the 32-bit Windows type library (WIN32.TLB) are wrong.
As a result, a function on page 240 (Chapter 5) of the book fails, usually with
a very rude error. The function is LookupItem, which is supposed to find the
index number of a ListBox entry.

  Function LookupItem(ctl As Control, sItem As String) As Long
       LookupItem = SendMessageAsStr(ctl.hWnd, LB_FINDSTRING, -1, sItem)
  End Function

How could such a serious bug find its way in a one-line function? Easy. Just
define the constant LB_FINDSTRING with the wrong value in the Windows type
library. This function actually sends the LB_GETSELCOUNT message, which does
weird things when you pass it real arguments instead of zeros.

The easiest way to fix the problem is to simply add a local constant with the
correct value to the function:

  #If Win32 Then
  Const LB_FINDSTRING = &amp;H18F
  #EndIf

Of course, this doesn't help with the rest of the LB_ constants, which are also
off by one. Here are the correct values. As a temporary fix, paste these into
the WINTOOL.BAS file and make sure you include it in any project that sends
ListBox messages. The correct Basic constants will override the incorrect ones
in the type library.

     ' Temporary fix overrides incorrect values in Windows type library
     #If Win32 Then
     Public Const LB_ADDSTRING = &amp;H180
     Public Const LB_INSERTSTRING = &amp;H181
     Public Const LB_DELETESTRING = &amp;H182
     Public Const LB_SELITEMRANGEEX = &amp;H183

     Public Const LB_INITSTORAGE = &amp;H1A8
     Public Const LB_ITEMFROMPOINT = &amp;H1A9
     #End If

An updated version of the Windows API type library with fixes for this and other
problems is being created and will be described in a separate entry when it is
finished.

Page 4: DoCommon should be DoUncommon
-------------------------------------

Page 4, second code block line 3 and third code block line 3: Change DoCommon to
DoUncommon

Page 87:  VBUTIL16.DLL doesn't have type library
------------------------------------------------

The text of the book states that Vbutil16.dll has an embedded type library.
Actually, Visual Basic has a bug that prevents it from recognizing type
libraries for 16-bit DLLs. As a result, the Declare statements for the DLL
functions are located in Utility.bas. This is noted in the Readme.txt file on
the compact disc included with the book.

Pages 89-119:  Miscellaneous minor corrections
----------------------------------------------

Page 89, Second paragraph of Inside Declarations sidebar, third sentence. It
states that Basic must save the return value for functions, but actually Basic
saves the return value type. Sentence should read "Basic must also save the type
of each argument, the return value type (for functions), and a pointer (empty at
this point) for the address of the procedure.

Page 93, Archaeologist's Note near the bottom of the page. The note states that:
"REMLINE went on to become the most widely distributed program in the history of
the planet." It should say that REMLINE is the most widely distributed source
code program in the history of the planet.

Page 103, last paragraph, second sentence. The 16-bit declarations for VBUTIL are
in UTILITY.BAS, not VBUTIL16.TLB. Sentence should read: "The declarations are in
UTILITY.BAS for 16-bit and in the VBUTIL32.TLB file for 32-bit."

Page 119, first paragraph, second sentence. The text incorrectly refers to the
ShiftRWord function rather than RShiftWord. Sentence should read: "If you ever
need to divide by 256 in a very tight loop, you might want to try RShiftWord(i,
8) rather than i / 256."

Page 128:  Performance bug in sorting algorithm
-----------------------------------------------

There is a serious performance bug in the QuickSort algorithm that has been used
in many Microsoft language demos over the year and which found its way into
Hardcore Visual Basic. The book uses variations of the algorithm to sort arrays,
collections, and list boxes. The code works fine, but it runs about four times
slower than necessary. The offending code is included at the end of this
message, but the heart of the error is this:

              SortSwap aTarget(iLast), aTarget(iRand)
              vSplit = aTarget(iLast)
  #If Bozo Then
              Do

                  ' Move in from both sides toward pivot element
                  i = iFirst: j = iLast
  #Else
              ' Move in from both sides toward pivot element
              i = iFirst: j = iLast
              Do
  #End If
                  ... ' And so on

The problem is one of the oldest and dumbest of programming mistakes--
initializing variables inside a loop instead of outside. Thanks to reader David
Wilmer for pointing this out. The only excuse for this bug is that the code
wasn't originally written for the book. It comes from the old SortDemo program
written many years ago for QuickBasic. It was such a cool demo that other
Microsoft languages reused it. In a previous job, the author of this book
personally translated the code to C and supervised others who translated it to
Pascal and FORTRAN. It eventually even appeared in Cobol and in C++ with MFC.
The orignal C version has the same stupid bug. The Pascal and FORTRAN versions
are OK.

The moral of the story is, don't trust anyone else's code. Here's full code with
corrections. The small fix makes a surprisingly big performance difference. Try
it both ways in the TimeIt program supplied with the book. Remember that this
bug appears exactly the same in five different places on the CD. Check sorting
arrays and collections in SORT.BAS, sorting arrays and collections
polymorphically in SORTPOLY.BAS, and sorting list boxes in SLISTBOX.CLS. The
code is quoted on page 129 and referenced but not shown on pages 427 and 452.

  ' QuickSort algorithm
  Sub SortArray(aTarget() As Variant, _
                iFirst As Integer, iLast As Integer)
      Dim vSplit As Variant

      If iFirst &lt; iLast Then

          ' Only two elements in this subdivision; exchange if
          ' they are out of order, and end recursive calls
          If iLast - iFirst = 1 Then
              ''@B CallSortCompare
              If SortCompare(aTarget(iFirst), aTarget(iLast)) &gt; 0 Then
                  SortSwap aTarget(iFirst), aTarget(iLast)
              End If
              ''@E CallSortCompare
          Else

              Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, iRand As Integer

              ' Pick pivot element at random and move to end
              ' (consider calling Randomize before sorting)
              iRand = GetRandom(iFirst, iLast)
              SortSwap aTarget(iLast), aTarget(iRand)
              vSplit = aTarget(iLast)
  #If Bozo Then
              Do

                  ' Move in from both sides toward pivot element
                  i = iFirst: j = iLast
  #Else
              ' Move in from both sides toward pivot element
              i = iFirst: j = iLast
              Do
  #End If
                  Do While (i &lt; j) And _
                           SortCompare(aTarget(i), vSplit) &lt;= 0
                      i = i + 1
                  Loop
                  Do While (j &gt; i) And _
                           SortCompare(aTarget(j), vSplit) &gt;= 0
                      j = j - 1
                  Loop

                  ' If you haven't reached pivot element, it means
                  ' that the two elements on either side are out of
                  ' order, so swap them
                  If i &lt; j Then
                      SortSwap aTarget(i), aTarget(j)
                  End If
              Loop While i &lt; j

              ' Move pivot element back to its proper place
              SortSwap aTarget(i), aTarget(iLast)

              ' Recursively call SortArray (pass smaller
              ' subdivision first to use less stack space)
              If (i - iFirst) &lt; (iLast - i) Then
                  SortArray aTarget(), iFirst, i - 1
                  SortArray aTarget(), i + 1, iLast
              Else
                  SortArray aTarget(), i + 1, iLast
                  SortArray aTarget(), iFirst, i - 1
              End If
          End If
      End If

  End Sub

Page 246, 249:  Corrections to Callback server information
----------------------------------------------------------

Page 246, second bulleted item, should be replaced with the following text:

  " The break mode DLL (VBBRK16.DLL or VBBRK32.DLL) isn't likely to work with
  the next version of Visual Basic. This DLL uses undocumented techniques, but
  it only affects debugging under the IDE. If you have working code that uses
  the Callback server, it should continue to work if recompiled under future
  versions." (without the quotation marks)

Page 249, comment in code near the top of page 249 should read: "Required to
prevent painting problems in break mode." (without the quotation marks) The
current text incorrectly says that the DebugProc property prevents crashes.

Page 246, 464: Book title reference updated
-------------------------------------------

Change "Microsoft Guide to Object Programming with Visual Basic 4 and Microsoft
Office for Windows 95"
To "Object Programming with Visual Basic 4" (without the quotation marks)

Page 302:  Bad description of events on a hidden pictureBox
-----------------------------------------------------------

The section titled "CPictureGlass Events" on page 302 talks about why the
internal PictureBox encapsulated by the CPictureGlass class moves around even
though it is invisible. The book claims that by moving the PictureBox around,
you could get the mouse events that the PictureBox receives. This claim wasn't
tested. A reader who tried to take advantage of these events reported that they
never occurred. This has been verified. If a PictureBox is invisible, it doesn't
generate mouse events. The CPictureGlass class works in samples in the book, but
it may be unnecessarily complicated and inefficient. This class will be
redesigned for the next edition.

Page 424,425:  You can remove item from collection by key
---------------------------------------------------------

The book claims that you can't remove an item from a collection by its key. This
appears in the table on page 424, row 11, column 3. The operation as described
in column 1 is Remove item "Pig". Column 3 claims that you can't do this, but
should say: n.Remove "Pig". The error is repeated on page 425 in the bulleted
list. The first sentence in the fourth bulleted item starts out "List boxes and
collections require you...", but this statement actually only applies to List
boxes. It should read "List boxes require you...".

Page 545:  Wrong interface for Quick View
-----------------------------------------

Page 545, first paragraph under the heading Faking Quick View, fifth sentence.
This paragraph is confusing because it starts talking about Quick View, but then
uses shell extensions as an example of OLE interfaces. It should instead discuss
the IFileViewer interface. The sentence should read: "Second, file viewers must
implement OLE interfaces--IFileViewer and IPersistFile."

Page 577:  ItemDblClick unnecessarily complicated
-------------------------------------------------

The description of a workaround for the lack of an ItemDblClick event on the
ListView control is unnecessarily complicated. Page 577 notes that the ListView
control doesn't have an ItemDblClick event. Any app that tries to emulate the
Windows Explorer needs to identify items that were double clicked, but the
DblClick event doesn't tell you the item. The book describes a complicated hack
for getting around this limitation. Save the x and y coordinates as Private
variables in the Mouse_Down event. In the DblClick event, use the coordinates
with the HitTest method to identify which item was double-clicked. In fact,
there is a much easier way to identify the item. Use the SelectedItem method:

  Private Sub lvwFiles_DblClick()
      Dim item As Object
  #Const fHard = 1
  #If fHard Then
      Set item = lvwFiles.HitTest(xList, yList) ' x and y saved in Mouse_Down
  #Else
      Set item = lvwFiles.SelectedItem
  #End If
      If item Is Nothing Then
          Debug.Print "Double clicked column: ?"
      Else
          Debug.Print "Double clicked item: " &amp; item.Text
      End If
  End Sub

The code works as described in the book and as used in the Columbus application
in the book, but code based on the technique shown above is simpler.
