SUMMARY
=======

The Lstddx32 sample illustrates a technique for filling both an ordinary list
box control and the list box portion of a combo box control with data, and using
the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Dialog Data Exchange (DDX) facility to
return the selection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A common misconception with regard to DDX is that assigning a value to a DDX
variable will cause that data to be loaded into a control. This does in fact
happen for edit controls, but not for list box controls. In order to add items
to a list box the dialog class must use the CListBox::AddString() or
CComboBox::AddString() functions. Doing this involves several steps which are
illustrated by this sample.

The sample itself was initially created as an MDI application using AppWizard
from Visual C++ version 1.0. AppStudio was then used to create a dialog which
contains OK and Cancel button plus an edit control (IDC_EDIT1), a combo control
(IDC_COMBO1), and a list box control (IDC_LIST1). The Class Wizard was used to
create a class CDialog1 based on CDialog. The files dialog1.h and dialog1.cpp
contain the code for this class. Class Wizard was also used to add DDX member
variables m_edit1, m_combo1, and m_list1 to dialog1.h. A menu item was added to
the view menu (IDR_LIST_DTYPE) using AppStudio, and a message handler added
which will call the dialog when the menu item was selected.

The Readme.txt file included with the sample explains in more detail how the list
boxes are initialized and how data is passed between the calling routine and the
dialog procedure.
