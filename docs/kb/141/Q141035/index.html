3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each item that may be using CD Audio.

NOTE: Several items that often appear in the Close Program dialog box, but do not

MORE INFORMATION
================

About FlexiCD
-------------

NOTE: The following information comes from the FlexiCD online documentation.

FlexiCD is a quick, convenient audio CD control applet designed for use with
Windows 95. When running, FlexiCD appears as an icon on the Windows Taskbar.

FlexiCD.exe is available on the Microsoft World Wide Web (WWW) Homepage,
address:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/powertoy.htm

Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs (MSB Dinosaurs) does not
utilize CD Audio the same way MSB Ocean and MSB Earth do. MSB Dinosaurs
exclusively uses wave files for sound output. As a result, MSB Dinosaurs does
not generate the error message described in this article.
