The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Errors raised when working with the Remote OLE Automation feature of Visual
Basic 4.0, Enterprise Edition often do not include a full error description.
This article gives more detail on a number of the most common errors, including
possible causes and resolutions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

-2147023143 (&amp;H800706d9)

There are no more endpoints available from the endpoint mapper
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common causes for this error are:

- The Automation Manager isn't running on the server machine. Double check to
  make sure the server has a running instance of the Automation Manager.

- If your server is running Windows 95, then set The Remote Automation
  Connection Manager's Authentication Level to "No Authentication." This is the
  only available setting on Windows 95.

- The protocol specified may not be installed correctly on both the client and
  server machines. Determine whether the problem persists with other protocols
  and/or reinstall, or ensure that the protocol used is installed correctly on
  both machines.

- The protocol may suffer a transient failure, even though the protocol
  specified was installed correctly on both machines. Rebooting the system
  eliminates the problem. If the problem occurs frequently, you should change
  protocols.

-2147418111 (&amp;H80010001)

Call was rejected by callee
----------------------------------------------------

This error usually occurs when the server application is too busy to respond to
the client. When a call comes into the Automation Manager, it will try to get
the attention of the OLE thread for the target object. If the thread refuses the
request (normally because it is busy with another request), the Automation
Manager will pause and then try again. The Automation Manager will continue
retrying until it succeeds or times out.


VBA error 5

Illegal Procedure Call
----------------------------------

Visual Basic maps several OLE errors to this single error message, so there are
many potential causes of this error. The most likely cause of this problem is
that the registry information on the client machine is wrong. Or the registry
information currently cached by the Visual Basic development environment is
wrong.

For speed, Visual Basic will cache certain TypeLib and registry information. This
can lead to problems in the development environment, where you are frequently
building and rebuilding (and reregistering) classes.

To fix problems with the registry, shut down both the client, the server, and
also the Automation Manager, and ensure that their registry entries are correct.
For more information on cleaning the registry entries see the section on
cleaning Registry entries at the end of this article.

This error can also occur if an application calls the Error function after
getting an error. Error only understands the old 16-bit error codes and does not
know how to handle 32-bit error codes. It was included in Visual Basic 4.0 to
retain compatibility. Apps should use Err.Description to get the true
description string, and Err.Number to get the error code.

-2147023152 (&amp;H800706d0)

The RPC protocol sequence was not found
----------------------------------------------------------------

This can occur any time the client specifies a protocol that is not supported by
the client or server machines. Most frequently this error occurs when trying to
use Named Pipes to communicate with a Windows 95 server.

VBA error 429

Can't create object
---------------------------------

This error, like VBA error 5, is a catch-all for a lot of problems and could be
caused by any of the situations listed above. Most frequently, the problem is:

- The server is not registered on the client machine.

- The server is not correctly registered on the remote computer.

- Remote Automation is not correctly installed on the remote computer.

- The Remote Automation proxy is not installed correctly on the client machine.

VBA error 70

Permission denied
------------------------------

This error occurs when the Automation Manager refuses to create an object because
of a security violation. Check the system security policy on the server machine;
if it is set to the Allow by Key (2) or Allow by ACL (3), then make sure that
the appropriate CLSID has the right subkey or ACL.

Winsock TSR not started
-----------------------

On Win 3.1 machines running LanMAN, the Winsock TSR must be started before RPC
can use TCP/IP. If the TSR is not started, a system modal dialog box will appear
when the client tries to connect to the server. To fix this, run Sockets.exe
before starting Windows.

Object does not support OLE Automation
--------------------------------------

This error can occur when:

1. An application has a reference to an object on a remote computer, and

2. is trying to pass a reference to local object as a parameter of a method of
  the remote object, and

3. the Automation Manager is not installed properly on the local machine.

When a reference to a local object is passed to an application on another
computer, the local computer becomes a Remote Automation server, and the
Automation proxy must start the Automation Manager on the local machine. If the
Automation Manager is on the machine, try starting it with the command line
AUTMGR32 /REGSERVER to register it.

-2147220998 (&amp;H800401FA)

Wrong OS or OS version for application
----------------------------------------------------------------

The "Wrong OS version" error is caused by an incorrectly set InprocServer key.
Each public class in a Visual Basic server has an entry in the CLSID section of
the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT registry key. Remote objects have their InprocServer (or
InprocServer32) subkey set to the automation proxy. The automation proxy is
Autprx32.dll for a 32-bit client on a 32-bit OS, Autprx16.dll for a 16-bit
client on a 32-bit OS, and Autprx.dll for a 16- bit client on a 16-bit OS. This
error can be raised when the InprocServer key is set to Autprx.dll on a 32-bit
system. Because of a bug in the 16-bit Remote Automation Connection Manager on
Windows 95, when an object is made remote, the InprocServer key is set
incorrectly in this manner. To fix this problem, do one of the following:

- Manually edit the InprocServer key of each affected class so that it
  correctly points to Autprx16.dll.

-or-

- Use the 16-bit client registration tool (Clireg16.exe) to remote your server
  instead of RacMan16. CliReg16 correctly detects what OS it is running under
  and will set the InprocServer key accurately. CliReg16 can be run from the
  command line with this syntax:

  clireg16 server.vbr -t server.tlb.

-2146959355 (&amp;H80080005)

Server Execution Failed
------------------------------------------------

This error is caused by an incorrectly registered Autprx16.dll. Although Setup
Wizard-generated setup programs will register Autprx16.dll completely, the
Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit installation does not. To fix this problem, unregister
and reregister Autprx16.dll with Regsvr.exe (or Regsvr16.exe).

Other Errors
------------

Many errors encountered while working with Remote OLE Automation are
characterized by a decimal error number that is both negative and longer than a
usual error number. Errors that fit this description are most commonly OLE
errors that are not mapped to a specific Visual Basic error. The corresponding
text for an error number like this can be found by searching for the hexadecimal
equivalent of the number in the winerror.h header file that is included with
Visual C++ and the Windows SDK.

The Unregister and Reregister Method of Cleaning the Registry
-------------------------------------------------------------

Generally you can clean the registry entries for a specific server by
unregistering and reregistering the relevant program. However, the method used
to perform these registry operations varies according to the location of the
server, its bit-type, and whether it is an in-process or out-of- process server.
This section will give a brief description of the tools and methods that can be
used to clean the registry entries for a specific application.

Server Exe on the Server Machine
--------------------------------

All out-of-process servers created by Visual Basic recognize the command line
switches UNREGSERVER and REGSERVER. These switches can be used for servers that
are run locally or remotely. To clean the registry entries for a server exe on
the server machine:

1. Run the server with the command line switch /UNREGSERVER.

2. Run the server with the command line switch /REGSERVER.

Server Exe on a Client Machine
------------------------------

If the server application doesn't reside physically on a client machine, the
CliRegXX tool should be used to unregister and reregister the server. The .vbr
file and the .tlb file for the relevant server are needed for both operations.
CliReg16 should be used for any 16-bit clients, regardless of the bit-type of
the OS, and CliReg32 should be used for all 32-bit clients. To use the client
registration tool to unregister and register a remote server:

1. Run CliRegXX -u server.vbr -t server.tlb.

2. Run CliRegXX server.vbr -t server.tlb. A dialog box will appear to prompt for
  the name of the remote machine and the network protocol.

Server DLL (must be local)
--------------------------

DLL servers do not recognize the UNREGSERVER and REGSERVER parameters. To perform
registry operations with in-process servers you must use the REGSVR32.EXE tool.
RegSvr32 will query the DLL for the registry information needed and perform the
operation specified (either a register or an unregister). To use:

1. Run RegSvr32 -u server.dll.

2. Run RegSvr32 server.dll.
