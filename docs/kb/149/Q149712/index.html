SUMMARY
=======

This article provides general information about installing Windows 95. This
information can help you avoid problems that may arise during the installation
process and help make the installation process as smooth as possible. The
following topics are discussed:

- Before purchasing Windows 95

- Before installing Windows 95

- Installing Windows 95

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before Purchasing Windows 95
----------------------------

Before you purchase Windows 95, decide whether you are going to purchase the
CD-ROM version of Windows 95 or the floppy disk version of Windows 95. If you
have a CD-ROM drive installed in your computer, you should purchase the CD-ROM
version of Windows 95. The CD-ROM version is preferred for the following
reasons:

- Installing from a CD-ROM is typically much faster than installing from floppy
  disks. In addition, installing from a CD-ROM is more convenient because you
  do not need to swap disks.

- The CD-ROM version of Windows 95 includes additional files that are not
  included with the floppy disk version. These files include additional
  accessories such as an Online User's Guide and Windows 95 Tour,
  administrative tools, wallpaper, and other miscellaneous tools.

- CD-ROMs are more reliable than floppy disks. It is less likely that a Windows
  95 CD-ROM will become damaged or infected with a virus.

Before you purchase the CD-ROM or floppy disk version of Windows 95, you should
also make sure that your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements for
running Windows 95. These requirements include a 386DX or better processor, 4
megabytes (MB) of memory, one CD-ROM drive or 3.5-inch high-density floppy disk
drive, and a display adapter and monitor that support VGA or higher resolution.
For additional information about the installation requirements for Windows 95,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q138349 Windows 95 Installation Requirements

If you are not sure if your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements for
running Windows 95, obtain the Windows 95 System Check tool. Windows 95 System
Check is a tool that performs a basic test of your computer's hardware and
software to ensure compatibility with Windows 95.

Windows 95 System Check is not intended as a comprehensive diagnostics tool to
check for every known Windows 95 incompatibility. Instead, this tool is designed
to answer some common questions you might have before you upgrade to Windows 95.
For information about obtaining Windows 95 System Check, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q137047 Windows 95 System Check Tool

Before Installing Windows 95
----------------------------

Before you upgrade your existing version of Windows or Windows for Workgroups to
Windows 95, you should perform the following steps:

- Make sure that your computer is not infected with a virus. To do so, run an
  anti-virus program with the latest virus signatures and allow the program to
  remove any viruses that it finds.

- Close any programs that run automatically, including anti-virus programs,
  screen savers, and third-party memory managers and shells.

- Back up all critical data on your hard disk. While it is unlikely that you
  will encounter a serious problem installing Windows 95, it is always a good
  idea to perform a complete system backup before install- ing a new operating
  system. When you upgrade your computer's operating system, it is possible
  that an error could occur (such as a problem due to incompatible hardware or
  a power failure) that could temporarily or permanently prevent access to the
  data on your hard disk.

- Make sure that any network software installed on your computer is functioning
  properly. The settings from your existing network configuration may not be
  successfully transferred to Windows 95 if the network software is not
  functioning properly.

Installing Windows 95
---------------------

After performing the steps in the previous section, install Windows 95 on your
computer by following these steps:

1. Insert the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, or insert Windows 95 disk 1
  in the appropriate floppy disk drive.

2. In File Manager or Program Manager, click Run on the File menu.

3. In the Command Line box, type the following line and then click OK

  " &lt;drive&gt;:\setup.exe " (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive or the floppy disk
  drive containing Windows 95 disk 1.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen.

If you are installing Windows 95 from a command prompt, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, or insert Windows 95 disk 1
  in the appropriate floppy disk drive.

2. Change to the drive containing the Windows 95 CD-ROM or Windows 95 disk 1,
  type the following line, and then press ENTER:

  " setup " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: If you are upgrading Windows or Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 or
later, you should run Setup from your existing installation of Windows or
Windows for Workgroups. If you are upgrading Windows version 3.0, you must run
Setup from a command prompt.
