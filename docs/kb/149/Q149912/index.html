SYMPTOMS
========

An alias for an application, file, or folder located on a Windows NT server can
be created on a Macintosh client desktop. If the path to the original file that
the alias is associated with is deleted, corrupted, or moved, the following
error message appears:

  The alias "Alias Title" could not be opened, because the shared disk "Shared
  volume name," which contains the original item, could not be found on the
  network.

CAUSE
=====

This error usually occurs when the application or file has been moved or the
"Shared volume name" has been changed. This can be determined by selecting the
alias on the Macintosh desktop and clicking Get Info on the File menu. The
window contains a field called "Original," which represents the path to the
original file or application.

Make sure the path is still valid and the application or file for which the alias
was created is still there. This can be done by manually mounting the volume and
running the application or file. If the path is different you can either:

- Correct the path to the file by editing the Volume or Folder names to reflect
  what is listed by the alias.

  -or-

- Delete the alias and re create it using the current path to the file.

The original path reflected in the Get Info window on the Macintosh cannot be
edited. The alias must be re-created.
