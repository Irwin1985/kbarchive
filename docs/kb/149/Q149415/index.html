-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS),
group policies may no longer work. This problem is more evident when you are
connecting to a Novell NetWare 3.1x server.

CAUSE
=====

NetWare servers require that user names be submitted in all uppercase letters.
The MSNDS client allows you to submit your user name in lowercase or uppercase
letters. If you enter your user name in the logon dialog box in lowercase
letters, group policies are ignored.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following conditions must be true for group policies to work properly:

1. User profiles must be enabled. To verify that user profiles are enabled,
  follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Passwords.

  b. Click the User Profiles tab.

  c. Verify that "Users can customize their preferences and desktop
     settings..." is selected.

  d. Click OK.

2. The preferred server must be selected in Network properties. To verify this,
  follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

  b. Click the Configuration tab.

  c. In the Primary Network Logon box, click Client For NetWare Networks.

  d. In the "The following network components are installed" box, click Client
     For NetWare Networks, and then click Properties.

  e. On the General tab, verify that a preferred server is selected.

  f. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.

  NOTE: The Config.pol file must be located in the Public folder on the
  preferred server.

3. The registry must contain the following entries:

   - Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Network\Logon
     Value name (STRING): PolicyHandler
     Value data: GROUPPOL.DLL, ProcessPolicies

   - Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\
     MSNP32\NetworkProvider
     Value name (STRING): GroupFcn
     Value data: GROUPPOL.DLL, NTGetUserGroups

   - Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\
     NWNP32\NetworkProvider
     Value name (STRING): GroupFcn
     Value data: GROUPPOL.DLL, NWGetUserGroups

  If any of these entries does not exist, use either of the following methods:

   - Reinstall group policies from the Windows 95 CD-ROM. This replaces the
     revised Grouppol.dll file with the original file. If you use this method,
     make sure to copy the revised Grouppol.dll file over the original file in
     the Windows\System folder. This is the recommended method.

   - Manually edit the registry and add the missing value(s).

     NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing
     Keys And Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note
     that you should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and
     User.dat) before you edit the registry.

     WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
     may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
     problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
     solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.


Note that the person setting up group policies on an NDS server must also
administer the NDS tree to supply an NDS volume and the path to a Config.pol
file. Bindery services do not need this information because the correct location
for the policy file is looked at automatically. NDS servers need to be told
where the policy file is located.
