-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Each Connector has an associated address space (or spaces) and a Connected Sites
configuration. Both associations can be defined using the Exchange
Administration program and can be replicated by the directory to or from
adjacent sites. As this information is created by configuration and replicated
by the directory, it is used by the System Attendant and the Message Transfer
Agent (MTA) to generate a routing table called the Gateway Address Routing Table
(GWART). Each server maintains its own GWART within its Directory.

The GWART is stored in the ds (on the site Addressing object in the gateway-
routing-tree attribute); the Ems_rid.dll is the module that generates the GWART
and can be called from admin ("Regenerate Routing" button) and MAD (based on the
schedule). Renaming or deleting the GWART text file will have no impact on the
routing information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to successfully deliver a message, the MTA compares the recipient of
the message to the GWART to determine through which group of connectors the
message can be delivered. The final result of the search provides a group of
Connectors which can deliver the message to the remote site.

The GWART is kept by the Directory. It can be viewed by an Administrator using
the Site Addressing Object. The Routing property page displays the routing table
as it has currently been calculated.

Under normal circumstances, the routing table is rebuilt when changes occur
(changes are refreshed very quickly). If you want to force a re- calculation,
click Recalculate Routing. You can view the contents of the GWART by using a
text editor, such as Notepad. The GWART is located in the EXCHSRVR\MTADATA
directory. Each time the routing of a server is updated, the GWART is updated
and a single backup copy is saved for administrative reference only. The
following is a list of the GWART files and its purposes:

  Filename      Purpose
  ----------    ----------------------------------
  GWART0.MTA    Current Routing table text file
  GWART1.MTA    Routing table prior to last change

Reading The GWART
-----------------

The GWART can be segmented into three major areas. Each area corresponds with an
address type, which Exchange uses to send mail. These address types are as
follows:

  Address Type        Description
  ------------        --------------------------------------------
  Distinguised Name   The native Microsoft Exchange Server address
  (DN)                format. These are reflected as type EX.

  Domain Defined      The format used for custom recipient storage
  Attribute (DDA)     (for example: MS and SMTP).

  O/R Address         The Native X.400 address type.

Each line of the GWART indicates an available path which the MTA can use to route
messages to a destination.

  [    Address Space     ] [ cost ] [ connection 1, connection 2, .......]
  EX, /O=ORGNAME/OU=Site-X , 2      , Connector to Site-A, Connector to
   Site-B

When the MTA makes a routing decision, it scans through the GWART to find an
address space that matches the address of the message. If an available address
space is identified, the MTA routes the message to the associated connector.
Obtaining details on any GWART entry reveals the associated connector in a
Routing Details dialog box.

Sample GWART Diagram
--------------------

For troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended that you view the GWART. You can
save the GWART as a text file, and open it as a text file using a text editor.
The following diagram graphically represents the connections for the sample
GWART listed below:
