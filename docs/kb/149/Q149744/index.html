SUMMARY
=======

In 3D Movie Maker, the Copy and Paste Path function copies and pastes the
position and orientation in space that the actor follows. In most instances,
copying a path from one actor to another causes the second actor to follow the
same route that the original actor followed. There are instances, however, when
this does not occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, the Copy and Paste Path function may be used for the actors to
follow the same path, but one arrives at the end sooner than the other. In these
instances, actors may have a different action or a different step size.

For example, lets say Actor 1 is running and Actor 2 is walking. The running
actor takes larger steps than the walking actor and covers a longer distance in
the same number of steps or the same amount of time. If Actor 1 is placed next
to Actor 2 and they are given the same path with the Copy Path function, they
will start off together, but the running actor will pull ahead and finish the
path before the walking actor.

The same situation occurs if the actors are both performing the same action, but
are of different size. The larger actor, who is taking larger steps, covers the
path faster than the smaller actor. A similar situation occurs with props and 3D
words when an actor's path is copied and pasted to them.

If you want to have actors follow the same path in the same amount of time:

- Make sure that they are performing the same action.

- Make sure that the actors are the same size.

Doing so ensures that the Copy and Paste Path function keeps them synchronized.
