SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to access network drives created in services. Even
though network drives are global system resources, they can only be accessed by
processes running under the security context which was used to establish the
network connection.

In fact the rule is very simple. A network connection is always made with a set
of credentials (such as, domain name, user name, and password.) A process can
access a network drive only if it has already validated the credentials used to
establish the connection.

This article can also be used to understand how to create pseudo-permanent
connections with the scheduler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For the purpose of this article, assume the following configuration:

- 1 Server acting as Primary Domain Controller (PDC) of a domain "DOMAIN"

- A share on an other machine of the domain "ASERVER"

- 1 Service running as User1 (Service1)

- An other user "Auser"

This article considers the following two cases and explains, for each case, who
can access the network driver:

1. Network Connection made with Service1

2. Network Connection made with the option /USER

1.Network Connection made with Service1
---------------------------------------

When a network connection is established under "Service1," the "User1"
credentials are used (such as, domain "DOMAIN," user "User1" and their
password):

  NET USE X: \\ASERVER\SHARE

The drive X: is mapped to \\ASERVER\SHARE and can only be used by Processes which
have validated this credentials of DOMAIN\User1. Therefore only the following
processes can access the network drive X:

- The service Service1

- Any other service running under the security context of "User1"

- Any process when logged on with the credentials of "User1"

2.Network Connection made with the option NET USE /USER
-------------------------------------------------------

When a network connection is made with NET USE /USER:'Domain\Auser', the
redirector sends an Server Message Block (SMB) frame "C Session setup" to the
server in order to validate the credentials of "Domain\Auser." The server
creates an access token for this user and replies to the redirector with an SMB
frame "R Session setup" including a user ID that will be used in all consecutive
SMB frames related to the connection.

  NET USE X: \\ASERVER\SHARE /USER:DOMAIN\Auser

The drive X: is mapped to \\ASERVER\SHARE and can only be used by processes which
have validated the credentials of DOMAIN\AUser. Therefore only the following
processes can access the network drive X:

- The service Service1

- Any other service running under the security context of "Auser"

- Any process when logged on with the credentials of "Auser"
