-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing the Windows 3.x version of the Microsoft Exchange client, you
may receive the following error:

  Microsoft Exchange setup was interrupted before your new software was fully
  installed.

  You can run Microsoft Exchange Setup in its entirety at a later time to
  complete the installation.

CAUSE
=====

This error appears when you have another older version of Mapi.dll already
installed on your computer that has a newer version stamp -- a version number
newer then the one being installed by Microsoft Exchange.

For example, Novell GroupWise installs a pre-Exchange version of Mapi.dll that
has a version stamp of 4.1. Before Exchange setup tries to copy Mapi.dll, it
checks the version of the file. If the version of the previously installed file
is newer than the one that setup is trying to install (4.0), the setup skips the
file without copying it. This in turn causes the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem:


- Delete the current Mapi.dll file from the Windows\System directory, and then
  re-run Microsoft Exchange setup.

  -or-

- To correct this problem on multiple workstations, modify the Exchang.inf file
  as outlined below.

Steps to Modify Exchang.inf File
--------------------------------

1. Make a backup copy of your Exchang.inf file before proceeding.

2. Use Notepad to open the Exchang.inf file.

3. Find the following line in the [MAPI] section:

  "mapi.dll"=5,mapi.dll,,,,1996-03-11,,1033,,,,,,,,
     890464,SYSTEM,,,4.0.837.7,

4. The number preceding the last comma is the version number of the Mapi.dll
  file that is being installed. Change this number to be greater than the
  version number of the Mapi.dll file you already have installed. For example,
  if the currently installed file is version 4.1, change the line as follows:

  "mapi.dll"=5,mapi.dll,,,,1996-03-11,,1033,,,,,,,,
     890464,SYSTEM,,,4.1.0.1,

5. Save Exchang.inf as a text file.

6. Re-run setup.

This will result in the 4.0.837.7 version of Mapi.dll being written to the
Windows\System directory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
