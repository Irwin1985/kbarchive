-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the SNA Server service, you may get the following Error 242
message:

  DLC 802.2 Link Service is configured to use NDIS adapter that is not
  installed.

CAUSE
=====

The error is reporting that a link service that is configured to use a DLC 802.2
Link Service could not find an adapter bound to the driver specified for the
Link Service. This message indicates one of the following:

- A connection or media problem inserting into the Token Ring network.

- A configuration problem with the network adapter.

- A hardware problem with the adapter.

WORKAROUND
==========

Error 242 will generally appear when the DLC cannot bind to the adapter
specified in the SNA Server DLC 802.2 Link Service Setup dialog. The main
reasons for this failure arises out of adapter initialization problems. The
following items should be checked to ensure that the network adapter is
initializing properly:

- The adapter can communicate to any other computer in the network.

  The ability to contact another computer on the network clears suspicion from
  any installation problems with the adapter. If another protocol is proven to
  work on the card, the DLC should find no hardware problems in the card. If
  only the DLC is being bound to the adapter (for SNA Server use only), then
  the Microsoft Windows NT Workstation service and transport (NetBEUI, TCP/IP,
  etc.) would need to be enabled over this adapter. Use the Bindings dialog box
  in the Windows NT Network Control Panel to verify that the bindings are
  enabled in order to test network connectivity. Otherwise, install a LAN
  protocol and enable its bindings to the network card.

  If this works properly, the adapter should not be suspect. Check the System
  Event Log to verify other reasons why the card appears not to be correctly
  binding. If the computer is multihomed, make sure that the connection to the
  host can be made using the affected adapter by disconnecting the other
  adapter from the network. If a Token Ring connection problem exists (due to a
  bad cable, bad port on the MAU or hub, mismatched Token Ring link speed,
  etc.), NetBEUI will report an error in the Windows NT system event log
  indicating a problem with the adapter.

- A duplicate Token Ring adapter address exists in the Token Ring network.

  Therefore, the adapter cannot be inserted into the ring. Some Token Ring
  adapter drivers will report specific errors referring to problems inserting
  into the ring; unfortunately, some will not. The event log number will vary
  on an adapter to adapter basis. For example, an Olicom Token Ring card will
  return the following:

  Event ID:5
  Could not open adapter OcTk1601. Duplicate node address.
  Source: "OcTk16" | "OcTk32" (depending on the adapter installed)

  For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q122933 Event Viewer Messages for the Olicom Network Card

  Some adapters will return protocol related events that will reference the
  adapter. IBM's 16/4 Token Ring Adapter, for example, returns a message
  related to protocol failure.

  For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q121070 Duplicate Locally Administered Address Can Cause Event 9006

  The adapter's factory set address could be overridden by using a locally
  administered address. Different adapters will have different ways of
  providing a locally administered address. Some cards will use Registry
  parameters, while some cards will have an option in the driver configuration
  to provide a locally administered address. Reference your particular
  adapter's documentation for details.

- The driver may have failed to initialize for the adapter because of
  configuration problems.

  Problems with mismatched drivers or adapters that are not configured correctly
  will prevent the adapter from initializing correctly. Most instances involve
  a driver.

  Three particular situations have been isolated by Microsoft. However, there
  may be other reasons; this is just a partial list.

  If you see messages regarding driver initialization problems not discussed,
  check your adapter's documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge Base for the
  most recent information on http://www.microsoft.com/kb.
  a. An initialization problem occurs with the 3Com 3c59x.sys because the
     driver does not reset the adapter on Windows NT shutdown. When Windows NT
     restarts, the driver is not able to locate the NIC. A Service Control
     Manager event will warn that it was unable to start the adapter.

     For additional information, please see the following article in the
     Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139179 3C0M 3C59X.SYS Driver Fails to Initialize in Windows NT 3.51

  b. The Oemsetup.inf file for the IBM Auto 16/4 Token Ring adapter driver
     (Ibmtok4.sys) does not add a required value in the Windows NT registry
     properly, causing Service Control Manager to report event 7000s in the
     event log.

     For additional information, please see the following article in the
     Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q137505 IBM 16/4 Auto Token Ring Adapter Driver Causes Event ID 7000

- A problem occurs when the Madge Smart 16/4 AT Plus Ringnode Token Ring
  adapter is configured for Normal software operating mode. This token ring
  adapter has two software operating modes: Normal mode and AT mode. By
  default, the adapter is set to Normal mode, and if the adapter is used in
  Normal mode, you can only use the drivers shipped with the Madge Token Ring
  adapter. If the adapter is used in AT mode, you can use previous versions of
  the drivers, and the Madge configuration software cannot override the I/O
  base address, Ring Speed, and SmartROM switch settings. The Service Control
  Manager will return errors related to not being able to stop the network
  adapter.

  Knowledge Base:
