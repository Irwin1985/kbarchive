SUMMARY
=======

Mdbvu32 is a utility that allows you to view a Messaging Application Programming
Interface (MAPI) based mailbox store. This article describes how to use Mdbvu32
to view the actual long file name of attachments.

When you preview attachment names in Microsoft Outlook 2000 (or other Microsoft
Exchange Client programs), the file name is truncated to 8.3 notation.

In certain cases, you may need to determine the name of the attachment before you
open or save the attachment, for example, if a virus infection occurs where the
virus is in the form of an executable attachment. Some worm viruses have
exploited this fact by using multiple extensions (for example,
wrmvirus.txt.vbs). Because the .vbs extension is truncated, the file is
displayed by the name wrmvirus.txt, and the user may not realize that by opening
the attachment the user may execute malicious code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the long file name of message attachments using Mdbvu32:

1. Make sure that a client profile is configured for the mailbox that you want
  to view. If you currently have a profile, create a new one.

  NOTE: You must have rights to log on to the mailbox that you want to open.

2. At a command prompt, type "mdbvu32.exe" (without the quotation marks).

3. Leave the uIUIParam as the default of NULL, and then click OK.

4. Click the client profile that is mentioned in step 1, and then click OK. The
  MDB Viewer Test Application dialog box is displayed.

5. On the MDB menu, click OpenMessageStore.

6. A list of MAPI stores that the client has access to is displayed. Click the
  mailbox that has the name of the client, and then click Open.

7. The dialog box disappears and you are returned to the main window.

8. On the MDB menu, click Open IPM Subtree.

9. In the Child Folders list, double-click the Inbox. A list of the messages
  that the folder contains is displayed in the Messages in Folder list.
  Double-click the message that contains the attachment that you want to view.

10. A list of attachments is displayed (numbered beginning at zero).
  Double-click the first attachment.

11. The default operation available is Attachment Properties. While this option
  is selected, scroll down the Attachment Properties list until you see the
  PR_ATTACH_LONG_FILENAME property. In the third column, the file name of the
  attachment that you are viewing is displayed.

12. If there are multiple attachments in the message, and this attachment is not
  the attachment that you are looking for, repeat steps 9 through 11 until you
  find the long file name information that you are looking for.
