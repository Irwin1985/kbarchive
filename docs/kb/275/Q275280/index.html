-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Service Pack 3 (SP3) clients that are
running on Microsoft Windows 2000 cannot connect to their assigned SNA resources
(3270 LUs or Pools) when the resources are assigned to a workstation record by
using the SNA client's MAC address.

The error that is displayed varies depending on the 3270 Emulator (or
application) that is being used. The following error message is displayed when
the 3270 application that is included with SNA Server is used:

  ERROR - There are no configured sessions for your user record.

NOTE: SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and earlier do not include the feature
that allows workstation records to be defined by using MAC addresses for
Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connected clients.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server 4.0 SP2 and SP3 clients call the CoCreateGUID function to obtain a
global unique ID (GUID) for the system. On Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, the last
six bytes of the GUID contain the MAC address of the client's network adapter.
CoCreateGUID changed in Windows 2000 so that it no longer returns the MAC
address as part of the resulting GUID. This change results in the problem
described in the "Symptoms" section.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ability to define workstation definitions for TCP/IP-connected SNA Server
clients by using the client's MAC address was added in SNA Server 4.0 SP2. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191610 Assigning LUs/Pools to Workstation MAC Addresses Not Supported

NOTE: This problem does not occur with either the End User client or the Admin
client that are included with Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000.
