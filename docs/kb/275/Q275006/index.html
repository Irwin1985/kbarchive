-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some known video-related issues that you may experience
when you play in Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following video adapters and chip sets have known video-related issues in
Combat Flight Simulator 2.

3Dfx - Voodoo and Voodoo II Chip Sets
-------------------------------------

- When a video adapter that is based on a Voodoo or Voodoo II chip set (Diamond
  Monster I and II, Canopus Pure 3D I and II, and Creative Labs Voodoo Blaster)
  is installed in your computer, you may not be able to select the video
  adapter in Combat Flight Simulator 2.

  To resolve this issue, restart your computer.

- If a Diamond Monster II video adapter is installed in your computer with the
  retail video driver, Combat Flight Simulator 2 may not recognize the video
  adapter.

  To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver for your
  video adapter from the following S3 Web site:

  http://www.s3.com

- Voodoo I users may see a band of rectangles that briefly appear horizontally
  across the screen. This condition occurs when new textures are downloading
  and audio is playing.

  This is an issue with the video adapter and there is no known fix.

- The color palette may be distorted or text may be unreadable.

  To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver for your
  video adapter.

Voodoo 5
--------

- If you use the Tool tips feature, the frame rate may slow down by 90%.

nVidia GeForce DDR
------------------

- Ground textures or aircraft textures may appear black or disappear.

  To attempt to resolve this issue, download and install the latest Detonator 3
  video driver for your video adapter from the following nVidia Web site:

  http://www.nvidia.com

Rush Chip Set (Hercules Stingray 128 /3D)
-----------------------------------------

- When you quit Combat Flight Simulator 2, your computer may stop responding
  (hang).

  This behavior can occur if you are using version 4.10.1.2059 of the 3Dfx
  Voodoo Rush video driver.

  To resolve this issue, download and install the 3Dfx Voodoo Rush Reference
  Drivers for Windows 95/98 (Single Board) from the following 3Dfx Web site:

  http://www.3dfx.com

ATI Radeon 7200, ATI Radeon 64 MB DDR VIVO
------------------------------------------

Hardware Transform and Lighting (T&amp;L) may exhibit one of the following
symptoms:

  

- T&amp;L may not remain functioning between CFS2 sessions.
- T&amp;L may only work if the feature is disabled in CFS2.
- A change in the video resolution setting in CFS2 may cause the symptoms to
  alternate.

To resolve this behavior:

1. From the main screen, click Settings. From within the game, press and hold
  down ALT, and then from the Options menu, click Settings.

2. Click Advanced Settings.

3. Click to select the T&amp;L option.

4. Click OK twice.

If T&amp;L is not enabled, repeat steps 1-4 and click to clear the option.

NOTE: To ensure T&amp;L is working, switch to the Spot Plane view (from the Views
menu, higlight New View, and then click Spot Plane). With NUM LOCK on, press the
keys on the number pad to switch views. Make sure you are viewing the side of
the aircraft that has sun shining on it. The shady side of the air raft may
appear dark as though T&amp;L is not enabled.

ATI Rage
--------

- When an ATI Rage video adapter is installed in your computer, textures may be
  missing or distorted.

  You may be able to improve the textures by turning off MIP Mapping in Combat
  Flight Simulator 2.

ATI Rage II, ATI Rage II+ or ATI Rage Pro Chip Sets
---------------------------------------------------

- When a video adapter that uses an ATI Rage II or an ATI Rage II+ chip set is
  installed in your computer, you may receive graphic errors

  To resolve this behavior, download and install the latest video driver from
  ATI.

NOTE: The ATI Xpert@work and the ATI Xpert@play video adapters are based on the
ATI Rage Pro chip set.

Cirrus Logic
------------

- When a video adapter that is based on the Cirrus Logic CL-546X chip set
  (including the Creative Labs Graphics Blaster 3D video adapter) is installed
  in your computer, text may be corrupt.

- When you use the Microsoft Windows 98 default video driver (Cirruslg.drv
  version 4.10.1637) or the Cirrus Logic video driver (546x.drv version
  4.10.01.1701), textures may be corrupt in different screen resolutions and
  color palette settings.

  To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver available
  for your video adapter from the manufacturer of your video adapter.

Diamond Fire GL 1000 Pro
------------------------

- When a Diamond Fire GL 1000 Pro video adapter is installed in your Microsoft
  Windows 2000-based computer, Combat Flight Simulator 2 may randomly stop
  responding (hang).

  There is no known workaround for this issue.

----------------------------------------

- When a video adapter that is based on the Matrox G-100 chip set is installed
  in your computer, aircraft and ground textures may appear blurry or
  distorted.

  To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver from
  Matrox.

- When a video adapter that is based on the Matrox G-100 chip set is installed
  in your computer, the propeller, aircraft canopy, and explosions may appear
  in a checkered pattern.

  This issue is a limitation of the video adapter.

Matrox G-200 Chip Set (Millennium and Mystique G-200)
-----------------------------------------------------

- When a video adapter that is based on the Matrox G-200 chip set is installed
  in your computer, ground textures may appear distorted.

- When a Matrox Mystique or a Matrox Mystique 220 video adapter is installed in
  your computer, Combat Flight Simulator 2 runs in Software mode only.

  These video adapters do not support the features required to run Combat Flight
  Simulator 2.

Mpact II 3DVD (STB Nitro DVD)
-----------------------------

- When Microsoft released Combat Flight Simulator 2, no Mpact II 3DVD video
  driver was compatible with Combat Flight Simulator 2.

  Contact your video adapter manufacturer to inquire if an updated video driver
  is available for your video adapter.

  If an updated video driver is not available for your video adapter, run Combat
  Flight Simulator 2 in 3-D software mode.

nVidia Riva TNT (STB Velocity V4400)
------------------------------------

- When a video adapter that is based on the nVidia Riva TNT chip set is
  installed in your computer, the cockpit may flicker.

  To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver for your
  video adapter from the following nVidia Web site:

  http://www.nvidia.com
