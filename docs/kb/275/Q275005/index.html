The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the new features that are included in Microsoft Combat Flight
Simulator 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The new features that are included in Combat Flight Simulator 2 are:

- New Battle Sites

  Beautifully rendered battle sites such as Papua New Guinea, the Marianas, the
  Gilberts, and Midway capture historical scenes in vivid detail, from jungle
  hillsides to coral reefs.

- Mission Builder

  Fly challenging single missions and full-fledged campaigns where your skill
  determines your fate - and that of your wingmen. Use the powerful new
  graphical Mission Builder to re-create other famous conflicts and "what-if"
  campaigns where the challenges change each time you take off into battle.

- History Takes Wing

  These aircraft, the pride of the Japanese and American fleets, made history.
  Now make them yours. Microsoft's leading graphics technology brilliantly
  captures classic WWII naval fighters. Choose from the American P-38F
  Lightning, the F4F-4 Wildcat, the F6F-3 Hellcat, and the F4U-1A Corsair or
  the Japanese A6M2 Zero, the A6M5 Zero, and the NiK2 George. Bid today goodbye
  as you fly off into history. More choices to fly and new challenges to
  master. All the new aircraft look and sound even more realistic than
  Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1.

- The Real Story, Straight from the Source

  Combat Flight Simulator 2 builds on a tradition of more than 18 years of
  creating compelling flight simulations. Veteran World War II pilots from both
  sides of the Pacific conflict helped make every detail, from the roar of
  engines to radio chatter, come to life. Read their stories in the Pilot's
  Manual, and then test their battle-proven tactics for yourself. Realistic and
  stunning visuals.

- Enhanced Depth of Play

  Combat Flight Simulator 2 engages you at heightened new level of game play.
  Your actions in the game now have real consequences - lose a wingman in
  battle and his replacement may not be the ace that you hoped for. Campaigns
  are a branching tree structure. You have to try and survive, not lose too
  many wingmen, complete your mission goals and earn medals and promotions, and
  fly increasingly higher-performance aircraft. Failing to perform will result
  in your early retirement. You will be able to enter the campaign at any of 10
  different historical points. Real-life action and game play immerse you into
  the era.

- Fight the Pacific War for Either Flag

  You're a 20-year-old farm boy from Nebraska, engaging the Japanese with a 2000
  horsepower fighter bristling with firepower. Or a veteran Japanese pilot at
  the controls of a deadly and agile Zero, determined to protect your fleet.
  Experience the war from both sides of the battle.

- Enhanced Visuals

  Combat Flight Simulator 2 features enhanced 3-D objects and aircraft models,
  cockpits, explosions, splashes, waves and wakes, and many other effects.
  High-resolution terrain with detailed roads, rivers, coastlines, and atolls
  will bring this area of the world to life. Take off and land from the
  aircraft carriers Essex, Enterprise, Junyo, and Hiryu. A Landing Signal
  Officer will get you back on deck. Combat Flight Simulator 2 contains
  incredible realism.

- Updated and Improved Weather System

  You can download current weather conditions and forecast winds aloft from a
  Microsoft server on Zone.com. The new weather system also dramatically
  improves the variety of weather as you fly and the effects you see, such as
  clouds, precipitation, lightning, and more. Customize realistic weather or
  fly in real-time conditions using the Internet!

- New Level of Realism

  Details such as moving canopies, folding wings, battle-scarred paint,
  spectacular damage, and last-second bailouts immerse you in a new level of
  realism.

- Talk Strategy with Your Teammates

  Talk trash to your opponents. Control your game with voice commands.
  Communicate in mid-air with GameVoice!
