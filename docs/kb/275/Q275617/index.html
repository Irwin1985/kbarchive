-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Before the release of Systems Management Server (SMS) Service Pack 2 (SP2),
Inbox Manager periodically could not replicate files to the Client Access Points
(CAPs) because the files were in use by client computers. Because of the added
functionality in SMS SP2, Inbox Manager can create a lock file on the CAP to
prevent client access when Inbox Manager updates the Inboxes on the CAP. The
lock file is created for each Inbox that Inbox Manager replicates to the CAP;
however, there is a situation where Inbox Manager may not remove the
Inboxlck.tok file from the Inbox. When this occurs, the processing of offers by
clients may be prevented. Advertised Program Manager (APM) in SP2 checks for the
Inboxlck.tok file in the Offerinf.box file on the CAP. If the Inboxlck.tok file
is present on the CAP, offer processing is prevented.

The presence of the Inboxlck.tok file may also prevent clients from upgrading the
Software Distribution component to a newer version, from a QFE or Service Pack
applied to the Site server. When this happens, the status of the Software
Distribution component on the clients would remain at "Install pending."

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Inbox Manager attempts to delete the Inboxlck.tok
file after the Inbox is updated. This deletion may not work if the Inboxlck.tok
is opened by a client. The clients attempt to open the Inboxlck.tok file to
verify that it exists.

WORKAROUND

If the symptoms are observed during software distribution on a site running SMS
2.0 SP2 or SMS 2.0 SP3, please apply the fix discussed in the "Resolution"
section of this article. If however the symptoms are observed after a QFE
application or Service Pack upgrade, please use the following workaround to
clear the lock file:

1. Stop the SMS_INBOX_MANAGER component on the Site Server using the SMS Service
  Manager.

2. Using Computer Management or Server Manager, close all Open File connections
  on \CAP_xxx\clicomp.box\SWDist. Repeat this step for all affected CAPs.

3. Start the SMS_INBOX_MANAGER component on the Site Server, and verify that it
  removes the lock file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack





STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you view the Odpsys32.log file, the client retries the Offerinf.box every
5,000 milliseconds until the retry count interval is reached after the lock file
is found. If APM reaches the retry count interval before the Inboxlck.tok file
is removed, APM stops and reports that the CAP offer Inbox is not accessible;
therefore, no offers are processed.

The following examples are samples of Odpsys32.log file entries:

With the hotfix installed, Inbox Manager attempts to delete the Inboxlck.tok ten
times before proceeding. The Offer Data Providers (ODPs) that are running on the
client have also been changed. After you install the hotfix, the ODPs scan for
the presence of the Inboxlck.tok file, instead of opening the file to verify
that it exists.
