The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has identified a vulnerability that may enable a malicious user to
cause code to run on the computer of another user through a third-party Web
site. Such code can take any action on the user's computer that the third-party
Web site was permitted to take. In addition, the code can be made persistent, so
that if the user returns to the Web site again, the code begins to run again.

This vulnerability can only be exploited if the user clicks on a hypertext link,
either in HTML e-mail or on a malicious user's Web site; the code cannot be
injected into an existing session.

CAUSE
=====

Certain Web services provided by Internet Information Services 5.0 do not
properly validate all inputs before they use them, and are therefore vulnerable
to Cross-Site Scripting (CSS).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

On November 2, 2000, Microsoft released an updated patch to correct a new variant
of this vulnerability. See the following for information on how to obtain the
latest patch.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

Server (IIS) 4.0, click the article number below to view the article in the

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Services
5.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on this security vulnerability, please see the following
Microsoft web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-060.asp

CSS is a recently discovered security vulnerability that can potentially enable a
malicious user to inject code into a user's session with a Web site. Unlike most
security vulnerabilities, CSS does not apply to any single vendor's products,
but instead, it can affect any software that runs on a Web server and does not
follow defensive programming practices. In early 2000, Microsoft and CERT worked
together to inform the software industry of the issue and lead an industry-wide
response to it.

Microsoft published extensive information about CSS, including information for
developers about how to check their code for potential vulnerabilities.
Microsoft has identified several places in IIS where proper checking was not
performed; some of these have been found by our internal security teams, and
others were identified by customers.
