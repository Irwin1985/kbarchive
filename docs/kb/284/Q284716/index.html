SUMMARY
=======

This article describes when IIS displays the following error message in a
browser:

  The Remote Procedure Call Failed and Did Not Execute.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is displayed in the Web browser when a request is made by a user to
an "out-of-process" Web application that has terminated or has been killed. This
is a temporary message that is displayed until IIS has restarted the failed Web
application. IIS, by default, automatically restarts all failed out-of-process
Web applications, and this behavior is governed by a metabase value,
"AppOopRecoverLimit".

In IIS 4.0, a faulty in-process Web application can cause the entire Inetinfo.exe
service to fail, which renders all Web sites unavailable. To help alleviate this
situation, IIS 4.0 introduced the concept of out-of-process Web applications.
When a Web application is designated as out-of-process, the application runs in
a separate process (MTX.exe) that is isolated from the main IIS service
(Inetinfo.exe) so that if the faulty Web application crashes, the main IIS
service is unaffected and all other in-process and out-of-process Web sites
remain available.

In IIS 4.0, the AppOopRecoverLimit is not present in the metabase by default, but
the value internally defaults to "5" for all out-of-process Web applications.
This means that you can kill/crash an out-of-process Web site up to five times
and IIS will restart the Web application for you automatically. In IIS 4.0, this
setting only applies to out-of-process Web applications that run in MTX.exe.

In IIS 5.0, the process isolation model was changed to encompass the new medium
isolation "pooled out-of-process" Web applications in addition to high-isolation
out-of-process Web applications. In IIS 5.0, the AppOopRecoverLimit limit is not
present in the metabase by default, but the value internally defaults to "-1",
which means IIS will restart all medium-isolation and high-isolation Web
applications indefinitely. If the AppOopRecoverLimit is set in the metabase on a
medium-isolation (pooled) Web application, it will be ignored and the pooled
out-of-process Web application will restart indefinitely by default. In IIS 5.0,
this setting can only be used on high-isolation Web applications that are
running in DLLHost.exe. Additionally, if the Web site is in low isolation
(in-process), then the application restart capability is governed by the
properties for the IIS Admin service, which are listed in the Service Control
Manager (which is configured through the "Services" Microsoft Management Console
[MMC] snap-in, located in the Administrative tools group) and not by the
AppOopRecoverLimit metabase entry. In IIS 5.0, by default, if the Inetinfo.exe
service crashes, the IISReset.exe command will be issued to restart IIS
indefinitely.

Each time IIS 4.0 or 5.0 has to restart a failed out-of-process Web application,
an error message similar to the following is logged in the event log:

  Event ID: 37
  Source: W3SVC
  Description: "Out of process application /LM/w3svc/root/iishelp terminated
  unexpectedly."

In addition, each time that an out-of-process IIS Web site crashes or is killed,
the next user to request a page from that Web site will receive the following
error message once in his or her browser while IIS is restarting the failed
site:

  The Remote Procedure Call Failed and Did Not Execute.

After receiving that error message, if the user requests the page again (or
clicks refresh in the browser), IIS will have restarted the failed
out-of-process Web site (provided that the AppOOPRecoverLimit hasn't been
reached) and will return the page to the browser as usual.

In IIS 4.0, after the out-of-process Web site has failed five times, on the sixth
attempt to restart that Web site, IIS will not restart the site, and it will
instead return the following error message to the browser:

  The Remote Procedure Call Failed and Did Not Execute.

Then, if the user clicks refresh or requests the page again, he or she will then
receive the following error message:

  Server Application Error
  The server has reached the maximum recovery limit for the application during
  the processing of your request. Please contact the server administrator for
  assistance.

If the user continues to click refresh in the browser or to request a page from
the failed out-of-process application, he or she will continue to see the
"Server Application Error" and the Web application will remain stopped until IIS
is restarted.

In addition, in the IIS logs if you are using W3C Extended Logging, you may see
an entry like the following for each GET request that is sent to the server once
AppOOPRecoverLimit has been reached:

  

  #Software: Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0
  #Version: 1.0
  #Date: 2000-11-29 18:24:46
  #Fields: time c-ip s-sitename s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem sc-status sc-win32-status s-port
  18:39:26 127.0.0.1 W3SVC1 127.0.0.1 GET /iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp 502 1727 80
  18:39:39 127.0.0.1 W3SVC1 127.0.0.1 GET /iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp 502 1726 80
  18:46:52 127.0.0.1 W3SVC1 127.0.0.1 GET /iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp 502 1726 80
  18:46:52 127.0.0.1 W3SVC1 127.0.0.1 GET /iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp 502 1726 80

Note in the third column from the right the "502" response code from IIS and the
column next to that containing "1727" and "1726", which are the "Win32" response
codes. A 1727 code maps to the "The Remote Procedure Call Failed and Did Not
Execute" error and 1726 maps to "The Server has reached the maximum
recovery...." The "Win32 Status" field is not enabled by default. In order to
make that column show up in the IIS logs, you must edit the extended logging
properties for your Web site.

Also note that the time recorded in the IIS logs is in Greenwich mean time. So,
for example, if you are in the (U.S.) eastern time zone, you would have to
subtract 5 hours from the time that is logged in the first column to determine
the local time at which the request was received (eastern time is Greenwich mean
time - 5).
