-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the following configuration, when you recalculate routing, the c=* address
space does not appear in the Gateway Address Resolution Table (GWART), and
messages to the outside world are not delivered.

Two Exchange Server sites, SiteA and SiteB, are connected by four X.400
Connectors (each site has two bridgehead servers, and each bridgehead has an
X.400 Connector to each of the opposing bridgehead servers). The Connected Sites
tabs are completed, and directory replication is set up between the sites.

SiteA is responsible for the c=* address space (it has another connector to the
outside world), so both of the connectors in SiteB are configured with the c=*
address space.

CAUSE
=====

A code regression was introduced in build 2654.21 of the Ems_rid.dll file.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
