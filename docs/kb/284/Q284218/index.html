SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to troubleshoot the following video related issues in
the Microsoft games listed at the beginning of this article:

   - Poor video performance in the game.

- Poor game performance (choppy game play).

- Graphics in the game are distorted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot video related issues, use the following methods in the order in
which they are presented.

Method 1: Verify Video Adapter Memory
-------------------------------------

Use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to determine how much video memory is installed
on your video adapter. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following line (including the quotation marks), and
  then click OK:

  "Dxdiag" (without the quotation marks)

3. Click the Display or Display 1 tab.

4. Note how much video memory is Fon the Approx. Total Memory line under Device,
  and then click Exit.

If less than 8 megabytes (MB) of video memory are installed on your video
adapter, install additional video memory on your video adapter, or install a
video adapter with more video memory.

To view MechWarrior 4 system requirements, see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q279362 MechWarrior 4: Vengeance: Minimum System Requirements

  Q310627 MechWarrior 4 Black Knight/Mech Paks: Minimum System Requirements

If your video adapter meets the game requirements, reduce graphics settings.

Method 2: Reduce Graphics Settings in AutoConfig utility
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Quit MechWarrior 4.

2. To open the AutoConfig utility, click Start, point to Programs or All
  Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to MechWarrior 4 Vengeance, and
  then click Autoconfig. For MechWarrior Black Knight click AutoConfig Black
  Knight.

3. Select the Graphics Setting:Low check box.

4. Click Continue.

5. Start MechWarrior 4.

If your adjusting graphics settings in AutoCinfig utility did not resolve the
issue, update to use the latest video adapter driver available for your video
adapter.

Method 3: Install an Updated Video Driver
-----------------------------------------

To identify the manufacturer and the model of your video adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. If you are using a Microsoft Windows 95-based or a Microsoft Windows 98-based
  computer, click the Device Manager tab.

  If you are using a Microsoft Windows 2000 or XP based computer, click the
  Hardware tab, and then click Device Manager.

4. Expand the list next to Display adapters to expand the branch.

5. Under the Display adapters branch, note the manufacturer and the model of
  your video adapter, and then click OK.

6. Close all of the open windows on the desktop.

Method 4: Add Command Line Parameter -window

To manually add parameter to the command line in the MechWarrior 4 shortcut,

  automatically.

2. Right-click Start, and then click Open or Open All Users.

3. Double-click the Programs folder.

4. Double-click the MechWarrior Vengeance or Black Knight folder.

5. Right-click the MechWarrior icon, and then click Properties.

6. On the Shortcut tab, in the Target box, press END, press the SPACEBAR, and
  then type the "-window" (without the quotation marks) parameter.

For example:

MechWarrior 4 Vengeance

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\MechWarrior Vengeance\MW4.exe
  -window

Black Knight

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\MechWarrior
  Vengeance\mw4x\MW4x.exe
  -window

where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard drive where you have installed MechWarrior 4
Vengeance or Black Knight.

NOTE: Parameters are not case-sensitive.

7. Click Apply or OK.

8. Double-click the MechWarrior 4 icon to start the game.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next step.

  monitor is selected, or if a standard or unknown monitor is selected, click
  Change, click the manufacturer and model of your monitor, and then click OK.
