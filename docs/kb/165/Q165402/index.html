-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a computer running Windows 95 is left unattended while a user is logged on to
a network, it may be possible to obtain that user's network password by a
programmatic examination of the computer's memory. Typically, accomplishing this
would require physical access to the computer. However, the network password
could also potentially be acquired if a program designed to search for passwords
using the same examination of memory were to be downloaded and run by a
currently logged-on user.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows 95, passwords are encrypted before being sent over the network.
However, the network password for the user who is currently logged on to the
Windows 95-based computer is stored temporarily in memory in an unencrypted
format.

Using detailed knowledge of Windows 95 internal memory structures, it may be
possible to write a program that runs in Windows 95 and reads the password for
the currently logged-on user from memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recommends the following precautions to prevent the current user's
network password from being accessed by unauthorized means:

- Log off the computer when you leave it for long periods of time.

- Run a password-protected screen saver when you leave the computer for short
  periods of time.

- Do not run untrusted programs on the network, the Web, or that have been sent
  in e-mail.

- Install the update described in this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now available.

This issue is resolved by the following updated files:

- For Windows 95 (all releases):

Nwredir.vxd version 4.00.960 (dated 4/21/97) and later
Pppmac.vxd version 4.00.954 (dated 4/28/97) and later
Vredir.vxd version 4.00.1114 (dated 6/2/97) and later
Vnetsup.vxd version 4.00.1112 (dated 6/2/97) and later

- For Windows 95 (retail release) and OEM Service Release 1 (OSR1) only:

Rasapi32.dll version 4.00.954 (dated 4/25/97) and later

- For Windows 95 OSR2 and OSR2.1 only:

Rasapi32.dll version 4.00.1113 (dated 4/25/97) and later

- For the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services [MSNDS] (all Windows
  95 releases):

Nwredir.vxd version 4.00.975 (dated 4/21/97) and later

To install this update, follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate update file(s) to an empty folder.

  a. If you are running Windows 95 retail release (version 4.00.950) or OSR1
     (version 4.00.950 A), download the Secupd.exe file.

  b. If you are running Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 or 2.1 (version
     4.00.950 B), download the Secupd2.exe file.

  c. If you are running the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks with the
     Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS) installed, also
     download the Nwredup4.exe file.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the update file(s) you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Windows 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These components have been updated to encrypt the current user's network
password even when it is stored in memory so that it cannot be read even by a
programmer with detailed knowledge of Windows 95 internal memory structures.

For additional information about Windows 95 security, see Chapter 14 ("Security")
in the Windows 95 Resource Kit.
