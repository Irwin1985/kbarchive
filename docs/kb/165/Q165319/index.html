The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the directory import process to create distribution lists (DLs), you
may encounter a problem if you use recipients from sub-containers to populate
the DLs. The import process completes without any errors, but the DL does not
work properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0 and 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use the directory import process to create distribution lists, you have
to make sure to use the correct distinguished name (DN) in the Members column of
the Import file. If you have recipients in sub-containers, but you do not
include both the top-level container and the sub-container in the distinguished
name for recipients in sub-containers, the import will complete with no errors,
but the distribution list will not work properly.

For example, say you have the recipient container "Recipients" and a sub-
container of "Recipients" called "Other". The "Other" sub-container contains
non-Exchange recipients.

You then create an import file in order to create a distribution list to send to
some of the "Other" recipients. Call these "User1" and "User2". The distribution
list is called "Users".

The following mock import file shows the incorrect way to create the import file
for this example:

  Obj-Class Display Name Alias Name Directory Name Members
  --------- ------------ ---------- -------------- -------
  DL        Users        Users      Users          Other/cn=User1
  DL        Users        Users      Users          Other/cn=User2

After importing this file, you would receive no errors, and the distribution list
would get created. However, the distribution list would not work because the
names in the list cannot be resolved. Notice the Members column only specifies
the Other container and not its parent container, so when Exchange tries to
resolve the names in the list, it fails.

Here is the same import file with the correct information in it for this
example:

  Obj-Class Display Name Alias Name Directory Name Members
  --------- ------------ ---------- -------------- -------
  DL        Users        Users      Users
  Recipients/cn=Other/cn=User1
  DL        Users        Users      Users
  Recipients/cn=Other/cn=User2

After performing an import using this file, the distribution list will be created
and it will work properly. Again, notice the Members column has the parent
container (Recipients) and the sub-container (Other) in the DN for each
recipient in the list.

NOTE: If you have already created a faulty distribution list, you will need to
use the Overwrite option when re-importing the list with the correct format, or
you can delete the distribution list and re-import it using the correct format.
Using the "Overwrite" option may not work in the desired fashion depending on
how your import file is formatted.
