MORE INFORMATION
================

Do Not Install Visual C++ 5.0 Over an Installation of Visual C++ 4.x
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Visual C++ 5.0 on top of Visual C++ 4.x will render the 4.x tools
unusable. Install Visual C++ 5.0 into a directory separate from your Visual C++
4.x installation. Visual C++ 5.0 can co-exist with a 4.x installation, as long
as both versions reside in different directories.

Protected-Mode CD-ROM Driver Required Under Windows 95 for Visual C++

Installation
------------

To install Visual C++ 5.0 under Windows 95, you must be running a protected- mode
CD-ROM driver. You can verify this by checking the Device Manager. If you are
currently using a real-mode CD-ROM driver, contact your CD-ROM drive
manufacturer for an updated driver for Windows 95 before installing Visual C++
5.0.

Use Knowledge Base Articles to Solve Setup and Operating Problems
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the Knowledge Base articles in the MSDN documentation to resolve
known installation and operating problems. Select the Search command from the
Help menu and search for error message or related keywords to find a problem
description and resolution.

Knowledge Base articles, which are written by Microsoft Technical Support
Professionals, are available by connecting to:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/support/

Applications Built with OLEAUT32.LIB Require AXDIST.EXE and/or NT SP5
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Visual C++ 5.0 ships with the latest OLEAUT32.LIB from the ActiveX SDK which
exposes entry points into the OLEAUT32.DLL which are not present in the
OLEAUT32.DLL that ships with the original NT and Windows 95 operating systems.
If you build an OLE-enabled application or component with Visual C++ 5.0, and
link with OLEAUT32.DLL, you will need to install the newer OLEAUT32.DLL via the
AXDist.exe applet located in the DevStudio\VC\Redist\AXRedist directory on the
Visual C++ 5.0 CD-Rom.

If you are targeting Windows NT 3.51, you will need to ensure that NT Service
Pack 5 is installed on the target machine.

NOTE: The Vcread.htm file incorrectly refers to SP5a for Windows NT 3.51. It
should state SP5 as the preceding topic does. SP5 for Windows NT 3.51 is located
on CD two of the Microsoft Visual C++ Enterprise CD set, or in the
\Winnt351.qfe\SP5a directory on CD four of the Microsoft Visual Studio 97
Enterprise CD set.

DAO Setup Requires OLEAUT32.dll 2.20.4054 or Later
--------------------------------------------------

The redistributable DAO Setup program that ships with Visual C++ will not run
successfully unless OLEAUT32.dll build 2.20.4045 or later is installed and
registered on the target computer. The newer version of OLEAUT32.dll must be
copied to the target machine's SYSTEM directory, and registered with
REGSVR32.exe. An up-to-date version of OLEAUT32.dll can be found on the first
disc of Visual C++, in the DevStudioVC\Redist directory.

Viewing "ANSI Character Code Chart" in InfoView Requires an English System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The character codes displayed in the "ANSI Character Code Chart" topic will only
display correctly if viewed on English systems using an "ANSI- compatible"
codepage.

Accessing Online Help Brings Up MSN Dialog Box
----------------------------------------------

When accessing online help you may get a dialog box asking about your dial- up
connection for your online service provider. This occurs because Internet
Explorer, which has an option to automatically connect to the online service, is
used to display the online documentation. The best way around this is to choose
Cancel when asked to connect. You can disable automatic dialup. To turn off the
automatic dialup:

1. Right-click Internet Explorer to get the Context menu. Click Properties.

2. In the Properties dialog box, click the Connection tab.

3. In the Dialing group, uncheck the "Connect to the Internet as needed". This
  will turn off the Auto dialup.

4. Click Apply and OK to close the dialog box.

Special Instructions for Installing Visual C++ 5.0 on Far East

Operating Systems
-----------------

The Visual C++ installation does not copy over the localized versions of
RICHED32.DLL, GAPI32.DLL, and HLP95EN.DLL on machines running a DBCS enabled
Operating System. These 3 files are required by some of the ActiveX Controls
installed by Visual C++.

If you install this version of Visual C++ on a Far East Operating System, be sure
to copy these 3 files from the directory on the Visual C++ CD indicated below
into your System directory:

  Chinese (PRC)     DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\chs

  Chinese (Taiwan)  DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\cht

  Japanese          DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\jpn

  Korean            DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\kor

ODBC Setup.exe is Not in REDIST Directory
-----------------------------------------

In ODBC 3.0 several of the ODBC Installer functions have been removed, and others
have been redesigned. Therefore this Setup program would not work with ODBC
3.0.

The Installer API has been changed to make it more platform independent. For
example, functions in the Installer API (such as SQLInstallODBC) that duplicated
the work of the Windows SDK Setup program have been removed. In general, it is
now the responsibility of the Setup program to copy files during installation.

For more information about creating setup programs that install ODBC 3.0
components and drivers, please refer to Part 3 in the ODBC 3.0 Programmers
Reference. To access the ODBC 3.0 Programmers' Reference, open ODBC.hlp which
can be found in DevStudio\SharedIDE\Help.
