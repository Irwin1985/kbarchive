Version(s): WINDOWS:3.2; winnt:4.0

Last Modified: 20-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Windows Remote client may display the following
message when you attempt to open an attachment that you received by being a
member of an Exchange Server Distribution List (DL):

  The Attached file &lt;filename&gt; could not be opened because a temporary
  file could not be created.

This occurs when the message contains a large number of recipients and the
recipient data exceeds 32K bytes.

CAUSE
=====

A logic error in the remote mail client caused the attachment to fail to be
renamed. This prevents it from being downloaded to the MMF file. The reference
to the attachment exists in the message, but the actual attachment has been
lost. When you attempt to use the attachment, the error message is displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  File Name     Version
  -----------------------
  Msrmttr.dll   3.02.4015

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Remcy2k.exe:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/pcmail-public/All-Y2K/


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Remote for
Windows version 3.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It may be possible to work around this problem by creating DLs that consist of
groups created by the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks administrators. These group
names are not expanded and can be distributed to other postoffices and included
in a larger group.

If the large DL is created in Exchange Server, it may be possible to create the
DL using smaller DLs and nesting these into the main DL.


Additional query words: remote dl exchange
