The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remove Microsoft Exchange Client by clicking the Add/Remove
in Control Panel or clicking Add/Remove in Exchange Client Setup, Exchange
Client does not seem to be removed.

CAUSE
=====

Several registry keys and files remain.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 and Windows NT clients from a computer
that does not also have Microsoft Exchange Server installed on it, follow these
steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. If you plan to reinstall the client later, synchronize any .ost files, and
  back up any .pst and .pab files. (This assumes there is no corruption in the
  files.)

  NOTE: Backing up .ost files will not work. That information will NOT be
  recoverable! Only a synchronization with the Exchange Server Mailbox will
  ensure there is no loss of information.

2. Log out of any applications.

3. Back up the entire client computer. (Later, registry keys will be removed.
  Full backup is required unless recovery does not matter.)

4. In Control Panel, click Add/Remove Software. Remove any Exchange and
  messaging options.

5. Go to the latest exchange Setup and click Remove All. ("Latest" Setup means
  the highest version installed on this computer.)

6. Start Registry Editor.

7. Go to the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\Software\Microsoft...

8. Delete the Exchange and Windows Messaging folders and subkeys.

9. Exit Registry Editor.

10. Do a search on *exch* and remove all remaining files.

11. Remove the &lt;system root&gt;\&lt;windows&gt;\system32\Msremind.wav file.

12. Restart the computer.

To reinstall Exchange Client:

1. Rename the Mapi.dll, Mapi32.dll, and Mfcans32.dll to *.old. These files are
  usually located in the &lt;system root&gt;\&lt;windows&gt;\system32\
  directory.

2. Restart the computer.

3. Reinstall Exchange Client.

4. You can point the client to the "old" .pab and .pst files. However, if you
  are reinstalling due to corruption issues, it's best to test the client with
  new files. Then, import the old information into the new files. ( On the File
  menu, click Import, and then click .pab and so on.)

5. If all is OK, remove the Mapi.old and Mapi32.old files (renamed in the step 1
  above).

To remove a Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client from a computer that also has
Microsoft Exchange Server installed, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel Services, stop System Attendant.

2. In Control Panel Add/Remove Programs, select Microsoft Exchange and then
  click Add/Remove.

3. Click Remove All.

4. When asked if you want to remove all shared components, click KEEP.

5. Once Setup is done, rename the Exchange directory where Exchange Client was
  installed.

6. Start Registry Editor . Export the the following keys and then delete them:

  NOTE: Make sure you export the keys prior to deleting them, in case of error.

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Forms Registry

  Delete the following String Value:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Exchange Provider
     "Rpc_Binding_Order"

7. Restart the computer.

To reinstall Exchange Client on the computer running Exchange Server:

1. In Control Panel Services, stop System Attendant.

2. Reinstall Exchange Client.

3. Restart computer and make sure all Exchange Server Services and the Exchange
  Client function properly.
