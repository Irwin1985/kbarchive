Server.

1. 5250 Applet Cannot Display DBCS Characters Correctly Which Are Input from
  Keyboard (Win32)


2. 5250 Applet Terminates Trnsdt.dll when It Exits (Win16)


3. 5250 Applet Displays Shift-Out Code (All Platforms)

SYMPTOMS
========

1. 5250 Applet Cannot Display DBCS Characters Correctly Which Are Input From
  Keyboard (Win32)

  SYMPTOMS

  The Win5250.exe program did not display DBCS characters correctly when they
  were typed on a keyboard. This did not occur if using cut and paste.

  CAUSE

  The Win5250 applet was processing VK_PROCESSKEY code when it receives
  WM_KEYDOWN message on Win32 platforms.

  RESOLUTION

  The Win5250 applet now ignores VK_PROCESSKEY when it receives WM_KEYDOWN
  messages.

  STATUS

  An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.


2. 5250 Applet Terminates Trnsdt.dll When It Exits (Win16)

  SYMPTOMS

  When the 5250 Applet exits, it terminates Trsndt.dll even if another module is
  calling TrnsDt. This problem occurs only in Windows 3.x (16-bit) using the
  Windows 3.x SNA Server client. It does not occur when using any of the 32-bit
  clients.


  CAUSE

  Win5250.exe issued FreeLibrary API to the same instance twice when it exited.

  STATUS

  An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.


3. 5250 Applet Displays Shift-Out Code (All Platforms)

  SYMPTOMS

  When DBCS data is input from the keyboard, the 5250 Applet displays the
  shift-out code (0x0e) directly. It should be converted to a space (0x20)
  character.

  CAUSE

  The Win5250.exe program was displaying the EBCDIC shift-out code incorrectly.

  STATUS

  An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.


4. 5250 Applet Has a Fixed Font Name (All Platforms)

  SYMPTOMS

  The 5250 applet is unable to display Japanese messages on the status bar.

  CAUSE

  The 5250 applet was designed to use a fixed font.


  STATUS

  An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.


5. 5250 Applet should support Greek and Central European Code Pages (All
  Platforms)

  SYMPTOMS

  The Win5250 applet shipped with SNA 3.0 is unable to support Greek Host code
  pages or Central European code pages.

  RESOLUTION

  The 5250 applet now supports the correct font for different Host Code Page
  Selection. The following is the corresponding font for Greek, Greek Modern,
  Czech, and Polish:

  Windows NT 4.0/Windows 95      Windows NT 3.51/Windows 3.x
  -------------------------      ------------------------------

  Greek Courier New              Courier New Greek
  (GREEK_CHARSET)                (ANSI_CHARSET/Courg.ttf)

  Greek Modern Courier New       Courier New Greek
  (GREEK_CHARSET)                (ANSI_CHARSET/Courg.ttf)

  Czech Courier New              Courier New CE
  (EASTEUROPE_CHARSET)           (ANSI_CHARSET/Cecour.ttf)

  Polish Courier New             Courier New CE
  (EASTEUROPE_CHARSET)           (ANSI_CHARSET/Cecour.ttf)

  STATUS

  An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.


6. 5250 Applet Does Not Support AltGr Or Alt-State Input For Foreign Locales

  SYMPTOMS

  When running the NT Win5250 applet, the Alt-state and AltGr states were not
  being processed correctly. This was first noticed when Setup for Polish
  keyboards.

  Some of what you would see are as follows:

  AltGr - s  shows d instead of d dashed. 
  AltGr - f  shows nothing (Notepad behaved the same way)
  AltGr - g  shows nothing
  AltGr - 1&amp; 2 shows ?~ instead of (v~)
  AltGr - 1&amp; 6 shows ~ instead of (ogonek and then ~ )
  AltGr - 7&amp; 0 shows ?` instead of (~`)

  CAUSE

  The Win5250 applet was not checking the HostCodePage configuration.

  STATUS

  An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.
