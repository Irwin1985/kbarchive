SUMMARY
=======

The Event Viewer enables the user to save the event logs in a binary file with
the EVT extension. Such a file can be opened with the Event Viewer on any other
computer running the same version of Windows NT.

Even though the Event Viewer is able to load such a file, it needs the messages
DLLs for each component described in the source of the events.

For example, assume that computer A is running Windows NT 4.0 and a service
called "aservice". On this computer, save the system event logs under the file
System_A.evt. Now assume that computer B is also running Windows NT 4.0. The
service "aservice" has not been installed on computer B.

On computer B, you open the file System_A.evt with the Event Viewer. If you
double-click a message with the source set to "aservice," you get the following
error:

  The description for Event ID (xxx) in Source (aservice) could not be found.
  It contains the following insertion string(s): ...

Follow the steps in the next section to read the event logs of computer A while
on computer B without having to install the components of computer A onto
computer B.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The EVT files include the event log messages as they are stored by the system.
Each message is composed of an ID (that is, the message itself) and a number of
insertion strings. The IDs are translated into strings through the use of
messages DLLs.

All the application event logs messages DLLs are defined under the following
registry keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\ 
Application

All the system event logs messages DLLs are defined under the following registry
keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\ 
System

For example, the TCP/IP service's message DLL is defined under the following
registry entry:

Key   = HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\ 
System\TcpIp
Value = EventMessageFile REG_EXPAND_SZ %SystemRoot%\System32\ 
netevent.dll

Therefore, all the TCP/IP event log messages are defined in the DLL
netevent.dll.

When the user double-clicks an event for which the message DLL is not defined in
the registry, the message string cannot be displayed and the following message
is displayed:

  The description for Event ID (51) in Source (aservice) could not be found. It
  contains the following insertion string(s): ...

Below is a description of a way to read the system event logs of a computer with
WINS on a computer without WINS. This sample can be adapted for any application
or system component.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

The following operations are required:

1. On the computer with WINS, run REGEDIT and select the following registry
  key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\ 
  System\Wins

2. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File and select a file name (for
  example, Winsreg.reg).

3. On the computer without WINS (for example, the one used to read the system
  event logs of the computer with WINS), run REGEDIT. On the Registry menu,
  click Import Registry File and select the file Winsreg.reg previously saved
  on the other computer.

4. You should now have the following registry entry on the target computer (that
  is, the one without WINS):

  Key   = HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ 
  EventLog\System\Wins
  Value = EventMessageFile REG_EXPAND_SZ %SystemRoot%\System32\ 
  winsevnt.dll

  You now need to copy the file defined in the EventMessageFile registry value
  in your System32 directory. If X: is mapped to \\wins_server\admins$, you can
  run the following command:

  copy x:\System32\winsevnt.dll %SystemRoot%\System32\winsevnt.dll

  Of course, the file may be copied somewhere else, but in this case you need to
  edit the EventMessageFile registry value manually so that it points to the
  directory with the DLL.

5. Close all the instances of the Event Viewer and rerun the Event Viewer. You
  should now be able to dump all the WINS events.
