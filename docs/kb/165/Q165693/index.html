SUMMARY
=======

SQL and SQL Debugging
---------------------

- Enabling SQL Debugging

- One or More Breakpoints are Disabled Upon Starting Direct Database Debugging

- SQL Server Service Pack 2 Bug May Cause a Failure in CRecordset::Edit Mode

- SQL Debugging Will Be Disabled Following a Lost Server Connection

- SQL Debugging a Disconnected Data Connection May Produce Unexpected Results

- Remote SQL Debugging with Automation Manager Registered as Interactive User

- Visual C++ Starts Automation Manager but Doesn't Shut It Down

MORE INFORMATION
================

Feature Only in Enterprise Edition SQL and SQL debugging are supported only in
Visual C++ Enterprise Editions.

Enabling SQL Debugging
----------------------

To enable SQL Debugging, you need to install the Visual C++ Enterprise Edition
Server Components on your SQL Server machine. Before you run the setup program
for the VC Server Components, you must first install the latest Service Pack for
Windows NT, and the latest Service Pack for Microsoft SQL Server. Once these
service packs are installed, you will be able to successfully install the Visual
C++ Server Components. The setup program can be run directly from the VCServer
directory, or from the master setup program in the root directory of Disc 2
(Disc 4 for Visual Studio).

One or More Breakpoints are Disabled Upon Starting Direct Database

Debugging
---------

If your workspace includes both a C++ and a database project it is possible to
encounter a message that warns of one or more break points being disabled when
you begin debugging the database. This happens when you have C++ breakpoint set
in your C++ project and you begin debugging the database project before the C++
project. In some cases, the debugger will not be able to find the C++ symbols.
The workaround is to first begin debugging the C++ project, which allows the
debugger to load the C++ symbols, before you debug the database project.

SQL Server Service Pack 2 Bug May Cause a Failure in CRecordset::Edit Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SQL Server Service Pack 2 (06.50.0240) that ships with the Visual C++
Enterprise Edition has a bug that may cause a failure in CRecordset::Edit mode
during the call to CRecordset::Update.

The ODBC driver that ships with this version of SQL Server now gives you the
option to turn ON or OFF the following items:

- Use ANSI Quoted Identifiers

- Use ANSI Nulls, Padding, and Warnings

Previous versions of the ODBC driver turned these items ON by default.

If you encounter the following error:

  Syntax error or access violation
  State:37000,Native:7134,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]

and you have Use ANSI Nulls, Padding, and Warnings turned ON, try the following
workaround:

1. Open the ODBC Data Source Administrator using the icon in the Control Panel.

2. Select your SQL Server Data Connection and click the Configure button.

3. Click the Options button. 4.Clear the Use ANSI Nulls, Padding and Warnings
  option.

SQL Debugging Will Be Disabled Following a Lost Server Connection
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If the SQL Server against which you are debugging fails during an SQL Debugging
Session, you can reestablish the connection to the database. Go to the View menu
and use the Refresh command.

SQL Debugging a Disconnected Data Connection May Produce Unexpected Results
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you delete or disconnect a Data Connection during a SQL Debugging session you
may find the IDE in an unstable state. It is recommended that you do not delete
or disconnect a Data Connection while you are using SQL Debugging. Stop
Debugging before you delete or disconnect the Data Connection.

Remote SQL Debugging with Automation Manager Registered as Interactive User
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you install SQL Server and then install Visual C++ Enterprise Edition
(including the Visual C++ Enterprise server-side components) on the same
computer, the automation manager's identity is registered as "Interactive User."
In this scenario, if you log off from this machine but keep SQL server running
as a service, you will not be able to remote debug against this server.
Registering the automation manager's identity as "Interactive User" necessitates
that someone be logged onto the computer to remotely debug SQL.

Visual C++ setup registers the Automation manager as Interactive User, when
installed with a preexisting SQL Server, with the assumption that you'll want to
do local SQL debugging. SQL Debugging may not work if the automation manager's
identity is registered as "Launching User" (the default) and SQL server and
automation manager are already running in the service environment.

To change the identity that the automation manager recognizes:

1. From the computer on which you installed SQL Server and then installed Visual
  C++ Enterprise Edition, run DCOMCNFG.exe .

2. From the Applications list, select Remote Automation CLSID_StubMarshaler.

3. Click Properties.

4. Click the Identity tab.

5. Select the appropriate user account.

Visual C++ Starts Automation Manager but Doesn't Shut it Down
-------------------------------------------------------------

Starting SQL Debugging automatically starts the Automation Manager to manage
remote OLE objects. Automation Manager displays the current number of
connections and objects that are instantiated on the remote machine. When Visual
C++ shut downs, it does not shut down Automation Manager because there isn't any
method of querying Automation Manager to determine if another application might
also be using it.

You can manually shut down Automation Manager when it displays that there are no
connections left.
