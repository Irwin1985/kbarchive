SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a cross-reference to a ListNum field, the cross-reference may
not include the complete ListNum context if all of the following conditions are
true:

- The ListNum field is located previous to the cross-reference.

  -and-

- The cross-reference is being inserted into a paragraph containing a higher
  level ListNum then the ListNum being referenced.

  -and-

- There is not a higher level ListNum field (other than the ListNum field
  contained in the paragraph where the cross-reference is being inserted)
  between the cross-reference and the ListNum that is being cross- referenced.

WORKAROUND
==========

Consider using outline numbering or a combination of outline numbering and
ListNum fields.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A cross-reference to a ListNum field should include the entire context of the
ListNum that is being cross-referenced unless there are no higher level ListNum
fields between the paragraph containing the cross-reference and the ListNum
field that is being cross-referenced.

In the following discussion, the term ListNum "context" is used. A paragraph is
said to be in the same ListNum context as a certain ListNum field if no higher
level ListNum fields occur between the paragraph and the ListNum field.

Here is a sample list with the numbering created using ListNum fields:

  ------------------------------------
  1) This is a ListNum of level 1
       a) This is a ListNum of level 2
       b) This is a ListNum of level 2

  2) This is a ListNum of level 1
       a) This is a ListNum of level 2
       b) This is a ListNum of level 2
       c) This is a ListNum of level 2
       d) This is a ListNum of level 2

  3) This is a ListNum of level 1
       a) This is a ListNum of level 2
       b) This is a ListNum of level 2
  ------------------------------------

Cross-references to this list:

If you insert a cross-reference in line 2d and reference either line 2a, 2b, 2c,
or 2d, you will only get "a)," "b)," "c)," or "d)" as the cross reference
because the cross-reference is in the same context as the item being
cross-referenced.

However, if you insert a cross-reference in line 2d and reference either line 1a,
1b, 3a, or 3b, you will get the full context "1)a)," "1)b)," "3)a)," or "3)b)"
as the cross-reference because the cross-reference is in a different context
than the item being cross-referenced.

The problem also occurs when you insert a cross-reference in line 3) and
reference 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d. You should get the full context of "2)a)," "2)b),"
"2)c)," or "2)d)" because you are referencing a line that is outside the context
of the paragraph where you are inserting the cross reference. However, in this
situation, you will get the incorrect cross- reference of "a," "b," "c," or
"d."

NOTE: Inserting a cross-reference in line "3)" and cross-referencing lines "1a"
or "1b" works correctly (giving you the full context).
