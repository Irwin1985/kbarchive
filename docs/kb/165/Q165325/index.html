-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade Windows NT 4.0, the mouse which used to work in Windows NT
3.51 no longer is recognized. The problem, according to CYBEX, is that Microsoft
added a new parameter to the mouse detection.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 and Windows95 loads (with the IntelliMouse mouse driver), a
problem has been discovered on the XPAC and XPAB cards that are used within a 4x
Peripheral configuration. The problem occurs on cards having a firmware revision
earlier than C04. The PS/2 mouse attached to the 4xP may not operate properly
with any of the attached computers running these new operating systems. When the
IntelliMouse mouse driver is loaded in these systems they attempt to detect the
new Microsoft IntelliMouse through a series of commands and parameters, one of
which causes the XPAC/XPAB card to operate erratically.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

For systems running Windows NT 4.0: disable the support for the IntelliMouse
wheel in the computer's registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services
  /i8042prt/Parameters/

2. Select EnableWheelDetection, and from the Edit menu, click DWORD.

3. Change the value to 0, and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer for this change to take
  effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For systems running Win95 (with IntelliMouse mouse driver) or for a permanent
solution for Windows NT 4.0, you can contact Cybex technical support department
at (205)430-4000 in order to instructions on how to upgrade the firmware on the
XPAC or XPAB card in your 4xP.This is information is available for download at:

  http://www.cybex.com

NOTE: If you want to connect a Microsoft IntelliMouse to the 4xP, and be able to
use the wheel button, you must use XPLU/LCI firmware revision C02 (or higher),
and XPAC/XPAB firmware revision C04 (or higher).
