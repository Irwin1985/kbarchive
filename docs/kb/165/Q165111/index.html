The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

The following checklist is intended as an aide in configuring X.400 connectivity
between Microsoft Exchange Servers. This effort is not intended to replace
observations on previously operational connections that may point to the actual
problem, but rather, as a guide to succesful configuration of between Microsoft
Exchange Message Transfer Agents (MTAs). The term 'server' refers to a Windows
NT server that has Microsoft Exchange Server Enterprise Edition or Standard
Edition with the X.400 connector installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Can each server can ping the IP address of the other?
  No - Resolve network issue.
  Yes - If you want to use the server name versus the ip address proceed to step
  2, otherwise proceed to step 3.

2. If the server name will be used in lieu of the IP address of the target MTA,
  ping the server name. Note: DNS will support server name resolution or a
  lmhosts or hosts file may be used. The lmhosts and hosts files are located in
  the 'winntdir'\system32\drivers\etc directory. The form for a lmhosts file is
  ip address, tab, server name, tab, #PRE, and a tab followed by a
  #DOM:domain_name if the server is a domain controller. The format for a hosts
  file is IP address, a tab, and then the server name.

  Did the server name return an ip address?
  No - Resolve problem with name resolution.
  Yes - Proceed to step 3.

3. Have the administrator configuring a given MTA record the following
  information for the MTA to which they desire to connect.

  Remote Server name: This entry is not case sensitive and may not exceed 32
  characters in length. This entry is the name of the NT server where the
  target Microsoft Exchange Server is installed.

  Remote MTA password: This entry is case sensitive and may not exceed a length
  of 64 characters. If the other MTA has a password, you must enter it here.

  For the simplest configuration, select the defaults, which is no password.

4. T selector: This value is optional. This value is specified on the Outgoing
  OSI address information of the Stack tab. The value cannot exceed 32 text
  characters (64 HEX characters). By default, Microsoft Exchange uses the
  value(s) specified in the Outgoing OSI address information for the value(s)
  in the Incoming OSI address information. If a T selector is used, it is
  critical that the value be an exact match with the corresponding value
  specified for the T selector on the target Microsoft Exchange Server. If the
  remote admin wants to specify a S selector and/or a P Selector, this should
  be done after successful messaging has been established. The T, S, and P
  selectors are supported between Microsoft Exchange Servers.

5. Use the Overide tab to specify the Local MTA and Password. The MTA will use
  the name of the NT server on which Microsoft Exchange Server is installed for
  the MTA name. If no incoming password is desired, use of the Override Tab is
  unnecessary. Using a password is redundant because the T selector provides
  adequate security.

6. Use the Connected Sites tab to configure the address space that will be
  associated with the target Microsoft Exchange Server. The Address Space tab
  should only be used on a Microsoft Exchange Server that connects to a foreign
  MTA.

  Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program and select the
  Configuration object. Highlight the Site Addressing object in the right-hand
  window and double-click it. Select the Routing tab and click Recalculate
  Routing. This ensures that the routing table for the Site reflects current
  changes.

7. The information on the Advanced tab of the X.400 Connector should not require
  modification.

8. Make a custom recipient on both Servers or send a message to a user on the
  foreign server using a 1-off address in the To: line.

  Example of 1-off:

  [x400:c=us;a=attmail;p=organization;o=locale;s=lastname;g=firstname]


9. If the above test fails in either direction, highlight the Server object in
  the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program. With the Server object
  highlighted, open the File menu and select the Properties option. Select the
  Diagnostics Logging tab and increase the MSExchangeMTA X.400,
  Interoperablility, and APDU logging to Medium. This will result in increased
  logging to the Bf0.log, Ev0.log and Ap0.log in the MTADATA directory.

10. Repeat the send mail testing.
