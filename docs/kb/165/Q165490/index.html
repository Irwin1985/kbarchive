SUMMARY
=======

When using an existing 16-bit application compiled with Microsoft Visual Basic
version 4.0, the following error message may be displayed if you are working
with a Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit-built OLE client:

  OLE Automation Error. -2147319784 (80028018)

During the installation of Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0,
updated components and registrations entries may cause the above error message
only if you are using early binding and passing Collections from a Visual Basic
4.0 16-bit Automation client to a Visual Basic 4.0 Automation server. The server
can be either 16-bit or 32-bit.

This applies to any combination of 16-bit / 32-bit collection interaction. This
means that the same problem will occur if the collection originates and is
passed from a 32-bit application to a 16-bit server as well. There are two ways
to work around this behavior:

Workaround 1 - When Source Code is Available (Best Solution)
------------------------------------------------------------

To work around this behavior when you have the source code available, you can
re-write portions of the client that deal with collections to use late binding
rather of early binding. For example, a change you would make to the Automation
Client is:

instead of:

        Dim X as Collection

use:

        Dim X as Object
        Set X = VBA.Collection

Workaround 2 - Existing Applications and No Access to Source Code
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To work around this behavior in the situation where an existing, compiled
application is affected, certain changes must be made to the Registration
Database. These changes force TYPELIB.DLL to use the earlier versions of the
type libraries that released with Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0. A registry file
has been created by Microsoft that will change the registration automatically.

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Vb416fix.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


Updating an Individual System
-----------------------------

To update any single system, do the following:

1. Copy the VB416FIX.EXE to a directory on the target system. C:\TEMP works
  well.

2. Double-click on VB416FIX.EXE to extract the file VB416FIX.REG.

3. Double-click on the VB416FIX.REG.

  The following message should be displayed:

  "Information in &lt;filename&gt; has been successfully entered into the
  registry."

Including the VB416FIX.REG File in New Setups
---------------------------------------------

To include the VB416FIX.REG file with the other components of a Visual Basic 4.0
16-bit application, you must use the Application Setup Wizard to build the
distribution diskettes. Use the following steps:

1. Run the Application Setup Wizard for Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 (16-bit).

2. Proceed through step 6 in the Setup Wizard as you normally would.

3. In step 7 in the Setup Wizard, click Add Files.

4. Select the VB416FIX.REG file from the folder or diskette where it is stored.

5. Click OK, and then click Finish.

  The Setup Wizard will generate the compressed files for all of your
  components, including the VB416FIX.REG file you included. When Setup Wizard
  is complete, you must alter the SETUP.LST file.

6. Edit SETUP.LST in a text editor such as NotePad.

7. In the section labeled [Files], you will find a line that lists the
  VB416FIX.REG file The line will look similar to the following sample:

     File2=1,,VB416FIX.RE_,VB416FIX.REG,$(AppPath),,,3/6/1997,247

8. Edit the sixth (6) field to include the name of the .REG file. The line
  should look like the following:

  File2=1,,VB416FIX.RE_,VB416FIX.REG,$(AppPath),VB416FIX.REG,,3/6/1997,247

9. Save the SETUP.LST file.

  When a user runs the SETUP.EXE, the VB416FIX.REG file will be registered
  automatically on the user's system.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0,
updated components and registrations entries may cause the above error message
only if you are using early binding and passing Collections from a Visual Basic
4.0 16-bit Automation client to a Visual Basic 4.0 Automation server. The server
can be either 16-bit or 32-bit. This is limited to Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit built
clients that use early binding and pass a Collection to an Automation server.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project in Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit:

  (ProjectName="TestServer", StartMode= OLE Server)

2. Add a Class module:

  (Instancing = Multi-Use, Name = "Class1", Public = True)

3. Add the following code to Class1:

          Private gTstCol as New Collection

          Public Function fTstCol(ByRef ParCol As Collection) As Long
             Set ParCol = gTstCol 'Return some global collection object
             fTstCol = 0  'just return 0, nothing special.
          End Function

4. Run Project.

5. Start another instance of Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit.

6. Add a reference to TestServer to the project.

7. Add the following code to the project:

          Sub Form_Load ()
             Dim gTstObj As TestServer.Class1
             Dim Res As Long
             Dim tmpCol As Collection
             Set gTstObj =  new "TESTSERVER.CLASS1"
             Res = gTstObj.fTstCol(tmpCol)
            'The Automation Error message is displayed in the line above.
          End Sub

8. Run the Project.
