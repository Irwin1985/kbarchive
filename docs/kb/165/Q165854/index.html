Ordering the SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 CD
----------------------------------------------

Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack 1 (SP1) is available
in CD media format by ordering from Microsoft at (800) 936-3500.

SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) includes all bug fixes implemented
since the initial SNA Server 3.0 release. In addition, the 3.0 SP1 CD
includes updated documentation, collateral, and SDK (software development
kit files). 3.0 SP1 includes updated SNA Server and client software for
I386 (Intel) and DEC Alpha platforms.

NOTE: Support for MIPS and Power PC platforms have been discontinued
and is not included in 3.0 SP1.

Downloading SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1
------------------------------------------

Self-extracting executable files containing updated 3.0 SP1 SNA
Server and client files can be downloaded electronically from
www.microsoft.com. The following files comprise the updated
SNA Server and client files for 3.0 SP1:

 30SP1TXT.EXE - 3.0 SP1 information and help file
 30SP1IS.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 Server Update (Intel) (NOTE 1)
 30SP1AS.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 Server Update (Alpha) (NOTE 1)
 30SP1IC.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 Windows NT Client Update (Intel)
 30SP1AC.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 Windows NT Client Update (Alpha)
 30SP1CL.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 Win 3.x, MS-DOS, OS/2 Client Update
 30SP195.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 Windows 95 Client Update
 30SP1HS.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 Host Security Update (Intel and Alpha) (NOTE 2)
 30SP1IW.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 SNA Workstation Update (Intel)
 30SP1AW.EXE  - 3.0 SP1 SNA Workstation Update (Alpha)

For information about changes implemented in 3.0 SP1, see the
SNA30SP1.HLP file included in 30SP1TXT.EXE, 30SP1IS.EXE or
30SP1AS.EXE. SNA30SP1.HLP also lists new features added in
the service pack and articles describing the symptoms and causes
for problems fixed in the service pack.

NOTE 1: The SNA Server 3.0 SP1 update files include updates to
the SNA Server, Print Service, TN3270 Service, TN5250 Service,
ODBC drivers, AFTP, and Shared Folders Gateway.

NOTE 2: A problem was found in the Host Security Update program
after SNA Server 3.0 SP1 was released. If the 3.0 SP1 Host Security
Update program is run by itself, or is run after the SNA Server 3.0
SP1 Update program, then the SNAREG.DLL file is renamed causing the
SnaBase and Host Security modules to fail to function upon reboot.
See below for more information on this problem.

Instructions for Decompressing Files
------------------------------------

All of the above files are compressed in self-extracting
archive format, containing SNA Server 3.0 SP1.  To extract
each file, copy the file to a separate empty directory on your
hard drive and run the file using the "-d" option.  For
example:

   30SP1IS.EXE -d &lt;PATH&gt;

Where &lt;PATH&gt; is the destination directory for the service
pack. If you wish to extract the service pack to the current
directory, leave &lt;PATH&gt; blank.

After the service pack file has been decompressed, run the
UPDATE.EXE program to install the updated SNA Server 3.0
server or client files, as appropriate.

NOTE: The UPDATE program will automatically stop any SNA
Server services which may be running.

Installing the Service Pack Files
---------------------------------

** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 3.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **

Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated
in 3.0 SP1. Updates may be applied in any order -- to the
server and/or to the clients. It is recommended that all
systems running SNA Server 3.0 (that is, SNA Servers and
client computers) are updated to 3.0 SP1. It may not be
necessary to update the client computers to SP1 unless you
are experiencing a client problem that has been fixed in SP1.

WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on
systems currently running SNA Server 3.0 server or client
software. These updates should NOT be applied over systems
running SNA Server 2.x releases.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR CUSTOMERS RUNNING HOST SECURITY
------------------------------------------------

A problem was found in the Host Security Update program after
SNA Server 3.0 SP1 was released. After running the 3.0 SP1
Host Security Update program, the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\SNAREG.DLL 
file is renamed in error. This causes the SnaBase and/or
Host Security components to fail to start upon reboot. The 
following solutions can be used to solve this problem:

- If SNA Server is also running on the same machine as the
  Host Security components, then reapply SNA Server 3.0 SP1 by
  re-running the SNA Server 3.0 SP1 UPDATE program. This will
  reapply the SNAREG.DLL file.

- If SNA Server is not running on this machine, locate a server 
  running SNA Server 3.0 SP1 and copy &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\SNAREG.DLL
  to the system path of the machine running the Host Security 
  service(s).
