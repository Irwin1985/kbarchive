The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Because FoxPro reports are sent as separate print jobs, they are also printed on
separate pages. So, if you have two one-page reports and you want to have them
printed as one duplex report, you would have to combine the reports into one, or
combine the output of the two reports--as the program code in this article
illustrates.

NOTE: The COPY FILE command used at the end of this program may not work under
Windows NT. This is another issue being researched at this time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are some cases where extra characters may be printed at the top of the two
pages, but adjustments can be made to the code to prevent this. Specifically,
you need to change the adjustment on the lines using the FSEEK() function so
that the file pointer is moved by fewer characters.

Please note the assumptions that this code makes:

- You have a printer connected to a local printer port (LPT1 for this code to
  work without modification), or you have captured a network printer to LPT1.

- You have only two reports to be printed together, and they print one page
  each.

One additional note is that this program creates several files as temporary files
in the default directory. Please take note of the names of the files so as not
to overwrite any files you may already have (since SAFETY is turned OFF). These
temporary files are not deleted, but could be with only a few additional lines
of code.
