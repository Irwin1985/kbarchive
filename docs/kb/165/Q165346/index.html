SYMPTOMS
========

Server Side Includes (SSI) can pose a security threat to any web server. If
executable SSI are enabled on a server that contains a FrontPage feedback form,
the security threat will be increased. This security threat occurs under
specific conditions as described in the "More Information" section of this
article.

CAUSE
=====

The FrontPage Server Extensions enable you to write HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) from a Web browser into a form and have it accurately evaluated by the
Web server.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft strongly recommends that you disable executable SSI on any server on
which you have installed the FrontPage Server Extensions.

If your server must retain support for executable SSI, install the updated
version of the FrontPage Server Extensions. You can download the updated
FrontPage Server Extensions from the following Microsoft web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/wpp/exts.htm

The updated FrontPage Server Extensions will not allow HTML tags in any feedback
form. Instead, the FrontPage Server Extensions will convert the HTML tags into
the corresponding character entities that represent the code. For example, the
less than sign (&lt;) will be converted to &amp;lt; and the greater than sign
(&gt;) will be converted to &amp;gt;. This allows you to enter the HTML code
into the feedback form. When you browse the form, the code will appear exactly
as you typed it when you filled out the feedback form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft FrontPage Server
Extensions version 2.0.2.1112. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
Server Extensions version 2.0.3.209.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Any web site that uses the FrontPage Server Extensions and where the results
from a WebBot Discussion component, WebBot Confirmation component, or WebBot
Save Results component are saved to a public HTML page, such as a guest book,
can be compromised by server-side executable commands entered into a feedback
form.

On Web servers that support SSI, the include capabilities are disabled by
default. They can be activated by the administrator of the Web server. If they
are enabled, the server only parses files with a mime type of either
text/x-server-parsed-html or text/x-server-parsed-html3. Neither of these mime
types exists in most standard mime types. Therefore, by default, no files are
parsed for server-side includes even if SSI is enabled. If the administrator of
the Web server enables SSI, SSI can still be configured to turn off #exec
includes by modifying the configuration files for the Web server.

If the Feedback Form is altered to create a file with the proper SSI extension,
and if the server is configured to allow executable server- side includes then
the new content can execute arbitrary programs on the server.

The revised version of the FrontPage Server Extensions will still convert valid
URLs into hyperlinks.
