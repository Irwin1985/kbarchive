IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

In some cases you may need to view or delete messages in the Exchange Server
Internet Mail Service (in Exchange Server version 4.0 the Internet Mail
Connector [IMC]) or the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail queues
that are located in the message store. This article explains how to view
messages in the queues and how to delete mail from them by using the Microsoft
Exchange MDB Viewer utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view or delete messages in the MTS-IN and MTS-OUT queues:

1. Log on using the service account to the server that is running the IMC,
  Internet Mail Service (IMS) or the Connector for cc:Mail.

2. Run the Profinst program to create a profile with a unique name (for example,
  IMC, IMS or ccmc):

  The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
  Center:

  DownloadDownload Profinst.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/exch50/Utility/1/NT4/EN-US/Profinst.exe)

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

  Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
  virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
  posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
  changes to the file.

  The Profinst program can also be obtained from the BackOffice Software
  Development Kit (SDK) version 2.0 or later. The following are the parameters
  for running this utility.

  NOTE: Enter "GATEWAY" (without the quotation marks) for the /Type= parameter.

  

     MAPI Profile Installation sample.

     USAGE: PROFINST [Flags]

       Required Flags
       /SERVICE=    Service name (MSExchangeIMC or MSExchangeCCMC)
       /NAME=    Profile name
       /TYPE=    Profile type (GATEWAY or AGENT)

       Optional Flags
       /DELETE   Delete profile
       /HELP or /?  Display help
 

  After you run the Profinst program you have a Messaging Application
  Programming Interface (MAPI) profile that can be used by any MAPI client. The
  MDB Viewer utility is a MAPI client that gives you full access to the MTS-IN
  and MTS-OUT folders. The executable file is called Mdbvu32.exe, and is
  located on both the Standard and Enterprise edition of Exchange Server in the
  Support\Utils\I386 folder. The utility can be run directly from the CD-ROM.
  The following steps outline the procedure to use MDB Viewer to view messages
  in the MTS-IN and MTS-OUT queues and to delete a message.

3. Start MDB View, click MAPI_Explicit_PROFILE, and then click OK.

  NOTE: If the option to select a profile is not available when you start MDB
  View, quit and restart Windows NT Server. Then start MDB View again and the
  profile option should be available.

4. Click the name of the profile that you created in step 2. On the MDB menu,
  click Open Message Store. In the Store Display Name pane, click either
  Internet Mail Connector (&lt;server&gt;) or Connector for cc:Mail
  (&lt;server&gt;), and then click Open.

  NOTE: The first time that you perform this procedure on a server, Internet
  Mail Connector (&lt;server&gt;) is not displayed. Instead, Private Folders is
  displayed. Both of these names refer to the same thing. Click Private
  Folders, and then click Open, and continue to perform the following steps.

  When you are finished, close the session, and then open another session the
  same way. During the second session and during subsequent sessions, because
  you have already opened Private Folders, Internet Mail Connector
  (&lt;server&gt;) is displayed.

5. On the MDB menu, click Open Root Folder. The MTS-IN and MTS-OUT folders are
  displayed in the Child Folders window. Click either the MTS-OUT Child Folder
  pane or MTS- IN Child Folder pane, and in the Messages in Folder pane, any
  messages that exist in that queue are displayed.

6. To delete a message, in the Message In Folder pane, click the message that
  you want to delete. In the Operations Available dialog box, click
  "lpFLD-&gt;DeleteMessages()". Click Call Function, and then click OK to
  confirm the deletion. The message is deleted.

If you are unable to obtain the Profinst.exe program, you can perform the
following steps to create the MAPI profile by using a registry entry.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Log on to the server that is running the IMC as the service account. Start
  the Regedt32.exe program and locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ Windows
  Messaging Subsystem\Profiles

2. A profile called "MSExchangeIMC xxxxxxxxxx" is displayed. Click the profile
  name key, and on the Registry menu, click Save Key to save the profile to
  your hard disk drive. In Exchange Server 5.0 there are multiple
  "MSExchangeIMC xxxxxxxxxx" entries. You may select any of the entries.

3. Under Profiles, add a key and name it something descriptive, such as "IMC
  Profile." Click the profile key that you just created, click Registry
  Restore, and then click the file that you created in step 2.
