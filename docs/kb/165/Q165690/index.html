MORE INFORMATION
================

Feature Only in Enterprise Edition The Microsoft Transaction Server is supported
only in Visual C++ Enterprise Editions.

Read Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) Readme
----------------------------------------------

After installing Microsoft Transaction Server, please consult the Microsoft
Transaction Server readme file, located in the docs subdirectory of the
Microsoft Transaction Server installation. The file contains information
required to install, configure and run program components. The readme also
contains descriptions of several useful samples and includes a list of known
problems.

MTS Doesn't Install on Windows 95
---------------------------------

The Beta version of Microsoft Transaction Server does not run on Windows 95. If
you attempt to install it, you will get a message box stating that 'the setup
did not complete.' No files or registry keys are affected.

Disable Transaction Time-Out While Debugging
--------------------------------------------

Microsoft Transaction Server uses a time-out mechanism to keep components from
deadlocking the system. If the transaction time-out is enabled while you are
debugging the component, the transaction context may be destroyed, causing a
protection fault. To avoid this, you can disable this time-out from the
Microsoft Transaction Server Explorer. Select the My Computer icon and select
its properties. Under the Options tab on the Properties dialog box, you will see
a transaction time out section. To disable the timeout, set the timeout to 0.

Run Transaction Explorer Before Running Components
--------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Transaction Server components are inproc COM servers. Most inproc COM
servers require that you run a utility called REGSVR32.exe. The utility places
important information about the server into the systems registry. The default
build step for MFC and ATL COM servers is to run REGSVR32.exe before completing
the build.

Microsoft Transaction Server components are different as they need special
registry keys in order to execute. This means that you should run the Microsoft
Transaction Server Explorer and install or import the component before executing
it. Running REGSVR32.exe after installing or importing the component will change
some of the registry keys and will prevent your component from running properly.
There are two ways to get around this:

1. If you created your component with MFC, ATL 1.0, or ATL 1.1 and contains the
  REGSVR32.exe custom build step, you should refresh the component within the
  Microsoft Transaction Server Explorer after every build. You can tell if
  REGSVR32.exe is being run as you will see the message 'Registering OLE
  Server...' in the IDE output window. The registration process is defined in a
  custom build rule. If you go into the build settings for the component and
  look at its custom build rules you will see the registration step. You can
  choose to remove the registration custom build rule for the component.

2. If you created the component with the Visual C++ 5.0 ATL Object Wizard and
  selected the 'Microsoft Transaction Server object', you only have to install
  the component with the Microsoft Transaction Server Explorer before
  executing. The REGSVR32.exe custom build rule has been removed with this
  option. You should still refresh the component in the Microsoft Transaction
  Server Explorer whenever you change any COM interfaces you support.

No Proxy/Stubs with Dual Interfaces
-----------------------------------

The Microsoft Transaction Server Beta software is not capable of inheriting
interfaces. The usual example of this is dual interfaces. Dual interfaces
inherit from the IDispatch interface. If you create a Microsoft Transaction
Server component that uses dual interfaces, you must use type libraries to
contain the interface information. If you build a proxy/stub marshaling .dll for
your dual interface component, you will get errors from Microsoft Transaction
Server. See the Microsoft Transaction Server Readme for more information.

SQL Debugging with Visual C++ 5.0 and Microsoft Transaction Server
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can perform SQL debugging through Microsoft Transaction Server Components. In
this case, the component usually calls a stored procedure via ODBC or any other
data-access methodology. The component needs to be running locally on the
debugging machine as an inproc server. If the component is running remotely on a
different machine or as a local server, you will be unable to engage the SQL
debugging components. You will also not be able to perform SQL debugging if the
transaction started on a different machine as part of the DTC functionality from
SQL Server/Microsoft Transaction Server.

To do SQL debugging, follow these steps:

1. Load the client .EXE as the active project workspace in Visual C++ 5.0. This
  is the client application that you've created.

2. Use the Project/Build Settings dialog box to add your inproc server DLL as an
  additional DLL.

3. Set a breakpoint in each stored procedure that you wish to debug.

4. Start debugging.

You should hit the breakpoints in your stored procedures and should be able to
debug them normally. If you have problems, ensure that you can debug the stored
procedure directly (i.e. select debug stored procedure instead of running it
through the component). Also, make sure that Microsoft Transaction Server is
functioning properly. See the Microsoft Transaction Server README for further
installation steps.

ATL Object Wizard Generates Extra Release for Microsoft Transaction Server
Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you select the icon of the MS Transaction Server Component from the right pane
of the ATL Object Wizard, and choose to support IObjectControl and pooling from
the resulting ATL Object Wizard Properties dialog, the wizard will generate code
that performs an extra interface release. This extra release is detected and
ignored by Microsoft Transaction Server 1.0 and will not cause your object to
fault. Microsoft Transaction Server will log the following message in your event
log indicating that it has detected the extra Release:

An object released more references to its object context than it had acquired.
The extra release is ignored.

You can change the generated code to avoid this problem all together. In the
Deactivate method within the generated object, look for code similar to the
following:

     void CYourClass::Deactivate()
     {
         m_spObjectContext-&gt;Release();
     }

     Replace it with the correct code below, which will release the
     IObjectContext interface.

     void CYourClass::Deactivate()
     {
         m_spObjectContext.Release();
     }
