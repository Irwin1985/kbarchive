SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Avery Wizard, the setup program stops responding, or you
receive the following error message:

you receive the following message:

  WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in unknown at 0000:6510165b.

CAUSE

Word before Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications can complete the operation
and close.

This behavior occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

- Microsoft Office 97 is installed.

  -and-

- Microsoft Word 97 and the Office Assistant components are installed.

  -and-

- Microsoft Word 97 has never been started.

RESOLUTION
==========

these error messages. To prevent these error messages from appearing during the
installation of the Avery Wizard, install version 2.0 or later.

STATUS
======

This behavior occurs when you install versions of the Avery Wizard earlier than
version 2.0. This behavior was corrected in version 2.0 and later of the Avery
Wizard.
