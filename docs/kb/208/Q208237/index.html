SUMMARY
=======

Event ID 5711 (Successful partial domain synchronization) is an informational
event, you generally see on the PDC. This event indicates that a successful
synchronization event has occured with a BDC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you observe these event IDs on the PDC, it is not an issue unless
synchronization is happening too often. There are several causes for a large
numbers of Event ID 5711's recorded in the event log of the PDC, and this could
indicate an issue. This article is designed to help determine the cause of the
large number of events.

1. Check to see if any built-in accounts have been modified. For example:

   - The administrator for the domain has been removed from the Administrators
     group on the domain controller.
   - The Administrator's account is made a non-Administrator account.
   - The Administrator's account is disabled using the "Disable account" check
     box.
   - The Administrator's account is configured to expire.
   - The Domain Admins global group is removed from the Administrators local
     group.
   - The administrator is removed from the Domain Admins global group.

  to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q161569 Event ID 5711 Fills Event Log on Primary Domain Controller

2. Check for an account lockout. Account lockout can cause immediate
  synchronization and a large number of event ID 5711 messages. You can detect
  account lockouts using the following tools:

   - Checked version of Netlogon.dll
   - Event Viewer
   - Network Monitor
   - User Manager for Domains

  For additional information about account lockouts, click the article number
  below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191828 Account Lockouts and 5711 Events on the PDC

3. Install the checked version of Netlogon.dll. If you use the correct debug
  flag configuration (0x29b6ffff), you can observe what gets written to the
  Changelog file. You can use the log file to help determine the cause of the
  large number of 5711 events.
  For additional information about account lockouts, click the article number
  below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q189541 Using the Checked Netlogon.dll to Track Account Lockouts

4. You can also install the debug version of Netlogon and run some tests to
  balance processor utilization and network utilization for database
  synchronization. Using the correct debug flag configuration (0x29b6ffff), you
  can observe what gets written to the Changelog and measure the start and end
  times for SAM database synchronization.

  For testing purposes generate 1, 10, 50, 100, or 500 changes then measure
  [(End time - Start time) / # of changes] to understand the number of changes
  that can be replicated.

There are a few domain tuning issues that can have an effect on the number of
5711 events. For additional information, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q238191 Partial Replication May Take a Long Time with Very Large Groups

If you install the Service Pack 4 version of the Netlogon.dll file, the secure
channels for BDCs are not dropped when there are more than 250 machine accounts.
For additional information, click the article number below to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q154398 BDC Secure Channel May Fail if More Than 250 Computer Accounts

You can install Service Pack 4, which installs a new version of the Samsrv.dll
file on the PDC to avoid immediate SAM syncronization for machine account
password changes. For additional information, click the article number below to

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q175468 Effects of Machine Account Replication on a Domain

If you are running Service Pack 4, investigate disabling or increasing the
machine account password change policy. There are three ways to resolve machine
account replications.

- Add the following registry parameter on all Windows NT workstations:

  Key     = HLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters
  Value   = DisablePasswordChange REG_DWORD 1
  Default = 0

  NOTE: This registry key prevents you from changing passwords on workstations.
  You could add this registry value after having joined the domain and
  restarted the computer, so that the computer account password would have at
  least been changed once with a random value only known by the computer.
- Refuse passwords changed at domain controllers levels. On all domain
  controllers, add the following registry value:

  Key     = HLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters
  Value   = RefusePasswordChange REG_DWORD 1
  Default = 0

  Q154501 How to Disable Automatic Machine Account Password Changes

- A new parameter has been added as a hotfix in order to change the frequency
  at which workstations change secure channel password. You can add it to all
  workstations and also on all BDCs. (This hotfix is the Service Pack 4 version
  of the Samsrv.dll file.)

  Key     = HLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters
  Value   = MaximumPasswordAge REG_DWORD
  Default = 7
  Range   = 1 to 1,000,000 (in days)
