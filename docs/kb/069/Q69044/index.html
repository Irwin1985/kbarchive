In the repackaged release of Microsoft QuickBASIC version 4.50, the
"System Requirements" section on the back cover of the manual
incorrectly states that a system with "One 3 1/2" disk drive" is
supported.

The repackaged release of QuickBASIC 4.50 actually requires two disk
drives (for 3.5-inch disks or double-sided 5.25-inch disks).

In the repackaged release of Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.50, the "System
Requirements" are presently listed as follows:

   System Requirements
   * 384 available user memory
   * MS-DOS or PC-DOS operating system version 2.1 or higher
   * One 3 1/2" disk drive or two double-sided 5 1/4" disk drives

The first two system requirements are correct, but the third
pertaining to floppy drive requirements should be changed to read as
follows:

   * Two disk drives (for double-sided disks)

Although some customers have claimed to be able to run QuickBASIC from
one 3.5-inch floppy drive, they still had to use a system with two
floppy drives to run the QuickBASIC SETUP.EXE utility.

The QuickBASIC SETUP utility was not designed to be run using only one
floppy drive. SETUP will not allow you to do this, even if you
redirect drives through DOS.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a documentation error in the
repackaged release of Microsoft QuickBASIC version 4.50 for MS-DOS.

Reference:

The repackaged release of QuickBASIC 4.50 has packed (compressed)
files on four 5.25-inch disks or two 3.5-inch disks, plus an
UNPACK.EXE program, and the two manuals are combined into one spine
and shipped without a box. The previous release had normal (nonpacked)
files on five 5.25-inch disks and three 3.5-inch disks, and shipped
with two manuals. The previous release was packaged inside a box.
