-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Professional Advisor Library version 1.0 includes a sample program
(MHTEST.EXE) that demonstrates basic use of the help system API. However, this
program example was written for OS/2 and there is no MS-DOS example included in
the package. The sample code provided below demonstrates how to use the help
system functions under MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MHTEST.EXE example is built from two source files, HTEST.C and HELPBACK.C.
HTEST.C is a sample front-end application that interfaces with the library
functions. HELPBACK.C is a sample set of call-back functions, which the library
functions require you to have in your code. Both of these files are written for
OS/2 (utilizing OS/2 API calls) and will not compile and link explicitly for
MS-DOS; however, the program will run under either MS-DOS or OS/2 if it is
compiled and linked for OS/2 and then bound for MS-DOS.

If an unbound, MS-DOS-only version of the program is desired, the sample code
below illustrates how to write MS-DOS-specific versions of the seven call-back
functions needed by the library. The nature of these call-back functions is best
described in the following paragraph from the article "Adding Hypertext-Based
Help to Your Application Using the Microsoft Help System" from the "Microsoft
Systems Journal," May 1990:

  If you are developing an MS-DOS application, you must provide some call-back
  functions. These call-back functions are involved with opening and closing
  files, reading data from a file, allocating and deallocating memory, and
  locking and unlocking memory. The help library imposes this burden upon the
  programmer because of the limited resources available under MS-DOS. If the
  help engine were to use the standard malloc or _dos_allocmem functions to
  obtain memory for itself, it would probably find itself running out of memory
  if it were embedded into a large program, or possibly conflicting with the
  program's own memory management scheme. For example, many large programs
  manage their memory using a virtual memory management scheme. By forcing the
  application to provide call-back functions to control memory allocation, the
  help engine never intrudes on the application's own memory management scheme.

It is important to note that the sample routines provided below are only simple
templates for the type of functions needed; they do not include any error
checking or error-handling capabilities. The sample routines are written for use
with the large and compact memory models and will require some minor
modifications to avoid compiler warnings under the small or medium models.
