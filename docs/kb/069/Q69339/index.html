The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on the following known usage problems with
Microsoft Windows, PC Tools, and the Microsoft Mouse driver:

- Mouse problems with PC Tools version 7.0

- Mouse problems with PC Tools version 6.0

PC Tools is manufactured by Central Point Software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MOUSE PROBLEMS WITH PC TOOLS VERSION 7.0
----------------------------------------

PC Tools version 7.0 may not work correctly with Microsoft Mouse driver versions
7.0, 7.03, and 7.04. Central Point product support technicians have noted
various problems when using these two driver versions and recommend updating to
Microsoft Mouse driver version 8.0 or later.

The 7.04 driver (with the "/Y" switch) works in most instances, although you may
encounter some problems with certain system configurations.

Central Point product support reports no known problems with the 6.24b driver and
PC Tools.

The reported problems may result because some portions of PC Tools conflict with
the increased file size of the 7.0 and 7.03 drivers. Changing to the earlier
mouse driver, 6.24b, may free 10 to 15K of additional memory in the contested
address space of RAM.

MOUSE PROBLEMS WITH PC TOOLS VERSION 7.0
----------------------------------------

PC Tools version 6.0 may have problems running with a Microsoft mouse during or
after a Windows session. To correct this problem, you can do one of the
following:

- Add the "/M:PS2" parameter to HIMEM.SYS.

- Remove the"/Y" parameter from the mouse driver.

- Run FIXMOUSE.BAT and FIXWIN.BAT.

Each of these steps is described more fully in the following paragraphs.

Adding The "/M:PS2" Parameter
-----------------------------

Adding the "/M:PS2" parameter to the HIMEM.SYS reference line in the CONFIG.SYS
file may resolve this problem. For example, the reference to HIMEM.SYS in the
CONFIG.SYS file should read as follows:

       DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS /M:PS2

  -or-

       DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS /M:2

Removing the"/Y" Parameter from the Mouse Driver
------------------------------------------------

If your computer does not have a Video Seven graphics card, removing the "/Y"
parameter from the MOUSE.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file may also resolve this
problem. The "/Y" parameter on the mouse driver helps resolve problems (relating
to loss of mouse cursor control) with a Video Seven graphics card.

Run FIXMOUSE.BAT and FIXWIN.BAT
-------------------------------

Central Point Software has created FIXMOUSE.BAT and FIXWIN.BAT to correct the
problems. These batch files are available from Central Point Software customer
service or from the Central Point bulletin board service (BBS).

When you run an MS-DOS based application or exit Windows, the port designated for
the mouse is reset. Windows does a soft reset on the port that most MS-DOS-based
applications are able to use. Some of these applications, including PC Tools,
require a hard reset on the port to use the mouse. Central Point Software has
created FIXWIN.BAT and FIXMOUSE.BAT to provide a hard reset on the mouse port.

Running FIXWIN.BAT starts Windows. When you exit, it calls FIXMOUSE.BAT, which
does a hard reset and sends a command string out to the mouse port.
