SUMMARY
=======

Application Compatibility Document for Windows 3.1
--------------------------------------------------

Due to the amount of information in this document, it has been broken into seven
pieces. To find all seven pieces of this document and the Windows 3.1
Compatibility Test checklist, query this knowledge base on the words:

  " prod(winsdk) and 31compattest " (without the quotation marks)

Enhanced-Mode Windows
---------------------

COMM DRIVER
-----------

Performance and functionality of the Windows version 3.1 COMM driver are improved
as follows:

- COMM.DRV provides its own interrupt handling in enhanced mode. In Windows
  version 3.0, the virtual communication device (VCD) provided the interrupt
  routine so that interrupts for Windows applications could be handled at ring
  0. In Windows version 3.1, a new function allows COMM.DRV to register its own
  ring-0 handler, ensuring that all communications code exists in COMM.DRV. The
  VCD can still support COMM drivers that are compatible with Windows version
  3.0 by adding the SYSTEM.INI switch "COMMDRV30=TRUE" in the [386ENH] section.

- Both COMM.DRV and VCD read the COMxBASE and COMxIRQ settings in the
  SYSTEM.INI file to determine the base addresses and IRQs for COM3 and COM4;
  reading values written into the BIOS data area is no longer required.
  Although for compatibility these settings are in the [386ENH] section,
  COMM.DRV also examines them when running in standard mode.

- COMM.DRV supports the FIFO on 16550A UARTs. By default, COMM.DRV enables the
  FIFO if the FIFO is available, but the user can disable the FIFO by using the
  COMxFIFO setting in the [386ENH] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

- COMM.DRV baud rate is limited only by machine capability, so communication
  applications need not limit baud rates to 19200. Some users do have hardware
  capable of faster rates, and they don't like being stuck with an artificial
  limit.

Potential Problem
-----------------

Changes to COMM.DRV could affect any application that uses the communications
driver.

Test
----

You can test most changes to COMM.DRV by sending and receiving data in your
application at various baud rates.

VIRTUAL PRINTER DEVICE
----------------------

The standard setup no longer includes the virtual printer device (VPD). In
Windows version 3.0, the VPD detects contention between multiple VMs attempting
to access the same LPT port. To detect contention, VPD traps I/O for LPT ports,
which creates too much overhead for devices that use LPT ports, such as network
adapters, SCSI adapters, and external hard disks. Windows version 3.1 eliminates
the overhead by not installing the VPD.

Potential Problem
-----------------

Although changes to the virtual printer device installation should not affect
applications, Windows version 3.1 cannot detect the rare case of two
applications attempting to print through the same port at the same time.

VIRTUAL DMA DEVICE
------------------

In Windows version 3.1, VDMAD supports auto-initialize DMA as long as the region
being used can be locked and does not have alignment problems. This means that
TSRs and device drivers can use auto- initialize DMA with global memory. VDMAD
also deals with DMA globally rather than through VM. This means that most global
users (network, disk, and so on) no longer need a separate virtual device to
coordinate their DMA activity when they set up DMA transfers using hardware
interrupts. Finally, all problems in the virtual DMA services implementation
have been corrected; relying on private versions of VDMAD is no longer
necessary.

Potential Problem
-----------------

Changes to the VDMAD may affect applications that include their own version of
VDMAD.

Test
----

If your application has a custom VDMAD, thoroughly test the application with the
new VDMAD. Also, be sure that your installation program does not overwrite the
device=*VDMAD setting in the SYSTEM.INI file.

VIRTUAL TIMER DEVICE
--------------------

In Windows version 3.1, the virtual timer device (VTD) does not trap the I/O
ports used for accessing the system timer chip. This allows more MS-DOS software
to run better in VMs because I/O trapping adds significant overhead. The VTD
keeps timing in sync by watching other activity, for example, by counting
hardware interrupts that are not passed to the BIOS. Thus, the VTD does not
prevent applications from reprogramming the timer to different rates. The
TrapTimerPorts setting was added to the SYSTEM.INI file to revert to Windows
version 3.0 compatible behavior if problems do occur because of this change.

Potential Problem
-----------------

Changes to the virtual timer device may affect applications that are not based on
Windows.

Test
----

Start several other MS-DOS-based applications, and then start your MS-DOS- based
application and check for timer problems. If problems arise, set the SYSTEM.INI
setting TrapTimerPorts and try the tests again.

VIRTUAL DISPLAY DEVICE
----------------------

In Windows version 3.1, the standard virtual display device (VDD) for VGA is
modified to demand page video memory. Thus, you can run graphical MS-DOS-based
applications in a window or in the background on VGA systems. This VDD must
track video memory usage, so it is not compatible with any of the super VGA
display drivers that must access more than 256 kilobytes (K) of video memory. To
run these display drivers, a user must use either the VDD provided by the
display adapter manufacturer or the VDDVGA30.386, which is included with Windows
version 3.1. Demand paging of video memory may break TSRs that worked with
Windows version 3.0. The difference is that the VDD virtualizes access to video
memory; in Windows version 3.0, the display driver had full reign over memory.

Potential Problem
-----------------

Changes to the video device driver may affect applications that work directly
with video memory and TSRs.

Test
----

Start your application or TSR in one or more virtual machines, and then switch
between virtual machines, watching for problems with the display.

FASTDISK (WDCTL)
----------------

FastDisk allows specific virtual devices (currently WDCTL) to access secondary
storage devices directly. WDCTL supports Western Digital and compatible
controllers. This device speeds up disk activity and allows demand paging of
running VMs.

Test
----

FastDisk should not affect any applications. Be sure you are running it while
testing your application.
