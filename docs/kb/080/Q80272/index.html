The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1b, 2.1c, 2.1d, 2.1e, 3.0, 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If the -Q2z parameter is added on the External.exe command line, additional
information that is useful when troubleshooting modem problems will be listed.

When External.exe is invoked as follows

  external -q2z

information that is sent or received from the modem will appear on the screen.
This can help isolate the cause of errors and attribute them to one of the
following:

- Flow control

- Bad cabling

- Bad phone lines

- Slow network

The Diagnostics categories are Bad STX, Bad Type, Bad Seq, Bad CRC1, Bad CRC2,
Timeouts, and Rejects, and are described below.

Bad STX
-------

This error diagnostic occurs if the protocol is looking for a "2" to indicate the
start of a message block. The protocol scans the input stream until it finds a
"2". Occurrences of this error diagnostic do not indicate severe problems. For
example, this problem could be caused by a bad CRC1 occurring, forcing the
protocol to scan all subsequent packet data bytes for a valid packet header that
is looking for a "2", followed by the proper packet type, sequence number, etc.

Bad Type
--------

This error diagnostic occurs if a packet type indicator was received that is not
recognized by the protocol. The only reason that this problem can currently
occur is because a "2" is found and assumed to be the start of a packet (STX),
when it is not.

Bad Seq
-------

This error diagnostic occurs when a packet is received out of sequence. All
packets in the protocol are assigned a sequence number and must be sent in the
proper order. If the previous packet was lost during the transmission, then the
subsequent packet will be interpreted as being out of sequence.

Bad CRC1 (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
----------------------------------

This error diagnostic indicates that the packet header was corrupt and rejected;
that is, characters were lost during the transmission, which can be caused by
line noise or some other problem.

Bad CRC2
--------

This error diagnostic is a secondary Cyclic Redundancy Check and also indicates
that the packet data was corrupt and rejected.

Timeouts
--------

This error diagnostic occurs when a packet was sent and an acknowledgment was not
received within the allotted time. The default allotted time is 60 seconds; this
default can be set by using the -Exxx parameter on the External or Remote
command line.

This error diagnostic occurs when slow response is encountered on the receiving
end or if the other end is dead. This problem can also occur when using
error-correcting modems (Microcom Networking Protocol [MNP]) and the modems are
taking an unusual amount of time to send valid data between each other. This is
not a severe problem, but it can cause External to abort the communication link
if many Timeouts occur.

Rejects
-------

All of the above error diagnostics will occur only on the receiving end of the
communications link. Whenever an error is detected on the receiving end, the
protocol sends a reject packet to the sender. The sender then keeps track of the
number of reject packets received. The reject count is an indication of the
number of failures (CRCs, etc.) encountered by the receiver.

Summary of Diagnostics
----------------------

In any session that has errors, the receiver will get a combination of Bad STXs,
Bad Types, Bad Seqs, Bad CRCs, and so on, but no Rejects. The sender will get
Rejects but none of the other diagnostics. In twoway communication sessions, the
diagnostic counts are cumulative.

Clients generally assume that when they have error-correcting modems (that is,
Microcom Networking Protocol [MNP] modems) they should not get any detected
errors. MNP modems do not detect errors that occur between the serial port and
the modem; they only detect errors that occur between modems.

The communication errors that are detected by our protocol occur between serial
ports and our External/Remote programs recover from them.
