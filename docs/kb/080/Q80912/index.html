-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Visual Basic Graph custom control cannot successfully print directly to a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) II series LaserJet. This is a compatibility issue between
the Graph custom control and the HP II series only. It is not a problem with
Visual Basic.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, add an additional form to the project, transfer the
graph's image to the form, and then print the form. This method bypasses the
DrawMode=5 (print) method and the incompatibility issue. The example in the More
Information section demonstrates how how to implement this workaround.

NOTE: Unless you know that your graph will never be printed on an HP II Series
LaserJet, you may wish to always use this print method.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Graph custom control supplied
with the products listed above. This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual Basic
version 3.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Basic Graph custom control version 1.2 allows you to send a graph
image directly to your printer by setting the graph's DrawMode property to 5
(print). However, the Graph control is incompatible with the HP II LaserJet
family. When using the DrawMode=5 (print) method to print to an HP II LaserJet,
only a portion of the graph will print.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the File menu, choose Add File, and select the GRAPH.VBX custom control
  file. The Graph tool will appear in the Toolbox.

3. Add another form (Form2).

4. Change the following properties for Form2:

  Property     Value
  ------------------

  ControlBox   False
  MaxButton    False
  MinButton    False
  Caption      False

5. On Form1, create a Graph control (Graph1) and a command button (Command1).
  Set the Caption property for Command1 to "Print."

6. Size and edit Graph1 so that it appears the way you want it to print.

7. Add the following code to the Command1_Click event:

     Sub Command1_Click ()

        'change to black/white for clearer printing
        Graph1.DrawStyle = 0
        'update change to black/white
        Graph1.DrawMode = 2

        Load Form2
        'size Form2 and transfer Graph1's image
        Form2.width = Graph1.width
        Form2.height = Graph1.height
        Form2.picture = Graph1.picture
        Form2.visible = 1   'optional

        Form2.PrintForm

        'return Graph1 to display in color (optional)
        Graph1.DrawStyle = 1
        'update display to color
        Graph1.DrawMode = 2

     End Sub

8. From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT R, S) and click the Print button.

Unless you specify otherwise, Graph1 will originally be displayed in color. Once
the Command1_Click event is triggered, the graph will convert to black and
white. If you exclude the optional line Form2.visible=1, a dialog box will
appear stating that Form2 is being printed. Graph1 will convert back to a color
display, and the program will end.

If you included the optional line Form2.visible=1, you will see Form2 appear and
resize with the black and white graph image as its picture. A dialog box will
appear stating that Form2 is being printed. Graph1 will convert back to a color
display and the program will end.
