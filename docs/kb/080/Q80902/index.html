SUMMARY
=======

Application Compatibility Document for Windows 3.1:

Due to the amount of information in this document, it has been broken into seven
pieces. To find all seven pieces of this document and the Windows 3.1
Compatibility Test checklist, query this knowledge base on the words:

  prod(winsdk) and 31compattest

 Printing
--------

Most of the printing changes can be tested by printing documents from your
application with Windows versions 3.0a and 3.1 and comparing the output. Try to
print documents that represent the types of images your application is capable
of printing. You must test with the printers listed below; you should try
others.

- Postscript

- LaserJet II

- LaserJet III

- Dot matrix

RENAMED PRINTERS:

The printer names have been renamed, and your application could have problems
with an upgrade if your application or documents refer to a specific printer.
For example, if your application explicitly looks for the printer name "PCL/HP
LaserJet," it will no longer find this name. Note that renaming the printer does
not affect soft fonts.

Test:

Bring a document created with your Windows version 3.0a application to Windows
versions 3.1 and print it. Be sure there are no error messages and that it
prints correctly.

POSTSCRIPT DRIVER:

The GETEXTENTABLE escape has been removed.

Test:

Check your application code for this escape.

UNIVERSAL PRINTER DRIVER:

In Windows version 3.1, with the exception of PostScript and a few other printer
drivers, most printer drivers are based on Universal Printer Driver technology.
This technology provides uniform support and behavior for drivers in areas such
as font mapping, color mapping, escapes, and ExtDeviceMode and
DeviceCapabilities functions. It also makes DIB support available for dot matrix
printers.

Applications can now rely on the values that the DeviceCapabilities function
returns to design their print dialog.

PCL 4 DRIVER:

The PCL Driver changed in the following ways:

- Default resolution is 300 DPI for Windows version 3.1. In Windows version
  3.0, it was 75 DPI.

- The driver no longer requires a separate text band when printing at 300 DPI
  if there is enough free memory for a full-page band.

- The driver clips text vertically using the following formula:

  if (y + lpFont-&gt;dfInternalLeading &lt; rcClip.top
         || y &gt;= rcClip.bottom)
     return 0;

- The driver automatically tracks memory. If you encounter an out-of- memory
  error, be sure you set memory configuration correctly. If the memory
  configuration is correct but the document still generates out-of-memory
  errors (even though it prints under Windows version 3.0), please send an
  electronic copy of the document when you return the checklist.

- The following escapes are removed:

    EXT_DEVICE_CAPS
    EXTTEXTOUT
    FLUSHOUTPUT
    GETEXTENTABLE
    GETFACENAME
    GETSETPAPERORIENT (New ResetDC function provides
                       the same functionality)
    GETTECHNOLOGY
    SETALLJUSTVALUES

- The following escapes still exist for compatibility, but we recommend that
  you get the same information by using the DeviceCapabilities function:

  Escape                     Replacement
  ------                     -----------

  ENUMPAPERBINS              Use DeviceCapabilities DC_BINNAMES.
  ENUMPAPERMETRICS           Use DeviceCapabilities DC_PAPERS,
                             DC_PAPERSIZE, DC_PAPERNAMES.

- Printer settings are now saved in the WIN.INI file under the [device,port]
  section instead of under the [driver,port] section. For example, the WIN.INI
  file may now contain a [HP LaserJet IIP,LPT1] setting instead of
  [HPPCL,LPT1]. This implies that more than one printer within a driver can be
  connected to the same port at the same time while each retains its own
  settings.

- A new [PrinterAliases] section in WIN.INI supports custom printer names.

- The installation of HP/PCL soft fonts and external cartridges doesn't change
  -- the information is still saved under the [driver,port] section. Thus, if
  you install a soft font on LPT1, all HP laser printers connected to LPT1: see
  this soft font.

- In Windows version 3.0, the HPPCL.DRV has GDI simulate a bold typeface for a
  device font if a bold version is not available; the Windows version 3.1
  driver does not.

Applications that rely on the Windows version 3.0 driver always to enumerate the
first full-page text band and subsequent graphics bands should remove this
dependency. The Windows version 3.1 driver can put text into graphics bands and
can put graphics into the first band.

OTHER DOT-MATRIX PRINTER DRIVERS:

Dot-matrix drivers changed as follows:

- Printable regions increased on many dot-matrix drivers.

- Color support added for Fujitsu and NEC drivers

- Some resolutions changed on some drivers. Removed "odd" aspect ratios and put
  in closer to one aspect ratios. For example, NEC24.DRV changed 60 x 180 to
  120 x 180.

- Because of black-and-white printer driver dependency on the screen, some
  changes may be the result of screen driver changes.

Applications should test for color DIB printing using a color driver.

                      Other Core Enhancements
-----------------------

Most core enhancements affect applications only if they make assumptions about
internal structures or internal operations. Most of the testing for this section
involves looking at the changes and reviewing the code for your application.
Below is a list of the things you need to look for.

- An application making assumptions about internal data structures.

- An application building its own selectors.

- Press CTRL+ALT+DEL while your application is running. Be sure windows
  continues to function after your application terminates.

There are the following changes:

- Structure of kernel internal memory objects has changed. Applications that
  made assumptions regarding these internal structures will most likely be
  broken. TOOLHELP.DLL has been added to Windows version 3.1, which provides a
  documented interface for accessing internal data.

- Kernel now runs at ring 3 (instead of ring 1 as in Windows version 3.0) to
  prevent ill-behaved applications from relying on the relationship between
  handles and selectors. This does not affect the IOPL (input/output privilege
  level) of applications and drivers.

- GP-fault cleanup. If one application GP faults, Windows cleans up its
  internal state and allows the system to continue running after terminating
  that application.

- Local CTRL+ALT+DEL. Users can kill a single Windows-based application or a
  single VM by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. The rest of the system should continue
  running.

- Dr. Watson and continue button. Dr. Watson is included but not installed by
  default. If the user installs Dr. Watson, this application reports and logs
  data on application error. For some GP faults, Dr. Watson gives the user the
  option to continue running the application, resetting the IP to the
  instruction following the GP fault. Pressing the continue button bypasses GP
  faults until the next task switch.

- Real mode is removed.

- We correctly reflect floating-point exceptions to virtual mode, allowing
  applications that use their own floating-point packages to work correctly.
  Kernel correctly saves and restores the state of floating-point interrupt
  functions, allowing WIN87EM.DLL to coexist with other floating-point
  emulators.

- UMB mechanisms defined for XMS are supported, allowing software such as
  EMM386, 386MAX, and QEMM to load networks and other devices in HIMEM. Windows
  is fully backward compatible with versions 5.x and 6.x of QEMM and 386MAX.

  SMARTDrive 4
------------

Windows version 3.1 includes a new high performance disk cache. Applications
should test with this disk cache enabled (Setup enables this by default) to
ensure that no side effects occur.

Tests:

1. Read files from disk.

2. Write files to disk.

3. If your application uses the floppy drive or can read and write files to the
  floppy drive, try those operations with caching enabled on the floppy.
