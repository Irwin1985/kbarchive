-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You start the Windows version 3.1 File Manager, but it doesn't appear on the
screen. Selecting File Manager from your Task Lisk has no effect.

CAUSE
=====

There may be a problem with the settings in the WINFILE.INI file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To make File Manager visible, do the following:

1. Minimize all applications currently running, including Program Manager.

2. Start Task Manager by double-clicking on the wallpaper, or using CTRL+ESC.

3. Select File Manager from the Task List, and select Tile. File Manager will
  now be visible.

4. From the Options menu in File Manager, make sure Save Settings On Exit is
  chosen. This will prevent the problem from occurring again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is caused by an invalid entry in WINFILE.INI. WINFILE.INI can be
found in the WINDOWS directory and can be edited with Notepad. Near the top of
the file there will be a Window= line in the [Settings] section. For example:

     [Settings]
     Window=0,0,800,600, , ,1

     First Number: X offset of upper left hand corner
     Second Number: Y offset of upper left hand corner
     Third Number: Width of window
     Fourth Number: Height of window

If the first number is negative, and its absolute value is greater than the third
number, or if the second number is negative, and its absolute value is greater
than the fourth number, the File Manager window will be off-screen and not
visible. This could happen if a virtual desktop utility is being used like the
Inner Media's Wide Angle, or shareware program BIGDESK.

EXAMPLE: If the following line is in the WINFILE.INI

       Window=-500,0,480,600, , ,1

File Manager starts up without an error, but is not visible. File Manager shows
up in the Task List, but selecting it does not make it appear.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in the Windows 3.0 File Manager, as it does not
use or recognize the "Window=" setting.
