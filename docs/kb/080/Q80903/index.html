Comments:

Window Management
-----------------

___Pass ___Fail Start your application in its default state. Maximize
               and minimize it, making sure it paints correctly after
               each operation.

___Pass ___Fail Move your application as far right and left as you can
               in small increments, watching for repaint problems
               each time you stop moving.

___Pass ___Fail Resize your application using the mouse to drag the
               border.

               application. Restore your application. Be sure it
               paints correctly.

___Pass ___Fail Start your application with another Windows
               application, such as one of the accessories. Bring the
               accessory to the foreground, covering your
               application. Switch back to your application. Be sure
               it painted correctly.

               to switch between applications, and be sure your
               application repaints correctly.

Comments:

TrueType
--------

___Pass ___Fail Examine your application code and be sure there are no
               dependencies on the font names Helv and Tms Rmn.

___Pass ___Fail Enable the "Show Only TrueType Fonts in Applications"
               option in Control Panel. Check the font dialogs in
               your application. They should list all TrueType fonts
               and no non-TrueType fonts.

___Pass ___Fail Check fonts in dialog boxes, tool bars, and sample

               files for your application. Be sure they are readable.

___Pass ___Fail Check the application code and be sure there are no
               dependencies on GetTextFace and EnumFonts matching.

___Pass ___Fail Create a document in your application that contains
               characters close to the edge of the screen and the
               printable margins. Scroll the document, checking for
               characters (or pieces of characters) left behind.

___Pass ___Fail Highlight text. Be sure the highlight encompasses all
               characters and that no part of any character
               (especially the first and last characters) is left
               out.

___Pass ___Fail Print the document. Be sure no characters are clipped
               at the edges of the printable region.

___Pass ___Fail Create a document under Windows version 3.0a using
               type-manager (such as ATM), bitmap, and device fonts.
               Look at the document under Windows version 3.1; be
               sure the screen appears the same.

___Pass ___Fail Print the document under Windows versions 3.0a and
               3.1; be sure the output appears the same.

___Pass ___Fail If your application assumed that scalable fonts could

               not print on nonscalable devices, such as a PCL
               printer, it will have problems in enumerating fonts.
               Check the font dialog box and sizes listed for TrueType
               fonts. The font dialog box should list many sizes for each
               TrueType font.

___Pass ___Fail TrueType fonts are shipped in regular, bold, italic,
               and bold italic. This can cause problems for
               applications that assumed styles were always
               simulated. Check the font dialog box to ensure that each
               font is listed only once.

___Pass ___Fail TrueType fonts appear for both printer and screen.
               This causes problems for applications that assume
               printer and screen fonts are always different. Select
               a nonraster printer (for example, PCL) and check the
               font dialog box to ensure that each font is listed only
               once.

___Pass ___Fail Create a document with a nonscalable printer
               installed, using two fonts, a device font, and a
               TrueType font. Both fonts must have the same name.
               Print the document.

___Pass ___Fail Use a TrueType font to create a document using the
               desktop publishing and international characters. Be
               sure the characters appear correctly on the screen.

___Pass ___Fail Change to a bitmap font, and then change back to a
               TrueType font. Be sure the characters still appear
               correctly.

___Pass ___Fail Print the document. Be sure the printout is correct.

___Pass ___Fail Using the Char Map application in the accessories
               group of Program Manager, use a TrueType font to copy
               the desktop publishing characters to the clipboard and
               paste them into your application. Be sure the
               characters appear correctly.

Comments:

Enhanced-Mode Windows
---------------------

___Pass ___Fail Check COMM.DRV by sending and receiving data in your
               application at various baud rates.

___Pass ___Fail Check the new VDMAD as a replacement for your custom
               VDMAD by thoroughly testing your application with the
               new VDMAD.

___Pass ___Fail Check your application's installation program to
               ensure that it does not overwrite the "device=*VDMAD"
               setting in the SYSTEM.INI file.

___Pass ___Fail Check the VTD by starting several other non-Windows
               applications and then starting your non-Windows
               application. Check for timer problems. If there are
               problems, set the SYSTEM.INI setting TrapTimerPorts
               and try the tests again.
___Pass ___Fail Check the VDD by starting your application or TSR in
               one or more virtual machines and then switch between
               virtual machines watching for problems with the
               display.

___Pass ___Fail Check Fastdisk by running it while testing your
               application.

Printing
--------

___Pass ___Fail Print using the PostScript driver.

___Pass ___Fail Print using the LaserJet II driver.

___Pass ___Fail Print using the LaserJet III driver.

___Pass ___Fail Print using the dot-matrix driver.

___Pass ___Fail Bring a document created under Windows version 3.0a
               with your application to version 3.1 and print it. Be
               sure there are no error messages and that it prints
               correctly.

___Pass ___Fail Check you application code for the GETTEXTENTTABLE
               escape.

------------

___Pass ___Fail Read files from disk.

___Pass ___Fail Write files to disk.

___Pass ___Fail If your application uses the floppy drive or can read
               and write files to the floppy drive, try those
               operations with caching enabled on the floppy.

Comments:

Local CTRL+ALT+DEL
------------------

___Pass ___Fail Press CTRL+ALT+DEL while your application is running.
               Be sure Windows continues to function after your
               application terminates.

Comments:

Checklist of Problem Areas Not Specific to Windows 3.1 Changes:

Following are some areas that you should check, but that were not changes for
Windows version 3.1. We have seen several applications with problems in these
areas.

Setup
-----

___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with SHARE enabled and not
               enabled. Be sure your setup program runs correctly in
               both cases.

___Pass ___Fail Install Windows version 3.1 over Windows version 3.0,
               but in a directory other than the one containing
               Windows version 3.0. Be sure your application runs
               under Windows version 3.1 without being reinstalled.

___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with a path that is at the
               maximum length. Be sure your setup program recognizes
               that it cannot add to the path.

___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with an AUTOEXEC.BAT file
               containing more than one path statement, or by calling
               batch files that set the path. Be sure your setup
               program recognizes the correct path statement to which
               to add information.

___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with a screen saver running.

___Pass ___Fail Install your application on a hardcard drive and on a
               compressed drive. Be sure the application installs and
               runs correctly.

___Pass ___Fail Install your application on a hard drive with a drive
               letter greater than E:. Be sure your application
               installs and runs correctly.

___Pass ___Fail If your application can be installed on a network,
               install it on as many networks as possible.

Comments:

General Operations
------------------

___Pass ___Fail Load a large file, and resize the application window
               so that scrolling is necessary horizontally and
               vertically. Scroll and ensure that repainting is
               correct.

___Pass ___Fail Exit Windows while your application is still running
               but has unsaved files. Be sure you are prompted to
               save the unsaved files before Windows exits.

___Pass ___Fail Run your application with SHARE enabled and not
               enabled. Be sure it runs correctly.

___Pass ___Fail If your application adds anything to AUTOEXEC.BAT that
               uses environment space, be sure the application works
               or dies gracefully if the machine is out of
               environment space.

___Pass ___Fail Have the default printer in the Control Panel

               different from the printer selected in your
               application, and print a document. Be sure your
               application prints correctly or that it warns the user
               of the condition.

___Pass ___Fail Create a directory using character ASCII 129

               (ALT+129). Using your application's File Open or File
               Save commands, change to this directory.
