-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) assembles code that depends on the
difference between the values of two labels (a span-dependent value), the
results of an assembly by MASM versions 6.0 or later differs from the results
produces by an earlier version of MASM.

Specifically, the difference occurs when the application uses a span- dependent
value in one of the following cases:

- In the expression for a preprocessor directive, like IF

- In the expression for a predefined macro, like REPEAT or WHILE

- In the arguments to a MACRO or TEXTEQU statement preceded by % (percent sign)

CAUSE
=====

MASM versions 5.1 and earlier are two-pass assemblers; MASM versions 6.0 and
later are N-pass assemblers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid using a span-dependent value in a preprocessor directive or in a
predefined macro. If the code requires a span-dependent value, create and review
a listing file to determine that each span-dependent value is evaluated as
desired.

Avoid using the % operator with span-dependent values. The assembler evaluates an
expression containing the % operator on the first pass. In many cases, the
assembler produces the desired results when you remove the % operator and delay
expression evaluation to a later pass.

STATUS
======

This behavior is under review and may or may not change in a future release.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MASM versions 5.1 and earlier are two-pass assemblers. The source file is read
twice to determine the size of the instructions and the location of labels.

MASM versions 6.0 and later are N-pass assemblers. The assembler scans the source
until it can determine the size of all instructions and the location of all
labels. However, an N-pass assembler must determine certain values on its first
pass through the application code. These values include expressions in
preprocessor directives, expressions in predefined macros, and arguments
preceded by the % operator. If one of these values is based on the difference
between the values of two labels, the results may differ from those generated by
MASM versions 5.1 and earlier.

The difference occurs because the assembler evaluates expressions and arguments
based on the undetermined label locations available during the first assembly
pass that may change in a subsequent assembly pass. Typically, the value changes
when a forward reference occurs between the two labels. Because the assembler
adds padding bytes for the forward reference and removes the padding in
subsequent assembly passes, the second label has a larger value during the first
assembly pass than in subsequent passes.

The code example below demonstrates this behavior. Specify the /Fl assembler
option switch to create a listing file. Review the listing file to see how the
assembler processes a span-dependent value.

The following information is part of the README.TXT file distributed with MASM
version 6.1:

  Span-Dependent Expressions used in Macros
  -----------------------------------------

  MASM 6.1 evaluates macro expressions only on the first pass of assembly,
  but code and data are reevaluated on subsequent passes. Because of this,
  macro expressions which depend on the span between two addresses may not
  evaluate correctly. For example, the following code will not evaluate
  correctly:

     Label1:
        JMP Label2
     Label2:
        REPEAT Label2 - Label1  ; Evaluates incorrectly
        INC AX
     ENDM

  View the listing file to determine if a questionable macro expression
  was evaluated as desired.

  Span-Dependent Text Equates
  ---------------------------

  The TEXTEQU operator is evaluated on the first assembly pass. If TEXTEQU
  is used with an expression that depends on the difference between two
  addresses, the resulting constant may be incorrect. For example, the
  following code will not evaluate correctly:

     Label1:
        JMP Label2
     Label2:
        WrongNum TEXTEQU %Label2-Label1 ; WrongNum will be incorrect

Sample Code
-----------

; Assemble options needed in MASM 6.x: /c /Fl

_text   SEGMENT para public 'CODE'
       ASSUME cs:_text
start:
       jmp SHORT forward
forward:
       mov ax, 4C00h
       int 21h
_text   ENDS

count = offset forward - offset start

IF count LT 6
  %OUT two-pass assembler   ; MASM 5.1 and earlier shows this message
ELSE
  %OUT n-pass assembler     ; MASM 6.0 and later shows this message
ENDIF

tst1    SEGMENT para public
index = 0
       WHILE index LT count
         DB 1          ; This will be repeated 10 times in MASM 6.x.
index = index + 1
       ENDM
tst1    ENDS

tst2    SEGMENT para public
       REPT count      ; This will be repeated 10 times in MASM 6.x,
         DB 1          ; twice in MASM 5.1.
       ENDM
tst2    ENDS

mac3    MACRO arg1
       macvar = arg1
       ENDM

tst3    SEGMENT para public
       mac3 %count     ; This will set macvar to 10 in MASM 6.x
tst3    ENDS            ; and to 2 in MASM 5.1.

txt4    TEXTEQU %count

tst4    SEGMENT para public
txtvar  DB txt4         ; This will set txtvar to 10 in MASM 6.x.
tst4    ENDS
