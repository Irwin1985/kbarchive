The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MSRMTUI.DLL that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the MSRMTUI.DLL file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your MSRMTUI.DLL file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains MSRMTUI.DLL, a replacement for the MSRMTUI.DLL file that is
included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows. This replacement
file provides additional enhancements to the original MSRMTUI.DLL file that
resolve the following problems:

- The address list becomes corrupted when it is updated twice in the same
  session of Mail Remote for Windows.

- If the user forgets his or her password or if the password is changed while
  the remote driver is in use, the password cannot be reset.

  NOTE: To resolve this problem, two files must be updated: the MSRMTUI.DLL file
  (included in this update) and the ADMIN.EXE file provided in the Microsoft
  Mail for PC Networks version 3.2a Update. For details on this procedure
  please see the "To reset the password for a Mail Remote for Windows user"
  section below.

- Invalid extended information may be displayed when you are obtaining details
  on a user from the Global Address List. The invalid information consists of
  default template fields associated with a postoffice other than the one on
  which the user's account resides. This condition can occur if customized user
  template *.TPL files are present on the remote user's workstation. Another
  possible symptom of this condition is receiving one of these messages when
  you are obtaining details on users from the GAL: "A GLB file on your server
  is corrupt" or "Address is no longer valid." The updated MSRMTUI.DLL file
  (included in this update) will prevent the customized user template *.TPL
  files from being copied to the remote user's workstation.

  NOTE: To remove the customized user template *.TPL files from an existing
  installation of Mail Remote for Windows, the user must first follow the "To
  replace your MSRMTUI.DLL file" procedure outlined below to install the
  updated MSRMTUI.DLL file, and then follow one of the procedures outlined in
  the "To update your address lists" section to obtain new address lists from
  the postoffice.

- A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote address
  book was updated without uploading messages. The client will now check for
  the outbound messages prior to updating the address book. To ensure this fix
  works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded in conjunction with this
  DLL:

     MSRMT.DLL    version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTCN.DLL  version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTSU.DLL  version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTTR.DLL  version 3.2.4013


To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Msrmtui.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/pcmail/Update/11/WIN/EN-US/Msrmtui.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MSRMTUI.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "msrmtui"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  MSRMTUI.DLL (165,136 bytes, dated 06-15-95, 6:36 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To replace your MSRMTUI.DLL file
--------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\msrmtui.dll &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting MSRMTUI.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
  directory where your MSRMTUI.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you
  ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
  MSRMTUI.DLL file is located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory on drive C,
  type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\msrmtui.dll c:\windows\system " (without the quotation marks)

To update your address lists
----------------------------

Perform one of these procedures if you want to remove the customized user
template *.TPL files from an existing installation of Mail Remote for Windows:

- Update the address lists by using a modem connection to the postoffice
  established through the Mail Remote user interface:

  1. From the View menu, choose Connect Now.

  2. Select the Update Address Lists option.

  3. Choose the OK button.

- Update the address lists by using a LAN connection to the postoffice and the
  Mail System Selector:

  1. Obtain a network connection to the postoffice and edit the [Microsoft
     Mail] section of your MSMAIL.INI file to add a ServerPath= line with the
     actual location of the Mail data files.

  2. With the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks driver current, exit and sign out
     of Mail.

  3. Use the Microsoft Mail System Selector to switch from the Microsoft Mail
     for PC Networks driver to the Mail Remote driver. The Mail Remote dialog
     box appears.

  4. To copy the address lists from the postoffice to your remote computer,
     select the Copy Address List From Postoffice option.

  5. Choose the OK button.

- Update the address lists by using a new data disk:

  1. Obtain a new data disk from the Mail Administrator.

  2. Copy the files from the new data disk to the
     &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;Windows_dir&gt;\MSMAIL\MSRMT\USERINFO subdirectory.

  3. Launch Mail Remote for Windows to expand the address lists.

To reset the password for a Mail Remote for Windows user
--------------------------------------------------------

To reset the password, you must ensure that the user's data disk was created
using the version of ADMIN.EXE provided in the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
version 3.2a Update.

Have the user do the following:

1. Connect to the network on which his or her postoffice resides.

2. Use the Mail Selector to change to the PC Mail LAN driver.

You can then use ADMIN.EXE to reset the user's password. Once this is done, have
the user do the following:

1. Log in to Mail using the reset password.

2. After successfully logging in, the user can change the password.

3. Use the Mail Selector to switch back to the remote driver.
