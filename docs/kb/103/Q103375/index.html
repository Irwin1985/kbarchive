SUMMARY
=======

The Visual C++ Project Compiler and Project Linker dialog boxes, and the Word
for Windows version 2.0 Options dialog box, demonstrate dynamic child
dialogs--dialogs boxes within dialogs boxes, which dynamically appear based on a
list box selection. This article discusses how to implement these dynamic child
dialog boxes. MultiDlg.exe is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that
demonstrates one of the techniques discussed in this article.

The style to use is WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT.

A dynamic child dialog box generally contains a list box at the left, which
determines what subdialog box is displayed in the right side of the dialog box.
This interface structure is helpful when managing very large interfaces with
options that intuitively break into categories. The Word for Windows Options
dialog box and Visual C++'s Compiler and Linker dialog boxes are good examples
of complex interfaces made manageable by the use of dynamic child dialog boxes.

Possible implementations for dynamic child dialog boxes can be divided into two
categories. One approach--often the first one to come to mind--involves
embedding a dialog box, which has the WS_CHILD style, into a second, larger
dialog box. At first, this approach's modularity appears to be big plus; that
is, because the child dialog boxes are actual dialog boxes, each one gets its
own dialog box procedure and resource script definition. There is a major
problem in this approach, however, in that limitations of IsDialogMessage()
prevent it from operating on windows whose controls extend more than one level
deep. Because the controls on the WS_CHILD dialog boxes are children of a child
of the main dialog box, simply adding IsDialogMessage() with the main dialog
box's handle to the message loop won't cover mnemonic, tabbing, and other dialog
box functionality for these controls. Working around these problems can be
difficult.

The second approach does not use a true WS_CHILD dialog box. Instead, it
conditionally creates and destroys (and/or hides and shows) groups of controls
on a single dialog box, based on the list box selection. This approach does not
suffer from the tabbing and mnemonic problems of the WS_CHILD dialog approach.
Additionally, with some cleverness, both the code and the resource script can be
as modular as the WS_CHILD dialog box approach.

Developers should be aware of the stress dynamic dialog boxes can place on USER's
heap space. Each control created consumes some of this, and a normal Windows
dialog box may consume as much as 3 percent or more of this shared system
resource. However, a dynamic child dialog box creates many more controls
compared to a normal dialog box. Most of these controls are hidden at any one
time, and are made visible only when their particular child dialog box is shown.
While they may be hidden, they consume just as much USER heap, and therefore
it's easy to imagine how a complex dynamic child dialog box could use 15 percent
or more of the available USER heap space.

Obviously, the developer must beware of consuming so much of a scarce system
resource. To address this concern, MULTIDLG creates the controls of a particular
dynamic child dialog box only if and when that dialog box needs to be displayed.
If the user doesn't pick a particular list box option, the controls for that
option aren't created. Note that MULTIDLG just hides created controls when
another child dialog box is chosen. A more complex implementation of dynamic
child dialog boxes should destroy inactive controls, to fully reclaim the USER
heap space they consume. The down side of this is that the application is
required to record the state of each control within a particular dynamic child
dialog box before killing it, and to reset each control's state if the subdialog
box is chosen again. In contrast, if the controls aren't killed when the dynamic
child dialog box is deselected, the state information can be conveniently
extracted from the controls themselves when the user chooses the OK command
button, even though these controls are invisible.

MULTIDLG implements dynamic child dialog boxes by loading and parsing dialog box
resources and creating their controls manually on a larger, main dialog box.
When another subdialog box is chosen, MULTIDLG hides all the controls of the
existing dialog box before showing the new selection's controls (creating them
from their template as well, if necessary).

MULTIDLG uses these steps to create the controls on the main dialog box:

1. If the group of controls has not been loaded before, load the dialog box
  resource in which they reside, via FindResource() and LoadResource().

2. Parse the control information out of the dialog box resource using the
  DialogBoxHeader and ControlData structures as guides. (These structures are
  not defined in WINDOWS.H. Because they contain variable-length fields, they
  can't really be represented as C structs. You can find information about
  these structures in the Windows 3.1 SDK online documentation, under "Dialog
  Box Resource".)

3. Determine the coordinates of the controls within the main dialog box by
  converting their dialog units into pixels, and call CreateWindow() on each.

NOTE: A bug in IsDialogMessage() prevents mnemonics from working correctly when a
hidden control shares a mnemonic with a visible control. To work around this,
MULTIDLG captures the window text from appropriate controls as they are being
hidden, and resets this window text to nothing. When the control is becoming
visible again, the code resets the text to what it was. This prevents
IsDialogMessage() from seeing the mnemonic of the hidden control.
