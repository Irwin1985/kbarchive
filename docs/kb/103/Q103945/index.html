The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.2, 3.2a, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Mac OS (ALL) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the Macintosh client file that is included
with versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.2, and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the Macintosh client
file, see the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your Macintosh client file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the Macintosh client file, a replacement for the Macintosh
client file included with versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks. This update includes the following modifications:

- With the earlier version of this file, the computer could stop responding
  when sending a message to a personal group under low memory conditions. The
  Macintosh client file has been modified to correct this problem.


- Some network operating systems will not allow a file to be created in all
  uppercase letters. The Macintosh client file has been modified for these
  types of networks to allow the client to create filenames in lowercase
  letters if LOWRCASE.GLB exists in the GLB subdirectory of the Mail database.


- With the earlier version of this file, when mail is sent to global groups
  that contain nonalphabetic characters in their names, the recipient field
  appears blank when the message is viewed by a Mail for Windows user. The
  Macintosh client file has been modified to correct this problem.


This replacement file also resolves the following problems that can occur when
you use version 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b, 3.2, or 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks:

- Extended template information that exceeds 64K is now correctly displayed
  when you choose the Info button in the Addressing dialog box of the Macintosh
  client.

- The Macintosh client has been modified to enable you to address mail to an
  X.400 recipient when the address exceeds 52 characters. Attempting to do this
  with previous versions of the Macintosh client could produce the following
  error message:

  The application "unknown" has unexpectedly quit, because an error of type 1
  occurred. OK?

- If you attempt to forward a message in the Macintosh client, and you choose
  not to forward an attachment to that message, the following error message is
  generated:

  Low on Memory. Unable to complete the operation. Please close some windows.

  The Macintosh client has been modified to forward the message without
  generating the error.


- On a Power Macintosh, if the check box Open "To" Address Selector (from the
  Compose menu, select Get Info) is selected, and you attempt to forward or
  reply to a message, the following error message is generated and can hang the
  machine:

  The system has closed the following application "Unknown" because of an error
  type 1".

  The Macintosh client has been modified to forward or reply to a message
  without generating the error or hanging the machine.

To update your Macintosh client file
------------------------------------

NOTE: The Macintosh client file is in a self-extracting archive (.SEA) format as
well as in Bin-Hex (.HQX) format to allow you to use an MS-DOS- formatted disk.
To access the workstation software, you need to decode the file using a decoding
utility, such as StuffIt or Compact Pro. These utilities can be found on most
major bulletin boards, such as America Online and AppleLink.

From an IBM or compatible computer
----------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\maclient.hqx &lt;destination&gt; " (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you downloaded the
  MACLIENT.HQX file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where
  your postoffice currently resides. For example, if you downloaded the file to
  the TEST directory on drive D and the postoffice is located in the MAILDATA
  directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\maclient.hqx c:\maildata " (without the quotation marks)

2. From a Macintosh that has access to the Mail postoffice share, use one of the
  decoding utilities, such as StuffIt or Compact Pro, to decode the file into
  its original format by doing the following:

   - To use StuffIt: From the Other menu, choose Bin-Hex. Then select Decode
     Bin-Hex File.

  -or-

   - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM BinHex4.

  The utility will generate a Macintosh file called MACLIENT.SEA in the same
  location as the original file.

3. Each Macintosh user can then use AppleShare to update his or her subdirectory
  of the postoffice to the local Macintosh.

  The MACLIENT.SEA file is a self-extracting archive. Double-click the icon to
  extract the Microsoft Mail file.

From an Apple Macintosh
-----------------------

1. If you download MACLIENT.SEA, go to step 2.

  If you download the .HQX file, use one of the decoding utilities, such as
  StuffIt or Compact Pro, to decode the file into its original format by doing
  the following:

   - To use StuffIt: From the Other menu, choose Bin-Hex. Then select Decode
     Bin-Hex File.

  -or-

   - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM BinHex4.

  The utility will generate a Macintosh file called MACLIENT.SEA in the same
  location as the original file.

2. Copy the file to a share that each Macintosh user has access to, such as the
  MAILDATA subdirectory of the postoffice. Then using AppleShare, each
  Macintosh user can update his or her Mail client software by copying
  MACLIENT.SEA from the MAILDATA subdirectory of the postoffice to the local
  Macintosh and double-clicking it to extract the Macintosh file.
