SUMMARY
=======

The article contains Registry entries for network services, Part 8. These
subgroups are included.

- Replicator service

- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and RPCLocator software

    - ClientProtocols and ServiceProtocols entries for RPC
    - NameService entries for RPC

For a listing of the contents of network services entries articles 1-8, see
"Network Services Entries, Part 1."

Replicator Service Entries
--------------------------

The Registry path that contains entries for the Replicator service is the
following:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
       \Replicator\Parameters

CrashDir REG_SZ First-Level Directory Name

  This item is temporarily recorded in the Registry by the Replicator
  service. If it remains after a system repair, you can delete this
  entry using Registry Editor.

ExportList REG_SZ List

  Lists an unlimited number of servers or domains that receive
  notices when the export directory is updated. These servers
  subsequently replicate from the export server. If no List value is
  specified, the export server sends a notice to its domain. Separate
  multiple List names with a semicolon (;). This value is ignored if
  the value of Replicate is 2 (Import).

  Do not use the UNC name when you specify a computer name; that is,
  do not include two backslashes (\\) at the beginning of the name.

  Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in
  Control Panel to set this value. Default: none.

ExportPath REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ Pathname

  Specifies the export path. All files to be replicated must be in a
  subdirectory of the export directory. This value is ignored if the
  value of Replicate is set to 2 (Import). Use the Replicator
  controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in Control Panel to
  set this value, which cannot be a UNC name.
  Default: %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Export.

GuardTime REG_DWORD 0 to one-half of Interval minutes

  Sets the number of minutes an export directory must be stable (no
  changes to any files) before import servers can replicate its
  files. This option applies only to directories with tree integrity.
  Default: 2 minutes.

ImportList REG_SZ List

  Lists an unlimited number of servers or domains that receive
  notices when the import directory is updated. These servers
  subsequently replicate from the import server. If no List value is
  specified, updates come from the import server's domain. Separate
  multiple List names with a semicolon (;). This value is ignored if
  the value of Replicate is 1 (Export).

  Do not use the UNC name when you specify a computer name; that is,
  do not include two backslashes (\\) at the beginning of the name.

  Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in
  Control Panel to set this value.

ImportPath REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ Pathname

  Specifies the path on the import server to receive replicas from
  the export servers. This value is ignored if the value of Replicate
  is 1 (Export). Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the
  Server icon in Control Panel to set this value, which cannot be a
  UNC name. Default: %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import.

Interval REG_DWORD 1 to 60 minutes

  Sets how often an export server checks the replicated directories
  for changes. This option is ignored on import servers. Default: 5
  minutes.

PulseConcurrency REG_DWORD 1 to 10 cycles

  Specifies how often the export server repeats sending the last
  update notice. These repeat notices are sent even when no changes
  have occurred, so that import servers that missed the original
  update notice can receive the notice. The server waits the
  equivalent of (Pulse * Interval) minutes before sending each repeat
  notice. Default: 3.

Random REG_DWORD 1 to 120 seconds

  Specifies the maximum time that the import servers can wait before
  requesting an update. An import server uses the export server's
  value of Random to generate a random number of seconds (from 0 to
  the value of Random). The import server waits this long after
  receiving an update notice before requesting the replica from the
  export server. This prevents the export server from being
  overloaded by simultaneous update requests. Default: 60.

Replicate REG_DWORD 1, 2, or 3

  Specifies the Replicator action, according to the following:

  Value          Meaning
  ----------------------

    1            Export-the server maintains a master tree to be
                 replicated.
    2            Import-the server receives update notices from the export
                 server.
    3            Both-the server is to export and import directories or
                 files.

  Use the Replicator controls in Server Manager or the Server icon in
  Control Panel to set this value. Default: 3.

  The Replicator does not use the REPL.INI file as does LAN Manager
  2.0. The integrity and extent values (among other items) are stored
  as REG_SZ values under the Exports and Imports subkeys, which are
  found under the Replicator\Parameters key. These values are used
  only by the software and should be maintained only by the system.

RPC and RPCLocator Software Entries
-----------------------------------

There are no definable parameters of note in the Services subkey for Remote
Procedure Call (RPC) and RPCLocator.

The important value entries governing RPC are found under the Software key. There
are four subkeys: ClientProtocols, NameService, NetBIOS, and ServiceProtocols.
Entries are described in this section.

ClientProtocols and ServiceProtocols Entries for RPC:

The ClientProtocols subkey contains the mappings from client-side RPC protocol
name to DLL name. This is the Registry path:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ClientProtocols

The default values are as follows. All data types are REG_SZ.

  ncacn_np =  rpcltc1.dll
  ncacn_ip_tcp =  rpcltc3.dll
  ncacn_nb_nb =  rpcltc5.dll
  ncacn_nb_tcp =  rpcltc5.dll
  ncacn_nb_ipx =  rpcltc5.dll
  ncacn_spx =  rpcltc6.dll
  ncalrpc =  ncalrpc

The ServerProtocols subkey does the same for server-side protocols in this
Registry path:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ServerProtocols

The default values are:

  ncacn_np =  rpclts1.dll
  ncacn_ip_tcp =  rpclts3.dll
  ncacn_nb_nb =  rpclts5.dll
  ncacn_nb_tcp =  rpclts5.dll
  ncacn_nb_ipx =  rpclts5.dll
  ncacn_spx =  rpclts6.dll
  ncalrpc =  ncalrps

These subkeys are present for all supported RPC transports, but the mappings for
the ncacn_np and ncalrpc protocols are not used. For these transports, the
mapping is hardcoded in the RPC run-time code.

In the naming convention for the RPC dynamic-link libraries (DLLs): RPC indicates
this is an RPC DLL; LT indicates a loadable transport; C or S indicates
client-side or server-side; and the number indicates which transport, where 1 =
named pipes, 2 = undefined, 3 = TCP/IP, 4 = DECNet, 5 = NetBIOS, and 6 = SPX.

NOTE: On 16-bit Windows for MS-DOS systems, these entries in C:\RPCREG.DAT are a
subset of this information. For 16-bit systems, we rely upon the user to give
the proper LANA's to Setup. In addition, all information in the ClientProtocols
section is hardcoded into the run-time, so the section will typically not be
present in RPCREG.DAT. Finally, a Windows-based application running under the
WOW subsystem will still reference RPCREG.DAT for its parameters, because it
does not have access to the Windows NT Registry.

NameService Entries for RPC:

The NameService subkey contains information used by the RPC Locator service and
the client-side RPC NSI calls. This is the Registry path:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\NameService

The subkeys have the following default values when the Locator is the name
service provider. All are REG_SZ data types.

  DefaultSyntax  =  3
  Protocol =  ncacn_np
  NetworkAddress =  \\.
  ServerNetworkAddress =  \\.
  Endpoint  =  \pipe\locator

Because the Locator only listens to \pipe\locator, it is unwise to change any of
the name service values when the Locator is the name service provider.

When CDS is the name service provider (via NSID), these entries have the
following values. Again, all are REG_SZ data types.

  DefaultSyntax  =  3
  Protocol =  ncacn_ip_tcp
  NetworkAddress =  hostname.organization.edu
  ServerNetworkAddress =  hostname.organization.edu
  Endpoint =

The value for Endpoint is intentionally left blank in this case.

For these value entries, DefaultSyntax specifies the OSF name syntax to use when
RPC_C_NS_SYNTAX_DEFAULT is specified as the name service syntax to one of the
name service functions. The Locator and NSID support only the value of 3.
Because NSID forwards requests to CDS, it is possible that NSID actually
supports other syntaxes.

Protocol, NetworkAddress, ServerNetworkAddress, and Endpoint are used by the
system to construct a binding handle to the name service database and then to
make an RPC call to fetch the requested binding handles.

When CDS is the provider, the NetworkAddress and ServerNetworkAddress entry
values should be identical. The other entries can be changed, depending upon the
requirements of the NSID implementation. For the current Digital NSID, the
defaults are the best values.

NetBIOS Entries for RPC:

The NetBIOS subkey describes the mapping of NetBIOS-based protocol sequences to
LANA numbers. The Registry path is:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\NetBIOS

Each value has the following form:

  ncacn_nb_baseindex      REG_DWORD     lana

In the format for these value entries, base is either nb, ipx, or tcp, and index
and lana are zero-based integers. For example, a computer might have these
entries:

  ncacn_nb_nb0  = 0
  ncacn_nb_ipx0 = 1
  ncacn_nb_tcp0 = 2

In this example, IPX is on LANA 1, TCP is on LANA 2, and NetBEUI is on LANA 0. As
another example, if a computer has two network adapter cards using NetBEUI, the
configuration would be the following:

  ncacn_nb_nb0 = 0
  ncacn_nb_nb1 = 1

This information is updated by Windows NT Setup to match the installed network
transports, so it should never need to be altered.

Schedule Service Entries
------------------------

There are no parameters that can be added for the Schedule service in this path:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
       \Schedule

You use the Schedule service to submit a job such as an executable or batch file
to run at a later time. You must define access controls on the Schedule key
itself if you want to run in an account that is not an Administrator account.
