The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the PABNSP.DLL file that is included with
versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the PABNSP.DLL file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your PABNSP.DLL file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains PABNSP.DLL, a replacement for the PABNSP.DLL file that is
included with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. This
replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original PABNSP.DLL
file, correcting a problem where duplicate addresses are added to the Personal
Address Book (PAB).

NOTE: For this problem to be resolved, two DLL files must be updated: the
PABNSP.DLL file (included in this update) and MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4079
(update included in MSSFS.EXE on the MSL).

To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Pabnsp.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/pcmail/Update/16/WIN/EN-US/Pabnsp.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download PABNSP.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "pabnsp"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  PABNSP.DLL (44,656 bytes, dated 08-06-93, 5:37 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your PABNSP.DLL file
------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\pabnsp.dll &lt;destination&gt;" (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting PABNSP.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your PABNSP.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you ran the
  self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your PABNSP.DLL
  file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following
  command:

  " copy d:\test\pabnsp.dll c:\mailexe" (without the quotation marks)

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;mailexe&gt;\setup.inf &lt;mailexe&gt;\setupinf.old " (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;mailexe&gt; is the complete path to the directory containing the
  Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if SETUP.EXE is
  located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old " (without the quotation
  marks)

3. Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [MsMail System]
  section, replace the following line

  1, pabnsp.dll,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY ,,,,, SHARED,
  44640,,,, 3.2.0.4027,

  with:

  1, pabnsp.dll,,,, 1993-08-06, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY ,,,,, SHARED,
  44656,,,, 3.2.0.4046,

  Save the file and close the text editor.

  NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
  run Setup again.
