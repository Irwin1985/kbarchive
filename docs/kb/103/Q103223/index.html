SUMMARY
=======

Ripwatch uses the TOOLHELP dynamic-link library (DLL) to trap system RIPs and
other notification messages, and displays them in a window.

When developing Microsoft Windows-based applications, you should always use the
debugging version of Windows. This special build of the system is distributed
with the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). It tests for invalid parameters
to Windows function calls and reports other problems such as failing to free
graphics device interface (GDI) objects when an application exits. If you don't
know about the debugging version, you are not getting the most from your SDK;
worse still, you may be preparing to ship a potentially faulty product.

The default action for reporting detected errors is to send a message to a debug
terminal connected to COM1. This requires that you have a terminal attached to
the port to see these messages. This can be a waste of desktop space, a source
of annoying beeps, and may tie up an otherwise useful communications port. The
TOOLHELP.DLL included with the Windows SDK allows you to hook these messages
before they reach the communications port. The Ripwatch sample application
displays the messages in a window. The display includes a textual description of
the RIP error code. Ripwatch also allows you to copy the text to the Clipboard,
save it in a file, or print it.

There is a known problem when running Ripwatch with Microsoft CodeView(R) for
Windows. If you try to start CodeView while Ripwatch is running, CodeView
reports an out-of-memory condition. If you try to start Ripwatch after CodeView
has been started, CodeView will usually GP fault.

Ripwatch was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and the
Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 compiler.
