The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the Terminal Server Administration tool, User Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Users have more possible configurations in Terminal Server. For instance, some
users may have permission to connect to the Terminal Server as a file server but
not have permission to use it as an application server (through the Terminal
Server Client). Also, users can have different profiles and home directories,
depending on whether they are using "normal" workstations or whether they are
connecting through the Client.

When you create a user, the only difference on the main User Manager screen is
the additional "Config" button at the bottom. After installing a Terminal
Server, you will find the same default users (Admin and Guest) and the same
default groups as you would expect on a Windows NT Server computer.

The User Configuration screen allows these options:

Allow Logon to Terminal Server
------------------------------

This is similar to giving the user the right to log on locally.

By default, Everyone has the right to log on locally (that is, to log on at the
Terminal Server console). Just as in Windows NT Server, this right is set in
User Manager by selecting User Rights on the Policies menu. Because Terminal
Server clients are, in effect, logging on at the server's console, this is a
necessary right.

NOTE: Denying users the right to log on locally will keep Terminal Server clients
from logging on at all.

NOTE: Because this right is necessary for Clients to be able to log on, if you
install a Terminal Server as a domain controller, two situations are likely to
occur. First, if you install as a backup domain controller (BDC) with an Windows
NT Server as the primary domain controller (PDC), when your Terminal Server
joins the domain, Everyone will lose the right to log on locally because these
policies are global to the domain's domain controllers. Second, if you install a
Terminal Server as a PDC, Everyone will be able to log on at the console of any
BDCs in the domain, whether they are Terminal Server computers or not.

So, for a client to be able to log on to the Terminal Server, the user must have
two rights: the User Manager user right to log on locally and the user- specific
configuration "Allow Logon to Terminal Server."

If you deny a user the "Allow Logon to Terminal Server" right, that user will not
be able to log on at the Terminal Server console or through the Terminal Server
client. But the user can log on normally from other Windows NT servers,
workstations, or other domain workstations. So, if an administrator has a group
of users who will connect through the client and another who will log on
normally, this is the correct check box for allowing or denying access.

It is also possible to remove the Everyone group from the right to log on
locally. Another group of client users can be created and given this right.

If a user attempts to log on to a Terminal Server through the client and has been
denied the right to log on locally, the user will receive this message:

  

  The local policy of this system does not allow you to log on interactively.

If the user does not have the check box selected in User Configuration for "Allow
Logon to Terminal Server," another error is returned:

  

  Your interactive logon privilege has been disabled. Please contact your
  system administrator.

If BOTH permissions have been denied the user, he or she will get the following
message:

  

  The local policy of this system does not allow you to log on interactively.

Timeout Settings (in Minutes)
-----------------------------

Connection: By default this is turned off. This setting controls how long a
client can be connected. This is not dependent on any other state (for example,
being disconnected or idle). If a user can only be connected for 10 minutes,
then 10 minutes after connection, the user will be disconnected. If this feature
is enabled, the default value is 120 minutes.

Disconnection: After a user has been disconnected, how long should the Terminal
Server keep the session active? When a user is disconnected, the server keeps
the session and all running processes active, so that the user can reconnect and
continue working where she or he left off. This refers to any type of
disconnection (for example, connection timeout, dropped modem line, network
failure, user selects Disconnect on the Start menu). If this feature is enabled,
the default value is 10 minutes.

Idle: How long should the server wait before disconnecting an idle session? If
this feature is enabled, the default value is 30 minutes.

Client Devices
--------------

This setting does not apply to Microsoft's RDP client. If Citrix's ICA client is
being used, these settings are relevant and determine whether the client
computer's local devices will be available as local devices while in a Terminal
Session.

If you are logged on to a Terminal Server using the RDP client, when you access
your drive C, you are accessing the server's drive C, not your local device. The
same is true for printers, printer ports, and COM ports.

Initial Program
---------------

You can specify an application to start up as soon as the user logs on through
the Client. This is similar to placing an application in the user's startup
folder.

The option to "Inherit Client Config" applies only to Citrix's ICA Clients.

On a Broken or Timed out Connection...
--------------------------------------

If a connection is lost or times out, you have the options of disconnecting the
session, which leaves the session intact so the user can reconnect and keep
working, or you can reset the connection, which terminates the session.

Reconnect Sessions Disconnected...
----------------------------------

This option is used for Citrix direct-serial-port connecting devices only.

Modem Callback Is...
--------------------

Modem callback options apply only to Citrix's ICA Clients. For Microsoft's RDP
client, configure these settings through RAS.

Shadowing...
------------

Shadowing applies only the Citrix's ICA clients. Shadowing allows ICA clients to
view or take over other ICA client sessions. Note that the Terminal Server
console cannot be shadowed, and sessions cannot be shadowed from the console.
Shadowing only works from client to client and only in conjunction with the ICA
client and Metaframe.

User Configuration also includes a new option for NetWare users:

NetWare Logon Configuration:

Terminal Server offers the same NetWare connectivity options as Windows NT Server
4.0, with 3 additions. The first is here in User Manager. Specifying a NetWare
server here will allow the user to log on to NetWare prior to logging on to
Terminal Server or Windows NT. If you add a domain administrator name and
password here, if the user's NetWare password differs from the Windows NT
password, the NetWare password will be used, and the Windows NT password will be
synchronized to it.

The other two new NetWare options are the Administrator utility "NetWare User
Access for Terminal Server," which copies NetWare user accounts to Terminal
Server, and the command-line utility NDSPSVR, which sets a preferred NDS logon
server globally (this is not available on a per-user basis) for all NetWare
users who connect to this Terminal Server.

The User Environment Profile screen:

Note that this is very similar to the Profile settings for Windows NT Server
users. The only difference is that you can specify two different profiles and
two different home directories for each user. If the user logs on normally from
a Windows NT workstation, for instance, he or she can have a different profile
and home directory than if he or she logs on to the Terminal Server through the
RDP client. One profile can be roaming and the other mandatory.

User Profiles Overview:

- If you specify a User Profile Path only, the user will get that profile
  regardless of how he or she logs on.
- If you specify a Terminal Server Profile Path only, the user will get the
  profile if he or she logs into the domain from any Terminal Server console or
  through the Terminal Server client. Otherwise, the path will be ignored.
- If you specify both a User Profile path and a Terminal Server Profile path,
  the user will use the User Profile path if logging on at a Windows NT
  Workstation computer or Windows NT Server computer (not a Terminal Server and
  not using the Terminal Server client program), and the user will use the
  Terminal Server Profile path is logging on at any Terminal Server console or
  through the client program.
- Profile types can be mixed. That is, if a user has two profile paths, one can
  be mandatory and the other non-mandatory.

Details:

Windows Terminal Server 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0 both use User Profiles to
store user's desktop information. These profiles are simply a series of folders,
typically stored under a folder named with the user's logon name. By default,
every user who logs on to a Windows NT Workstation 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0,
or Windows Terminal Server 4.0 computer gets a profile folder under the
%SystemRoot%\Profiles folder. When users log on, the profile is loaded into
HKEY_CURRENT_USER in the registry. When the user logs off, the registry
information is written to the user's profile folder. One important note: if you
store the profile someplace other than the default location, the profile is
always copied to the user's %SystemRoot%\Profiles folder before it is loaded
into the registry. This is called the Locally Cached Profile. It allows the user
to get the expected desktop even if the network is unavailable. This is an
important concept in Terminal Server. (Also note that this caching of profiles
can be turned off through a System Policy.)

In User Manager, administrators can specify a path for profiles. This path can be
local or can reside on a network share. One common practice is to pick a central
network location, create a Profiles folder, and share it for everyone to use.
Then, in User Manager, under Profiles\User Profile Path enter the path
\\Server\Profiles\%username%. By using this path, administrators can select
several users at once and set their profile paths quickly.

Terminal Server allows users to have two profile paths: a User Profile Path and a
Terminal Server Profile Path. The User Profile Path is identical to the User
Profile Path function in Windows NT Server 4.0. Users have three logon options
with Terminal Server. They can log on "normally" from a computer running either
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server, they can log on at the Terminal
Server console, or they can log on through the Terminal Server client software.
If only a User Profile Path is specified, the user will get the same profile
regardless of the logon type she or he uses.

Before considering the Terminal Server Profile path, it is important to note
where the local profile cache is located for each logon type. If the user logs
on from a computer running Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server (that is,
not using the Terminal Server client software), the profile is copied from the
profile path location to the user's computer, saved in the local
%SystemRoot%\Profiles\Username folder, and then loaded into the registry.
However, if the user logs on at the Terminal Server console or through the
Terminal Server client, the profile is loaded into the Terminal Server's
%SystemRoot%\Profiles\%username% folder.

Also note that, for logon purposes, a Terminal Server console is considered the
same as a Terminal Server client session. So, if you specify a Terminal Server
Profile path in your domain and the user logs on to the domain from any Terminal
Server console, she or he will use the Terminal Server Profile path. However,
the profile will be cached in the %SystemRoot%\Profiles\%username% folder of the
Terminal Server at which the user logs on. When the user logs on through the
Terminal Server client, the profile is always cached on the Terminal Server to
which the user connects.

If users need different profiles, it is okay to specify a different profile path
for User Profile path and for Terminal Server Profile path. These profiles can
also be different types; that is, one can be mandatory and the other
nonmandatory.

However, administrators should carefully consider profile caching before deciding
on a profiles strategy. There is a particular situation that should be avoided
(and this is true in both Windows NT Server and Terminal Server). If a user logs
on to different domains in which he or she has different profile types
(mandatory/nonmandatory) so that the cached profile is being overwritten with
different profile types, the user's profile will not work as expected.
Nonmandatory profiles may be ignored, and mandatory profiles may become
nonmandatory. This situation can also be created if a user initially has a User
Profile path to a mandatory profile and then the user is given a nonmandatory
Terminal Server Profile path.

Fortunately, this is not a common scenario because users are not typically
allowed to log on at the Terminal Server console. It is also rare to have
Windows NT Workstation users log on to one domain with a mandatory profile and
another domain with a nonmandatory profile.

If your environment will not allow you to avoid this locally cached profile
confusion, you can create a System Policy that tells the system not to cache the
profiles. This option is found under Default Computer\Windows NT User
Profiles\Delete cached copies of roaming profiles. With this policy in place,
the problem will not exist since the cached profile never gets mixed with
various profiles.

Further, it is especially important to have home directories specified for each
user. The default location is the user's locally cached profile. If the user
logs on under one of the scenarios to be avoided, having different profiles
writing over the locally cached profile, the use will be overwriting the home
directory and potentially any saved filed. If the home directory is in the
default location (locally cached profile) and you set a system policy to not to
cache roaming profiles, the home directory can be deleted, again perhaps losing
files. This is a problem not only because the home directory could have user
files in it, but because the home directory contains a Terminal Server specific
directory, the user's Windows directory. This is where user's
application-specific .ini files are stored.
