SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the Terminal Server Administration tool, Connection
Configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you open this tool, you see that one connection is created by default, the
RDP-TCP connection. Typically, this is the only connection that needs to be
defined. Nothing needs to be done to enable this connection.

The RDP-TCP connection is a socket connection over TCP port 3389. In this tool,
you can specify how long clients can remain connected, if a specific application
should run when the client connects, choose the level of encryption, and so on.

You can have one connection defined per transport per type per adapter. So, in a
normal Terminal Server with one adapter, you can define exactly one connection
since there is only one connection type available. Terminal Server 4.0 by itself
with no additional services supports ONLY RDP over TCP connections. If you add a
second adapter, you can define a second RDP-TCP connection for that adapter.

Citrix's Metaframe product may be installed on the Terminal Server so Citrix's
ICA clients rather than Microsoft's RDP client can be used to connect to
Terminal Server. In this tool and in User Manager, you will find options that do
not apply unless Metaframe is installed on the Terminal Server.

On a Citrix Winframe Server (based on Windows NT 3.51) or on a Terminal Server
with Metaframe installed, customers have the option of creating different
connection types for different ICA clients (for example, Macintosh clients,
asynch clients, SPX clients).

Right-clicking a defined connection brings up a menu that allows you to edit the
connection configuration

Notice that the connection Name, Type, and Transport are unavailable. The name
can be changed under Connection/Rename. But the Type and Transport cannot be
changed.

The Lan Adapter drop down list shows "All Lan Adapters..." and any installed
adapters. Notice that the connection by default applies to all installed
adapters, so just because you have multiple adapters does not mean you must
define new connections. You can, but it is not a requirement.

Maximum Connection Count means what it says. Do not confuse this with licensing.
This setting governs how many socket connections are allowed. The default is
Unlimited.

If you select Client Settings on the Edit Connection screen, you will see a list
of options intended primarily for the Citrix ICA client. These settings do not
apply to the RDP client. Because the RDP client establishes only a single data
channel between the client and the server, mapping to local devices is not
possible. Inside an RDP client session, all "local" resources are the Terminal
Server's resources.

However, Citrix's ICA clients have been modified to create multiple data channels
between client and server. These settings are included for customers who load
Metaframe on Terminal Server and use the ICA clients.

Clicking Advanced on the Edit Configuration screen opens many options, although,
again, some apply only to the Citrix ICA client.

Note the selections "Inherit user config," "Inherit client config," and "Inherit
client/user config." User config selections are also available in Terminal
Server User Manager as options for specific users. Client config options can be
set at the client using Client Configuration Manager (installed with the Client
software) or in the client's registry (for 32- bit) or .ini file (for 16-bit)
settings.

Any values set on this screen apply to all connections at this Terminal Server
(and no others, regardless of domain relationship -- these settings are specific
to the Terminal Server).

Note also that any values set here will override settings for users in User
Manager.

Below is a description of the various advanced options:

Logon
-----

If you disable Logon, you are disabling client connections. This does not keep
non-client users from connecting to the server (for that you would have to pause
or stop the Server or Netlogon services). If you want to keep Clients from
connecting and establishing terminal sessions, this is where you do it.

NOTE: If you are used to pausing or stopping the Server or Netlogon services to
keep users from connecting to the server, you will be tempted to try to stop the
Terminal Server service. This service cannot be stopped. You can change it to
manual or disabled, but when you restart the server, this service will return to
automatic and will start. This is by design. This service is integral to
Terminal Server's operation.

NOTE: Stopping the Server or Netlogon services does not keep Terminal Server
clients from connecting. These connections use a completely different connection
path. Again, disabling logon here in Connection Configuration is the way to deny
client connections. Of course, it is also possible to deny connections based on
permissions (more detail below).

Timeout Settings (in Minutes)
-----------------------------

Here you can choose how long a connection should be maintained, how long a
disconnected session should be maintained in memory, and how long a session
should be allowed to be idle before disconnecting it.

The Connection Timeout determines how long the client can stay connected,
regardless of whether the session is idle or not.

The Disconnected Session Timeout determines how long a disconnected session
should be held in memory. If a client disconnects (rather than logging off), the
session is not terminated. Rather, it is held in memory so that the client can
reconnect and re-establish the session. Applications that were running
previously should still be available.

The Idle Session Timeout determines how long a session with no activity should
remain connected. Note that turning on the Menu Bar clock will generate enough
continuous traffic to keep a session from being idle.

If you uncheck No Timeout, the default for Connection is 120 minutes, for
Disconnection is 10 minutes, and for Idle is 30 minutes.

Setting these values here affects every Client that uses this connection. If you
want to modify the values for a specific user, you can do so in User Manager.
However, keep in mind that Connection Configuration values override values in
User Manager. If you need both advanced options set in Connection Configuration
AND separate options set for individual users in User Manager, you will need to
add multiple network adapters to your Terminal Server and define a different
connection for each adapter.

Security
--------

Low encryption = Microsoft 40-bit encryption from client to server only. Medium
encryption = Same as low but applies in both directions. High encryption
(Non-export) = 128-bit standard RC4 encryption High encryption (Export) = 40-bit
standard RC4 encryption

Use Default NT Authentication: This forces any Client on this connection to use
Windows NT's MSGINA. Otherwise, a 3rd party GINA might be used.

Autologon
---------

If a correct user name, domain, and password are entered here, clients will
automatically log on as this user after connection. There are obvious drawbacks
to this approach (for example, profiles, home directories). However, note that,
because clients are identified to the system by their unique SessionIDs, not
their logon names, it is possible for all client users to use the same logon
name.

Initial Program
---------------

Here you can specify a program that will run for every Client user after
connecting and logging on.

If a program is specified here, it is the ONLY application that runs on this
connection. The user will connect, log on, and run this application (provided
security is not an issue) but will get no desktop. When the user closes the
application, the session is terminated. This can be a very useful feature in a
single application environment.

User Profile Overrides: Disable Wallpaper
-----------------------------------------

Disabling wallpaper can significantly decrease screen redraw times. This is
especially useful for clients connecting over RAS.

On a Broken or Timed out Connection...
--------------------------------------

If a connection is lost or times out, you have the options of disconnecting the
session, which leaves the session intact so the user can reconnect and keep
working, or you can reset the connection, which terminates the session.

Reconnect Sessions Disconnected...
----------------------------------

This option is used for Citrix direct-serial-port connecting devices only.

From Any Client: If your session is disconnected at one device, you can reconnect
from any Client device.

From This Client Only: If you session is disconnected, you cannot reconnect from
another Client device.

Shadowing
---------

This feature is only available with the Citrix ICA client.

Another feature of Connection Configuration is the Security/Permissions menu.

Users or groups can be assigned permissions to the connection. Permissions are
cumulative except for No Access, so a user who normally has guest access but who
is a member of a group with full access will receive full access.

No Access
---------

As you might expect, this means you have no access to the connection.

Guest Access
------------

This permits logging on and logging off only. Guests cannot disconnect sessions
or reconnect to disconnected sessions.

User Access
-----------

This allows users to:

- Log on or log off.
- Query information through Terminal Server Administrator or at a command
  prompt with the Query command.
- Send messages through Terminal Server Administrator.
- Reconnect to disconnected sessions.
- Disconnect their own session (leaving it resident on the Terminal Server).

Full Access
-----------

This allows all of the above plus permission to:

- Shadow (ICA Clients only)
- Reset sessions
- Delete sessions

Along with Guest, User, and Full permissions, there is a more granular set of
permissions called Special Access that is used to grant each of the above
individually.
