-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some of the new features added to the Class Browser in
Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- In the new Class Browser, the splitters allow you to resize the Treeview and
  description areas.
- The new Class Browser provides more detailed information, as compared to the
  Class Browser for Visual FoxPro 5.0, when opening type libraries such as OLB,
  TLB, DLL, OCX, EXE, and so forth. The Class Browser is now comparable to the
  Visual Basic version 5.0 Object Browser, similar to the one included in
  Office 97 VBA.

Example 1
---------

Open Vfp6.exe in the Class Browser to view the entire Visual FoxPro 6.0
automation server object model. Note that the Class Browser displays more
collections as compared to Visual FoxPro 5.0. The Visual FoxPro 6.0 Class
Browser also displays information for the selected Collection, Property, Event,
or Method in the description pane, at the bottom. This is particularly useful
for seeing all the related member and collection interfaces of the new Project
Manager hooks.

Example 2
---------

- If a specific Property, Event or Method (PEM) in a type library has help
  associated with it, you can right-click and select Help or press the space
  bar when you select the item, which opens help for that topic.

- The Redefine dialog in the new Class Browser, for selecting a specific class
  to redefine, no longer requires you to type in the class name. The Redefine
  dialog now uses the get class dialog.

- Right-clicking the Class Browser/Component Gallery button (to the left of the
  Open button) displays a history list, up to 32 items, of the recent items
  selected for both the Component Gallery and the Class Browser since that
  instance of Browser.app was loaded (not saved after closing, it is a per
  Browser/Gallery window list only). If you select a Class Browser item when in
  the component gallery mode, Gallery switches to the Class Browser
  automatically and that item (class or member) is selected. If the VCX for
  that item is no longer open, that VCX (or file) is automatically added to the
  current view then selected. The same applies to Component Gallery catalogs
  and items.

- The Class Browser and the Component Gallery shortcut menus now have a menu
  item called "New Window", which loads a new instance of the Class Browser (or
  Gallery) and loads the current files in the view and selects the same item
  (kind of a window clone feature). When in the Class Browser mode, there is a
  shortcut menu item called "New Component Gallery" that opens a new Component
  Gallery window and opens the same catalogs and selects the same item as in
  the current Gallery window. When in the Component Gallery mode, there is a
  shortcut menu item called "New Class Browser" that opens a new Class Browser
  window and opens the same files and selects the same item as in the current
  browser window.

- Exporting the class definition code is enhanced. In the Visual FoxPro 5.x
  Class Browser, clicking the View Class Code button displays the class code in
  a modal Visual FoxPro edit window. In Visual FoxPro 6.0, when you click the
  View Class code button, a modaless form appears over the Class Browser area
  containing the class code, and is auto- refreshed if you select a different
  class in the left pane. Besides that, selecting a different method from the
  same class also auto- refreshes and positions the cursor in the View Class
  code window. This window can be resized, minimized, and so forth. If you
  close the Class Browser, the window automatically closes.

- If you right-click the View Class code button, using Microsoft Internet
  Explorer 4.0 or higher, the class code displays in the Internet Explorer Web
  browser control and the text appears in HTML. If you are using Microsoft
  Internet Explorer 3.0 (or you do not have Internet Explorer), then a Visual
  FoxPro EditBox class displays the class code.

- The Export option from the Class Browser shortcut menu now allows you to save
  the file using HTM or HTML extensions that automatically generate HTML
  instead of plain text for the class code definition.
