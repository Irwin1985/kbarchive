SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the Terminal Server administrator tool, Application
Security. This tool is used to limit user applications to an explicit set of
executables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This utility is very powerful. Its effect is similar to setting a system policy
that allows users to run only specific applications. The difference is that the
system policy only watches over the shell. That is, if your application allows
you to return to a command prompt, the system policy will not prevent users from
running an application from the prompt. Application Security does not have this
limitation.

The Application Security application lets the administrator decide exactly which
programs clients can execute. However, while this feature gives the
administrator a great deal of control, the administrator must manually authorize
every executable that the client will run. This may be a good solution if the
administrator intends for clients to run only a few applications. However, if
the clients will be running more than a few applications, the administrator may
find that using policies and profiles or an NTFS file and directory permissions
is a better solution.

You can start the Application Security application from the
Start/Programs/Administrative Tools menu, or at the command prompt with the
APPSEC command. When you start the utility, you first have the option to enable
or disable security. This gives administrators a quick way to turn off security
if something does not work.

If Application Security is set so that a user can run no applications, after
security has been enabled, a client can still attempt to connect to the Terminal
Server. Administrators can always connect, because Application Security does not
affect them. Non- administrative clients will receive an error when they attempt
to log on:

  An error (193) occurred while creating user logon. Failing component:
  explorer.exe.

When you click OK, the client will terminate.

At the Terminal Server, the administrator can add Explorer.exe to the list of
authorized applications. To do this, run the Application Security application
and choose ADD. Browse for the application or enter the path:

  drive:\systemroot\explorer.exe

If the non-administrator user tries to connect to the Terminal Server at this
point, an error similar to the following will occur:

  D:\Winnt\System32\SysTray.Exe is not a valid Windows NT application.

Systray is the application that runs the Task bar.

This is the standard error message seen when users attempt to run unauthorized
applications. Occasionally, the error will occur without a file name being
displayed (&lt;blank&gt; is not a valid Windows NT application). If this
happens, the administrator needs to look at the properties for the unauthorized
application, to determine which executable needs to be added in Application
Security.

With Explorer.exe and SysTray.exe authorized, the client should be able to view
the Desktop. Some functions (such as Find) that are part of Windows Explorer
will run, but most will generate the "not a valid Windows NT application" error
until the administrator authorizes the application.
