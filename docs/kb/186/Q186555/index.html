Error 2200
----------

  This workstation is already logged on to the local-area network.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. A user is already
logged on at this workstation.

Action: To see who is currently logged on at the workstation, type:

  "NET CONFIG WORKSTATION" (without the quotation marks)

Error 2201
----------

  The workstation is not logged on to the local-area network.

Error 2202
----------

  The user name or group name parameter is invalid.

Explanation: You specified an invalid user name or group name.

Action: Use a different user name or group name.

Error 2203
----------

  The password parameter is invalid.

Explanation: You specified an invalid password.

Action: Use a valid password.

Error 2204
----------

  The logon processor did not add the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. Your user name was
not added as a new message alias for one of the following reasons:

- The Messenger service is not started on your workstation.

- Your user name and your workstation's computer name are the same, and your
  workstation's computer name is already a message alias.

- Your user name is in use as a message alias on another computer on the
  network. In this case, you cannot receive messages at the local workstation
  using this name.

Action: Start the Messenger service on your workstation if it is not already
started. Then use the NET NAME command to add your user name as a message alias.
If your user name is being used as a message alias on another computer, delete
the alias on that computer. Then use the NET NAME command to add your user name
as a message alias on this computer.

Error 2205
----------

  The logon processor did not add the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. Your user name is
already established as a message alias. Either your user name and computer name
are the same, or your user name is in use as a message alias on another computer
on the network. If your user name is being used as a message alias on another
computer, you cannot receive messages at the local workstation using this name.

Action: If your user name is being used as a message alias on another computer,
delete the alias on that computer. Then log on again at this computer.

Error 2206
----------

  The logoff processor did not delete the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The message alias
corresponding to your user name was not deleted. Either your user name is the
same as the computer name, or your user name is being used as a message alias on
some other network computer.

Action: No action is needed.

Error 2207
----------

The logoff processor did not delete the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The message alias
corresponding to your user name was not deleted because your user name is the
same as the computer name.

Action: No action is needed.

Error 2208
----------

NOTE: Error 2208 is not a valid error message.

Error 2209
----------

  Network logons are paused.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. An administrator
has paused the Netlogon service. No one can log on until the Netlogon service is
continued.

Action: The administrator must continue the Netlogon service by typing the
following command:

  "NET CONTINUE NETLOGON" (without the quotation marks)

Error 2210
----------

  A centralized logon-server conflict occurred.

Explanation: You cannot start the Netlogon service on this server because a
server in the domain with an earlier version the software is running the

the Netlogon service on all servers in the domain running earlier versions of
the software.

for your account may contain unrecognized commands or commands that could not
run.

Action: Ask your network administrator to review your logon script.

Error 2214
----------

  The logon server was not specified. Your computer will be logged on as
  STANDALONE.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The logon was not
validated by a logon server.

Action: No action is needed.

Error 2215
----------

already has a logon domain established.

Action: To log on in a different domain, you must first log off from the current
domain and then log on again to a different domain.

Error 2217
----------

  The logon server could not validate the logon.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action

editor from File Manager.

Error 2226
----------

  This operation is only allowed on the primary domain controller of the
