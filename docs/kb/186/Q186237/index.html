SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to copy Word 97 AutoCorrect entries from one computer
to another.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use one of the following methods to share AutoCorrect entries between
computers.

Method 1: Use the Autocorrect Utility (Preferred Method)

that has the same name as an AutoCorrect entry on the source computer. All other
AutoCorrect entries are added to the AutoCorrect List on the destination
computer.

NOTE: The AutoCorrect Utility is part of the Macros8 template located in the
Macros folder. If you do not have the Macros folder installed, you need to rerun
Setup and install the Macro templates.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

The AutoCorrect entries from the other computer will now be available.

Method 2: Manually Copy the Autocorrect List
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: This procedure replaces the existing AutoCorrect List on the destination
computer with the AutoCorrect List from the source computer. In other words, the
existing AutoCorrect List on the Destination computer will be lost.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
AutoCorrect entries are stored in three locations: the registry, the Normal.dot
template file, and an AutoCorrect list (&lt;username&gt;.acl) file.

Copying the AutoCorrect List on the Source Computer
---------------------------------------------------

On the computer that has the AutoCorrect list that you want to copy, use the
following steps:

1. To export the registry key, do the following:
  a. Quit all programs.

  b. Click the Windows Start button, and then click Run.

  c. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then
     click OK.

  d. Select the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\AutoCorrect

     NOTE: The status bar displays the following:

  My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0
  \Common\AutoCorrect

  e. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File, type a file name, and
     then click Save.

  f. Close the registry.

2. Copy the following files to a floppy disk:
   - The exported registry file that you created in step 1-e.

   - Normal.dot (the default location for this file is C:\Program
     Files\Microsoft Office\Templates folder).

   - &lt;username&gt;.acl (located in the Windows directory).

To replace the AutoCorrect list on the destination computer:

1. Rename the original Normal.dot file (the default location for this file is
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates folder), and then copy the
  Normal.dot template from the floppy disk to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
  Office\Templates folder.

2. Rename the &lt;username&gt;.acl file (located in the Windows folder), and
  then copy the &lt;username&gt;.acl from the floppy disk to the Windows
  folder. Then rename the &lt;username&gt;.acl file you just copied to the
  Windows folder to the correct &lt;username&gt;.acl.

  NOTE: The &lt;username&gt; should be the same as the login name for the
  computer.

  NOTE: When you replace the &lt;username&gt;.acl file on your system with the
  &lt;username&gt;.acl file that contains the AutoCorrect entries you want to
  share, all of the AutoCorrect entries you had on this system will be lost and
  will be replaced with the new AutoCorrect entries you are sharing.

3. On the Registry menu, click Import Registry File, select the exported
  registry file on the floppy disk, and then click Open.

  You should receive a message similar to the following:

  Information in A:\&lt;filename&gt;.reg has been successfully entered into the
  registry.

  Click OK to close the message.

4. Go to the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\AutoCorrect

5. In the AutoCorrect key, select Path (on the right side of the Registry
  Editor).

6. On the Edit menu, click Modify.

7. In the Edit String dialog box, change the Value data box to the
  &lt;username&gt;.acl that you typed in step 2, and then click OK.

  NOTE: Make sure you specify the path to the &lt;username&gt;.acl file in the
  Value data box. For example: "C:\Windows\&lt;username&gt;.acl" (without the
  quotation marks).

8. On the Registry menu, click Exit to quit the Registry Editor.

When you start Word, the AutoCorrect List from the other computer will now be
available.
