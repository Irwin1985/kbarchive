SUMMARY
=======

This article provides the steps for implementing OLE Drag and Drop in manual
mode to drag the caption of a command button to a text box. The article also
features the Data Object methods ClearData, SetData and the changing of mouse
cursors. This article is a more extensive version of the Microsoft Knowledge
Base article Q185654, "HOWTO: Starting OLE Drag &amp; Drop In Manual Mode". The
steps and the information in this article are the same as those in Q185654.
However, there are many enhancements in this article. If you are new to OLE Drag
and Drop, we recommend that you start with Q185654.

This article does not cover the background for OLE Drag and Drop. For more
information on OLE Drag and Drop, please see Chapter 31: Interoperability and
the Internet in the Microsoft Visual FoxPro "Programmer's Guide," version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The steps below illustrate how to implement OLE Drag and Drop in manual mode to
drag the caption of a Command button to a Text box. In the steps where you add
code to the various events and methods, the LPARAMETERS lines shown are already
there by default. Do not add the lines a second time.

1. Create a new form and save the form. Be sure the default directory is set to
  the folder where the form is saved.

2. Add two command buttons and a text box.

3. Select the command button with the caption of "Command2" and change the
  caption to "Reset Controls".

4. Place the following code in the Click event of Command2:

        Thisform.Text1.Value=SPACE(10)
        Thisform.Command1.Caption="Text To Drag"

5. Copy the following files from the Visual Studio\Common\Graphics folders
  specified to the folder where the form is saved:

     \Icons\Misc\Eye.ico
     \Cursors\H_move.cur
     \Cursors\H_we.cur

6. Set the following properties of Command1:

        Caption="Text To Drag"
        OLEDragPicture="eye.ico"

7. Add the following code to the Click event of Command1:

        WAIT WINDOW "Hello"

8. Add the following code to the MouseDown event of Command1:

        LPARAMETERS nButton, nShift, nXCoord, nYCoord

        IF nButton=2
           *This.OLEDrag(.F.)
           This.OLEDrag(.T.)
        ENDIF

  This code checks to see if the right mouse button is down. If the right mouse
  button is down, the code calls the OLEDrag method. You can call the OLEDrag
  method with either true or false. The difference is shown later in this
  article.

9. Add the following code to the OLEDrag method of Command1:

        LPARAMETERS lDetectDrag

        IF lDetectDrag
           This.ForeColor=RGB(0,255,64)
        ELSE
           This.ForeColor=RGB(255,0,255)
        ENDIF

  The code above changes the color of the caption text of the command button. It
  is included here as a visual confirmation that the method is firing.

10. Add the following code to the OLEStartDrag event of Command1:

        LPARAMETERS oDataObject, nEffect

        nEffect=3
        oDataObject.ClearData
        oDataObject.SetData("Hello",1)

  In this event code, you clear the data in the Data Object, which in this case
  means that you clear the caption of the command button is from the Data
  Object. Next, it sets the caption to the word "Hello." for illustration
  purposes only. If you need to drop the actual command button caption into
  the text box, you would not use this code. The nEffect parameter is set to
  3, which is the sum of 1 (for copy) and 2 (for move). The nEffect parameter
  is an output parameter that you pass to the OLEDragOver event of the drop
  target. By default, it would be 7 (copy+move+link). Since this specific code
  example does not support linking, nEffect is set to 3.

  When using OLE Drag and Drop in automatic mode, the OLEStartDrag event is the
  first event to fire. In manual mode, the MouseDown and OLEDrag methods have
  to run first to start OLEStartDrag.

11. Add the following code to the OLEGiveFeedback event of Command1:

        LPARAMETERS nEffect, eMouseCursor
          DO CASE
           CASE nEffect=1
              eMouseCursor="H_we.cur"
           CASE nEffect=2
              eMouseCursor="H_move.cur"
          ENDCASE

  The code in this method checks the nEffect parameter. Visual FoxPro
  automatically sets the nEffect parameter to either 1 or 2, depending on
  whether or not the control key is depressed. The mouse cursor is then set
  appropriately. Note that the use of these cursors are for illustration
  purposes only.

12. Add the following code to the OLECompleteDrag event of Command1:

        LPARAMETERS nEffect

        DO CASE
        CASE nEffect=2
           This.Caption="You Moved Me"
        CASE nEffect=1
           This.Caption="You Copied Me"
        CASE nEffect=0
           This.Caption="You Didn't Drop Me"
        ENDCASE
        This.ResetToDefault("ForeColor")
        Thisform.Text1.BackColor=RGB(200,224,216)

  This code checks to see if you should copy or move the text from the command
  button. The OLEDragDrop event of the drop target (the text box) sets the
  nEffect parameter and then passes it to the OLECompleteDrag of the drag
  source (the command button). The programmer then needs to take appropriate
  action in the OLECompleteDrag.

13. Set the OLEDropMode property of the text box to 1 - Enabled.

14. Add the following code to the OLEDragOver event of the text box:

        LPARAMETERS oDataObject, nEffect, nButton, nShift, ;
           nXCoord, nYCoord, nState

        DO CASE
        CASE nState=0
           This.BackColor=RGB(10,255,10)
           IF oDataObject.GetFormat(1)    &amp;&amp; CF_TEXT
                  This.OLEDropHasData=1
                  This.OLEDropEffects=3     &amp;&amp; Copy and Move
           ELSE
                  This.OLEDropHasData=0
                  This.OLEDropEffects=0
           ENDIF
        CASE nState=1
        CASE nState=2
        ENDCASE

  This code fires when you drag data over the text box. This sets the nState
  parameter to zero. The event checks the Data Object to see if there is text
  data in the object. If so, it sets the OLEDropHasData and OLEDropEffects
  properties. The other cases for nState without any code are for illustration
  purposes only.

15. Add the following code to the OLEDragDrop event of the text box:

        LPARAMETERS oDataObject, nEffect, nButton, nShift, nXCoord, nYCoord
        LOCAL nOperation

        IF nShift=2        &amp;&amp; Control is down
            nOperation=1   &amp;&amp; DropEffect_Copy
        ELSE
            nOperation=2   &amp;&amp; DropEffect_Move
        ENDIF

        DO CASE
        CASE oDataObject.GetFormat(1)    &amp;&amp; CF_TEXT
            This.Value=oDataObject.GetData(1)
            NODEFAULT
        ENDCASE
        nEffect=nOperation

  This code fires when you drop data onto the text box. The first check that
  takes place is for the nShift parameter. If the Control key is down, the
  nEffect parameter sets to 1 for copy, otherwise it is 2 for move. The
  nEffect parameter is an output parameter so it passes to the OLECompleteDrag
  event of the drag source, Command1. After the check of the nShift parameter,
  a check for the Data Object for text data with the oDataObject.GetFormat(1)
  code occurs. If the check finds text, the Value property of the text box
  changes to text data. The inclusion of the NODEFAULT keyword here has two
  purposes. First, if it is not, a shortcut menu appears when you drop the
  data. Based on the settings in the code above, the menu has options for Copy
  Here, Move Here and Cancel. This menu essentially does nothing as there has
  been no allowances made for it in the OLECompleteDrag event of the drag
  source. Second, if you do not include NODEFAULT, and select either Copy Here
  or Move Here from the shortcut menu, the text you are dropping into the text
  box, appears twice. "Hello Hello" is what displays. This is because you set
  the Value property to "Hello" in the code and then the default drop behavior
  of the text box adds the second "Hello" to the Value property.

16. Save and run the form. Right-click the "Text To Drag" command button and
  drag and drop into the text box. Use the Reset Controls command button to
  reset. Try holding down the Control key while right dragging.

  The key program code in the example created above for starting OLE Drag and
  Drop in manual mode is the code shown in step 8 for the MouseDown event of
  the drag source. Also note that the OLEDragMode property of the "Text To
  Drag" command button is set to 0 - Manual.

  As stated in step 8, you can call the OLEDrag method with either True (.T.)
  or False (.F.). If you call OLEDrag with False, the OLEStartDrag event fires
  immediately. If you call OLEDrag with True, there is a slight delay before
  the OLEStartDrag event fires. Follow these steps to see the difference.

17. Starting with the OLEDrag method being True, which is how it should be set
  after step 16 above, right-click the "Text To Drag" command button. There
  should be a slight delay before the eye icon appears. Try this a few times.
  It should not be necessary to reset the controls.

18. Modify the form. Open the MouseDown event of the "Text To Drag" command
  button. Remark out the This.OLEDrag(.T.) and unremark the This.OLEDrag(.F.)
  lines of code. Save and run the form.

19. Right-click the "Text To Drag" command button. Notice that the eye icon
  appears immediately. If you move the mouse, the No Drop mouse pointer also
  appears.

Try some of the changes to the example form from the list below. They illustrate
some of the features of OLE Drag and Drop. Please see the Help file
documentation for further explanations of the options in the OLE Drag and Drop
events.

1. As discussed in step 15 above, remark out the NODEFAULT keyword in the
  OLEDragDrop event of the text box. Run the form and drag the "Text To Drag"
  command button over the text box. Experiment.

2. Try not clearing and setting the data in the OLEStartDrag event of the "Text
  To Drag" command button. See step 10 above. Also, try not setting nEffect in
  the OLEStartDrag event.

3. Try setting the OLEDropEffects for the text box to 1 or 2. See step 14 above
  for the code. Try this in conjunction with removing the NODEFAULT keyword
  from the OLEDragDrop event of the text box. Try setting OLEDropEffects to 4
  and 7. OLEDropEffect of 4 is Link. Seven is Copy, Move or Link.
