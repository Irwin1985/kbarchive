  file should be increased.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The server was
unable to create a thread.

Action: Increase the value of the THREADS entry in the server's Config.sys file.
The range for this value is 64 to 512.

a process and its value for INTEGRITY is TREE.

Action: For the directory to be replicated, be sure it is not the current
directory of any process.

Error 3207
----------

  The server cannot export directory *** to client ***. It is exported from
  another server.

Explanation: This server found that another server is exporting the listed
directory to the listed import server.

Action: Be sure that only one computer is configured as the export server of this
directory for the listed import computer. Check the EXPORTLIST and EXPORTPATH
entries in the configuration files of the export servers and the IMPORTLIST and
IMPORTPATH entries in the configuration file of the import server.

Error 3208
----------

  The replication server could not update directory *** from the source on ***
  due to error ***.

Explanation: An error prevented this server from updating the listed directory
from the export server. The directory cannot be updated until the problem is
