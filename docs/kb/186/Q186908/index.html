SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic does not provide a built-in mechanism for allowing programmers to
determine when their application either looses or gains user focus. At times
though, it may be necessary or desirable to be alerted when either of these
events take place. By using the AddressOf operator, you can implement
"subclassing" to determine when these events occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE SAMPLE CODE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR
OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this sample code "as is" without warranty of any
kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.

WARNING: The following steps demonstrate how to create a sample application that
is capable of determining when an application as a whole looses or gains focus.
To achieve this functionality, you must use subclassing to detect when the
WM_ACTIVATEAPP message occurs. For more information on subclassing, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q168795 : HOWTO: Hook Into a Window's Messages Using AddressOf

NOTE: Failure to unhook a window before its destruction results in application
errors, Invalid Page Faults, or data loss. This occurs because the new
WindowProc function that is being pointed to no longer exists, but the window
has not been notified of the change. Always unhook the subclassed window upon
unloading the subclassed form or exiting the application.

This is especially important when you use Visual Basic to debug an application
that includes subclassing. Pressing the End button or selecting End from the Run
menu without unhooking may cause an Invalid Page Fault and close Microsoft
Visual Basic.

Steps to Create Sample Application
----------------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Paste the following code into the code window for Form1:

        Sub Form_Load()
           'Store handle to this form's window
           gHW = Me.hWnd

           'Call procedure to begin capturing messages for this window
           Hook
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
           'Call procedure to stop intercepting the messages for this window
           Unhook
        End Sub

3. Add a standard module to the project.

4. Paste the following code into the module:

        Option Explicit

        Declare Function CallWindowProc Lib "user32" Alias _
          "CallWindowProcA" (ByVal lpPrevWndFunc As Long, _
          ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal Msg As Long, _
          ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

        Declare Function SetWindowLong Lib "user32" Alias "SetWindowLongA" _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal nIndex As Long, _
          ByVal dwNewLong As Long) As Long

        Public Const WM_ACTIVATEAPP = &amp;H1C
        Public Const GWL_WNDPROC = -4

        Global lpPrevWndProc As Long
        Global gHW As Long

        Public Sub Hook()
           'Establish a hook to capture messages to this window
           lpPrevWndProc = SetWindowLong(gHW, GWL_WNDPROC, _
             AddressOf WindowProc)
        End Sub

        Public Sub Unhook()
           Dim temp As Long

           'Reset the message handler for this window
           temp = SetWindowLong(gHW, GWL_WNDPROC, lpPrevWndProc)
        End Sub

        Function WindowProc(ByVal hw As Long, ByVal uMsg As Long, _
          ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
           'Check for the ActivateApp message

           If uMsg = WM_ACTIVATEAPP Then
               'Check to see if Activating the application
               If wParam &lt;&gt; 0 Then
                   'Application Received Focus
                   Form1.Caption = "Focus Restored"
               Else
                   'Application Lost Focus
                   Form1.Caption = "Focus Lost"
               End If
           End If

           'Pass message on to the original window message handler
           WindowProc = CallWindowProc(lpPrevWndProc, hw, uMsg, wParam, _
             lParam)
        End Function

5. Save and run the sample.

6. Click on another application (such as the Windows Desktop), and note that the
  caption of Form1 indicates that focus was lost. (If the Form is not visible,
  refer to the Form caption in the Windows taskbar.)

7. Click on the sample application, and note that the caption of Form1 indicates
  that focus was received.
