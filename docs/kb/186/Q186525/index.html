- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

DOSKBD tunes the MS-DOS keyboard polling detection algorithm for a specific
MS-DOS execution environment (window). After optimum values are selected for the
application, you can set up a batch file that runs automatically before the
application is started.

Syntax
------

doskbd

doskbd /defaults

doskbd [/DetectProbationCount:nnn] [/InProbationCount:nnn] [/msAllowed:nnn]
[/msSleep:nnn] [/BusymsAllowed:nnn] [/msProbationTrial:nnn]
[/msGoodProbationEnd:nnn] [/DetectionInterval:nnn] [/StartMonitor [appname]
| /StopMonitor] [/query] [/?]

Parameters
----------

none

The valid range for all values represented by nnn is 0 to 32767.

/defaults

  Resets all tuning parameters to their default values.

/DetectProbationCount:nnn

  Specifies the number of peeks in a system tick required to force the
  application into the probation state and to sleep the application (default
  value: 80).

/InProbationCount:nnn

  Specifies the number of peeks in a system tick required to sleep the
  application when the application is in the probation state. Should be less
  than or equal to the DetectProbationCount value (default value: 35).

/msAllowed:nnn

  Specifies the number of milliseconds the application is allowed to be in the
  probation state before the system starts sleeping the application (default
  value: 0).

/msSleep:nnn

  Specifies the number of milliseconds that the application is put to sleep
  (default value: 100).

/BusymsAllowed:nnn

  When the application is detected as "busy," the application cannot be put
  into the probation state for this number of milliseconds (default value: 60).

/msProbationTrial:nnn

  When the application is in probation, DetectProbationCount is used instead of
  InProbationCount every msProbationTrial milliseconds (default value: 2500).

/msGoodProbationEnd:nnn

  When the application is in probation, it must avoid being put to sleep for
  this number of milliseconds in order to be removed from probation (default
  value: 2500).

/DetectionInterval:nnn

  Specifies the time interval (in timer ticks) used to count the number of
  polling events.

/StartMonitor [appname]

  Executes appname and gathers polling statistics.

/StopMonitor

  Stops gathering application statistics.

/query (quick)

  Suppresses the display of information about the actions being performed.

/? (help)

  Displays the syntax for the command and information about the command's
  options.

DOSKBD -- Additional Notes
--------------------------

DOSKBD changes the default settings for a single MS-DOS session. Each MS- DOS
session can have different settings. To find out the current tuning settings
(the system default settings), type doskbd.

The poll detection algorithm is driven by how many keyboard polls happen within a
detection interval. All units of time are rounded to a detection interval. If
too many keyboard polls happen within a detection interval, the application is
put into probation state and made eligible to be paused for some amount of time.
Once the application is on probation, the algorithm can be set up to pause the
application after a smaller number of polls. Applications can perform actions
that cause the system to mark the application as busy; that is, take it out of
the probation state. When the application is determined to be busy, it is
awakened. In addition, the application is taken off probation. Examples of
things that cause the application to be busy include (but are not limited to)
updating the screen, doing file I/O, and getting keyboard or mouse input.

If an application polls DetectProbationCount number of times within a given
detection interval, the application is put into probation if BusymsAllowed
number of milliseconds have elapsed since the last time the application was
detected as busy. After the application is put into probation for msAllowed
milliseconds, if it exceeds the allowed number of polls within a detection
interval, it is put to sleep for msSleep number of milliseconds.

While the application is on probation, the number of polls it is allowed is
reduced to InProbationCount from DetectProbationCount. If it exceeds the allowed
number of polls, it is put to sleep as long as msAllowed milliseconds have
elapsed since the application was first put on probation. The application is
taken off probation if msGoodProbationEnd milliseconds have elapsed since the
application was last punished. In addition, every msProbationTrial milliseconds,
the allowed number of polls in a detection interval is increased to
DetectProbationCount. As long as the application is not punished, the allowed
number of polls stays at the higher level. If the application exceeds that
level, the allowed level of polls is reduced to InProbationCount.

If doskbd is invoked with no parameters, the current tuning values are
displayed.

DOSKBD -- Examples
------------------

When adjusting the parameters, you should consider the current behavior of the
application with the current settings. To observe this, start an inactive system
with a user on the console and a remote user close to the console. Only you and
these users should be running on the system. Set up Performance Monitor to
display total system CPU% every second. Doskbd can also be used to generate
polling statistics to give baseline values for DetectProbationCount,
InProbationCount, and DetectionInterval by using the /StartMonitor option. You
should run the performance monitor on the console and the DOS application
remotely. The performance monitor should be set up to display the total system
CPU every second.

In the first scenario, the MS-DOS application is running fine for a single user
but the system slows down when more users start using the application. In this
scenario, it is possible that the polling detection is not being aggressive
enough to put the application into probation. Observe how much CPU the
application is using while doing nothing and while doing common operations. Then
exit the application and use doskbd to refine the polling parameters. The new
parameters apply to the command line that you have just run doskbd from.
Changing parameters by about 30 percent per try is recommended. This scenario
takes the CPU away from the application more aggressively. The first thing to
try is lowering DetectProbationCount and InProbationCount. If that does not help
or does not help enough, try lowering BusymsAllowed 10 milliseconds per try. The
default of msAllowed is already zero. Assuming polling is being detected, the
CPU should be significantly below 100 percent by now. At this point, it is
important to make sure that the application is still responsive in all the ways
that it will be used. If it is not responsive, you have gone too far and you
must back off some of the settings. To further reduce the CPU used, msSleep can
be increased. Use caution while increasing msSleep because some applications
become unresponsive or jerky if this value is increased too much.

Now that you have reduced the amount of CPU that the application is using (while
ensuring that the application is still responsive), the system should be able to
support more concurrent users. Some applications may use close to 100 percent
CPU regardless of how aggressive you make the polling detection. These
applications are probably not polling the keyboard or they are doing something
that causes the application to be marked busy very frequently.

Another approach can be used to control how much CPU the application gets. The
PIF editor contains Advanced Options called Multitasking Options. By lowering
the Priority numbers, the total processor time that the application gets can be
reduced. This approach is recommended only as a last resort because it is not
adaptive and will limit the amount of CPU that the application gets even when it
is trying to do useful work. These priority settings should never be changed if
polling detection is being used.

In the second scenario, too much CPU is being taken away from the application and
the application is not responsive. It is also possible that the default polling
detection parameters work fine for 99 percent of an application's use but
occasionally you do something that does not work well with the polling
detection. In that case, it is probably a mistake to change the polling
parameters for all usage of the application because the change could
significantly affect how many concurrent users are supportable. Instead, create
a special Icon/PIF/autoexec for the infrequent scenario. This will enable
maximum productivity on your system.

If an application is not getting enough CPU, the polling detection is probably
too aggressive or the application needs more time to run before being punished.
DetectProbationCount and InProbationCount can be increased to lengthen the time
it takes to detect that the application is polling. msAllowed can be increased
from zero to give the application additional execution time before it is
punished for being on probation. Another way to give the application more CPU
while it is being punished is to reduce the value of msSleep. All these
possibilities increase the amount of CPU that the application gets, which
reduces the number of users who can simultaneously do useful work on the system.
