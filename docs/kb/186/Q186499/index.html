-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help
topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the registry settings that can be used to modify
application behavior on a Terminal Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Controlling Application Execution in Execute Mode
-------------------------------------------------

Several compatibility bits can be set for an application, registry path, or .ini
file to change how a Terminal Server computer handles the merging of application
initialization data when a session is in execute mode. These compatibility bits
are set in the registry under the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
  \Terminal Server\Compatibility

  NOTE: The above registry key is all one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

There are three separate keys for applications, .ini files, and registry entries
under this registry path.

The default settings work for most applications, but can be further tuned using
the compatibility bits described below.

WARNING: These compatibility bits should only be changed if an application is not
working properly.

The first set of compatibility bits indicates the version of the application that
the settings are for. Not all combinations are useful; for example, an MS-DOS
application will never make any registry calls. Because the path to the file is
not specified, and multiple applications may use the same file name (for
example, Setup.exe and Install.exe are now regularly used for installation
programs), specifying the application type will help ensure the compatibility
settings do not affect other applications with the same file name.

Add together the values of the bits you want to set to determine the String
value. For example, to return the user name instead of the computer name for
both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of Myapp.exe, create a subkey in the registry by
performing the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
  \Terminal Server\Compatibility\Applications\Myapp

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

2. On the Edit menu, click "Add Value" (without the quotation marks), and type
  the following information:

  "Value Name: Flags of Type: REG_DWORD" (without the quotation marks)

  In the Data field, type the hex value of 11C (add 0x00000004 for 16-bit
  Windows applications, 0x00000008 for 32-bit Windows applications, 0x00000010
  to return user name instead of computer name, and 0x00000100 to disable
  registry mapping).

Applications
------------

The compatibility bits below affect the application when it is running and are
located in the following registry subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
  \Terminal Server\Compatibility\Applications\Appname

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

NOTE: Appname is the name of the application's executable file (for example, if
the executable file name for an application is Prog1.exe, Appname would be
PROG1).

Compatibility Bits:

- MS-DOS application: 0x00000001

- OS/2 application: 0x00000002

- Windows 16-bit application: 0x00000004

- Windows 32-bit application: 0x00000008

- Return user name instead of computer name: 0x00000010

- Return Terminal Server build number: 0x00000020

- Disable registry mapping for this application: 0x00000100

- Do not substitute user Windows directory: 0x00000400

- Limit the reported memory: 0x00000800

Use the "Return user name instead of computer name" flag &lt;or bit?&gt; for
applications that use the computer name as a unique identifier. This returns the
user's name to the application, thereby giving each user of the application a
unique identifier.

Use the "Disable registry mapping for this application" &lt;bit? Or flag?&gt; to
retain only one global copy of the registry variables used by the application.

The "Do not substitute user Windows directory" bit, when set, retains the
SystemRoot directory for GetWindowsDirectory API calls. The default action if
this bit is not set is to replace all paths to the Windows directory with the
path to the user's Windows directory.

.INI Files
----------

The compatibility bits below control .ini file propagation and are located in the
following registry subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
  \Terminal Server\Compatibility\IniFiles\Inifile

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

NOTE: Inifile is the name of the .ini file (for example, if the .ini file name
for an application is Prog1.ini, Inifile would be PROG1).

Compatibility Bits:

- Windows 16-bit application: 0x00000004

- Windows 32-bit application: 0x00000008

- Synchronize user .ini file to system version: 0x00000040

- Do not substitute user Windows directory: 0x00000080

The "Synchronize user .ini file to system version" bit&lt;or flag?&gt;, when set,
adds new entries from the system master .ini file when the application is
started, but does not delete any existing data in the user's .ini file. The
default action, if this bit is not set, is to overwrite the user's .ini file if
it is older than the system master .ini file.

The "Do not substitute user Windows directory" bit, when set, retains the
SystemRoot directory for file paths in the .ini file when the system master
version of the .ini file is copied to the user's Windows directory. The default
action, if this bit is not set, is to replace all paths to the Windows directory
with the path to the user's Windows directory.

Registry Paths
--------------

The compatibility bits below control registry propagation and are located in the
following registry subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
  \Terminal Server\Compatibility\RegistryEntries\PathName

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

NOTE: Pathname is the registry path under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software (for
example, if the registry variable path for an application is HKEY_CURRENT_USER
\Software\BrandX\Prog1, Pathname would be Brandx\Prog1).

Compatibility Bits:

- Windows 32-bit application: 0x00000008

- Disable registry mapping for application: 0x00000100

The "Disable registry mapping for application" bit&lt;Or flag?&gt;, when set,
adds new entries from the system master registry image when the application is
started, but does not delete any existing data in the user's registry. The
default action, if this bit is not set, is to delete and overwrite the user's
registry data if it is older than the system master registry data.
