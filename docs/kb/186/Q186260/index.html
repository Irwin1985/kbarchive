The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

Bitmap rotation is a graphic effect that Visual Basic does not natively offer.
This article shows how to rotate a given image in 90-degree increments. It
allows you to rotate any image 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees. With a little work,
the code can be modified to rotate to any angle, but that is beyond the scope of
this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample uses a function called RotateBitmap. Here is some
information about this function:

     RotateBitmap(hBitmapDC As Long, _
        lWidth As Long, _
        lHeight As Long, _
        lRadians As Long)

hBitmapDC: Handle to a device context of the image to be rotated. Upon return,
this variable will contain the device context of the rotated image.

lWidth: Width of the incoming image. Upon return contains the width of the
rotated image.

lHeight: Height of the incoming image. Upon return, contains the height of the
rotated image.

lRadians: Angle to rotate the image (in Radians). The sample shows how to convert
degrees into radians on the fly.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a Standard Module (Module1) to the project.

3. Add the following controls to Form1:

   - Two PictureBox controls

   - One Timer control

4. For the two PictureBox controls, set their AutoRedraw properties to True.

5. Copy and paste the following code in the Form's code Window:

        Option Explicit

        Dim sFileName As String     ' filename of the image being used
        Dim hBitmap As Long         ' handle to the loaded bitmap
        Dim lBMDC As Long           ' device context of the bitmap
        Dim sBitmapInfo As BITMAP   ' information on the loaded image
        Dim Degrees As Long         ' current rotation degree

        Private Sub Form_Load()

           ' set staring degrees
           Degrees = 0

           ' set the bitmap that will be used in the sample
           sFileName = "filename.bmp"  ' where filename.bmp is the bitmap
                                       ' being used

           ' load the bitmap into memory
           hBitmap = LoadImage(0, sFileName, IMAGE_BITMAP, 0, 0, _
                       LR_LOADFROMFILE Or LR_CREATEDIBSECTION)

           ' make sure the call succeeded
           If (hBitmap = 0) Then
              MsgBox "Error, Unable To Load Bitmap", vbOKOnly, _
                     "Bitmap Load Error"
              End
           End If

           ' create a device context to use when blitting the loaded bitmap
           lBMDC = CreateCompatibleDC(0)

           ' make sure our call succeeded
           If (lBMDC = 0) Then
              MsgBox "Error, Unable To Create Device Context", _
                     vbOKOnly, "Device Context Error"
              Exit Sub
           End If

           ' attach the bitmap to the device context just created
           Call SelectObject(lBMDC, hBitmap)

           ' get the information about this image
           Call GetObject(hBitmap, Len(sBitmapInfo), sBitmapInfo)

           ' blit the bitmap image onto the picturebox control
           ' on the form to show what is being worked with
           Call BitBlt(Picture1.hdc, 0, 0, sBitmapInfo.bmWidth, _
                      sBitmapInfo.bmHeight, lBMDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY)
           Picture1.Refresh

           ' set the timer and turn it on
           Timer1.Interval = 500
           Timer1.Enabled = True

        End Sub

        Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
           Dim hRotatedBitmapDC As Long    ' returned DC to the new bitmap
           Dim lWidth As Long              ' current/new width of the bitmaps
           Dim lHeight As Long             ' current/new width of the bitmaps
           Dim lRadians As Long            ' the degrees will be converted to
                                           ' - radians
           ' get the width/height of the original bitmap image
           lWidth = sBitmapInfo.bmWidth
           lHeight = sBitmapInfo.bmHeight

           ' convert the rotation degrees into radians for the
           ' rotate function
           lRadians = PI * Degrees / 180

           ' set the input var to the current bitmaps DC
           hRotatedBitmapDC = Picture1.hdc

           ' rotate the bitmap to its new degree
           RotateBitmap hRotatedBitmapDC, lWidth, lHeight, lRadians

           ' clear the second picturebox to show the rotated image
           Set Picture2.Picture = LoadPicture

           ' blit the rotated image
           Call BitBlt(Picture2.hdc, 0, 0, lWidth, lHeight, _
                      hRotatedBitmapDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY)
           Picture2.Refresh

           ' destroy the DC created for the rotated bitmap
           Call DeleteDC(hRotatedBitmapDC)

           ' increase the degree count, or reset if we have come full circle
           Degrees = Degrees + 90
           If Degrees = 360 Then
              Degrees = 0
           End If

        End Sub

6. In the Form_Load event in the above code, be sure to set the sFileName
  variable to a bitmap file on your system.

7. Add the following code to the Standard Module (Module1):

        Option Explicit

         ' refer to the MSDN for more detailed information regarding the
         ' constants used in this sample.
        Public Const IMAGE_BITMAP = &amp;O0   ' used with LoadImage to load

8. Press the F5 key to run the project.

Note that the application will load and attempt to read in the bitmap image
specified in sFileName. If successful, the image will be blitted to the first
PictureBox on the Form. Every half second, the image will then be rotated
90-degrees and blitted into the second PictureBox.
