MORE INFORMATION
================

Error 3710
----------

  An error occurred while opening the Help file.

Explanation: Windows NT could not find a file of Help information.

Action: Be sure the Net.hlp file is in the same directory as Net.exe, which is
usually in your system directory. This directory should also be on your search
path (specified by the PATH command). If you cannot find the Help file on your
computer, contact your network administrator. Your administrator should copy the
Help file from the Windows NT distribution disks to your computer.

Error 3711
----------

  The Help file is empty.

Explanation: Help file, Net.hlp, is damaged. The file is usually in your system
directory.

Action: Contact your network administrator. Your administrator should copy the

problem persists, contact technical support.

Error 3712
----------

  The Help file is corrupted.

Explanation: Help file, Net.hlp, is damaged. The file is usually in your system

Help file from the Windows NT distribution disks to your computer. If the
problem persists, contact technical support.

Otherwise, retry the command. If the problem persists, ask your network
administrator if the domain controller is running.

  software.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. You must have
administrative privilege on the remote computer to perform this task because
that computer is running a previous version of LAN Manager.

Action: To complete this task, ask your administrator to give you administrative
privilege on the remote computer, or have that computer upgraded to Windows NT.
