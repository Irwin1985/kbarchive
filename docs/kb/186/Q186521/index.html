SUMMARY
=======

The default home directory location is the user's profile. This may not be
efficient if the user stores a large amount of data in the home directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, all users have a home directory defined for them. The default
location is the user's profile, located under %systemroot%\profiles\%username%.
The home directory is called "Windows," and contains a necessary subdirectory
called "System." These are critical directories. The system writes user-specific
application INI files to the user's Windows directory, and by default, refers
any application requesting the system Windows directory to the user's Windows
directory.

Users typically make use of a home directory to save files.

If users do not save files in their home directories, then the default location
of the user's profile may not be an issue. However, if the user stores files in
the Windows home director, the user needs a new home directory path outside of
the user profile.

When a user logs on, the entire profile is parsed and loaded, including any files
in the default home directory. If you use roaming profiles, for example, the
profile and the entire set of files in the home directory will be copied to the
profile cache (the user's profile under %SystemRoot%\Profiles\%UserName%) at
every logon attempt. This can take considerable time and resources, especially
if the roaming profile is stored across the network.

For these reasons, it is a good idea to specify a new location for home
directories in User Manager for each user. For example, create a directory on
the computer running Terminal Server called HOMEDIRS, and give the group called
"Everyone," Change permissions. Then you can specify the home directory location
as C:\Homedirs\%UserName% in User Manager. The system will automatically create
the username subdirectory and give it appropriate permissions (Administrators
receive Special Access permission with directory-level access only, and the
specific users receive Full Control). The default permissions allow
Administrators to copy files into the home directory, but not to read or delete
files there.

The Windows and Windows\System directories will also be automatically created in
the user's home directory. Administrators will be given Full Control of these
directories (and MUST have full control).

After the home directory is created, copy any files in the existing home
directory under the user's profile to the new home directory (make sure you
check the Windows and Windows\System subdirectories for any files). You can then
delete the old home directory.
