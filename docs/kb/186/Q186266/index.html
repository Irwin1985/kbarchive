-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft eMbedded Visual Basic, version 3.0 
- Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE) and eMbedded Visual Basic are
similar to Visual Basic in both functionality and design. However, several
Visual Basic features have not been implemented because of limitations in the
Windows CE operating system and other factors. This article addresses the
restrictions imposed by these limitations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IDE AND PROJECT STRUCTURE
-------------------------

- Visual Basic class files are not supported.

- Designers and insertable objects, such as Excel, are not supported.

- The Auto Increment checkbox on the Make tab is not supported.

- The Standard, Edit, and Menu Bar toolbars can be customized, but the changes
  are not persisted. This means that the next time you launch the design
  environment, it will launch with its default settings.

- The Debug toolbar is not available (VBCE6 only).

- Some properties and methods are provided by the IDE but are not supported.

- Icons cannot be specified in the Project Properties dialog.

- The menu editor is not available (eVB only). Use either the CommandBar or
  MenuBar (PocketPC platforms) for this functionality.

OBJECTS AND CONTROLS
--------------------

- ActiveX components cannot be created.

- ActiveX controls written for Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0 cannot be used.

- The Printer object is not supported.

LANGUAGE FEATURES
-----------------

- Help files are not supported.

- The only variable type is Variant. Although variables can be declared as a
  specific type, this is only for Intellisense help.

- Duplicate sub or functions, such as a sub-sub, function-function, or
  sub-function combination, are not supported.

- Conditional compilation is not supported.

- Command line arguments are not supported.

- The Next statement does not take an argument (VBCE6 only).

- Only lete binding is supported.

RUNNING AND DEBUGGING CODE
--------------------------

- Programs are compiled before they are run.

- Most language errors are displayed only at run-time.

- Arrays may not get initialized when there is little free memory.

- The Debug object is not supported.

- An external debugger is provided.

NOTE: Adding an existing Visual Basic code module or existing Visual Basic forms,
including those listed in the Add Form dialog, to a Windows CE Toolkit for
Visual Basic or eMbedded Visual Basic project is generally not supported because
the code module or form may use controls and/or language syntax not supported by
Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic.
