-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Standard MS-DOS applications will use nearly 100 percent of the system CPU
because they constantly look for keyboard input, whether the application is
active (checking for keyboard input to be more responsive) or idle. Obviously,
no application should be allowed to monopolize the CPU. In a Terminal Server
environment, keyboard polling can make an MS-DOS application sluggish for a
single user, or can seriously limit the number of simultaneous users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two ways to modify an application's keyboard polling. The first is to
modify the application's properties, and the second is to use the MS- DOS
utility, DOSKBD.

Determining that a Problem Exists
---------------------------------

Application performance problems will be obvious to the user, but to get a more
precise picture of application resource use, use Performance Monitor. If you
suspect an MS-DOS application is monopolizing the CPU, Performance Monitor can
tell you precisely how much CPU time the application is using. To avoid false
readings, make sure that Terminal Server is running as few system-processes as
possible. Run only Performance Monitor and a single client connection from which
to run the MS-DOS application.

In Performance Monitor, open a graph that displays total system CPU usage, every
second. Note the CPU usage before you have the client run the MS-DOS
application. This will give you a baseline.

Now have the client run the MS-DOS application and note the increased CPU usage.

Lowering CPU Usage through Application Properties
-------------------------------------------------

Have the client close the MS-DOS application. At the Terminal Server, run Windows
NT Explorer, and highlight the application's executable file. Right- click this
file and select Properties from the popup list. On the Properties Screen, select
MISC (miscellaneous). You will find a slider bar called Idle Sensitivity. This
setting tells the system how much CPU time to allow the application to use while
it is idle. Low sensitivity allows the application to use more CPU time. High
sensitivity reduces allowable CPU time. In this case, you want to increase
sensitivity. Every application will be different, so determining the correct
sensitivity level will necessitate some trial and error.

NOTE: If you are familiar with Citrix Winframe, you may have used the PIF Editor
to modify an MS-DOS application's properties. Terminal Server uses the Windows
NT 4.0 method: right-click the application name in Windows NT Explorer, and open
the application's Properties. Whenever properties are changed, an application
shortcut is created. You can place this shortcut on the user's desktop, folder,
or START Menu. Launching the application from the shortcut activates the
properties you select. However, running the application's executable from a
command line will not activate the properties you select.

After you modify the application properties and exit the Properties screen, a
shortcut will be created with a default name identical to the application
executable name. Use this shortcut to start the application. You can modify the
shortcut name if you want to create multiple instances with different
properties.

Have the client run this shortcut while you monitor Performance Monitor for
decreased CPU use.

NOTE: Modifying the application properties affects ONLY idle time. It does not
decrease CPU use while the application is active (for example, when the user is
typing).

The DOSKBD Utility
------------------

The DOSKBD utility can decrease an MS-DOS application's CPU usage from keyboard
polling during active and idle times. It is also much more complex than simply
modifying the application properties. What is also much more complex?

DOSKBD works by monitoring how frequently the MS-DOS application checks the
keyboard buffer for input. If it checks too frequently during a specific
interval (by default, a single system timer tick), the application is suspended,
or put to sleep, for a short period of time.

The default values for DOSKBD are in effect whenever an MS-DOS application is
started. The defaults, switches, and usage are detailed below. If you need to
modify any of the default values, run DOSKBD with the new values from the same
command prompt (or within the same MS-DOS session) that you use to run the
application. The easiest way to accomplish this is to create a batch file that
runs DOSKBD with the appropriate settings and then runs the application. An
alternative to using a batch file is to create a custom autoexec.nt file and
associate it with the MS-DOS application's shortcut properties.

By using batch files to run your MS-DOS applications, you can set different
values for DOSKBD as needed.

These are the default values for DOSKBD. These are the values in effect, whenever
an MS-DOS window is opened.

- Number of milliseconds in a system timer tick is 10

- DetectionInterval = 1 tick(s) (10 msec)

- DetectProbationCount= 80

- InProbationCount= 35

- msAllowed= 0

- msSleep= 100

- BusymsAllowed= 60

- msProbationTrial= 2500

- msGoodProbationEnd= 2500

The poll detection algorithm is driven by how many keyboard polls happen within a
polling detection interval. All units of time are rounded to a system timer
tick. If too many keyboard polls occur within a detection interval, the
application is put on probation and punished by being put to sleep for a
predetermined amount of time. When the application is on probation, the
algorithm can be set up to punish the application after a fewer number of
polls.

Activities such as updating the screen, doing file I/O, or getting mouse or
keyboard activity cause the system to mark the application as busy. When the
application is determined to be busy, it is awakened if it is being punished. In
addition, the application is taken off probation.

If an application polls DetectProbationCount number of times within a given timer
tick, the application is put into probation if BusymsAllowed number of
milliseconds have elapsed since the last time the application was detected as
busy. When the application is put into probation for msAllowed milliseconds, it
is punished for exceeding the allowed number of polls within a timer tick by
being put to sleep for msSleep number of milliseconds.

While the application is on probation, the number of allowed polls is reduced to
InProbationCount from DetectProbationCount. After exceeding the allowed number
of polls, it is put to sleep as long as msAllowed milliseconds have elapsed
since the application probation.

The application is taken off probation if msGoodProbationEnd milliseconds have
elapsed since the application was last punished. In addition, every
msProbationTrial milliseconds, the allowed number of polls in a timer tick is
increased to DetectProbationCount. As long as the application is not punished,
the allowed number of polls stays at the higher level. If the application
exceeds that level, the allowed level of polls is reduced to InProbationCount.

DOSKBD Command-Line Switches, Syntax, and Values
------------------------------------------------

At a command prompt, type DOSKBD /? to display how to use DOSKBD. To display the
current settings, type DOSKBD. The number of milliseconds in a system timer tick
is also displayed.

  DOSKBD

  DOSKBD /DEFAULTS [/Q]

  DOSKBD [/DETECTPROBATIONCOUNT:nnn] [/INPROBATIONCOUNT:nnn]

     [/MSALLOWED:nnn]

  [/MSSLEEP:nnn] [/BUSYMSALLOWED:nnn] [/MSPROBATIONTRIAL:nnn]
  [/MSGOODPROBATIONEND:nnn] [/DETECTIONINTERVAL:nnn] [/STARTMONITOR

     [appname]

  | /STOPMONITOR] [/Q]

  DOSKBD displays the current settings.

  DOSKBD /DEFAULTS resets all tuning parameters to the system defaults.

  Any DOSKBD command line ending with /Q will not display any information.

  NOTE: Valid range for all values (represented by nnn) is 0 to 32767.

  /DETECTPROBATIONCOUNT:nnn

  The number of peeks in the detection interval required to force the
  application into the probation state and to sleep the application.

  /INPROBATIONCOUNT:nnn

  The number of peeks in the detection interval required to sleep the
  application when the application is in probation. Should be &lt;=
  DETECTPROBATIONCOUNT.

  /MSALLOWED:nnn

  The number of milliseconds the application is allowed to be in the
  probation state before the system starts sleeping the application.

  /MSSLEEP:nnn

  The number of milliseconds that the application is put to sleep.

  /BUSYMSALLOWED:nnn

  When the application is detected as 'busy', the application cannot be
  put into the probation state for this # of milliseconds.

  /MSPROBATIONTRIAL:nnn

  When the application is in probation, DETECTPROBATIONCOUNT is used
  instead of INPROBATIONCOUNT every MSPROBATIONTRIAL milliseconds.

  /MSGOODPROBATIONEND:nnn

  When the application is in probation it must avoid being put to sleep
  for this # of milliseconds in order to be removed from probation.

  /DETECTIONINTERVAL:nnn

  The length of time (in ticks) used to count up the number of polling
  events.

  /STARTMONITOR [appname]

  Start gathering polling statistics.

  /STOPMONITOR

  Stop gathering polling information and display statistics.

How to Use DOSKBD
-----------------

The typical scenario (typical scenario for what?) is that an MS-DOS application
runs fine for a single user, but the system slows down when more users start
using the application. When the system slows in this way, it is possible that
the polling detection is not being aggressive enough to put the application into
probation. Observe how much CPU the application is using while doing nothing,
and while doing common operations. Then exit the application and use DOSKBD to
refine the polling parameters. Remember that DOSKBD settings affect only the
MS-DOS session in which they are set, so it is advisable that you modify your
DOSKBD settings and run the MS-DOS application within a batch file, or through
the use of a custom autoexec.nt file.

Changing parameters by about 30 percent per try is recommended.

To more aggressively take the CPU away from the application, first try decreasing
DetectProbationCount and InProbationCount.

If that does not help or does not help enough, try lowering BusymsAllowed by 10
milliseconds per try. The default of msAllowed is already 0 (zero). If polling
is being detected, the CPU should be significantly less than 100 percent by
now.

At this point it is important to make sure that the application is still Able to
respond in all the ways that it will be used. If it is not responsive, you have
gone too far, and you must back off some of the settings. To further reduce the
CPU used, msSleep can be increased. Use caution while increasing msSleep,
because some applications become unresponsive or jerky if this value is
increased too much.

As you reduce the amount of CPU that the application is using, while ensuring
that the application is still responsive, the system should be able to support a
greater number of concurrent users.

Some applications may use close to 100 percent CPU, regardless of how aggressive
you make the polling detection. Keyboard polling is a common problem, but
applications may monopolize the CPU in other ways.

If an application is not getting enough CPU, the polling detection is probably
too aggressive, or the application needs more time to run before it is punished.
You can increase DetectProbationCount and InProbationCount to lengthen the time
it takes to detect that the application is polling. You can increase msAllowed
from zero to give the application additional execution time, before it is
punished for being on probation. You can also give the application more CPU
while it is being punished by reducing the value of msSleep.

All these possibilities increase the amount of CPU that the application gets,
which reduces the number of users who can simultaneously do useful work on the
system.

NOTE: DOSKBD is used only for MS-DOS applications. However, Windows applications
may also monopolize the CPU by checking the message queue too frequently. This
behavior can be modified through the system registry. See the article
Performance Tuning CPU Usage for 16-bit and 32-bit Windows Applications for more
information.
