-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Some Macintosh-based programs create files that are also compatible with
programs that are not Macintosh-based. When you attach these files to a message
and send the message through the Internet Mail Service, the information store
may not recognize the file as a Macintosh file. This causes the Microsoft
Exchange Server computer to encode the file using UUENCODE instead of BinHex,
even if you specified that the file should be encoded using BinHex in the
Exchange client or in the properties for the Internet Mail Service.

Because the file is encoded using UUENCODE, you are unable to open the attachment
when you view the message in a Macintosh e-mail client. To open the attachment,
you must manually decode the file using a program that is able to do so.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you apply the first fix, a MacCreatorTypes registry value is created In the
following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS
  \ParametersSystem\InternetContent

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

This registry value has a type of REG_MULTI_SZ and contains a list of Macintosh
file types. If the file you attach to the message has an extension that is
specified in this registry value, the information store recognizes the file as a
Macintosh file and encodes the file using BinHex.

When you apply the second fix, a BinHexAllFiles registry value is created in the
above registry key. This registry value has a type of REG_DWORD. If the registry
value is assigned a value greater than 0 (zero) and the Internet Mail Service is
configured so that outbound attachments are sent in BinHex, all attachments sent
through the Internet Mail Service are encoded in BinHex. If the registry value
is assigned a value of 0 (zero) and the Internet Mail Service is configured so
that outbound attachments are sent in BinHex, Macintosh attachments sent through
the Internet Mail Service are encoded in BinHex and non-Macintosh attachments
are encoded in UUENCODE.

To configure the Internet Mail Service so that outbound attachments are sent in
BinHex, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. In the left pane of the Administrator window, click the Connections object
  under the appropriate site. In the right pane, click the Internet Mail
  Service, and then click Properties on the File menu. Note that the
  Connections object appears under the Configuration object.

3. On the Internet Mail tab, select UUENCODE, select the Binhex check box, and
  then click OK.
