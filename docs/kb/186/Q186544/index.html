  increase NCBs for this network. The following information includes the number
  of NCBs submitted by the server when this error occurred:

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The server found a
resource shortage in a network driver when it tried to issue a network control
block (NCB).

Action: Be sure that the NETn entries in the configuration file specify valid
NetBIOS device drivers and that these device drivers are in the Lanman\Drivers
folder. Also, be sure that the Config.sys file contains a DEVICE line specifying
the absolute paths of the device drivers. You may be able to increase the NCBs
for the listed network by changing an option in the network's NETn entry in the
configuration file. See the installation guide that came with your network
adapter for information about those options. If you need assistance, contact
your network administrator.

delete the file and create a new one with the AT utility.

Error 3175
----------

  The server found an invalid AT schedule record.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The schedule file
contains a record with an invalid format.

Action: Restore the schedule file from a backup copy. If you do not have one,
delete the AT schedule file and create a new one with the AT utility.

Error 3176

the files affected by the lazy-write process.

Error 3181
----------

  A defective sector on drive *** has been replaced (hotfixed). No data was
  lost. You should run CHKDSK soon to restore full performance and replenish
  the volume's spare sector pool. The hotfix occurred while processing a remote
  request.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The fault-tolerance
system found a bad disk sector and rerouted data to a good sector (this is
called hotfixing). No data was lost.

Action: Run CHKDSK soon to ensure that enough good disk sectors are available for
hotfixing.

Error 3182
----------

  A disk error occurred on the HPFS volume in drive ***. The error occurred
  while processing a remote request.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. An error occurred
during an operation on the listed disk because of problems with the disk. The

  is replacing the corrupted NET.ACC with the backup made at ***. Any updates
  made to the database after this time are lost.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The user accounts
database file is damaged, so the backup file made at the listed date is now
being used. Changes made to the user accounts database since this time were
lost. Local security is still in effect.

Action: To update the user accounts database, retype changes made to it since the
listed date.

Error 3184
----------

  The user accounts database (NET.ACC) is missing. The local security system is
  restoring the backup database made at ***. Any updates made to the database
  made after this time are lost.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The user accounts
database file is missing, so the backup file made at the listed date is now
being used. Changes made to the user accounts database since this time were
lost. Local security is still in effect.

Action: To update the user accounts database, retype changes made to it since the
listed date.

Error 3185
----------

  Local security could not be started because the user accounts database
  (NET.ACC) was missing or corrupted, and no usable backup database was
  present. THE SYSTEM IS NOT SECURE.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. Local security
could not start because the user accounts database file, Net.acc, is missing or
damaged and no backup file exists on the hard disk.

Action: Restore Net.acc from a backup. The backup file will be named either
Net.acc or Netacc.bkp. Then restart the computer. If there is no backup,
reinstall LAN Manager using the Setup program.

Error 3186
----------

  Local security could not be started because an error occurred during
  initialization. The error code returned is ***. THE SYSTEM IS NOT SECURE.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action

  header is the data.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. An error occurred
on a request that was sent to the specified server. The workstation may have
been connected to a resource that is no longer shared.

Action: Ask a network administrator to reshare the resource so that you can use
it. If this solution fails, contact technical support.

Error 3193
----------

  A virtual circuit error occurred on the session to ***. The network control
  block (NCB) command and return code is the data.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The connection
between your workstation and the specified server was unexpectedly broken. The
server may have been restarted or a network problem may have occurred.

Action: If the server was restarted, retry the operation to reestablish the
connection. If you need more assistance, contact technical support. This message
displays a network control block (NCB) value and the NCB error that was
returned. Save this information for technical support.

Error 3194
----------

  Hanging up a stuck session to ***.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action
to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The session with
the specified server was ended because the server stopped responding.

Action: Ask your network administrator if the server is running. If so, reconnect
to the server. The amount of time a workstation waits for a server to respond to
a request is determined by the SESSTIMEOUT entry in the workstation's
configuration file. If your sessions with servers are frequently ended by this
error, you may want to increase the value of SESSTIMEOUT. If you need
assistance, contact your administrator.

Error 3195
----------

  A network control block (NCB) error occurred (***). The NCB is the data.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action

network control block (NCB) error occurred on the session with the specified
server. The server may have been restarted, or a network problem may have
occurred.

Action: Ask your network administrator if the server was recently restarted. If
you need more assistance, contact technical support. This message displays an
NCB value and the NCB error that was returned. Save this information for
technical support.
