-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to perform directory synchronization (dirsync) between a Lotus
cc:Mail DB8 post office and an Exchange Server 5.5 computer, Event ID 14005 and
Event ID 59 may appear in the event log.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the Exchange Server service account is able to access the cc:Mail
post office. To do so, log onto the Exchange Server computer as the Exchange
Server service account and at a command prompt, change to the
Exchsrvr\Connect\Ccmail\Bin folder, type "ccmc ccdir" (without the quotation
marks), and then press ENTER.

If result code 1 is returned when you run the "ccmc ccdir" command and an error
message indicating that the Ie.ri file could not be found is displayed, verify
that the Ie.ri file is located in the folder specified in the error message. If
it is not, copy the file from its current location to the folder specified in
the error message. After you have copied the file, stop and restart the Exchange
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, and then run the "ccmc ccdir" command again.

To stop and restart the connector:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

2. Click "Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail", click Stop, and then
  click Yes.

3. Click "Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail", and then click Start.


If result code 3 is returned when you run the "ccmc ccdir" command, verify that
the post office name, password, and path specified in the properties of the
Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail are correct. To do so:

1. Start the Administrator program. To do so, click Start, point to Programs,
  point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. Click the "Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail", and then on the File menu,
  click Properties.

3. On the Post Office tab, verify that the values in the Name, Password, and
  Path boxes are correct.

If you made any changes in the properties for the Exchange Connector for Lotus
cc:Mail, stop and restart the connector, and then run the "ccmc ccdir" command
again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Lotus cc:Mail DB6 post offices require Import.exe version 5.15 and Export.exe
version 5.14, which do not require an Ie.ri file. However, Lotus cc:Mail DB8
post offices require Import.exe and Export.exe version 6.0 or later, which
require an Ie.ri file. The Import.exe, Export.exe, and Ie.ri files are typically
located in the Winnt\System32 folder.
