-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the enhancements and new features included in Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Updated Database Structure for the Information Store and Directory
------------------------------------------------------------------

Exchange Server 5.5 uses an updated database that provides more robust data
storage capabilities. Because of the new database structure, the information
store is limited only by your system's hardware capacity.

Ability to Retrieve Deleted Items from Mailboxes and Public Folders
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Users can now retrieve deleted items in mailboxes and public folders if you set a
deleted item retention period for the information store, mailbox, or public
folder. Users can recover deleted items by using the Recover Deleted Items
command in Microsoft Outlook (R) version 8.03 or later. Recovered items are
copied to the Deleted Items folder using mailboxes, or to the selected folder
using public folders.

IMAP4: Exchange Server 5.5 Supports Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writable LDAP:

Exchange Server 5.5 enables users to make changes to the directory by using
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). For information, see Microsoft
Exchange Server Operations.

Enhanced Protocol Support for the Internet Mail Service:

The Internet Mail Service supports the following protocols: ETRN, Secure
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL).

Support for MHTML:

Exchange Server 5.5 supports MIME Hypertext Markup Language (MHTML), which is the
MIME encapsulation of aggregate documents, such as an HTML document with inline
pictures.

Microsoft Exchange Scripting
----------------------------

You can install the Microsoft Exchange Event Service to support customized public
folder workflow applications that you develop. For example, you can develop an
application that performs an action when a specified event occurs in a public
folder.

Container Level Search Control
------------------------------

You can restrict users' access to Address Book views. For example, if you are
hosting multiple companies on a single Exchange Server computer, you can prevent
users of one company from viewing the Address Book views of another company.

Support for Multiple and Differential Offline Address Books
-----------------------------------------------------------

Users can also download differential entries in offline Address Books, so that
only changes that occurred since the last download are downloaded.

Advanced Security
-----------------

You can set multiple password policies that prevent administrators from making
changes to the Key Management (KM) server without authorization from one or more
other administrators. Exchange Server also supports trusted messages sent
between organizations so that users can verify the source of messages sent from
another organization.

Microsoft Cluster Server Support
--------------------------------

Microsoft Exchange Server supports Microsoft Cluster Server, which is included
with Windows NT&lt;AE&gt; Server. Microsoft Cluster Server provides fault tolerance in
the event of hardware and software malfunctions. It ensures that if an Exchange
Server computer fails, another is available so mail delivery is never
interrupted. Microsoft Cluster Server must be installed on the Exchange Server
computer to enable support for clustering.

NOTE: The Outlook Web Access component will not function correctly installed on a
Microsoft Cluster Server.

Microsoft Exchange Chat Service
-------------------------------

Exchange Server now includes chat services that enable users to interact with
each other online, in real time.

SNMP Madman MIB
---------------

Exchange Server supports the Mail and Directory Management Management Information
Base (MADMAN MIB) for use with Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
monitoring agents.

Lotus cc:Mail DB8 Migration
---------------------------

The Lotus cc:Mail source extractor supports Lotus cc:Mail version 5.x (DB6), and
version 6.0 and version 8.0 (DB8).

Address Space and Routing Enhancements
--------------------------------------

Exchange Server gives you more control over message routing. The Address Space
property page on connectors has been enhanced to enable scoping restrictions on
each address space specified. Each address space can be configured so that the
connector routes messages that originate from anyone in the organization, routes
only messages that originate from within the home site, or routes only messages
that originate within the home server location. In addition, each MTA can be
configured to use only the least-cost routes to deliver mail, so that if the
least-cost route is not accessible, messages are returned with a non-delivery
report (NDR).
