The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
- Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to enable the Active Server Pages (ASP) features on
Web servers that are not running the FrontPage Server Extensions from
Microsoft.

You can run the FrontPage "Save to Database" feature and the pages that are
generated by the Database Results Wizard on any server that supports ASP and has
sufficient database support for the database system that you are using.

Although either FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions from Microsoft or FrontPage 2002
Server Extensions from Microsoft are required to create pages that use the ASP
features, FrontPage Server Extensions are not required to run the pages that are
generated by the ASP features.

NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you install Microsoft Data Access Components
(MDAC) 2.1 for full support on all Web servers that are based on Microsoft
Windows, Microsoft Windows NT, or Microsoft Windows 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Getting Ready to Use the ASP Features in FrontPage
--------------------------------------------------

Before you can use the ASP features in FrontPage, you must install the components
that are listed in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. Select the
article for the version of FrontPage that you are using:

  Q312638 FP: What You Need to Use Active Server Pages (ASP) in FrontPage 2000

  Q318287 FP2002: What You Need to Use Active Server Pages (ASP) in FrontPage
  2002

Create and Publish Your Database Web
------------------------------------

1. If you are using a network-based data connection, such as a Microsoft SQL
  Server connection or an Oracle server connection, you must confirm that the
  network location is accessible from the destination Web site. If you are
  using a system data source name (DSN), you must confirm that that the system
  DSN is valid on the system that is running the destination Web server.

2. Create your database Web. Note the following:

   - If you are using a Web server, the Web server must be a Microsoft Internet
     Information Services (IIS) server, a Microsoft NT Peer Web Server (NTPWS),
     or a Microsoft Personal Web Server (MSPWS) that meets the following
     requirements:

      - Supports Active Server Pages
      - Has Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.1 or later installed
      - Has the FrontPage Server Extensions installed

     For more information, please see the Knowledge Base articles listed in the
     "Getting Ready to Use the ASP Features in FrontPage" section of this
     article.

   - If you are using a disk-based Web, you cannot confirm that the pages work
     before you publish the pages.

   - If you are using a Web server to author the pages, confirm that the pages
     work before you publish the pages to the unextended server.

3. When the Web is complete, you can publish the Web by using FTP, or you can
  copy the Web by using Windows Explorer or the command prompt.

   - If you are publishing by using FTP, follow these steps in FrontPage 2000:

     1. On the File menu, click Publish Web.

     2. Type the FTP URL for the destination in the "Specify the location to
        publish your web to" section of the Publish Web dialog box.

   - If you are copying through Windows Explorer or the command prompt, make
     sure that you copy all the files from your local copy of the Web to the
     destination.

4. On the destination server, find the entry in the Web server's configuration
  file or files. Make sure that the URL for the folder that you just copied or
  published by using FTP is configured as an application root. For more
  information about this process, see your Web server documentation or ISP
  provider documentation. You must be certain that the setting is created on
  the HTTP URL for the published files.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the published Web is not an application root, you may receive an error message
similar to the following when you browse to a page that uses a database
connection:

  The database connection named 'Sample' is undefined.

  This problem can occur if:

- the connection has been removed from the web
- the file 'global.asa' is missing or contains errors
- the root folder does not have Scripting permissions enabled
- the web is not marked as an Application Root

  Disk-Based Web

  Page in the Web Browser

  Q265323 FP2000: Database Connection List Is Empty When You View Database
  Results Properties

  Q292628 FP2002: Database Connection Undefined After Publishing Web

If the published Web meets all other requirements described earlier in this
article, and you do not receive an error message when you submit a database
form, but no data is added to the database on the Web server, the error may be
suppressed in the ASP code. For additional information about this error, click
