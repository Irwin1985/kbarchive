ordered by customers within the U.S. and Canada through the Microsoft

SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) includes all bug fixes 
implemented since the initial SNA Server 3.0 release. In addition,

WEB-installable SNA Server Windows 95 client software, and SDK 
(software development kit) files. SNA 3.0 SP4 includes updated SNA 
Server and client software for I386 (Intel) and DEC Alpha platforms.

and is not included in 3.0 SP4. 

Downloading SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4
------------------------------------------

Self-extracting executable files containing updated 3.0 SP4 
SNA Server and client files can be downloaded electronically 
from www.microsoft.com, which points to:

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/sna-public/fixes/sna30/ussp4/ 

The following files comprise the updated SNA Server and client 
files for SNA Server 3.0 SP4:

 30SP4TXT.EXE  - 3.0 SP4 Release Notes and Help File
 30SP4IS.EXE   - 3.0 SP4 Server Update (Intel) (NOTE 1)
 30SP4AS.EXE   - 3.0 SP4 Server Update (Alpha) (NOTE 1)
 30SP4ICU.EXE  - 3.0 SP4 Windows NT Client Update (Intel)

 30SP4IHS.EXE  - 3.0 SP4 Host Security Update (Intel)
 30SP4AHS.EXE  - 3.0 SP4 Host Security Update (Alpha)

For information about changes implemented in 3.0 SP4, see the 
SNA30SP4.HLP file included in 30SP4TXT.EXE, 30SP4IS.EXE or 
30SP4AS.EXE.  SNA30SP4.HLP also lists new features added in the 
service pack and articles describing the symptoms and causes for 
problems fixed in the service pack. 

NOTE 1: The SNA Server 3.0 SP4 includes updates to the SNA Server, 
Print Service, TN3270 Service, TN5250 Service, ODBC drivers, AFTP, 
and Shared Folders Gateway.

Instructions for Decompressing Files
------------------------------------

All of the above files are Win32 self-extracting executables.  The 
SNA Server and client update programs automatically extract and run 
the Update program. For these Update programs to run automatically, 
the server or client machine must have the following free disk space:

 Server Update (Intel) - 30SP4IS.EXE:  95 MB 
 Server Update (Alpha) - 30SP4AS.EXE:  107 MB
 Windows NT Client Update (Intel) - 30SP4ICU.EXE: 28 MB
 Windows NT Client Update (Alpha) - 30SP4ACU.EXE: 38 MB
 Windows 95 Client Update         - 30SP495U.EXE: 13 MB

When running Update automatically, please note the following:

- before update is run, all files are automatically extracted to the 
 directory where the TMP, TEMP, or WINROOT environment variable is 
 pointing (trying in that order). So, if the SET command shows that 
 TMP=C:\TMP , and C: does not have sufficient storage to extract the 
 files, change TMP to point to a drive which has sufficient space.  
 For example:  

   SET TMP=D:\TEMP

- to extract the files into a separate directory without running update
 automatically, run the service pack update file using the /x option. 
 For example:

   30SP4IS /x

- Once the files have been extracted using the "/x" option, the Update 
 program may be invoked manually to apply the service pack. Use the 
 "UPDATE /?" command to view the command line options to support 
 quiet and batch mode installation options.

The SNA Server Windows 3.x client file (30SP4CLU.EXE) is a Win32
self extracting executable that cannot be run directly from a 
Windows 3.x machine. The administrator must first run the file
and choose a directory to place the extracted files. Windows 3.x 
clients may then connect across the network and run the Update 
program to apply the service pack files.

The update files upgrade existing SNA Server 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2,
or 3.0 SP3 systems to SNA Server 3.0 SP4. Unlike previous service 
packs, no 3.0 SP4 client refresh binaries are provided for installation 
of new client systems. For new client systems, install a previous
version of the SNA 3.0 client software (any service pack) and apply 
the 3.0 SP4 Update.

NOTE: Unlike previous SNA Server service packs, there is no need 
to extract the executable with the "-d" option.

Installing the Service Pack Files
---------------------------------
Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated in 3.0 
SP4. Updates may be applied in any order -- to the server and/or to 
the clients. It is recommended that all systems running SNA 
Server 3.0 (that is, SNA Servers and client computers) are updated 
to 3.0 SP4. It may not be necessary to update the client computers 
to SP4 unless you are experiencing a client problem that has been 
fixed in SP4.

WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on
systems currently running SNA Server 3.0 server or client software.  
These updates should NOT be applied over systems running SNA Server 
2.x or 4.x releases.

** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 3.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **
