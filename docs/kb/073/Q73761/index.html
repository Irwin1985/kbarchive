-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains the version 3.0 Microsoft Mail Dial-In Utility ReadMe file
included with the Microsoft Mail Extras disk.

Welcome to the Microsoft Mail Dial-In Utility
---------------------------------------------

The following information supplements information in the "Microsoft Mail Dial-In
User's Guide."

Turning the Dial-In Utility On and Off
--------------------------------------

After turning the dial-in utility on or off from the Control Panel, you must
restart your Macintosh to have the change take effect. When the dial- in utility
is first installed on your Macintosh, it is off.

Recommended Modems
------------------

The dial-in utility has been designed to work with Hayes- compatible modems with
a baud rate of 1200-9600. The following modems are fully supported: Hayes
Smartmodem series, Hayes V-series modems, Hayes Personal Modem 2400plus, Apple
Personal Modem, TouchBase Systems Worldport 2496, and Volksmodem 12.

Terminals and Settings
----------------------

The dial-in utility works with any terminal emulator which supports full VT100
emulation. Microsoft Windows Terminal, Microphone II (Software Ventures
Corporation), DynaComm (Future Soft Engineering, Inc.), White Knight (The
Freesoft Company), ProComm (Datastorm Technologies, Inc.), and most other
communication programs support VT100 emulation.

Your terminal should be set for 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. Make sure
Local Echo is off and there is no Xon/Xoff flow control.

Dial-In User List Limitations
-----------------------------

Clicking Add/Remove Users from the Control Panel brings up the list of all
Microsoft Mail users in the current Mail site. This process may take up to a
minute in a very large site. If the Mail site contains 800 users or more, the
dial-in utility may not be able to display all of them. If you have a very large
Mail system, you should configure it into sites to most effectively use the
dial-in utility. (See Appendix B in the Network Manager's Guide.)

Because of memory limitations, you cannot give more than 800 users access to a
single dial-in machine.

Timing Considerations
---------------------

If a dial-in user is connected for six minutes without typing anything, the
dial-in utility will log the user out to prevent unwanted phone charges and to
give other users a chance to call in.

If the modem connected to the Macintosh running the dial-in utility software is
turned on after the Macintosh is started, it may take up to five minutes before
the utility has registered with the modem and can begin answering calls.

MS Mail Cache
-------------

The dial-in user list is stored in the MS Mail Cache file in the System Folder of
the Macintosh running the dial-in utility. If this file is deleted or moved out
of the system folder, all dial- in users will be removed and you will need to
build up a new dial-in user list.

Performance
-----------

The speed of the modem connection has the most significant impact on the
performance of the dial-in utility. Additionally, the dial-in utility should be
installed on a Macintosh which is running Finder (rather than MultiFinder) and
which is not used heavily for other purposes.

Compatibility Issues
--------------------

The dial-in utility is incompatible with the screen saver After Dark.

You should not attempt to run a Microsoft Mail gateway, terminal emulator, or
other program which interacts with the modem port when the dial-in utility is
loaded. The dial-in utility exclusively controls the modem port while it is
running.

Reply All
---------

If you reply to all recipients of a message, the dial-in utility displays a Send
window addressed to "&lt;All Original Recipients&gt;". If you wish to address
the message to other recipients, you can add their names after "&lt;All Original
Recipients&gt;" or in the Cc or Bcc fields.

Forwarding Enclosures
---------------------

Enclosures cannot be attached to messages which are sent from the dial-in
utility, but enclosures remain attached to messages which are forwarded from the
dial-in utility.

Redrawing the Screen
--------------------

If line noise or other problems cause your terminal output to become cluttered,
press CTRL+R. This will redraw the screen.

Insert and Overstrike Compose Mode
----------------------------------

The dial-in utility supports both insert and overstrike from the Send window.
When insert mode is in effect, typed characters are inserted at the cursor
position without typing over previously entered text. When overstrike mode is in
effect, typed characters replace characters after the cursor with the characters
you type. By default, the dial-in utility is in insert mode. Pressing CTRL+V
toggles between the two modes.

Custom Messages
---------------

Image and other nontext messages can be read from the dial-in utility, but only
the text portions of these messages will be displayed.
