The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0, used with:
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run a Visual Basic (VB) application on a computer that is
running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 2000, and you are not
logged in as an Administrator or you do not have Administrator rights, you may
receive the following error message

  Component tabctl32.ocx or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a
  file is missing or invalid.

where tabctl32.ocx is the name of the ActiveX control that is experiencing the
problem. The .ocx file for the control is physically present on the computer.
Any attempt to manually register this control by using Regsvr32.exe fails with
the 0x00000005 (or "Access is Denied") return error code.

Users who are logged in as an Administrator or who have Administrator rights do
not receive an error message.

CAUSE
=====

The interactive user does not have access permission to the ActiveX control that
is listed in the error dialog box. This problem usually occurs on computers that
are formatted with Microsoft Windows NT File System (NTFS). NTFS has a built-in
security system that allows you to grant various permissions to folders and to
individual files. These permissions protect files and folders locally and
remotely.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, grant the user the necessary permissions to the
control.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change file permissions, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the system as an Administrator or as a user with Administrator
  rights.

2. Search for the .ocx file that is listed in the error message. It is usually
  located in the System32 folder.

3. Right-click the file and click Properties.

4. In the Properties dialog box for this control, click the Security tab.

5. If you are using Windows NT 4.0, on the Security tab, click Permissions. The
  File Permissions dialog box appears. Make sure that the Type of access is at
  least set to Read for the interactive user.

  If you are using Windows 2000, on the Security tab, select a user or group
  from the list, select the permissions that you want to grant (which must
  include at least Read), and then click either OK or Apply.
