-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) 2.0 contains a NIS server component. When you
install NIS on a peer domain in an existing forest, the install may not succeed
and generate error 26065.

For example, assume that you install Windows 2000 and create a new domain in a
new forest. Then, you install NIS on this domain controller. The install
succeeds and NIS works correctly. Later, you add a second domain to the same
forest. When you try to install NIS on a domain controller in this peer domain,
the NIS install does not succeed.

CAUSE
=====

For the peer domain, some Active Directory entries were not structured the way
the install script expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the problem is in the installation script, you must copy the SFU
distribution media to disk, apply the hotfix to the copy on disk, and then run
Setup from the copy to which you applied the hotfix.

When you run the hotfix image (Q289747_SFU_2_X86_EN.EXE) it runs a .cmd file that
prompts for the location of the distribution media and the location to which you
want to copy it. The .cmd file applies the patch to the copy on the disk and
then runs Setup from the disk copy.

This information is copied from the Q289747.txt file:

  

  ======================================================================
  4. STEPS TO INSTALL
  ======================================================================

  * Run the file Q289747_SFU_2_X86_EN.exe from its current location.

  * This will run a batch file. Supply whatever the batch file asks.
 The batch file will
 - Copy the "Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX 2.0" CD-ROM contents
   to a local or network share.
   * If the CD-ROM contents are already available either as a local
     share or a network one, you can specify the path.
   * If the share is on the network, ensure this is writeable.
 - Then apply the patch on to this share.
 - Then the batch file will start Setup from this share.

  * In the setup,
 - Select "Custom Setup".
 - Select Server for NIS.
 - Select other components.
 - Proceed with the installation.
 - Setup will prompt for a reboot. Select Yes.
