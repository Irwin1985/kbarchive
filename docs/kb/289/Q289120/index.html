-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

General Exchange Server performance and stability problems may be caused if a
client application opens a large numbers of messages at once. Some add-on
services and applications may inadvertently do this while performing their
functions.

Symptoms may be non-specific and can include slow performance on the server or
unexpected program exits by clients. You may also observe Out-of-Memory errors
on the Exchange Server computer. Examination of Exchange Server-related errors
in the server Application log may show errors with the following IDs in the
event descriptions:

- 0x800700E
- 1014
- CdoE_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY

RESOLUTION
==========

For Exchange Server 5.5 and earlier, you must address the problem from the
client. Exchange 2000 provides two server-side options for dealing with this
problem:

- Limit the number of open messages for each client logon.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q289109 XADM: Limit the Number of Messages Opened per MAPI Logon

- If you find that a particular client version is problematic in your
  environment, you may prevent all clients of this version from connecting at
  all to the Exchange 2000 server.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  MAPI Provider Version

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server.
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can view the number of open messages for each client logon in the Exchange
Server 5.5 Administrator program or in Exchange System Manager for Exchange
2000. A client logon is suspect if it shows more than 1,000 messages open for
more than a few minutes at a time.

To check the open message count:

1. Start the Administrator program for Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, or
  Exchange System Manager for Exchange 2000.

2. Expand the mailbox database object, and then click Logons.

  NOTE: In Exchange Server 5.5, this database is always the private information
  store. In Exchange 2000, the database name is set by the administrator.

3. On the View menu, click Columns, and then add "Open Messages" to the
  displayed columns.

Note that the column display does not refresh automatically, and values in it are
updated at approximately one minute intervals.
