SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 protects system resources with access control lists
(ACLs). ACLs are lists of security identifiers (SIDs), and a list of access
rights or permissions that are granted to that security principal. SIDs are
relative to a domain. The SID of a user or group from a domain is always based
on the SID of the domain, and uniquely identifies the user or group. ACLs are
placed on a resource to indicate which users and groups are permitted to access
it, and what level of access they are allowed. When a user attempts to access
the resource, Windows NT compares the list of SIDs in the ACL to the list of
SIDs that identify the user and his group memberships, and grants or denies
access as appropriate.

When a user logs on to a domain, the user's account SID and group membership SIDs
are determined by a domain controller in the user's account domain. The SID of
the trusted domain, the relative ID (RID) of the user's account, the RID of the
user's primary group, and the SIDs of all other group memberships are combined
into an authorization data structure and passed to the requesting computer.

When the computer that is requesting user authentication is in a different domain
than the user's account, authentication occurs using a trust. Trust is created
between Windows NT-based or Windows 2000-based domains to simplify the user's
authentication experience, especially by enabling single sign-on. When one
domain trusts another, it means that the trusting domain will allow the trusted
domain to authenticate the users (or computers) whose accounts it manages.
During authentication, the computer in the trusting domain accepts the
authorization data provided by the trusted domain controller. There is no way
for the computer that is requesting authentication to determine the validity of
the authorization information, so it accepts the data as accurate based on the
existence of the trust relationship.

A vulnerability exists because the trusting domain does not verify that the
trusted domain is actually authoritative for all the SIDs in the authorization
data. If one of the SIDs in the list identifies a user or security group that is
not in the trusted domain, the trusting domain accepts the information and uses
it for subsequent access control decisions. If an attacker inserted SIDs into
the authorization data at the trusted domain, the attacker could elevate his or
her privileges to those that are associated with any user or group, including
the domain administrators group for the trusting domain. This would enable the
attacker to gain full domain administrator access on computers in the trusting
domain.

It is very hard to exploit this vulnerability. At a minimum, an attacker would
need administrative privileges on the trusted domain, and the technical
wherewithal to modify low-level operating system functions and data structures.

To counter these potential attacks, Microsoft has added a feature called SID
filtering to Windows NT 4.0. With SID filtering, an administrator can cause the
domain controllers in a given domain to "quarantine" a trusted domain. This
causes the domain controllers in the trusting domain to remove all SIDs that are
not relative to the trusted domain from any authorization data that is received
from that domain. Quarantining is performed from the trusting domain, and is
done on a per-domain basis.


CAUSE
=====

When a trust relationship exists between two domains, the trusting domain
accepts the SIDs that are specified within authorization data provided by the
trusted domain even if the SIDs are from domains other than the trusted one. If
an attacker in a trusted domain were able to insert SIDs into authorization
data, the attacker could grant himself or herself the privileges that are
associated with a user in another domain, including the trusting domain itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup Package. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a.



Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition, Security Rollup Package (SRP). For additional information about the
SRP, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q317636 Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, Security Rollup
  Package

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of
security vulnerability in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT Server version
4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Applying the Hotfix
-------------------

Registry Key Modification for the Quarantined Bit:

In addition to applying the hotfix, Windows NT 4.0 requires a modification of a
registry key to quarantine domains. In addition, you can configure auditing to
monitor SIDHistory-related security events:

1. Use Regedt32.exe to add a new REG_MULTI_SZ value named QuarantinedDomains to
  the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters

2. Set the data value of the new QuarantinedDomains value to a sequence of zero,
  or more, NetBIOS domain names. This new value will be recognized by Netlogon.

NOTES:

- Use only NetBIOS domain names even if the trusted domain is a Windows
  2000-based domain.

- You quarantine a domain by adding its name to the QuarantinedDomains registry
  value. You cancel quarantine by removing the domain name.

- There is no error checking or validation of the names that you enter in the
  QuarantinedDomains registry value to ensure that they correspond to a
  currently trusted domain. Any legal string value is allowed. However, any
  value that is not equal to the name of a trusted domain will be ignored. The
  net effect is that "SIDHistory" quarantine can only be applied by a trusting
  domain against a trusted domain.

- You must manually set or rest the registry value on every domain controller
  in a domain for consistent behavior.

- After you set the registry key, you must issue "net stop netlogon" and "net
  start netlogon" commands from a command prompt to make the new registry key
  values take effect.

Auditing Changes
----------------

Please refer to the online Help for information about how to configure auditing
in Windows NT 4.0.

This hotfix introduces a new Security Audit event with event ID 548 during NTLM
authentication. This is a logon and logoff event that is generated when there is
a SID History attack on the domain (that is, when the domain SID is spoofed).
These events are logged on the domain controller that is processing the
authentication request in the trusting domain. The following events will be
generated during NTLM authentication:

  

  Event Type:     Failure Audit
  Event Source:   Security
  Event Category: Logon/Logoff
  Event ID:       548
  Date:           Event date
  Time:           Event time
  User:           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  Computer:       Name of the computer on which the event is logged
  Description:
 Logon Failure.
 Reason:                 Domain sid inconsistent
 User Name:              Name of the user being authenticated
 Domain:                 Name of the Quarantined Domain
 Logon Type:             Type of logon (3=network)
 Logon Process:          NtLmSsp
 Authentication Package: MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0
 Workstation Name:       Name of the client computer
