The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

For computers running Microsoft Windows 3.1 and LAN Manager for MS-DOS, the
ShivaRemote is used to remotely access computers running Microsoft Exchange
Server. However, those users who need to carry the computer back and forth
between home and an office have to reconfigure the settings every time they
move, because transport layer protocols cannot be bound to a LAN card driver and
to the ShivaRemote driver at the same time.

WORKAROUND
==========

An administrator can set up one configuration that works both at home and at the
office for these users. The workaround is to load two transport drivers, NetBEUI
and TCP/IP, which are bound to a LAN card driver and the ShivaRemote driver
respectively. Because the NetBEUI protocol provides the fastest throughput to
NetBIOS resources when accessed over a remote access connection, it can be used
for remote connectivity and the TCP/IP is used on a LAN. Do the following
procedures to make the configuration work:

1. Install the LAN Manager for MS-DOS version 2.2, and select TCP/IP and
  NetBEUI.

2. Configure the TCP/IP with the following:

  a. Enable DHCP in the "TCP/IP Settings" dialog box.

  b. Type the Username, and Hostname, and enable Windows Sockets in the "DNR
     and Sockets Settings" dialog box. To bring up the "DNR and Sockets
     Settings" dialog box, click the Advanced button in the "TCP/IP Settings"
     dialog box.

  c. Type the Computername, Username and Domain in the "Workstation Settings"
     dialog box.

3. After the installation of the LAN Manager is complete, install the Microsoft
  Exchange client for Windows 3.x. Select the custom installation that includes
  the ShivaRemote software.

4. Run the ShivaRemote Setup program from the Microsoft Exchange program group,
  as follows:

  a. Select the COM port and the type of modem you use.

  b. Enable NetBEUI/LLC in the "Protocol Configuration" dialog.

  c. When ShivaRemote Setup is complete, restart your computer so that the
     configuration changes you made take effect.

5. After the computer restarts, in the Config.sys file, add the line

  DEVICE=C:\EXCHANGE\SHIVA\DIALNDIS.EXE (After the line
  DEVICE=...\PROTMAN.DOS /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS)

6. Modify the Protocol.ini file in the Lanman.dos directory. Leave the TCP/IP
  section intact.

     [NetBEUI_XIF]
     ;BINDINGS="LAN Card Driver"    Make this line a comment.
     BINDINGS=SDIALIN$                  Add this line.
     [SDIALIN$]                                    Add this line.
     DriverName=SDIALIN$                Add this line.

7. Restart the computer.

If users want to use the remote mail functionality of the Exchange, the Exchange
profile needs to be configured as follows.

1. Double-click the Microsoft Exchange Services icon in the Microsoft Exchange
  program group. Then, click the Add button to create a new profile.

2. When the Setup Wizard prompts for "Do you travel with this computer", click
  Yes to create offline folder use in this profile.

3. After the profile is created, select this profile and click the Properties
  button.

4. Select the Microsoft Exchange Server Information service and click the
  Properties button. The "Microsoft Exchange Server" dialog is brought up and
  you should see four tabs, General, Advanced, Dial-Up Networking and Remote
  Mail.

5. On the General tab, click "Work offline and use dial-up networking".

6. On the Dial-Up Networking tab, click "Dial using the following connection"
  and click the Setup button to bring up the "ShivaRemote Connect" dialog box.

  a. Type the Description, Dial-in Name, Password and Phone number.

  b. Click Port Setup in the Tools menu to make sure that the port and modem
     are configured correctly.

  c. Click the Options button to make sure that the NetBEUI/LLC is enabled.

  d. On the File menu, click Save to save the settings. For more information on
     creating a connection file, refer to the ShivaRemote Online Guide.

  e. Exit the "ShivaRemote Connect" dialog box.

7. On the Dial-Up Networking tab, you should see the description of the just
  created connection file that appears in the drop-down list. Click this
  connection and type the User name, Password, and Domain.

8. Click OK to save the settings.

NOTE: This Microsoft Exchange profile has to be used to connect to a computer
running Microsoft Exchange server on a LAN at least once before it can be used
remotely because the offline folder file needs to be created and synchronized.
