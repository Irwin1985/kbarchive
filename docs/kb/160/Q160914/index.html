SYMPTOMS
========

When running the Analyze utility against a SourceSafe database, the following
message appears:

  The data file for &lt;real file name &gt; (&lt;physical file name&gt;) was
  not found

For example:

  The data file for "myfile.txt" (qusaaaaa.b) was not found.

This article discusses some of the steps that can be taken to resolve the
problem.

CAUSE
=====

Files under SourceSafe control are stored as a file pair: the data file and the
log file. In this example, Analyze has found that a log file exists with no
matching data file: there is a file qusaaaaa in the DATA\Q directory, but no
matching qusaaaaa.b file. There may be a qusaaaaa.a (note that the extension is
different from the one in the error message), but this does not change the
approach to this problem.

NOTE: This article will use the file names in the example error message given
earlier.

RESOLUTION
==========


Your first step should always be to back up the entire DATA directory. You should
also make sure you are using the most recent version of Analyze.exe. Please see
the REFERENCES section of this article for more information.

There are three ways to resolve this error:

1. Delete qusaaaaa from the DATA/Q subdirectory.

2. Add a valid copy of qusaaaaa.b to the DATA/Q subdirectory.

3. Delete Myfile.txt from the SourceSafe database, and then add it back.

In many cases, there is a single copy of Myfile.txt in the database that has been
deleted and removed permanently. If you are confident that this is the case,
deleting qusaaaaa will resolve the problem. If you are not sure, see the MORE
INFORMATION section later for guidelines on what course of action to take.

Adding a valid copy of qusaaaaa.b can be done in two ways:

1. This is the better method. If a user has a local copy of myfile.txt that is
  identical to the last checked-in version, copy Myfile.txt into the DATA\Q
  directory, and then rename the copy to qusaaaaa.b. It is important not to
  leave a file named Myfile.txt in the data directory. You can see who last
  checked the file in by viewing its History. If that user has a local copy
  that has not been modified since the check in, this method will work.

  It is also possible that a user may have performed a "Get Latest Version" of
  Myfile.txt (though there is no way of testing to see if this has happened)
  and has a local copy of the correct version of the file. If so, this method
  will also work, but you must remove the read-only flag of qusaaaaa.b after
  renaming it.

  This method assumes that the SourceSafe user or administrator knows whether
  the local version has been modified since the last Check Out or Get.

2. If you have a backup of the database, copy the backup version of the file
  pair into the DATA\Q subdirectory: qusaaaaa (the log file) and the
  corresponding data file that will have either a .a or .b extension. In this
  case, any changes made since the backup will be lost.

  If you do not have a backup or a correct version of the file, the only
  resolution is to delete myfile.txt from SourceSafe and add it back in. In
  this case, you will lose all history and branching information.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Novell version 3.12 or later, on a Windows 95 computer using the Microsoft
client for NetWare Networks (found under Control Panel .. Network ..
Configuration), deleting a file from the SourceSafe database will delete only
the data file, causing this error.

The above configuration is known to cause a problem. It has been seen in other
configurations, though not consistently reproduced. For the purpose of this
article, the configuration is not important because it is suggesting ways of
resolving the error, regardless of the cause.

The following section provides some guidelines to help you determine whether you
can delete the data file, or whether you need to add it back to the database:

1. Is there a single copy of Myfile.txt, or multiple copies?

2. What project or projects contain Myfile.txt?

3. If there are multiple copies, are they different files in different projects
  that happen to have the same name, or are they linked (has Myfile.txt been
  shared or branched)?

4. Has every occurrence of Myfile.txt been deleted from the database? If so, was
  it purged or destroyed?

Often, a user or the SourceSafe administrator will be able to answer these
questions and the following steps will be unnecessary. The methods described
here and the order in which they occur will vary from one case to another.

You can answer the questions above using a combination of the following methods:

1. Issuing this command at the SourceSafe command line interface:

     SS Locate myfile.txt

  will find all occurrences of Myfile.txt that have not been deleted, and those
  that have been deleted but not removed permanently. If multiple copies of
  Myfile.txt are found, use the SourceSafe Physical command to identify which
  project contains which instance of myfile.txt.

2. A recursive History of the top level project will tell what files have been
  added, deleted, destroyed, purged, or branched.

3. If a file has been shared, viewing the Links for that file will show which
  projects share the file.

4. If a file has been branched, viewing the Paths for that file will show which
  projects contain branches of the file.

NOTE: It is preferable to view Links and Paths from the command line interface
because viewing from the SourceSafe Explorer will return errors. These errors
can be ignored, but may be confusing.

The log file, qusaaaaa, can be deleted only if all instances of myfile.txt that
have a link or path to the copy that is causing the error have been removed
permanently from the database.

If this is not the case, locate a copy of myfile.txt that is identical to the
last checked-in version. If no suitable copy exists, restore the file pair from
a backup. Deleting and adding myfile.txt back should only be used in a "worst
case" situation in which neither of the previous two methods is possible.
