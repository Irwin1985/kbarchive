SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install one of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive one of the following error messages:

   - Cannot find the file drive:\Setup.exe or one of its components.

   - Cannot find the file drive:\filename

   - Cannot copy the file drive:\filename

where drive is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive and filename can be any file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a real mode (16-bit) driver for your CD-ROM drive is
installed on your computer.

Protected mode (32-bit) CD-ROM drivers are required to install the programs
listed at the beginning of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your CD-ROM drive manufacturer to inquire about
how to obtain and install a protected mode (32-bit) CD-ROM driver for Microsoft
Windows 95/98.

For information about how to contact your CD-ROM drive manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if you are using a real-mode CD-ROM driver:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Locate the CDROM branch in the device tree.

  If the CDROM branch does not exist, you are using a real-mode CD-ROM driver.

  If this line does exist and the issue continues to occur, both a real mode
  CD-ROM driver and a protected mode CD-ROM driver may be installed.

To determine if a real mode CD-ROM driver is installed in addition to a protected
mode CD-ROM driver, examine the Autoexec.bat file for a line that refers to the
Mscdex.exe file. To do this:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. In the Autoexec.bat window, look for any lines that refer to the Mscdex.exe
  file.

  If a line that refers to the Mscdex.exe file exists, a real-mode CD-ROM driver
  is probably installed on your computer. To resolve this issue, see your
  hardware documentation, or contact your CD-ROM drive manufacturer for
  information about how to remove the real-mode driver for your CD-ROM drive.
