SYMPTOMS
========

The installation of the Madge 16/4 PCMCIA PC Card Ringnode in Windows NT 4.0
shows no problems when carrying out a fresh installation. However, when
upgrading from Windows NT 3.5 or Windows NT 3.51, the miniport driver will not
be properly installed and will not work.

CAUSE
=====

The Product Software Name (PSN) for the Madge miniport in Windows NT 4.0 is
"MadgeMPort"; the Driver File Name (DFN) is "MdgMPort.SYS". In the case of the
PC Card adapters, Windows NT keeps a database in the Registry that tells which
driver to use for an adapter with the given CIS ID. The database uses the PSN to
identify drivers. In Windows NT 4.0 the database refers to "MadgeMPort"; whereas
in Windows NT 3.51, it referred to "MdgMPort".

In a clean installation of Windows NT 4.0, the Madge miniport driver is installed
with a PSN of "MadgeMPort", which will match the PC Card database. But during an
upgrade of Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0, the Madge miniport driver
has already been installed with a PSN of "MdgMPort". This does not match what is
in the PC Card database. The result is an error message during the subsequent
log on attempt:

  At least one service or driver failed during system startup.

The Event Log records an error from the Service Control Manager saying:

  The MdgMport service failed to start due to the following error. A device
  attached to the system is not functioning.

RESOLUTION
==========

During the upgrade to Windows NT 4.0, the user will have been asked if they want
to upgrade the various Madge miniport files. Whether this has been chosen, the
entry in the PC Card database must refer to "MdgMPort."

Make an entry in the registry to update the database. To make this entry, perform
the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PCMCIA
  \Database\MADGE\ SMART 16/4 PCMCIA

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path, it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Double-click Driver:REG_SZ:madgemport, edit the string so that it reads
  "mdgmport" (without the quotation marks).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
