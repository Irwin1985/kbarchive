The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Close Combat for the Macintosh 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the Network Read Me file located on
the Microsoft Close Combat compact disc.

NOTE: Apple Corporation released Open Transport 1.1.1 after this Read Me file was
created. Open Transport 1.1.1 corrects problems associated with running Open
Transport 1.1 on certain Macintosh models. The Open Transport 1.1.1 software is
available by contacting Apple Corporation or is available via download from the
Apple web site:

  http://www.apple.com

It is recommended that you use Open Transport 1.1 or higher with System 7.5
version 7.5.3 to connect to the Internet. Using MacTCP, as the Read Me file
states, should not be necessary nor is it recommended.

The following is the Read Me file.

=============================
Network Read Me file Contents

Playing Head-To-Head Close Combat

To play a two-player game in Close Combat you must have either MacTCP 2.0.6
or Open Transport 1.1 installed.  Using Open Transport 1.1 is the
recommended method for connecting to the Internet.  However, Open Transport
1.1 is not available for all Macintosh models; refer to the
"Troubleshooting Open Transport 1.1" section for more information.  Without
Open Transport 1.1, you need to use MacTCP 2.0.6 instead.  If your
Macintosh supports the Open Transport software and you are using System
7.5, 7.5.1, or 7.5.2, you can obtain a System 7.5.3 upgrade from Apple
Corporation.  This upgrade will install Open Transport 1.1.

Note:  You may experience problems playing Close Combat using any
      version of Open Transport earlier than version 1.1.  The problem
      exists on most PCI Power Macintosh computers running System
      7.5.2.  It is recommended that you upgrade to Open Transport 1.1
      or later. Open Transport 1.1 can be installed from the System
      7.5.3 upgrade.

You need to know your or your opponent's IP address when playing in two-
player mode.  To find out what your IP address is, see the section later in
this document that pertains to your networking software.

Open Transport 1.1

Make sure that Open Transport 1.1 is installed.  To do this, choose Control
Panels from the Apple menu and search for TCP/IP.  If it is not there, then
Open Transport is not installed.  Open Transport is only available in
System 7.5.2 or higher. To install Open Transport 1.1:

Insert your System 7.5 installation CD or floppy disk 1 and launch the
System 7.5 installer.

Click Continue at the initial screen.

Choose Custom Install.

Click the Networking Software tab, then check Open Transport 1.1.

Click Install to complete the installation.

Contact your Internet Service Provider for complete instructions on how to
install the appropriate PPP or SLIP software in order to use your modem to
connect to the Internet.  See the "Troubleshooting Open Transport 1.1"
section for a list of compatible PPP or SLIP software.

Confirming Your IP Address

When you start Close Combat and click on the two-player button, a screen
will appear that displays your IP Address.  This is your current IP address
that your opponent can use to establish a connection with you.

If an IP address is not being displayed, then you do not have access to the
Internet and will not be able to play Close Combat in two-player mode.  Use
the following procedure to make sure that your Macintosh has access to the
Internet:

From the Apple menu, choose Controls Panels and then TCP/IP.

In the Connect Via pop-up menu, choose your connection type.

In the Setup portion of the window, enter the appropriate
   information for your network.  This can be obtained from your
   Internet Service Provider or your Network Administrator.

From the Edit menu, choose User Mode.

Select Advanced and press OK.

Click the Options button.

Make sure TCP/IP is active.  If you are directly connected to the
   network, clear the Load Only When Needed check box.  If you are
   connecting to the Internet by way of a service provider, select the
   Load Only When Needed check box. This will load TCP/IP when you
   connect to your service provider in step 9.

Close the TCP/IP control panel, saving any changes, and then
   restart your Macintosh.

If necessary, connect to your Internet Service Provider.

From the Apple menu, choose Controls Panels and then TCP/IP.  The
   TCP/IP window should now display your IP address.

Communicate your IP address to your opponent.

Note: Because IP addresses often change each time you connect to the
     Internet, you need to stay connected to the Internet if you want
     to give your IP address to someone else. In most cases you cannot
     disconnect, call someone with your IP address, and reconnect.

Start the Close Combat program. Click the two-player button.  Your
   IP address should now be displayed.

Troubleshooting Open Transport 1.1

Non-PCI Based Macintoshes

With early Power Macintosh computers, Open Transport may be installed but
will not be activated.  This will prevent the Control Panels from
displaying the TCP/IP control panel. To activate Open Transport:

Open the Apple Extras folder on the hard drive.

Double-click on the Network Software Selector icon.

In the Network Software Selector window, verify that the Use Open
   Transport Networking check box is selected.  If it is not, select
   it.

Close the window and restart your Macintosh.

TCP/IP should now be located in the Control Panels folder.

Note: The Apple Extras is the default location for the Network Software
     Selector program.  If you do not have this folder directly on
     your hard drive, it may have been moved.  Try looking elsewhere
     for the Network Software Selector program; if you still cannot
     find it, you may need to reinstall the Open Transport software.

System 7.5.2

Open Transport 1.0 is included in System 7.5.2.  If you have System 7.5.2
and are upgrading to System 7.5.3, Open Transport will be upgraded to
version 1.1 as well.  To obtain the System 7.5.3 upgrade, contact Apple
Corporation.

Power Macintosh Compatibility

As of this writing, Open Transport 1.1 cannot be active on the desktop
5200, 5300, 6200, and the 6300 series computers. You must use MacTCP 2.0.6
to play Close Combat in two-player mode.

Connection Type Missing

If your connection type is missing in the Connect Via pop-up menu, make
sure that the software necessary to connect to your Internet Service
Provider is properly installed, and then restart your Macintosh.

Open Transport Compatibility With MacTCP mdevs

Open Transport 1.1 is compatible with the following MacTCP mdevs:

FreePPP - version 1.0.4 or later
MacPPP - version 2.1.4 SD or later (version 2.2.0 is not recommended).
InterPPP - version 1.2.9 or later
nterPPP II - version 1.1 or later
InterSLIP - version 1.0.1 or later
MacSLIP - version 3.0.2 or later
VersaTerm SLIP - version 1.1.4 or later
Sonic PPP - version 1.0.2 or later
AOL Link - the most current version is recommended

For further help on installing the MacTCP mdevs, consult the instructions
provided by your Internet Service Provider.

MacTCP 2.0.6

Make sure that MacTCP 2.0.6 is installed.  To do this, choose Control
Panels from the Apple menu, and search for MacTCP.  If it is not there,
then MacTCP has not been installed. To install MacTCP:

Insert your System 7.5 installation CD or floppy disk 1 and launch the
System 7.5 installer.

Press Continue at the initial screen.

Choose Custom Install.

Click on the Networking Software tab (or Control Panels if this is
System 7.5 Update 1), then select MacTCP.

Click on Install to complete the installation.

Contact your Internet Service Provider for complete instructions on how to
install the appropriate PPP or SLIP software in order to use your modem to
connect to the Internet.  MacTCP is compatible with many PPP or SLIP
software, including FreePPP and MacPPP.

Confirming Your IP Address

When you start Close Combat and click on the two-player button, a screen
appears that displays your IP address. This is your current IP address that
your opponent can use to establish a connection with you.

If an IP address is not being displayed, then you do not have access to the
Internet and will not be able to play Close Combat in two-player mode.  Use
the following procedure to make sure that your Macintosh has access to the
Internet.

From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels and then MacTCP.

Choose your connection type by clicking on the appropriate icon in the
top portion of the window.

Click the More... button.

In the window that appears, enter the appropriate information for your
network.  This can be obtained from your Internet Service Provider or your
Network Administrator.

Click the OK button.

Close the MacTCP window and then restart your Macintosh.

If necessary, connect to your Internet Service Provider.

From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels and then MacTCP.  The MacTCP
window should now display your IP address.

Communicate your IP address to your opponent.

Note: Because IP addresses often change each time you connect to the
Internet, you need to stay connected to the Internet if you want to give
your IP address to someone else. In most cases you cannot disconnect, call
someone with your IP address, and then reconnect.

Start the Close Combat program, and click on the two-player button.
Your IP address should now be displayed.

Troubleshooting MacTCP 2.0.6

Connection Type Missing
