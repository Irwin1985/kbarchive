SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Account Synchronization (SNAPMP) service coordinates all updates to
the host account cache(s) and all password synchronization activities in
Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 2000 and host security domains. The
SNAPMP service that is operating in a master (or primary) role registers itself
with the master SNA Host Account Cache service in all Windows NT and Windows
2000 domains listed in its MDBDomains registry parameter. The SNAPMP service
does not complete initialization and start normal operation until it has
registered in each of the configured domains.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Host Security Setup program included in Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 and 4.0
displays a dialog box that allows you to enter the Windows NT or Windows 2000
domain that contains the host account cache(s). However, the Setup program that
installs the SNAPMP service in Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 does not
include a dialog box that allows you to enter the Windows NT or Windows 2000
domain(s) that contain host account cache(s).

The SNAPMP service maintains the list of Windows NT and Windows 2000 domains that
contain the host account cache(s) in the following registry entry:

  

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  \SYSTEM
      \CurrentControlSet
          \Services
              \SnaPMP
                  \Parameters
                      \MdbDomains:REG_MULTI_SZ: &lt;list of domains&gt;          

The SNAPMP service included with Host Integration Server 2000 determines the
domain name of the computer running Windows NT or Windows 2000 that it is being
installed on. It then adds this domain name to the MdbDomains registry
parameter. In a single domain environment, the SNAPMP service is installed in
the same domain as the Host Account Cache service. Therefore, the MdbDomains
value is correct.

In a multiple domain environment, the SNAPMP service needs to be installed on the
PDC (Windows NT 4.0) or PDC Emulator (Windows 2000) in each domain that contains
accounts for users that will participate in the host security domain. In these
environments, the MdbDomains parameter may be incorrect on at least some of the
systems because the master host account cache is likely to reside in a domain
other then the one the SNAPMP service resides in.

In an environment that contains multiple master (primary) host account caches,
the MdbDomains parameter must contain the domain names for all domains that
contain master host account caches. The MdbDomains parameter will be incomplete
because it will only have one domain name, which may also be incorrect if the
local domain does not contain a master host account cache.

The last two scenarios require an update to the MdbDomains parameter. This update
can be done by modifying the registry manually on all the servers that the
SNAPMP service has been installed on. However, Host Integration Server 2000
includes a the command line utility Hostseccfg.exe that can be used to update
this registry parameter.

The Hostseccfg.exe file can also be used to perform a few other host security
related functions. The following is a list of the available options for this
utility:

  /? - Displays help

  /PRIMARY - Sets the SNAPMP role to primary.

  /BACKUP - Sets the SNAPMP role to backup.

  /UDBDOMAIN &lt;domain names&gt; - Windows NT or Windows 2000 domain names that
  will be written to the MdbDomains registry parameter. Any current domains in
  MdbDomains are overwritten unless the /APPEND or /REMOVE options are used.
  Domain names must be separated by spaces.

  /APPEND - Used with /UDBDOMAIN to append domain name(s) to the MdbDomains
  registry parameter.

  /REMOVE - Used with /UDBDOMAIN to remove domain name(s) from the MdbDomains
  registry parameter.

  /ACCOUNTPASSWORD - Used to specify new service account password for the SNAPMP
  and SNA Host Account Cache services.

  /PRINT - Displays the current role of the SNAPMP service and the current
  MdbDomains list.

NOTE: The parameters are not case sensitive.

The following are examples of how to use the Hostseccfg.exe file to update the
MdbDomains parameter:

- Overwrite and replace the existing MDbDomains value with a domain name of
  DOMAIN1:

  hostseccfg /udbdomain DOMAIN1

- Add domains DOMAIN2 and DOMAIN3 to the current MDbDomains list:

  hostseccfg /udbdomain DOMAIN2 DOMAIN3 /APPEND

- Remove DOMAIN2 from the existing MdbDomains list:

  hostseccfg /UDBDOMAIN DOMAIN2 /REMOVE

NOTE: HOSTSECCFG must be run on each system that the SNAPMP service is installed
on in order to update the MdbDomains registry parameter on each system.
