The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Show method of Data Report to preview the report, the page
orientation defaults to the default printer settings on the local computer.
Therefore, if the orientation of the default printer settings is set to Portrait
of standard Letter paper and your report width is more than 8.5 inches wide, the
following error occurs:

  Report Width is Larger than the Paper Width

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the width of your report exceeds the maximum width
specified by the default printer settings. The width of the report is determined
by taking the sum of the RightMargin, LeftMargin, and ReportWidth properties.

When a report prints or displays, the default printer settings in the Printers
Folders are used to determine the layout of the report. Because the Printer
object in Visual Basic cannot modify the default printer settings, if your
default printer orientation is set to Portrait of standard Letter paper and you
design a report that extends beyond 8.5 inches wide, the preceding error
occurs.

NOTE: The LeftMargin, RightMargin, and ReportWidth properties are denoted in
twips, and 1440 twips equal 1 inch.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4 and later service packs include a new
property called Orientation for Data Report. The value for this property is:

- rptOrientDefault = 0
- rptOrientPortrait = 1
- rptOrientLandscape = 2

With this property, you are able to tell the Data Report not to use the
orientation setting of the default printer in the Printers Folders. Following is
the syntax for implementing the Orientation property:

DataReport1.Orientation = rptOrientLandscape
DataReport1.Show

When you use this new Orientation property in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4,
you may encounter the error below:

  Compiler Error
  Method or Data member not found.

To fix this error, delete the values for DataMember and DataSource properties of
the Data Report and reassign these two properties with the original values.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the next service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Locate the default printer settings in Printers Folders on Windows. Make sure
  that the page orientation is set to Portrait of standard Letter paper.

2. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add a Command button to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
    DataReport1.Show
  End Sub

5. From the Project menu, select Add Data Environment. DataEnvironment1 is added
  by default.

6. In DataEnvironment1, right-click on Connection1 and choose Properties. Set
  the properties of Connection1 to be the following:

   - On the Provider tab, set Provider to Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider.

   - Click Next.

   - On the Connection tab, set the database name to NWIND.MDB, which should be
     in the folder where Visual Basic 6.0 is installed.

   - Click on Test Connection to make sure you are connected to the database,
     and then click OK.

7. Right-click on Connection1 and choose Add Command. Command1 is added by
  default.

8. Right-click on Command1 and select Properties. Set the properties of Command1
  to be the following:

   - On the General tab, change the Database object to Table.

   - On the Object Name combo box, select Employees, and then click OK.

9. From the Project menu, select Add Data Report. DataReport1 is added by
  default.

10. Set the properties of DataReport1 to be the following:

   - Set the DataSource property to DataEnvironment1.

   - Set the DataMember property to Command1.

   - Set the ReportWidth property to 11520 (8 inches).

   - Set the LeftMargin property to 1440 (1 inch).

   - Set the RightMargin property to 1440 (1 inch).

11. If you add ReportWidth, LeftMargin and RightMargin, you can see that the
  total report width is 10 inches, which is wider than 8.5 inches. So the Data
  Report should be placed on Landscape orientation of a standard Letter paper.

12. Press the F5 key to run the program.

13. Click on Command1, and note that the error message in the "Symptoms" section
  of this article occurs.

Steps to Fix the Problem in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open the preceding project in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4.

2. Replace the code in Form1's code window with the following:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
    DataReport1.Orientation = rptOrientLandscape
    DataReport1.Show
  End Sub

3. Delete the values for the DataMember and DataSource properties of
  DataReport1.

4. Reassign the DataMember and DataSource properties of DataReport1 to be the
  following:

   - Set the DataSource property to DataEnvironment1.

   - Set the DataMember property to Command1.

5. Press F5 to run the program.

6. Click the Command1 button and note that DataReport1 is shown in Landscape
  orientation.
