-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In certain situations, an Exchange Server site is built with Recipients
containers which follow an organizational structure. After you add a mailbox to
one of these containers you cannot move it to another container within the
directory when the person changes locations within the organization.

For example, during the initial setup of your Exchange Server directory you
defined four Recipients containers: Sales, Marketing, Operations, and
Administration, and created mailboxes in each container based on the group each
individual works in. When User A in Operations moves to the Administration
group, you cannot move User A's mailbox to the Administration container.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although there is no way to change the location where the objects are stored in
the Exchange Server directory without re-creating the account, you can use
Address Book Views to change the view that the users see to reflect the current
organizational structure. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Populate the field by which the Global Address List is sorted (such as the
  Department field) for all mailboxes in the site.

2. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, on the File menu, point to New
  Other, and then click Address Book View.

3. Type the "&lt;display name&gt;" (without the quotation marks) and the
  "&lt;directory name&gt;" (without the quotation marks) for the view you want
  to create.

  NOTE: Type a descriptive directory name (for example, "Departments" (without
  the quotation marks)) to make it easier to sort the directory.

4. Click the Group By tab and click the field by which you want to organize the
  view.

5. Click the Permissions tab, and then under Search, grant permissions for the
  group that will use this view.

6. Click the Domain Users group if you want all users on your Exchange Server
  messaging system to see the updated view.

7. Click Apply, and then click OK.

You have created containers in the Address List in Outlook that match your
current organizational structure, but users can still view the original
containers. You can hide the original containers so that the only containers
viewable through Outlook are the Global Address List and the new Address Book
Views. To hide the original containers, follow these steps:

1. In the Directory Service Site Configuration object, click Properties, and
  then configure an anonymous account.

2. To locate the Directory Service Site Configuration object, follow these
  steps:

  a. Click to expand the Site object, and then click to expand the
     Configuration object.

  b. Click the "Directory Service Site Configuration" object.

3. In the Administrator program, click Options on the Tools menu.

4. On the Permissions tab, click to select "Display rights for roles on
  permissions page".

5. In the Administrator program, click the Site object, and then click
  Properties on the File menu.

6. Click the Permissions tab.

7. Grant Search permissions for a Windows NT account that is not assigned to a
  user. Do not remove any permissions from this service account.

8. Follow the same process on the configuration container.
