IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

By default, during 802.2 connection startup, a computer running SNA Server on an
Ethernet network tests link station-to-link station connectivity by sending four
LLC test commands (both 802.3 and DIX frame types to both the configured and
bit-flipped Media Access Control [MAC] addresses). For additional information on
this process , click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q123791 SNA Server Remote Station Discovery Process

In some environments, it may be necessary to force test commands to only be sent
to one of these two addresses. A registry entry is available for controlling
this process. For information on how to do this, see the "More Information"
section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNADLC?\Parameters\ExtraParameters

  NOTE: SNADLC? is the link service used by the connection, and needs
  bit-flipped TEST polls disabled.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: DisableFlipping
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1 (valid values are 0=enable both configured and bit-flipped addresses
  to be sent; or 1=send only bit-flipped address)

4. Quit Registry Editor.

After a test response is received, the next step in the connection process is for
SNA Server to send an XID request. SNA Server sends the XID request to the
address in the first test response that it receives. In some environments,
responses are received on both the configured and bit-flipped addresses. If the
first response received is not from the intended mainframe device or AS/400
computer, SNA Server cannot establish a connection with that device, and the
connection status stays pending.
