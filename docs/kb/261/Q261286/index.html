The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Systems Management Server (SMS) site server resides on a Windows
2000-based computer, changes to the site such as site control changes, new
packages and any component that needs access to the SQL database may operate
slowly or may not be able to update properly. When this occurs, there are no
status messages or Event Viewer updates to alert an administrator that this
problem is being encountered.

The Smsdbmon.log file may contain the following entry that indicates that the SQL
Monitor process is unable to connect to the Registry:

  ERROR: Could not connect to registry key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS on site server SMSServer04,
  sleeping 60 seconds. SMS_SQL_MONITOR 4/29/2000 11:51:03 PM
  ERROR: Could not connect to registry key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS on site server SMSServer04,
  sleeping 60 seconds. SMS_SQL_MONITOR 4/29/2000 11:52:05 PM
  ERROR: Could not connect to registry key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS on site server SMSServer04,
  sleeping 60 seconds.

Also, the Smsexec.log file may contain the following entry:

  Initializing the status message reporting system... SMS_EXECUTIVE 4/29/2000
  11:50:49 PM 1756 (0x6DC)
  ERROR: Could not connect to registry key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS on site server SMSServer04,
  sleeping 60 seconds. SMS_EXECUTIVE 4/29/2000 11:50:52 PM
  ERROR: Could not connect to registry key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS on site server SMSServer04,
  sleeping 60 seconds. SMS_EXECUTIVE 4/29/2000 11:51:54 PM

Locally, if you log on to the SMS Site server with the SMS service account, you
will be able to review the SMS key in the registry. However, if you are
connecting to the registry of the Site Server from a remote computer, you may
receive a "registry editor can not access registry" error message.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Remote Registry service has been set to Disabled. If
the Remote Registry service has been set to Disabled, SMS processes may stop
working. This can occur under the following conditions:

- The Remote Registry service policy is set to "Define this Policy setting,"
  and it is set to Disabled.

- A domain controller is restarted.

NOTE: On a Windows 2000-based server, check the Remote Registry service to verify
that it is running. If it is not running, check the domain policy to determine
if this policy has been implemented. To check the Remote Registry service
policy:

1. Start the Microsoft Management Console tool, and add the Default Domain
  Policy snap-in if it is not already installed.

2. Double-click the following items to open them:

  Default Domain Policy
  Windows Settings
  Security Settings
  System Services
  Remote Registry Service

If the Remote Registry service policy is set to "Define this Policy setting," and
it is set to Disabled, when a domain controller is restarted the Remote Registry
service will not start. Instead, the Remote Registry service is set to Disabled,
and SMS processes may stop working.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, start the Remote Registry service manually to restore
functionality. If there was a policy that had caused the service to become
disabled, this policy should be modified to allow this service to start when the
computer is restarted. Note that if you start the Remote Registry service
manually, it should resolve the issue. However, the next time the computer is
restarted, it would adhere to that policy, and this may cause the service to
return to a disabled setting.
