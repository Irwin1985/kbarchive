Method 2: Change the Security Permissions in the Windows Registry

that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot

incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

4. After the Alki Proofing Tools setup has completed successfully, click Run on
  the Windows Start menu.

5. In the Open box, type "Regedt32.exe" (without the quotation marks) and then
  click OK.

6. Find the following Windows Registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing Tools

7. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

8. On the Security tab, under Name, click to select the group to whom you want
  to grant permissions to access the Alki Proofing Tools. For example, click to
  select the Everyone group.
