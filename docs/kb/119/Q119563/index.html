-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0a, 3.2, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation user tries to modify a
user in the personal address list by choosing Address, Modify or tries to get
details of a user from the postoffice address list, the following error message
may be displayed:

  Notice 62 Address no longer valid. User or postoffice no longer exists.

CAUSE
=====

The last 4 bytes of each record in the postoffice address list (POL) (ADMIN.NME
and ADMINSHD.NME) contain the eight digit hexadecimal ID (hexid) of the user.
This information is also contained in the ACCESS*.GLB files on the postoffice.
When there is a discrepancy in the hexid between the postoffice address lists
and the ACCESS files, the above error message is displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1
--------

The user can be deleted and re-added from the postoffice. The administrator will
have to ensure that the user retrieves his mail and makes necessary backups
before deleting the user from the postoffice. This method will result in the
invalidation of this user's address in personal address lists of other users.

Method 2
--------

Determine the hexid of the user by using LISTUSER utility. The hexid in ADMIN.NME
and ADMINSHD.NME need to be modified to reflect the correct hexid.


DEBUG must be used to reset the bytes in ADMIN.NME. The procedure listed below
can be used if the ADMIN.NME is not greater than 64K. If the ADMIN.NME is
greater than 64K, please consult the MS-DOS debug manual for more information.

1. Make a backup of ADMIN.NME (for example, copy admin.nme admin.bak)

2. DEBUG ADMIN.BAK

3. At the prompt, search for the full name (alias) in ADMIN.BAK as follows. Use
  the exact full name (case sensitive) as found in the address list:

  -s from to 'fullname'

  where "from" and "to" indicate the range of addresses to search. This will
  return an address of the form YYYY:ZZZZ, indicating that it has found a
  match. If there is no match, it just returns the prompt. For example:

  -s 100 FFFF 'John Smith'

  Returns a 3068:0500

4. At the prompt, do a Dump to view the record

  -d ZZZZ

  where ZZZZ is the same ZZZZ returned from step 3.

  This will display the name of the user and the hexid of the user. The hex ID
  of the user is an eight digit (4 byte) number, like 00000001.

5. At the prompt, type

  "-h ZZZZ 27" (without the quotation marks)

  where ZZZZ is the same ZZZZ returned from step 3.

  This will return 2 values separated by a space

  VAL1 VAL2

  VAL1 is the start of the hexid field for that user.

6. At the prompt, type

  "-dVAL1" (without the quotation marks)

  The first four bytes represent the hexid and are listed starting from the
  least significant byte to the most significant byte.

  For example, if the first four bytes displayed are 00 01 02 03, the hexid is
  03020100.

7. The value in these 4 bytes need to be modified to match the output from
  LISTUSER. Modify the value in these 4 bytes by using the edit command of
  debug. At the prompt, type

  "-eVAL1" (without the quotation marks)

  Type in the correct value for this byte. You can view and change the other
  bytes of the hexid by using the Space Bar.

8. To save the file type W (Write) at the prompt, and then Q to quit.

  "-w
  -q" (without the quotation marks)

  The ADMIN.BAK created above should be the same size as ADMIN.NME.

9. COPY ADMIN.BAK ADMIN.NME

10. COPY ADMIN.NME ADMINSHD.NME

MORE INFORMATION
================

In step 3 of Method 2, with the search command

  -S from to 'fullname'

you can use FFFF in your "To" field, to avoid computation, even if your file size
is less than 64K. If you want to be accurate, the "To" field should be
100+filesize-1 (hex addition). The file size can be determined using RCX at the
DEBUG prompt.

Please see the Microsoft MS-DOS "User's Guide" for additional information on
using DEBUG.
