SYMPTOMS
========

During the T1 phase of directory synchronization (Dir-Sync), the requestor may
not send any updates to the Dir-Sync server, even though address changes have
occurred at the postoffice.

The DIRSYNC.LOG file on that postoffice may contain the following status at T1
time, indicating that all transactions at the postoffice are being ignored:

  No requestor updates to send

CAUSE
=====

The ReqSync number in the REQCONF.GLB file on the postoffice may be higher than
the transaction number in the REQTRANS.GLB file. You can use the LISTQ utility
to determine the transaction number and you can use the LISTDS utility to
determine the ReqSync number. Both the LISTQ utility and the LISTDS utility are
included in the "Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" document.

RESOLUTION
==========

Case 1: Problems with Non-Dir-Sync Server Requestors
----------------------------------------------------

If this problem occurs on a postoffice that is not the Dir-Sync server:

1. Start the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) and select Config, Dir-
  Sync, Requestor, Export.

2. Run the LISTQ utility to dump the contents of the REQTRANS.GLB file and
  determine the transaction number (sync number) for the last transaction.

3. Run the LISTDS utility to display the contents of the REQCONF.GLB file on the
  Dir-Sync server. Determine the ReqSync number.

4. Transactions in REQTRANS.GLB that have a transaction number less than the
  ReqSync number noted in step 3 will be ignored. The transaction number in
  REQTRANS.GLB can be increased by repeatedly performing a Config, Dir- Sync,
  Requestor, Export. Doing repeated exports may not be feasible if the ReqSync
  number determined in step 3 is very high. In this case, use the RESYNC.GLB as
  follows:

  a. Use the IMPORT utility with the -S option to create a RESYNC.GLB file on
     the Dir-Sync server postoffice.

  b. Copy the RESYNC.GLB file to the problem postoffice and run IMPORT with -Q
     option. RESYNC.GLB is a generic file that can be applied to any requestor.

  When you run IMPORT to process the RESYNC.GLB file, the REQSYNC, SRVSYNC, and
  IMPORTSYNC options in the REQCONF.GLB file are updated with the sync numbers
  in the header transaction in the RESYNC.GLB file. REQTRANS.GLB is also
  updated with the last confirmed sync number transaction.

  The administrator at the requestor postoffice should use RESYNC.GLB before
  adding any transactions at the postoffice. If transactions have already been
  added, they should be re-added because RESYNC.GLB will change the ReqSync
  number in the REQCONF.GLB. As a result, transactions in REQTRANS.GLB that
  have a lower number than ReqSync will be ignored.

If using RESYNC.GLB does not resolve the problem, you can resolve the situation
by performing a Dir-Sync reset for that requestor postoffice as follows:

1. On the server postoffice, run the Mail Administrator program. Select Config,
  Dir-Sync, Server, Requestors and delete and re-add the requestor record.

2. On the requestor postoffice, run the LISTDS utility as follows: listds admin
  -ppassword -ddrive -r -z

3. Create a zero-byte REQTRANS.GLB file in the GLB subdirectory of the
  postoffice. You can use the TYPE NUL&gt;REQTRANS.GLB command to create a
  zero-byte file.

4. Run the Mail Administrator program. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Types
  and reset the types of names propagated. Select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
  Export to re-export the address list.

Case 2: Problems with the Dir-Sync Server Requestor
---------------------------------------------------

When this problem occurs on the Dir-Sync server postoffice:

1. From the Mail Administrator program, select Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor,
  Export.

2. Run the LISTQ utility to dump the contents of the REQTRANS.GLB file and
  determine the transaction number (sync number) for the last transaction.

3. Run the LISTDS utility to display the contents of the REQCONF.GLB file on the
  Dir-Sync server. Determine the ReqSync number.

4. Transactions in REQTRANS.GLB that have a transaction number less than the
  ReqSync number noted in step 3 will be ignored. The transaction number in
  REQTRANS.GLB can be increased by repeatedly performing a Config, Dir- Sync,
  Requestor, Export.

  Doing repeated exports may not be feasible if the ReqSync number determined in
  step 3 is very high. If this is the case, you should call Microsoft Product
  Support Services and send in you REQCONF.GLB and SRVCONF.GLB files to have
  the files reset.


MORE INFORMATION
================

REQTRANS.GLB is the directory synchronization transaction file that contains the
transactions on that postoffice. Each transaction has a transaction number or
sync number associated with it.
