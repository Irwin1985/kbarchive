SUMMARY
=======

If you have a parent table that has two or more child tables, and when you
create a report from these tables, you want to create a data grouping on a key
field in the parent table, and within the Detail band you want to print first
all of the related records from the first child table, followed by all the
related records from the second child table (followed by all records from
subsequent child tables in turn), follow one of the procedures below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example 1
---------

This example assumes that there are three tables:

- A parent table, PARENT.DBF, with two fields:

   - CODE: A character field of width 2

   - DESRIPT: A character field of width 2

- Two child tables, CHILD1.DBF and CHILD2.DBF, with identical structures:

   - CODE: A character field of width 2

   - SALES: A numeric field of width 10 with two decimal places

The example also assumes that the values for CODE are unique in the PARENT table,
and that there are some records in both CHILD1 and CHILD2 that have values in
the CODE field that also exist in the PARENT table. All three tables are indexed
on the CODE field, and ORDER is set to that index. This example will produce the
desired results regardless of whether a RELATION is set from PARENT to either of
the child tables, and regardless of the SET SKIP (one-to-many) condition.

1. Create a program (CHLDLST.PRG) with the following code:

        PARAMETERS parentkey, childalias, string_exp
        *parentkey is the field that all tables are indexed on.
        *string_exp is the field in the child, must be a character expression
        STORE "" TO ret_val
        STORE ALIAS() TO was_alias  &amp;&amp;parent table
        m_exact=SET("EXACT")
        SET EXACT ON                 &amp;&amp;this is necessary for INLIST
        one2many=INLIST(UPPER(childalias),UPPER(SET("SKIP")))
        SELECT (childalias)
        IF NOT one2many
           SEEK EVALUATE(was_alias + "." + parentkey)
        ENDIF
        IF FOUND()                    &amp;&amp; are there related child records?
           SCAN WHILE EVALUATE(childalias + "." + parentkey) = ;
           EVALUATE(was_alias + "." + parentkey)
        * get the data from the current record in the child
               STORE ret_val + EVALUATE(string_exp) ;
                  + CHR(13) + CHR(10) TO ret_val
        * add carriage return &amp; linefeed
           ENDSCAN
       ENDIF
       SELECT (was_alias)
       SET EXACT &amp;m_exact
       * ret_val is now a concatenation of child records, separated by CR/LF
       RETURN ret_val

2. With the three tables open, and PARENT being the selected table, create a new
  report that has a data grouping on the CODE field from the PARENT table. In
  the group header band, place the two fields from the PARENT table. In the
  Detail band, create two fields with an empty line separating them. The
  expression for the first field is:

        IIF(is_newkey=1,chldlst("code","child1","str(sales,10,2)"),"")

  The expression for the second field is:

        IIF(is_newkey=1,chldlst("code","child2","str(sales,10,2)"),"")

  For both fields, do one of the following:

   - On the Windows and Macintosh platforms, open the Report Expression dialog
     box, choose the Top -- Field Can Stretch radio button under Position
     Relative To, select the Print When check box, and select the Remove Line
     If Blank check box.

     -or-

   - On the MS-DOS platform, open the Report Expression dialog box, and select
     the Stretch Vertically and Float As Band Stretches check boxes. From the
     Report menu, choose Page Layout, choose the Options button, and select the
     Suppress Blank Lines check box.

3. Create two report variables in the following order:

  NOTE: It is critical that these variables appear in the correct order in the
  list of report variables.

   - Variable Name : is_newkey
     Value to Store: iif(curr_key=parent.code,0,1)
     Initial Value : 1

   - Variable Name : curr_key
     Value to Store: parent.code
     Initial Value : ' '

     With these report variables defined, is_newkey = 1 only when the key field
     (CODE) in the PARENT table changes.

4. Make sure the program CHLDLST.PRG is in the same subdirectory as the report
  or in a subdirectory that is in the FoxPro path. Also make sure that the
  parent table is in the active work area.

This program can be customized to include (for example) subtotals for each child
table, draw dividing lines between the children, and so on.

Example 2
---------

You can also use the SELECT-SQL statement with the UNION ALL clause to obtain a
table combining the records from both the parent and child tables.

Use the following code to set up tables for this example:

     USE customer IN 1
     USE invoices IN 2
     COPY TO inv2
     USE inv2 IN 3

The following SELECT-SQL statement could be used to join these tables into a
cursor file that could then be used in a report. The resulting cursor will have
all the related records for the first child, followed by the related records for
the second child for each parent record. In this example, a character field is
used to indicate from which child table the data comes and to further illustrate
the point.

     SELECT customer.cno, customer.contact, "child#1", invoices.ino, ;
        invoices.idate ;
        FROM customer, invoices ;
        WHERE customer.cno=invoices.cno ;
        UNION ALL ;
        SELECT customer.cno, customer.contact, "child#2", inv2.ino, ;
           inv2.idate ;
           FROM customer, inv2 ;
           WHERE customer.cno=inv2.cno ;
           ORDER BY 1
