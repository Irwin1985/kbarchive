SUMMARY
=======

The UNION clause is used to join the results of multiple queries. However, the
UNION clause is not supported by the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) tool
because the RQBE tool does not support multiple or nested queries. Therefore, to
perform queries of this type, the SELECT statement must be coded by hand.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UNION clause is a very important clause in the SELECT statement because it
allows you to append the results of a query to the results of another query. The
syntax is:

  UNION [ALL] &lt;SELECT statement&gt;

The ALL clause prevents UNION from eliminating duplicate rows from the combined
results of the tables.

NOTE: There is no limit to the number of UNION clauses that can be used, except
that the whole SELECT statement is limited to 2048 characters.

There are three rules you need to follow when using a UNION clause. They are as
follows:

1. A UNION clause cannot be used to join nested SELECT statements.

2. If an ORDER BY or an INTO clause is used, it must be placed in the last
  SELECT statement.

3. SELECT statements joined with a UNION clause must have identical structures
  for the resulting tables of both statements.

The last rule is very important to keep in mind because you may need to join two
tables that have different structures. For example, one of the tables may
contain a memo field while the other does not. In this case, you have two
options. If the information in the field is not needed, do not include that
particular field in the SELECT statement. If the field is needed, insert a
placeholder in the SELECT statement for the other table. The placeholders for
the different data types are as follows:

  Numeric:   0
  Character: " "
  Date:      {}
  Logical:   .F.
  Memo:      Not available. Use workaround described below.

To create a placeholder for a memo field:

1. Create a database called HOLDMEMO with only one field: a memo field called
  PLACEHOLD.

2. USE the database.

3. In the Command window, type:

        APPEND BLANK

Now that the placeholder has been created, it has to be added to the SELECT
statement. Here is an example of using a memo field placeholder with the
CUSTOMER.DBF file:

     SELECT *,placehold FROM customer, holdmemo INTO CURSOR test

The resulting query will have a blank memo field as the last field for each
record. This behavior occurs because there is not a join condition for the
databases, which creates a Cartesian product. In other words, each record in the
first table is matched with each record in the second table.

For another example of the UNION clause, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
