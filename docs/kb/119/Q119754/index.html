-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, versions 2.0, 7.0 
- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a custom application that you created with the Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools or the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, you receive
a compile error. The same application runs correctly when you run it with the
retail version of Microsoft Access.

CAUSE
=====

This compile error will occur in Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Access for
Windows 95 version 7.0 if your application uses methods or properties in a
referenced database that has not been included in the application distribution
set or if Microsoft Access cannot establish a valid reference. (Wizards in
Microsoft Access 97 and in Microsoft Access 7.0 are shipped in a compiled state
and cannot be referenced.)

A similar error can occur in Microsoft Access version 2.0 if you make a reference
in your application's code to functions or variables defined in the WZLIB.MDA
file (which cannot be legally distributed with your application), or to any
other library database that is not loaded in your application.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remove or modify the code in your application that refers to the WZLIB.MDA file,
or to any other file that is not referenced (in Microsoft Access 97 and 7.0) or
not loaded (in version 2.0).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft Access 7.0
--------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft Access 7.0 run-time environment uses the
same executable file (Msaccess.exe) as the full Microsoft Access environment. To
test the run-time application on a computer with full Microsoft Access
installed, start the application using the run-time switch on the command line.
For example, the following command line starts Microsoft Access and opens the
Northwind sample database in the run-time environment.

NOTE: In the following example, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is used as
a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the line
when re-creating this example.

Microsoft Access 97:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\MSAccess.exe /Runtime _
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb

Microsoft Access 7.0:

  C:\MSOffice\Access\MSAccess.exe /Runtime C:\MSOffice\Access\Samples_
  \Northwind.mdb

If a compile error occurs on one computer but not when opened as a run-time
application on the development computer, you may have referenced methods or
procedures contained in a file that you failed to distribute.

To check the references that are available on the development computer, open the
application in full Microsoft Access. On the View menu, click Code to open a
code module. On the View menu, click Object Browser. If the drop down list
labeled Libraries/Databases contains a custom database and if you have used a
function, method, or property from it, you must distribute that custom database
with your application.

Microsoft Access Version 2.0
----------------------------

The WZLIB.MDA library database contains routines and utilities used by the
Microsoft Access Wizards and by other code. For example, the Reattach NWIND
module in the SOLUTION.MDB database (a sample database shipped with Microsoft
Access version 2.0) includes a function that refers to WZLIB.MDA.

If you include code in your application that refers to the WZLIB.MDA file, and
then run your application with the retail version of Microsoft Access, the
application will run correctly. However, if you run the Setup Wizard to create
distribution disks for your application, and correctly modify the initialization
(.INI) file for the application to remove the Wizard files from the [Libraries]
section, you will receive a compile error when you run the application as a
run-time application. Note that error-trapping routines that you may have
included in your code will not be called, because these routines cannot trap
compile errors.

To discover which section of your code is causing the compile error, run your
application with the retail version of Microsoft Access, but with your
application's custom .INI file. For example, to run an application called
MYAPP.MDB with a custom .INI file called MYAPP.INI, create an icon with the
following command line.

NOTE: This example assumes that you have Microsoft Access installed in the ACCESS
directory on drive C, and that the MYAPP.MDB application is in the MYAPP
directory on drive C.

  C:\ACCESS\MSACCESS.EXE C:\MYAPP\MYAPP.MDB /INI C:\MYAPP\MYAPP.INI

This command will run the MYAPP.MDB application with only the libraries specified
in the [Libraries] section of the custom MYAPP.INI file. Compile your
application's code at this point to locate the cause of the compile error.

NOTE: If you open a module in Design view and then choose Compile Loaded Modules
from the Run menu, code in any form or report modules will not be compiled. To
compile code in form and report modules, the forms and reports must be open in
Design view.
