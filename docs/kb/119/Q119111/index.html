-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) processes are not run at the times they
are scheduled.

CAUSE
=====

Possible causes are:

1. The PROCESS.GLB file on the postoffice is corrupt.

2. The TZ variable is used inconsistently.

3. The time has changed to Daylight Saving Time.

4. The clock is set incorrectly on the computer running Dispatch.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following workarounds correspond with the causes listed above and correct
this problem:

1. If the PROCESS.GLB file on the postoffice is corrupt, use the DEBUG program
  to reset the PROCESS.GLB file to 512 bytes:

  debug process.glb
  -rcx
  xxxx
  :200
  -w
  -q

2. Use the Microsoft Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) or the DSSCHED
  utility included in the "Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" document.

3. If the TZ variable is being used, please refer to the following article in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base for proper and consistent usage:

  Q101753 PC DirSync: When to Use the Time Zone Option with Dir-Sync

  As an alternative to using DEBUG you can rename the corrupt PROCESS.GLB file
  and copy a non-corrupt PROCESS.GLB from a working REQUESTOR. This action can
  be performed without difficulty as long as the Timezone variable setting by
  the machine running the ADMIN program was the same for both the REQUESTOR
  that had the corrupt PROCESS.GLB and the REQUESTOR that has the non-corrupt
  PROCESS.GLB.

4. If the discrepancy is during Daylight Saving Time change, the Microsoft Mail
  Administrator should wait until the week after the Daylight Saving Time
  change and reschedule the times.

5. If the computer running Dispatch has its clock set incorrectly, reset the
  clock.
