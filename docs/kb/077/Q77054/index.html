SUMMARY
=======

If you are experiencing problems printing to to a network printer using an
Invisible Network, the TRUNCATE command may help solve those problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print to a network printer over the Invisible Network, print jobs are
automatically queued in the network print spooler. These print jobs are handled
in a "first-in first-out" method and will not print until the print spooler
receives the entire job.

The problem arises when the print job is large, or there is much activity on the
network, and the print spooler does not know when the end-of-file is reached for
that particular job. In this situation, the print spooler waits until it thinks
it has the whole job or until the application is closed before the print process
is carried out. With the TRUNCATE parameter set too low, the spooler may start
printing the job before the entire job is received, resulting in scrambled
output with another print job.

With an Invisible Network, the wait period can be modified by using the following
statement in the the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  truncate xxx

For example, TRUNCATE 10 cuts off the print stream after waiting 10 seconds to
receive the entire print job. The value xxx can range from 1-250 seconds of
waiting before the printer will start printing. The default for the TRUNCATE
command is no print truncation at all; it will not cut off the print stream.

According to Invisible Software technical support, a value of 10 is usually
adequate for the print spooler to receive the job and continue the printing
process. For word processing print jobs where the entire job is sent to the
printer at once, TRUNCATE 1 is suggested. However, database print jobs should
use a higher number for the TRUNCATE parameter because a database application
may send some information to the printer, then search the data base for more
information, send more data to the printer, and continue this process until the
database criteria has fully been met.
