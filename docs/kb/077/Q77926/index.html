The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides descriptions of each of the Mail database subdirectories.
It also lists the versions of Mail in which that subdirectory exists.

If a customer is experiencing a problem, the Mail administrator should NEVER
modify file sizes without first consulting with Microsoft Product Support
Services.

The following is a brief description of the database subdirectories (where
appropriate, default file sizes are listed):

Subdir    Description                                            Version(s)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATT       This subdirectory has 16 subdirectories that contain         All
         any attachment files that are used in the Mail system.
         Each of the 16 subdirectories contain encrypted
         attachment files. Files that have the .ATT extension are
         files that have been attached to a particular mail item.
         The reference to an attachment file is in the mail (.MAI)
         file itself. A single mail file can reference several
         attachments, but a single attachment file cannot be
         referenced more than once.

CAL       This subdirectory stores the online calendar files when      3.0
         Schedule+ is installed. The files are stored according       3.2
         to a hexadecimal (hexid) number that is assigned when
         the Schedule+ user first logs on.

         NOTE: The hexid number is NOT the same number as the
         one used by the Mail system!

FOLDERS   This subdirectory is used by the folders subsystem.          All
         All folder files are stored here initially. Mail users
         may optionally move individual private folders to local
         storage. Individual private folders are stored in the
         FOLDERS\LOC\&lt;hexid&gt; subdirectory. Group and shared
         folders are stored in the FOLDERS\PUB subdirectory. This
         storage method is used by all versions of the MS-DOS
         client, OS/2 client, and Macintosh client. It is also
         used by the version 2.1 Windows client.

         the &lt;serialno&gt;.IDX file in the FOLDERS subdirectory is
         4 bytes (fixed size). Individual &lt;nnnnnnnn&gt;.IDX files
         and the FOLDROOT.IDX file are (file size - 100 bytes) and
         should be divisible by 158.

GLB       The files in this directory are at the top of the            All
         hierarchy of the database and serve a variety of
         purposes. These files contain the core of the postoffice
         configuration. The GLB directory also contains error
         message and other types of files that do not contain
         postoffice configuration information. This is also the
         default location for modem scripts.

         File Sizes
         ----------

         ACCESS.GLB should be divisible by 586.
         ACCESS2.GLB should be divisible by 69.
         ACCESS3.GLB should be divisible by 512.

         The result for the three access files should be the same
         number.

         CONTROL.GLB    8 bytes fixed size
         FLAG.GLB       2 bytes fixed size
         GLOBAL.GLB     512 bytes fixed size
         GROUP.GLB      (file size - 4 bytes)
                        Should be divisible by 51
         GRPMEM.GLB     (file size - 4 bytes)
                        Should be divisible by 128
         MASTER.GLB     176 bytes fixed size
         MODEM.GLB      64 bytes fixed size
         NETPO.GLB      (file size - 4 bytes)
                        Should be divisible by 43
         NETWORK.GLB    Should be divisible by 122
         PROCESS.GLB    (file size - 512 bytes)
                        Should be divisible by 197
         REQCONF.GLB    512 bytes fixed size
         SERVER.GLB     Should be divisible by 181
         SVRCONF.GLB    On directory synchronization server only
                        1024 bytes + (1024 bytes * total number of POs)
         TID.GLB        4 bytes fixed size

GRP       This subdirectory contains the group pointer files for       All
         public and private distribution lists.

         The file size should be divisible by 8.

HLP       This subdirectory contains the Help files for the            All
         individual Mail programs. Help is opened when the F1
         key is pressed.

INF       This subdirectory contains the information files that        All
         correspond to the postoffice-defined template files.
         The INF file contains template ("about") information for
         every user defined in a .USR file. The .USR file is the
         user list for external Mail for PC Networks postoffices
         and has the same filename prefix as the postoffice's MBG
         file. The .INF file also has this same filename prefix.
         There may also be an ADMIN.INF file if the local postoffice
         administrator has defined a custom template. External
         postoffice .INF files only exist if another postoffice
         administrator exports templates. The record format of the
         .INF file is defined by the associated .TPL file. There is
         always an associated .TPL file with every .INF file.

INI       This subdirectory is the default location for .INI files     3.2
         used by the system; notably, by the Dispatch and External
         Mail programs.

KEY       This subdirectory contains the index files that are used     All
         to determine the location of the mail header in the
         individual user's mailbag (.MBG) file. There will always
         be a corresponding .MBG file in the MBG subdirectory. The
         .KEY file contains information such as the number of new
         mail items since the user last logged in, the amount of
         unread mail in the user's mailbag, and a bitmap of deleted
         records in the corresponding .MBG file. The bitmap is used
         so that when mail is sent to a user, a vacant record
         position in the user's .MBG file can be found directly by
         examining the bitmap rather than having to sequentially
         process the .MBG file looking for deleted records.

         The file size should be 560 bytes (fixed size).

LOG       This subdirectory is the default location for the log        All
         files created by the External Mail, Dispatch, and other
         gateway programs. The creation of these files is
         determined by the parameters that are specified when the
         various programs are started.

MAI       This subdirectory has 16 subdirectories that contain         All
         any message files that are used in the Mail system. Each
         of the 16 subdirectories contains encrypted message files.

MBG       This subdirectory contains the individual mailbag files      All
         that are used to store the Mail headers for an individual
         user. It is basically the file format of the first screen
         a user sees when he or she starts up the MS-DOS Mail or
         Monitor program. There will always be a corresponding key
         index (.KEY) file in the KEY subdirectory.

         The records contained in the mailbag (.MBG) file serve two
         purposes:

          - A non-deleted record acts as an index pointer to a mail
            item. Thus, a single mail file can be pointed to by many
            mailbag records. Each of these mailbag records must
            reside in separate .MBG files because two records in a
            single mailbag can never point to the same item of mail.

          - .MBG records contain summary information about the
            particular mail item. This information is used by the
            user agent programs to display a list of mail headers in
            the opening display of the user's mail. The mail file
            itself does not have to be read until the user selects
            it for processing (for example, by reading, deleting, and
            so forth). There is no delete flag in the .MBG record
            structure. Deleted status is maintained in the .KEY file,
            which has the same filename prefix as the .MBG file.

         There is a single .MBG file for every local user, of the
         format &lt;nnnnnnnn&gt;.MBG; there is a single .MBG file for
         every external postoffice or gateway that is defined; and
         there is an INQUEUE3.MBG file that is used to receive any
         mail from external sources and an INQUEUE.MBG file that is
         used for directory synchronization (Dir-Sync).

         Mail is delivered from the INQUEUE3.MBG file to individual
         mailbags via the Mailer process. The version 3.0 postoffice
         contains a special mailbag: SYSTEM.MBG. Mail addressed to
         network/postoffice/$system will be put here. This mailbag
         is currently used for Dir-Sync mail, but in future versions
         it may also be used for other system mail functions.

         The file size should be divisible by 116.

MEM       This subdirectory contains only the local members of         All
         global groups defined at this postoffice. External
         addresses are not part of the member list. Each record
         represents a user mailbag number. These files are only
         created for administrator-defined groups (that is,
         postoffice groups) and are used for quick access by
         Mailer for resolving groups.

         The file size should be divisible by 4.
         The maximum size should 2000 bytes.

MMF       This subdirectory contains the Mail message files (.MMF)     3.0
         used by the Windows clients in versions  3.0 and later.      3.2
         These files are stored by user hexid number.

NME       This subdirectory contains the files for the postoffice      All
         address list (POL), the global address list (GAL),
         gateway address lists, and the individual personal address
         lists (PALs) used by all clients in version 2.1, and in
         the MS-DOS, OS/2, and Macintosh clients in Mail versions
         3.0 and later. The concept of these lists is to allow
         dissimilar address types to reside in the same address list.

         The file size should be divisible by 45.

P1        This subdirectory is used by the External Mail program to    All
         store temporary mail files during a communications or
         postoffice-to-postoffice (PO-to-PO) delivery session.

TPL       This subdirectory contains the template files used by the    All
         local postoffice and gateways.

USR       This file is the address list of users and groups for a      All
         particular postoffice. The postoffice that this list
         represents is an externally defined postoffice. If this
         file exists, its prefix filename will match the external
         postoffice's .MBG filename. This file can be created or
         updated using the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE)
         or it can be created or replaced by the External Mail
         program when it receives an exported user list from this
         postoffice.

         The file size should be divisible by 53.

XTN       This subdirectory contains the external postoffice           All
         definition files. Each .XTN file contains all of the
         postoffices that are defined at an individual network.

         For each network that is defined in the NETWORK.GLB file,
         there is an associated .XTN file. This file is a series
         of records, where each record defines a different
         postoffice at this network. The purpose of this file is
         to provide routing, naming, and sign-on information for
         external services/postoffices. Postoffice records also
         contain connection information, statistics, and various
         configuration options for that postoffice. Each postoffice
         record contains a file pointer reference to its mailbag.
         When an address list of users is created for this
         postoffice, there will also be a .USR file and, possibly,
         .TPL and .INF files with the same file prefix as the .MBG
         file.

         The file size should be divisible by 698.
