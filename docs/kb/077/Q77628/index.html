SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, it is useful to understand how the External
Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) delivers mail between postoffices. This process
involves several files in the mail system database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample shown below shows a typical file transfer of a single piece of mail
from postoffice P: MICROSOFT/CORPORATE to Q: MICROSOFT/MAIL. External first
checks the postoffices for updates to user/group lists. These lists include all
the new user lists and definitions that are programmed into the postoffices
through the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE).

A user has composed a message on postoffice MICROSOFT/CORPORATE and has addressed
the message to a user on MICROSOFT/MAIL. The message is written into the
database for MICROSOFT/CORPORATE in the KEY, MBG, and MAI subdirectories. If an
attachment is included, a file is written to an ATT subdirectory.

External then checks for any outgoing mail by opening and closing every MBG and
KEY file on the postoffice. Flags within the files indicate if there is any mail
required to be sent.

In this example, one mail item is going to be sent from CORPORATE to MAIL. First,
External reads the KEY, MBG, and MAI file on P: MICROSOFT/CORPORATE. The
filename in the example is 00003D90.MAI.

The delivery by the External program is a two-part process called Dispatch and
Mailer. Dispatch is used to deliver the mail between the postoffices and Mailer
is used to process the mail and place messages into recipients' mailbags.

Dispatch
--------

External first reads the P2 file (00003D90.MAI) from the CORPORATE postoffice and
writes to the MAIL postoffice (Q:MAI\MAB\000003CB.MAI):

  [16:24] - Mail file: P:MAI\MA0\00003D90.MAI
  [16:24] - Sending P2...
  [16:24] - Target file: Q:MAI\MAB\000003CB.MAI

The dispatcher then writes to the P1 subdirectory the envelope of the mail
message. The envelope contains a list of all the people to whom the mail message
must be delivered. This includes the TO field and the CC field:

  [16:24] - Target file: Q:P1\000003CB.P1

External then writes to INQUEUE.KEY and INQUEUE.MBG the name of the file in the
P1 subdirectory that contains the recipients of the mail.

This concludes the delivery of the mail:

  [16:24] - FM_SEND, ok

Mailer
------

Mailer reads the INQUEUE files in the KEY and MBG subdirectories. The MBG queue
contains the reference pointer (P1 subdirectory filename). MAILER then reads the
references contained in the file in the P1 subdirectory and writes to each
recipient's KEY file and MBG file a pointer to the mail item contained in the
MAI subdirectory:

  [16:24] - inqueue opened
  [16:24] - Processing received mail queue on: Q: MICROSOFT/MAIL
  [16:24] - Inqueue file: Q:MAI\MAB\000003CB.MAI

Note: A mail item that is sent to numerous people will have a reference pointer
for each person who is to have the mail item but there will only be ONE .MAI
file.

Glossary
--------

  Term       Definition
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  ATT        Attachments subdirectory and attachments files.
             Referenced by a pointer within the message contents (MAI
             file).

  Contents   Contents of the message include the items such as the
             date, time, subject, priority, attachments, and the
             message itself. Another name for the MAI file. In visual
             terms this can equate to selecting a message from the
             Inbox and reading the contents.

  Envelope   See P1.

  MAI        See CONTENTS.

  MBG, KEY   Combined, these two files are used to provide a list of
             Inbox items that point to the mail message. This can
             equate to looking at the Inbox in the Mail program.

  P2         Another name for the MAI file. Otherwise known as the
             contents of the message. To equate, this would be the
             actual message that was composed.

  P1         An acronym for the addressing or the envelope of the
             message. The envelope contains all the TO and CC
             addresses the mail items are supposed to go to.
