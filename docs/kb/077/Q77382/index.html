SUMMARY
=======

  **************************************
  Microsoft Flight Simulator version 4.0
             Release Notes
  **************************************

Please note the following additions to Microsoft Flight Simulator for
the Macintosh version 4.0 and its documentation. You can print this
document for convenient reference.

Rebuild your desktop after installing Flight Simulator
------------------------------------------------------

It is recommended that you rebuild your desktop after you have
installed Flight Simulator on your machine by holding down the OPTION
and COMMAND keys while starting your Macintosh. Warning: If you
rebuild your desktop, you lose any Finder comments you previously
created, so record those comments for later re-entry if needed.

Application memory recommendations for using Flight Simulator
-------------------------------------------------------------

Flight Simulator contains many features and multiple windows to view
your flying experience. Each of these features and views require
memory to function, and if your system has a large monitor and/or
ability to display many colors, the memory demands on Flight Simulator
are high. If you are using Flight Simulator and begin to see alert
messages that say memory is low, it is recommended that you allocate
more memory for Flight Simulator by using the following steps:

1. Highlight the Microsoft Flight Simulator icon, and choose Get Info
  from the Finder's File menu. De-select the Lock check box to unlock
  the file.

2. Increase the Application Memory Size from 750K to 1024K, or 2048K
  if your system has the memory available. Close the Get Info window.

The general guideline is that Flight Simulator operates with fewer
constraints when memory has been increased, especially with systems
that have ability to display many colors (for example, 24- bit video
boards).

Using mouse replacement-type joysticks with Flight Simulator
------------------------------------------------------------

Flight Simulator's joystick control mode is designed to operate with
joysticks that plug into the ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) and have driver
programs associated with them (the Advanced Gravis joystick, for
example). The Joystick dialog box and controls control these sticks.
Some brands of joysticks are designed to be mouse replacements, and
are thus indistinguishable from a mouse to the Flight Simulator
program. These joysticks can be used quite nicely by choosing Mouse As
Yoke aircraft control mode from the Edit menu. Follow these guidelines
when using these types of joysticks:

1. Put the joystick into an absolute position mode. In this mode, the
  pointer should always come back to the same spot on the screen when
  you center the joystick.

2. Press COMMAND+M to enter Mouse As Yoke aircraft control mode. (The
  mouse *and* joystick now control the yoke.)

3. The best setup is to use the joystick for typical yoke control
  functions only (such as aileron and elevator). Use the mouse (with
  button down) for throttle and brakes. Pressing the joystick button and
  using it for throttle leaves the stick in an off-center position when
  you release the button and go back to elevators. It's best not to use
  the joystick throttle.

4. Make sensitivity adjustments from the Mouse dialog box, not the
  Joystick dialog box. Set Null Zone to full narrow (setting 1).
  Sensitivity for many joysticks (especially IBM PC-based sticks that
  have been converted for use with the Macintosh) should be set to
  maximum.

5. Choose the Control Panel from the Apple menu, and select the mouse
  icon for adjustment. Set tracking to TABLET mode (very slow). This
  helps center any "drift" problems.

6. The mouse (and thus the joystick) have different sensitivities at
  different airspeeds, so if you move the stick far left at one airspeed
  and center it at another airspeed, ailerons may not return to center.
  This is unnoticeable on a mouse, but quite noticeable on the joystick.
  The following steps can be used to keep your ailerons centered:

   a. Press 5 on the keypad.

   b. Make a trim adjustment on your joystick.

   c. Move the mouse to the left or right (this makes a good trim
      adjustment on joysticks without trim adjustments).

Using Flight Simulator with macro recorders
-------------------------------------------

If you use a macro recorder like AutoMac or QuickKeys, and want to use
it to record a flight session in Flight Simulator, avoid using Mouse
As Yoke mode for controlling the aircraft. When Flight Simulator uses
the mouse to control the aircraft, it hides the mouse pointer, which
can cause conflicts with macro recorders that depend on the position
of the pointer to operate properly. The airplane can still be
controlled by using the keyboard controls, as explained in the
Keyboard Summary of the User's Guide.

Using Flight Simulator with French or German keyboards
------------------------------------------------------

To operate the aircraft's flaps with keyboards that do not have
function keys, use the following keys to raise or lower the flaps:

                             French      German
                             ------      ------

Raise flaps:                    ^            \334

Lower flaps:                    $            #

The COMMAND+1, COMMAND+2, and COMMAND+3 keyboard assignments for
selecting either View1, View2, or Map View with the keyboard do not
function while using the French keyboard. French keyboard users must
use the mouse to select the active window by either clicking the
window, or choosing the window's name from the Window menu.

The Microsoft Flight Simulator team hopes you enjoy this version of
Flight Simulator, and that you find it is worth the wait!
