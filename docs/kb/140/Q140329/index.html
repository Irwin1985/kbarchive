-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Backup Domain Controllers do not list all trusted domains during
logon when there are more than twenty trust relationships.

Trusted domain users from domains that do not show up in the Backup Domain
Controller's list of domains during logon receive access denied errors when
attempting to use resources on the Backup Domain Controller.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the full list of trusted domains is not replicated to Backup
Domain Controllers. Since the Backup Domain Controllers do not have a complete
list of trusted domains, they do not setup a secure channel with Domain
Controllers that exist in Domain accounts that did not replicate. This results
in access denied errors on clients from trusted domains because there is no way
for pass-through validation to occur.

The complete list of trusted domains does not replicate to Backup Domain
Controllers because Netlogon does not indicate all the trusted domain accounts
to replicate. Replication fails when Netlogon calls the LSA to get the complete
list of domain accounts to replicate during a synchronization. Netlogon fails
because it replicates domain names when it receives STATUS_SUCCESS back from the
LSA, however with a large number of trusted domain names the LSA may return
STATUS_MORE_ENTRIES instead of STATUS_SUCCESS. The LSA returns
STATUS_MORE_ENTRIES if the default buffer supplied by Netlogon (1k in size) is
too small to hold the complete list of domain names. As a result, if there are
too many domains to fit in the 1k buffer, Netlogon ignores all but the last
group of domain names returned by the LSA when STATUS_SUCCESS is received.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
