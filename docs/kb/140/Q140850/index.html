SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to properly implement an exported function from an
MFC Regular DLL that uses the MFC Shared Library by converting the DLLTRACE
sample to use the shared version of the MFC DLL. The article also discusses some
of the general problems that result in any Regular DLL that does not switch the
module state appropriately.

The Visual C++ 4.0 sample DLLTRACE demonstrates how to create a Regular DLL with
an exported function that can be called to pop up a modal dialog box. By
default, this sample is set to statically link MFC to the DLL. In earlier
versions of Visual C++, this was the only option available for Regular DLLs.
These kinds of DLLs were formerly known as _USRDLLs.

Now, it is possible for a Regular DLL to use MFC from the shared MFC40 DLL.
Because there are certain benefits for doing this, you may want to convert the
DLLTRACE sample to use the shared MFC DLL. However, it is necessary to use the
macro AFX_MANAGE_STATE in order to switch the proper global MFC module state
correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Size is the major advantage for converting a statically-linked Regular DLL to a
Regular DLL that uses the MFC Shared Library. Converting the Trace.dll from the
DLLTRACE sample to use the Shared Library will drop the size of a release-build
DLL from around 95K down to about 12K. The difference between debug builds is
even more staggering: a debug build Trace.dll drops from nearly a megabyte in
size down to 25K when using MFC in the Shared Library.

Steps to Convert DLLTRACE to Use MFC in a Shared Library
--------------------------------------------------------

1. In the Build Settings property sheet, select both the release and debug
  builds to change settings for.

  Visual C++ .NET:
  On the Properties dialog for the project, from the Configuration combo box,
  select All Configurations.

2. In the General tab, in the Microsoft Foundation Classes combo box, change the
  option to "Use MFC in a Shared DLL (mfc(d).dll)".

  Visual C++ .NET:
  On the General tab, change Use of MFC option to Use MFC in a Shared DLL.

3. Add the following line of code to the beginning of every function exported
  from the DLL:

  AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState())

The AfxGetStaticModuleState() MFC Function
------------------------------------------

The code in step 3 uses an MFC-provided macro (AFX_MANAGE_STATE) to swap the
current module state with the state returned from AfxGetStaticModuleState()
until the end of the current scope. The AfxGetStaticModuleState() function is a
special MFC function in Regular DLLs that returns the module state of the
Regular DLL in the context of the DLL. For example, Trace.dll exports only three
functions:

  PromptTraceFlags()
  ProcessDLLIdle()
  FilterDLLMsg()

Here is what FilterDLLMsg() should look like in the converted form:

  extern "C" BOOL FAR PASCAL EXPORT FilterDllMsg(LPMSG lpMsg)
     {

        AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState())
        TRY
        {
            return AfxGetApp()-&gt;PreTranslateMessage(lpMsg);
        }
        END_TRY
        return FALSE;

     }

After making these changes, rebuild the DLLTRACE project. The application will
use the new DLL and work just as it did before.

Problems Occur If the AFX_MANAGE_STATE Macro Is Not Used
--------------------------------------------------------

Certain problems occur if the AFX_MANAGE_STATE macro is not used. In discussing
these problems, this article may shed some light on problems that crop up when
attempting to convert the old-style _USRDLLs to use the DLL version of MFC.

If the PromptTraceFlags function does not use the AFX_MANAGE_STATE macro at the
very beginning of execution, an assertion will fail at line 43 in Dlgdata.cpp
and the following message will appear in the output window:

  Error: no data exchange control with ID xx.

The primary cause of this problem is that MFC is using the resource handle of the
main application to load the dialog box template for the Prompt Dialog. This
template is actually stored in the Trace DLL. The root cause, of course, is that
MFC's module state information has not been switched by the AFX_MANAGE_STATE
macro. The resource handle is recovered from MFC's module state; not switching
the module state causes the wrong resource handle to be used.

If the AFX_MANAGE_STATE macro is omitted from the beginning of either the
FilterDLLMsg or ProcessDLLIdle function, a different problem occurs. In this
case, immediately after executing the DLLTRACE application it takes a momentary
siesta and then quits with an error message similar to this one:

  Unhandled exception in dlltrace.exe (MFC40D.DLL):
  0xC00000FD: Stack Overflow

The primary culprit here is the AfxGetApp() function, which is used to call
either PreTranslateMessage() in the case of FilterDLLMsg() or OnIdle() in the
case of ProcessDLLIdle(). Once again, the root evil is the failure to switch the
module state, which maintains the pointer to the current CWinApp object that is
returned from AfxGetApp().

In each of these situations, when the module state is not switched, AfxGetApp()
returns a pointer to the CTheApp object of the application, not the CTracerDLL
object of the DLL, as it rightfully should. When FilterDLLMsg() goes to call
AfxGetApp()-&gt;PreTranslateMessage(), it calls CTheApp::PreTranslateMessage().
However, FilterDllMsg() was called by CTheApp::PreTranslateMessage(); so, once
again, FilterDLLMsg() is called, which in turn calls
CTheApp::PreTranslateMessage(), creating an infinite recursion. ProcessDLLIdle()
is invoked in a similar way.

To avoid this recursive state, AFX_MANAGE_STATE is used and AfxGetApp() returns a
pointer to the CTracerDLL object in the DLL. Because CTracerDLL has no override
of PreTranslateMessage() or OnIdle(), the default MFC versions are called--not
the CTheApp overrides. Consequently, there is no infinite recursion.

Final Question
--------------

Why doesn't AFX_MANAGE_STATE need to be put on every function in the DLL?
CTracerDLL::InitInstance() is called by the MFC code in the application, why
doesn't it need to have AFX_MANAGE_STATE?

The answer is that MFC does it for you. MFC manually shifts the module state
before InitInstance() and then switches it back after InitInstance() returns.
The same is true for all message map handlers. Regular DLLs actually have a
special master window procedure that automatically switches the module state
before routing any message.
