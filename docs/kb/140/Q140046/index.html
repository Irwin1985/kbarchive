The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

If a virus is present in the master boot record, the following message appears
after selecting the partition to install Windows NT to during setup:

  The hard disk containing the partition or free space you chose is not
  accessible to your computer's startup program. Setup cannot install Windows
  NT on this hard disk.

On x86-based computers, this message may indicate a problem with the computer's
CMOS hard disk type settings. Consult your computer or hard disk controller
documentation for more information.

NOTE: This message does not necessarily indicate an error condition. The hard
disks typically accessible to a computer's startup program are those whose
installation in your computer were anticipated by the computer manufacturer.

For example, disks attached to a SCSI adapter not installed by your computer
manufacturer, or to a secondary hard disk controller, are typically not visible
to the startup program unless special software is added to your computer.
Contact your computer or hard disk controller manufacturer for more information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The message is referencing a translation/configuration problem between Windows
NT and the hard disk you are trying to install Windows NT to. A computer virus
that is part of the Master Boot Record of a hard drive can also cause the same
message to appear during setup. (If the problem is caused by the NYB virus, you
can remove the virus with the lastest version of McAfee's antivirus program.)

If the message appears during setup right after you have selected the partition
to install Windows NT to you need to do the following:

1. Use a well known virus application such as McAfee SCAN.EXE and verify the
  entire drive. Not all Master Boot Record viruses can be eliminated with a
  FDISK /MBR. Drives without a partition still have Master Boot Records and
  have to be checked also.

2. Ensure that the BIOS drive type for IDE and EIDE drives are correct. You may
  need to change the CMOS drive type from AUTO to the manufacture
  specifications.

3. Verify adapter and drive options for SCSI devices to include termination and
  SCSI cables.

4. If all hardware has been verified for configuration you may need to run a
  hardware diagnostics on the system to verify that the hard disk controller
  and hard drive are functioning properly.
