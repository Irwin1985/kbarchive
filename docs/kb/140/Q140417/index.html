SUMMARY
=======

Creating user profiles is accomplished with the User Profile Editor (creates the
profile) and User Manager for Domains (assigns existing profiles to users). For
additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q128624
  TITLE : How to Create and Assign User Profiles for Users in a Domain

A profile created by using the Profile Editor is stored on the server and
controls the user's desktop configuration at the workstation. There are two
types of server-based profiles available:

- Mandatory profiles which use the *.MAN file extension.

- Personal profiles which use the *.USR file extension.

To control the program groups that users see when they log into a server, you
have two choices:

The first option is to use Mandatory profiles for the user if security and tight
control are priorities. The user is able to change the settings while logged in,
but the profile reverts back to the settings in the mandatory profile. The
program groups are those outlined in the program settings section. The common
program groups that are seen are from the local computer and not the server.

The second option is to use a Personal Profile. You can customize the profile per
individual user, but unless you select the Disable Save Settings Menu Item and
Never Save Settings, the user is able to change the program group settings.
Again, the show common program groups will show the local machines common group
and not the server common group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using Profile Editor, the following settings are available on the menu:

- Disable Run in File Menu.

  This option disables the user from running the File Run command in program
  manager.

- Disable Save Settings Menu Item and Never Save Settings.

  Allows you to restrict the user from changing the program group settings by
  graying out these options in Program Manager under the Options menu.

- Show Common Program Groups.

  Allows you to show the common program groups from the local machine accounts
  database as opposed to the common program groups from the server, regardless
  of whether it is a mandatory profile or personal profile.

If you create the profile (mandatory or personal) as outlined in Q128624 and
select the Show Common Program Groups, you will see the Common Program Groups
that reside on the Local Machine.

If you deselect the Show Common Program Groups you will only see the program
groups created from the Profile Editor for that profile in the program settings
section.
