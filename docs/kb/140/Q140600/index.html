SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to set up your Microsoft Windows 95-based computer to
run Microsoft Flight Simulator version 5.1 most efficiently, and it is divided
into two parts:

1. Optimizing Your Windows 95 Configuration for Flight Simulator

  Running Microsoft Flight Simulator version 5.1 in Windows 95 sometimes
  requires a specific system configuration. This Application Note gives steps
  to optimally configure your computer to run Flight Simulator with Windows 95.
  See the section "Part 1: Optimizing Your Windows 95 Configuration for Flight
  Simulator" in this Application Note.

2. Configuring Flight Simulator to Run in MS-DOS Mode

  Microsoft Flight Simulator is an MS-DOS-based program. Although it runs in
  Windows 95 protected mode, sometimes the program runs better in MS-DOS mode.
  For information about running Flight Simulator in Windows 95 MS-DOS mode, see
  the section "Part 2: Configuring Flight Simulator to Run in MS-DOS Mode" in
  this Application Note.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PART 1: OPTIMIZING YOUR WINDOWS 95 CONFIGURATION FOR FLIGHT SIMULATOR
---------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This is a general guide for optimizing your system under Windows. Not all
steps work for all machines. If your machine stops responding (hangs) when you
restart your system (reboot), use the steps in the "Restarting a Non-Responding
Computer" section in this Application Note.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following and click OK:

  sysedit

3. The System Configuration Editor starts. You should be able to view
  configuration files such as Autoexec.bat, Config.sys, System.ini, and
  Win.ini.

4. The first file is usually the Autoexec.bat file. Type "rem" (without the
  quotation marks) in front of every line. For example, if the line reads
  C:\Mouse\Mouse, change the line to read:

  rem c:\mouse\mouse

  Repeat this step for each line in the Autoexec.bat file. When you are
  finished, click Save on the File menu.

5. Directly behind the Autoexec.bat file is the Config.sys file. Repeat step 4
  for Config.sys. Don't forget to save your work.

6. After completing steps 4 and 5, switch to the Win.ini file. If you do not see
  it, locate it on the Window menu in System Configuration Editor.

  a. On the Window menu, click Win.ini.

  b. In Win.ini, look for the following lines:

  Run=
  Load=

  c. If these lines contain entries, type a semicolon (;) in front of the line.
     For example, if the Load= line looks like

  Load=Pointer.exe

     change it to look like:

  ;Load=Pointer.exe

  d. Save your changes.

7. Exit the System Configuration Editor.

8. Exit Windows 95, and restart your computer.

9. When Windows 95 restarts, test your system. Check the following:

   - Does sound work?
   - Does the mouse work?
   - Does the CD-ROM drive work?

  Note any features that do not work.

10. Click Start, point to Programs, and click MS-DOS Prompt. Change to the
  Flight Simulator folder and start Flight Simulator.

  If part of your system is not functioning, do the following:

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click Add/Remove Hardware. This starts the Add New Hardware Wizard.
     Click Next.

  c. When you are asked if you want Windows to search for your new hardware,
     click Yes. Click Next.

  If no new hardware is detected, follow steps 1, 2, and 3 again. This time,
  remove REM from the lines that contain the driver for the piece of hardware
  that does not work. For example, if your Sound Card is not working, remove
  REM from any line that refers to a sound device. Don't forget to save your
  work.

11. Restart your system, and start again at step 9. Do this until your computer
  is working correctly.

RESTARTING A NON-RESPONDING COMPUTER
------------------------------------

1. Restart your computer.

2. When you see "Starting Windows 95" on your screen, press the F8 key.

3. Click Safe Mode, which starts Windows 95 in a very basic configuration.

4. Run Sysedit again, and remove the very last change you made in your
  configuration.

CREATING A FLIGHT SIMULATOR SHORTCUT IN WINDOWS 95
--------------------------------------------------

1. Double-click My Computer and open the Fltsim5 folder.

2. With your right mouse button, click the Fs.bat file, and then click Create
  Shortcut.

  NOTE: A file called Shortcut to Fs is created.

3. With your right mouse button, click the new file, and then click Properties
  from the drop-down list.

4. Click the Program tab.

5. Make sure Close On Exit is selected.

6. Click Advanced.

  NOTE: Make sure the Prevent MS-DOS-Based Programs From Detecting Windows
  option is selected.

7. Click OK, and OK again.

8. Double-click the shortcut to run Flight Simulator.

OPTIONAL SHORTCUT MODIFICATIONS
-------------------------------

After the shortcut has been set up using the instructions above, you can rename
the shortcut as follows:

1. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, click the Shortcut to Fs file once. You
  do not need to open it.

2. On the File menu, click Rename.

3. Type the new name and then press ENTER. For example, type "Flight Simulator"
  (without the quotation marks).

You may want to move the shortcut to a more convenient location, such as the
Start menu. To move the icon to the Start menu, drag the icon over and on top of
the Start button, release the mouse.

For additional Start menu customization steps, do the following:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Taskbar.

2. Click the Start Menu Programs tab. Make additional changes here.

PART 2: CONFIGURING FLIGHT SIMULATOR TO RUN IN MS-DOS MODE
----------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Flight Simulator is an MS-DOS-based program. Although it runs in
Windows 95 protected mode, sometimes the program runs better in MS-DOS mode.

NOTE: Not all of these steps work for all machines. Some steps may need to be
tailored for your individual computer. If your machine stops responding (hangs)
when you restart (reboot) your system, use the steps in the "Restarting a
Non-Responding Computer" section in this later in this article.

HOW TO CREATE AN MS-DOS MODE SHORTCUT
-------------------------------------

Creating an MS-DOS-mode shortcut is like making a startup disk, without the disk.
The shortcut allows you to make a special configuration for any MS-DOS program.
There are no limitations to the number of shortcuts you can have.

1. In Windows Explorer, open the folder that contains Flight Simulator, usually
  Fltsim5.

2. With your right mouse button, click Fs5.com, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Program tab, and then click Advanced.

4. You should be at the Fs5.com Advanced Properties screen. Make sure the MS-DOS
  Mode option is selected.

5. Notice there are two options available:

   - Use Current Option

  -and-

   - Specify New Option

  Select the Use Current Option if:

  a. The existing Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files are sufficient to run
     Flight Simulator in MS-DOS.

  -or-

  b. Flight Simulator runs in protected mode, but runs slower than usual.

  -or-

  c. Flight Simulator does not start in Windows 95, but there are no error
     messages to indicate a specific reason.

  Select the Specify New Option if:

  a. Your computer configuration allows you to run Windows 95 without any
     entries in the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files.

  -or-

  b. The entries in the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files do not contain a
     Memory Manager.

  -or-

  c. The Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files do not contain a required mouse,
     sound, or CD-ROM driver.

  -or-

  d. Your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files do not meet the minimum
     requirements to run a program in MS-DOS.

SELECTING USE CURRENT
---------------------

If you select Use Current, click OK, and then click OK again to return to Windows
Explorer. Test Flight Simulator by double-clicking Fs5.com.

Windows 95 should quit, the computer should restart in MS-DOS mode, and Flight
Simulator should start. When you end your Flight Simulator session, MS-DOS mode
ends, and your computer restarts with Windows 95.

SELECTING SPECIFY NEW
---------------------

If you select Specify New, or if the Use Current option did not work, you need to
further configure your MS-DOS mode shortcut.

The Specify New option has two additional boxes:

- Config.sys for MS-DOS Mode
- Autoexec.bat for MS-DOS Mode

You need to create a suitable Config.sys and Autoexec.bat file for Flight
Simulator.

CREATING A CONFIG.SYS AND AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE FOR MS-DOS MODE
-----------------------------------------------------------

Use one of the methods below to create your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files.
Note that these methods assume Windows 95 is installed in the Windows folder on
drive C. If you have installed Windows to a different folder or directory,
replace the drive and folder names below with the appropriate folder and drive
names.

Method 1
--------

The Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files can be disabled by typing "rem" (without
the quotation marks) in front of each line in the files. This method allows
Windows 95 protected mode drivers to load. If you used this technique to
optimize Windows 95, then use Method 1.

1. Leave the Fs5.com Advanced Properties window open.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. Type the following and click OK:

  sysedit

  The Autoexec.bat file with all the REM lines appears.

4. On the Edit menu in System Configuration Editor, click Select All.

5. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

6. You can now minimize the System Configuration editor by clicking the Minimize
  button (-) in the upper-right corner of the Window. The Editor should appear
  as a taskbar button.

7. At the Advanced Program Settings window, click the Autoexec.bat For MS-DOS
  box. Then, with your right mouse button, click the box again, and click
  Paste. You should now see the entire Autoexec.bat file, complete with the REM
  codes.

8. Repeat step 7 for the Config.sys file. Make sure you use the Config.sys For
  MS-DOS Mode box.

  Remove the REM codes from the lines that Flight Simulator needs to run. The
  minimum requirements for the program are:

  Config.sys for Flight Simulator

     Device = C:\Windows\Himem.sys
     Device = C:\Windows\EMM386.exe RAM
     files=30
     buffers=30
     dos=high,UMB
     devicehigh=C:\&lt;directory of CD-ROM driver&gt; \CDROM
     driver...../d:&lt;drive name&gt;
            (should say something like NEC_sys or Sanyo_IDE)

  If you are running Stacker, DriveSpace(TM), or DoubleSpace, you should also
  include the following line in the Config.sys file:

     devicehigh=&lt;compression device&gt;

  For example, if you are running DriveSpace, use the following:

     devicehigh=c:\Windows\drvspace.sys /move

  If you are running DoubleSpace, use the following:

     devicehigh=c:\Windows\Dblspace.sys /move

  Autoexec.bat for Flight Simulator

     LH C:\Mouse\Mouse    (or whatever your mouse line is)
     LH C:\Windows\Command\Mscdex.exe /D:&lt;drive name should match the
     drive designation in the config.sys&gt;
     Set Blaster  xx xx xx  (or any applicable sound device line;
     there may be as many as 3)

  Click OK, and then click OK to close Fs5.com Properties.

9. Test Flight Simulator by double-clicking Fs5.com. Windows 95 should end and
  the computer restarts automatically in MS-DOS mode using the Config.sys and
  Autoexec.bat files you specified. Flight Simulator should start.

  When you end your Flight Simulator session, MS-DOS mode ends, and your
  computer restarts in Windows 95.

Method 2
--------

The Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files must contain all the drivers required to
run the hardware on your computer. Any copy of Autoexec.bat and Config.sys that
worked on your machine previously is acceptable. When Windows 95 was installed,
the setup program took the original Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files and
renamed them as Autoexec.dos and Config.dos. These files are acceptable to use
in this situation.

1. Leave the Fs5.com Advanced Program Settings window open.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Notepad.

3. On the File menu in Notepad, click Open.

4. Select the drive C root directory, click Autoexec.dos, and click Open, where
  drive C is where you installed Windows 95.

5. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

6. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

7. Minimize Notepad and return to the Fs5.com Advanced Properties dialog box.
  Click your mouse once in the Autoexec.bat box.

8. With your right mouse button, click the box again, and then click Paste.

9. Return to Notepad and repeat steps 4-8 for the Config.dos file.

10. Close Notepad and return to the Fs5.com Advanced Properties dialog box.

11. Remove any line not required for Flight Simulator to run. The minimum
  requirements are:

  Config.sys for Flight Simulator

     Device = C:\Windows\Himem.sys
     Device =C:\Windows\EMM386.exe RAM
     files=30
     buffers=30
     dos=high,UMB
     devicehigh=C:\&lt;directory of CD ROM driver&gt; \CDROM
     driver...../d:&lt;drive name&gt;
         (should say something like NEC_sys or Sanyo_IDE)

  If you are running Stacker, DriveSpace, or DoubleSpace, you should also
  include the following line in the Config.sys file:

     devicehigh=&lt;compression device&gt;

  For example, if you are running DriveSpace, use the following:

     devicehigh=c:\Windows\Drvspace.sys /move

  If you are running DoubleSpace, use the following:

     devicehigh=c:\Windows\Dblspace.sys /move

  Autoexec.bat for Flight Simulator

     LH C:\Mouse\Mouse    (or what ever your mouse line is)
     LH C:\Windows\Command\Mscdex.exe /D:&lt;drive name should match the
     drive designation in the config.sys&gt;
     Set Blaster  xx xx xx  (or any applicable sound device line.
     There may be as many as 3)

12. Click Apply, and then click OK to return to the original screen.

13. Test Flight Simulator by double-clicking Fs5.com in Explorer.

Windows 95 should quit and the computer should restart in MS-DOS mode using the
Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files you just specified. Flight Simulator should
start. When you end your Flight Simulator session, MS- DOS ends and your
computer restarts with Windows 95.
