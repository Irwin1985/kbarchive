SYMPTOMS
========

If you add a new keyboard layout while user profiles are enabled, and then
choose the "Close all programs and log on as a different user" option in the
Shut Down Windows dialog box, the keyboard may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

User.exe creates a window/queue for the login box so early that the system does
not realize it is using an unusable language. The language is unusable because
the other language files have not been loaded yet.

correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
