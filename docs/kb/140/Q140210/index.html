SUMMARY
=======

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

1. Q. What is the Microsoft Jet database engine?

  A. The Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0 is the new database engine
  that ships with Microsoft Access for Windows 95 version 7.0, Microsoft Visual
  Basic 4.0, Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, and the upcoming version of
  Microsoft Visual C++. It cannot be purchased as a stand-alone product.

2. Q. What is a database engine?

  A. Database management systems (DBMS) are programs used to store and retrieve
  data. A DBMS program has a number of important components. The user interface
  is the component that handles interaction between the user and the program.
  It also controls the way a user views data through forms and reports. The
  database engine is the component that actually handles the data. The user
  typically does not interact directly with the database engine.

3. Q. So why should I care which database engine my products use?

  A. Think of the database engine as the engine in your car. You don't see the
  engine while you're driving. You manipulate the user interface: the steering
  wheel, the pedals, and the other dashboard gadgets. Even though you don't
  deal directly with the engine, you'll appreciate the difference in engines
  when a high performance car roars past you.

  The speed, performance, and reliability of a DBMS (or lack thereof) come from
  the engine. The Jet database engine is an advanced database engine that
  combines speed and performance with many other advanced features not found in
  competing desktop DBMS products. The Microsoft Jet database engine is also a
  reliable engine that offers certain transaction processing capabilities; for
  example, it can wrap bulk operations into transactions and even nest those
  transactions.

4. Q. How does the Jet database engine store my data?

  A. The Jet database engine stores data in a Microsoft Access database (.mdb)
  file. All tables and indexes are stored in this file, as are any forms,
  reports, macros, and modules used by Microsoft Access. According to user
  feedback, having everything in one file makes it easy to manage data and
  applications.

5. Q. Can the Jet database engine read and write data in other formats?

  A. Yes, the Jet database engine supports dBASE, Paradox, and the Microsoft
  FoxPro database file formats as well as many popular spreadsheet and text
  formats. In addition, the Jet database engine can use open database
  connectivity (ODBC) to connect to external client/server database sources
  that have ODBC drivers. The ODBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server ships with
  the Jet database engine, and other drivers are readily available for
  databases from Sybase, Oracle, and other vendors.

6. Q. How do I use the Jet database engine in my applications?

  A. The Jet database engine itself ships with Microsoft Access, Microsoft
  Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++, and Microsoft Excel. However these are
  not the only applications that can access the Jet database engine features.
  The following scenarios show how a user or developer can tap into the Jet
  database engine features:

   - The Microsoft Access user interface calls upon the Jet database engine to
     provide data retrieval and other services because all objects created in
     Microsoft Access are stored in the Jet database engine's native .mdb file.

   - Any program that is an OLE Automation controller, such as Microsoft
     Project, can access the Jet database engine programmatically because the
     Jet database engine's objects are fully exposed through DAO.

   - Any program that ships with the Microsoft Jet database engine, such as
     Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Visual C++, or Microsoft Excel, can
     control the Jet database engine programmatically.

  Microsoft is working to implement a standard development environment called
  Visual Basic for Applications across the entire Microsoft Office suite.
  Visual Basic for Applications is shipped as part of Microsoft Access for
  Windows 95, Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, and Microsoft Project for Windows
  95. In the future, it will be incorporated into Microsoft Word and Microsoft
  PowerPoint. Using Visual Basic for Applications, a developer can directly
  manipulate all of the Jet database engine's objects to read and write data
  stored in the Jet database engine tables, perform queries, or manage the Jet
  database engine's security features. This means, for example, that a
  Microsoft Excel developer can tap into the full power of the Jet database
  engine without having to go through Microsoft Access.

7. Q. Why is the Microsoft Jet database engine better than other database
  engines?

  A. Besides the basic features that users have come to expect from any database
  engine, the Microsoft Jet database engine adds advanced capabilities that
  were previously unavailable on desktop databases. These include:

   - Access to heterogeneous data sources. The Jet database engine provides
     transparent access, through industry-standard ODBC drivers, to over 170
     different data formats, including dBASE, Paradox, ORACLE, Microsoft SQL
     Server, and IBM DB2. Developers can build applications in which users read
     and update data simultaneously in virtually any data format and can
     replace a back-end data store with minimal programming should application
     requirements change.

   - Engine-level referential integrity and data validation. The Jet database
     engine has built-in support for primary and foreign keys,
     database-specific rules, and cascading updates and deletes. This means
     that a developer is freed from having to create rules using procedural
     code to implement data integrity. Also, these rules are consistently
     enforced by the Jet database engine itself, so that they are available to
     all application programs.

   - Advanced workgroup security features. The Jet database engine stores User
     and Group accounts in a separate database, typically located on the
     network. Object permissions for database objects (such as tables and
     queries) are stored in each database. By separating account information
     from permission information, the Jet database engine makes it much easier
     for system administrators to manage one set of accounts for all databases
     on a network.

   - Updateable recordsets. As opposed to most database engines which return
     query results in temporary views or snapshots, the Jet database engine
     returns a recordset that automatically propagates any changes users make
     back to the original tables. This means that the results of a query, even
     those based on multiple tables, can be treated as tables themselves. Users
     can even base queries on other queries.

   - Query optimization using Rushmore technology. The Jet database engine has
     incorporated this innovative technology from Microsoft FoxPro to enhance
     query performance.

   - Multiuser features. The Jet database engine supports multiple users in all
     products. You don't have to do anything to enable multiuser access. The
     Jet database engine supports both optimistic and pessimistic locking. It
     also supports transaction processing, with implicit transactions as a new
     feature in the Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0.

8. Q. What's new in version 3.0 of the Jet database engine?

  A. The Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0 is a 32-bit, multithreaded
  program. Microsoft's primary goal in developing this latest version was to
  boost the Jet database engine's performance and improve its multiuser
  capabilities. This means that most changes to the Jet database engine have
  been made behind the scenes. However, some new, important features for
  developers are worth noting:

   - Replication support (explained below)

   - Enhancements to DAO including new properties and methods to support
     replication and a new Errors collection. Also, new extensions have been
     added to existing functionality, such as the GetRows method (which
     retrieves multiple rows into an array), the PercentPosition property
     (which returns the approximate location of the current record), and the
     AllPermissions property (which returns all permissions on an object).

9. Q. What is replication and how does the Jet database engine support it?

  A. Data replication is the ability of a system to automatically synchronize
  copies of its data between local and remote connections. Replication is often
  used to improve data availability.

  Microsoft Access and Microsoft Visual Basic ship with new DLLs that implement
  replication. The Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0 introduces new DAO
  methods and properties to support this functionality. Once those DLLs have
  been installed on a system, replication is fully programmable through DAO.
  This means that other applications, including Microsoft Excel and Microsoft
  Visual C++, can benefit from this technology. In addition, the Microsoft
  Access Developer's Toolkit contains the Microsoft Access Replication Manager,
  which supplies enhancements to the basic functionality, including a graphical
  user interface for administering and scheduling replication services.

10. Q. How many users can the Jet database engine support?

  A. Theoretically, the Jet database engine can support 255 simultaneous
  connections to one database. The practical limit to the number of users it
  can handle in multiuser applications depends on many factors. Applications
  whose primary task is to perform queries can handle more users than
  applications whose primary task is to update data. The network and file
  server also play an important role in calculating this limit. In a properly
  configured network setting, the Jet database engine can easily support 25-50
  users in a transaction-oriented environment. Some multiuser applications
  function well with 80 users.

  If your application grows out of the Jet database engine's range, you can
  upsize the data portion of your application to Microsoft SQL Server while
  maintaining your investment in the Microsoft Access front end. The Microsoft
  Access Upsizing Tools, available separately, make it easy for you to migrate
  your data.

11. Q. How do I distribute my applications that use the Jet database engine?

  A. If your users already have Microsoft Office installed, then they already
  have the Jet database engine DLLs installed. Installing Microsoft Office is
  the easiest way to distribute the Jet database engine to your users.

  If your application is written in Microsoft Access and your users have not
  installed Microsoft Office, you need the Microsoft Access Developer's
  Toolkit (ADT). The ADT contains an application Setup Wizard and allows you
  to distribute run-time versions of your application.

  Microsoft Visual Basic and Microsoft Visual C++ users already have the
  ability to compile distributable applications.

  Microsoft Excel solutions require that the users have copies of Microsoft
  Excel, which they already have if they have installed Microsoft Office.

12. Q. Does the Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0 support record
  locking?

  A. The Microsoft Jet database engine version 3.0 continues to use page
  locking because of its performance advantage in most scenarios. However,
  many of the locking conflicts present in earlier versions of the Jet
  database engine have been eliminated in version 3.0. Developers can choose
  between optimistic and pessimistic locking.

13. Q. Has performance in multiuser environments improved?

  A. Yes, version 3.0 of the Jet database engine has improved its locking
  during multiuser sessions. Here are the most important improvements:

   - Fewer read locks on index pages. This removes many locking conflict issues
     and removes the need for applications to call DBEngine.Idle DBFreeLocks.

   - New mechanism for page reuse. The Microsoft Jet database engine version
     3.0 no longer recycles pages until the last user closes the database. This
     reduces concurrency conflicts and processing time.

   - New mechanism for page allocation. In previous versions of the Jet
     database engine, pages from different tables were often mixed together on
     disk. In version 3.0, pages are typically allocated so that pages from the
     same table are more contiguous. This scenario greatly enhances the Jet
     database engine's read- ahead capabilities, and improves many search and
     select operations.

   - Faster delete operations. In version 2.x, pages were doubly linked,
     causing a delete operation to visit every page when all rows were being
     deleted. If there is no predicate attached to the delete statement and no
     foreign keys referencing the table, this operation can now take advantage
     of new storage techniques and remove the table almost instantaneously.

   - Improved multi-user performance. In version 2.0, multiple insert
     operations frequently blocked other users. Version 3.0 incorporates new
     locking algorithms that can significantly reduce these conflicts.
