The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up and use ISDN (Integrated Services Digital
Network) terminal adapters in Windows 95.

Currently, Windows 95 supports only the following ISDN adapters:

- Motorola BitSURFR (needs version 1E EPROM)

- Motorola TA210 (needs version 1E EPROM)

- Motorola TA110-120

Microsoft supports the detection of these adapters, but does not support setting
them up. In order to properly set up an ISDN adapter, you need to obtain
information from the adapter's manufacturer and your ISDN provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Detection and Setup of ISDN Terminal Adapters
---------------------------------------------

1. Install the adapter using the Windows 95 Modem .inf file. Automatic detection
  of the adapter or Plug and Play detection typically provides this using
  native .inf files. Use the Modems tool in Control Panel, or if the adapter is
  a Plug and Play device, shut down and restart the computer. A new ISDN
  adapter should include a disk with a Windows 95 .inf file that should be
  installed following the manufacturer's instructions.

2. Configure the adapter using an ISDN setup tool. Adjust values and settings to
  prepare the adapter for ISDN use. Typically, the adapter's S registers are
  adjusted during this step. (S registers are memory storage locations within
  the adapter that are used to store information about the adapter's operating
  parameters.)

  These values are typically provided by the local phone company when ISDN
  service is provided. Other values for the adapter are derived from
  documentation accompanying the adapter.

  Some ISDN adapter vendors provide MS-DOS-based or Windows-based ISDN adapter
  configuration tools. These tools should run with Windows 95 and should be
  used to configure the adapter.

Setting S Registers
-------------------

Setting Specific Profile ID (SPID) and other ISDN values typically involves
adjusting S registers. You can use HyperTerminal for this purpose. Follow these
steps:

1. Install the adapter.

2. Check the Modems tool in Control Panel. The ISDN adapter should be listed.

3. Start HyperTerminal. You may need to configure HyperTerminal with a telephone
  number.

4. On the File menu, click Properties.

5. In the Connect Using box, click Direct To Com&lt;X&gt;, where &lt;X&gt; is
  the number of the port the ISDN adapter is using. Click OK.

6. Use Hayes-style AT commands to set the adapter's S registers. For example, to
  set register 10 to a value of 30, type the following line:

  " ats10=30 " (without the quotation marks)

7. When you finish setting up the adapter, select the ISDN adapter, rather than
  Direct To Com&lt;X&gt;, in the Connect Using box.

Dual Capability Adapters
------------------------

A few ISDN adapters have both analog line capability and ISDN features.
Typically, you can use AT commands with these adapters in either analog or ISDN
mode. The functionality of these adapters is dependent on the .inf file included
by the adapter's manufacturer. The .inf file may allow you to select either the
adapter's analog or its ISDN capabilities, or it may support a default ISDN
configuration only.

Dual-Channel ISDN
-----------------

Many ISDN adapters and local phone companies provide ISDN service that provides
two channels at the same time (a data channel and a voice channel). Both
channels can be operational during the same connection. Note that the voice
channel on some ISDN devices can also be converted to a data channel, boosting
data transfer capability. Manufacturer's documents and local phone company
instructions should be consulted to use this dual-channel feature.


Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade
------------------------------

Microsoft has released the Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade. This release includes
the support necessary for making remote access connections over an ISDN line.
