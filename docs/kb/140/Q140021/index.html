SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic version 4.0 for Windows ships with a full-featured grid that allows
in-place editing of items in a table. This grid, the Data Bound Grid (DBGRID),
was designed to be used to edit and display records in a database table. This
article includes a document that was written by Apex Software Corporation, the
designers of the control, that discusses how to use this control in an unbound
mode.

The Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q113902 also contains the text of the
document.

Introduction to True DBGrid Unbound Mode:

When used in "Unbound Mode" (DataMode property set to 1), the grid is not
connected to a database file. Instead, data in the grid must be supplied and
maintained by you, the programmer, while the grid handles all user interaction
and data display. Should a user cover the grid with another window, for example,
and later uncover it, the grid will be completely responsible for controlling
the details of repainting the grid. The programmer, meanwhile, does not need to
deal with any of the user interaction or display requirements. With the grid
controlling all other facets, you need to concentrate solely on maintaining your
data. When the grid needs to display data on the screen, you will be prompted
for it, by way of the UnboundReadData event. Once the user has made changes to
the data in the grid, you will be notified again - this time in reference to the
changes, by way of the UnboundAddData, UnboundWriteData and UnboundDeleteRow
events - and prompted to update the data to reflect these changes. If the data
is changed internally, rather than by user interaction with the grid, you will
need to instruct the grid to repaint itself, by using the RefreshRow,
RefreshColumn, or Refresh method.

In short, True DBGrid in unbound mode provides a useful tool for dealing with
dynamic data. Since it has no inherent storage capability, the grid handles
frequently changing data fluidly and easily. Make use of other True DBGrid
events and techniques, and you should be able to create efficient and friendly
applications.

Unbound Mode Bookmarks:

Before we discuss the use of Unbound Mode, we must answer the question: What is a
"bookmark" when referring to the Unbound mode? Simply put: Bookmarks are
variants used by the unbound grid as a means of uniquely identifying a row
within the data to be displayed. How, then, are bookmarks created, stored and
used? Well, since you provide, store and maintain the data in the unbound grid,
you must deal similarly with the bookmarks. The bookmarks, themselves, must be
supplied by the UnboundReadData and UnboundAddData (see next section) events,
and are passed to and from the grid in the form of Variant data type variables.
As variants, you are free to use whatever you choose for the purposes of
identifying a row, albeit with some restrictions. To better understand these
restrictions, we must first take a look at how VB and True DBGrid treat
bookmarks, and the importance of these differences.

The Grid:

The grid treats bookmarks as packets of binary information which cannot be
interpreted. To the grid, a bookmark is a piece of data containing a specific
number of bytes (ASCII codes) in a specific order. Thus, pieces of different
lengths, or pieces with different bytes, are considered different bookmarks. For
example, if the grid were to compare the String bookmarks: "1", " 1" and "01",
it would consider each bookmark different from the other, though they could,
numerically, be considered the same. Similarly, a 2-byte Integer and a 4-byte
Long would also be considered different, even if both contained the same numeric
value.

Visual Basic:

Visual Basic, on the other hand, treats bookmarks as true variants. That is, they
are quantities that can be converted from one form to another without loss of
equality, unless they are both in the form of a String. In addition, bookmarks
are often passed by Visual Basic(tm) as Byte Arrays, both by the grid and by
data controls. Thus, two bookmarks should be compared in Visual Basic(tm) for
equality, unless those bookmarks are converted to Strings. This rule remains
true whether the bookmark comes from a grid (bound or unbound) or from a data
control.

To avoid difficulties, it is usually best to use Strings universally for
bookmarks with an Unbound grid.

NOTE: Even though bookmarks passed to the grid may be strings, comparison of
bookmarks obtained from the grid (via Bookmark type properties) should always be
explicitly converted to strings before comparison. The conversion can be done by
simply defining a string variable and assigning the bookmark to that variable.
Another important consideration regarding bookmarks is their length. We advise
that all bookmarks in your application be created the same way. For example, the
Visual Basic(tm) functions Format$(), CStr() and Str$() do not generate the same
string, even if they are passed the same numerical value. The Str$() function
always generates a character for the sign of the numerical value, while
Format$() and CStr() do not (eg. Str$(1) generates " 1", with a leading blank
character, while Format$() and CStr() generate "1"). Remember that since these
strings are of different length, they will constitute different bookmarks.

To avoid difficulties of this nature, we suggest writing a single Visual Basic
for Applications function, like MakeBookmark(), and use it consistently whenever
a bookmark must be generated. Due to the way the grid handles bookmarks
internally, this function should, ideally, generate strings of at least 2
characters. Thus, if possible, use the Str$() function.

Creating an Unbound Mode Application:

Listed below are the basic steps for creating a True DBGrid application, using
the Unbound Mode.

Determine Data Storage Method:

You, as the programmer, are responsible for maintaining and storing the data
which will be displayed on the grid. One of the most common ways to store this
data is the Visual Basic(tm) array. If your grid is very large (1,000,000 rows x
5,000 columns), however, there may not be sufficient system memory to store the
arrays. In such a case, you will need to store the data in files, or in other
storage media (Generally, in such a case, databases are used to store the data
and it will be easier to use the Database mode of the grid.). Another use the
grid unbound would be to use a function/sub to return the values to display (The
values are usually dependent on row and column numbers). If using a function,
you can define it in the UnboundReadData event. Bookmarks will be generated by
the same function/sub. This technique is most appropriate when using another
DBMS such as Q+E Library, Choreo or Rocket.

Initialize the Data and the Grid:

Because the grid will start requesting data as soon as it is loaded, it is best
to initialize the data before the grid is ready. This can be done in Sub Main
(if you start your project with Main) or the Form_Load event (of the Form
containing the grid). That done, you must now initialize a few grid properties.
Some of these properties can be initialized at design time using either the
properties window or the True DBGrid property pages. (See Chapter 3 -
Configuring True DBGrid at Design Time.) We will now illustrate how to
initialize some properties at runtime.

With a 3 row by 2 column table entry, where the data is stored using a two-
dimensional array, the following code initializes the data and grid properties:

     ' Declare grid data as global array in some global module
     Global GridArray(0 to 1, 0 to 2) As String
     ' Initialize array data in Main() or Form_Load()
     For i% = 0 To 1
        For j% = 0 To 2
           GridArray(i%, j%) = "Row " &amp; Str$(j%) &amp; ", Col " &amp;  Str$(i%)
        Next j%
     Next i%

The following code is not necessary for configuring the grid at design time.
However, it does increase the efficiency of the code.

     ' For the sake of efficiency, we use Column objects to reference
     ' column properties, instead of repeatedly going through the
     ' grid's Columns collection object.
     Dim Col0, Col1 as Column
     ' Assuming the control name of the grid is DBGrid1, initialize
     ' grid properties in Form_Load():
     ' Assign the Column objects
     Set Col0 = DBGrid1.Columns(0)
     Set Col1 = DBGrid1.Columns(1)
     ' Define column heading text.  This can be done in code at
     ' runtime or in the Columns property page during design time.
     Col0.Caption = "Column 0"
     Col1.Caption = "Column 1"
     ' Columns display widths (in container units).
     Col0.Width = 1500
     Col1.Width = 1500
     ' Column alignment.  Specify left, center, or right justified.
     Col0.Alignment = 0      ' Left
     Col1.Alignment = 1      ' Right
     ' Column Locking.  Specifies if a column is read-only
     ' (i.e., user cannot edit that column).
     Col0.Locked = False
     Col1.Locked = True
     ' Initialize current cell position to upper left corner:
     DBGrid1.Row = 0
     DBGrid1.Col = 0

Note that the grid defaults to two columns, unless the number of columns has been
modified in the Columns property page. In the above sample code, we have simply
changed the properties of the existing default columns. If a different number of
columns is required, you must use the Columns() collection Add and Remove
methods.

Here, we provide sample code that deals with multiple columns and their
manipulation.

     ' Assume 5 columns are desired, and we wish to remove the
     ' existing columns since we do not know the property settings
     ' or even how many columns exist
     Dim oldcnt, newcnt as Integer

     ' Save how many columns initially exist in the grid, so we can
     ' remove them later. Also initialize the new column counter.
     oldcnt = DBGrid1.Columns.Count
     newcnt = 0
     ' Now add the new columns.  New columns are inserted before (and
     ' to the left of) the existing column number passed to the
     ' Columns collection Add method.
     For i% = 0 To 4
        DBGrid1.Columns.Add newcnt
        DBGrid1.Columns(newcnt).Caption = "Col " &amp; newcnt
        DBGrid1.Columns(newcnt).Visible = True
        newcnt = newcnt + 1
     Next i%
     ' Now remove the original existing columns.  As grid columns are
     ' removed from the collection, columns with higher indexes just
     ' move down, so we just keep removing the same column the
     ' appropriate number of times.
     While oldcnt &gt; 0
        DBGrid1.Columns.Remove newcnt
        oldcnt = oldcnt - 1
     Wend
     Define the UnboundReadData Event

Once the grid is loaded, you will be asked for data to display. The
UnboundReadData event is used to provide that data. Before describing the event
itself, however, we will briefly discuss the event's arguments: (see Chapter 10
- Command Reference for more information)

     Sub DBGrid1_UnboundReadData (ByVal RowBuf As RowBuffer, StartLocation
     As Variant, ByVal ReadPriorRows as Boolean)

RowBuffer - the RowBuffer is an OLE Object defined by the grid and used to
exchange row data between the grid and the Unbound data events. It has the
following properties and methods, and can be viewed using the Visual Basic(tm)
Object Browser, or Apex's Visual Basic for Applications Companion(tm) Object
Browser

RowBuf.RowCount Long - number of rows which the Unbound event expects to be
processed during the event. If fewer rows can be processed than requested, this
property should be changed in the event to reflect the actual number of rows
available.

RowBuf.ColumnCount Integer - number of columns which the Unbound event expects to
be processed during the event. This property is read-only, and no attempt should
be made to change it. The Unbound event should process all columns requested.

RowBuf.ColumnName(Col) String - name of the grid column indicated by the Col
parameter. This property is read-only.

     ' ColumnName (ByVal Col As Integer) As String

RowBuf.Bookmark Variant - specifies Unbound row bookmarks when the RowBuffer is
used to fetch data during the UnboundReadData event. The RowBuffer row is passed
as an argument.

RowBuf.Value(Row, Col) Variant - used to specify the data value associated with a
RowBuffer row and column. The Value property takes the RowBuffer row and column
as arguments.

     ' Value (ByVal Row As Long, ByVal Col As Integer) As Variant

In the UnboundReadData event, the RowBuffer object is created by the grid with
Values and Bookmarks set to Null. RowBuf is passed to the event with the
expectation that the event will set the necessary values and bookmarks.

In the UnboundAddData and UnboundWriteData events, data the user has changed is
held in the RowBuf.Value(0,Col). Any column with unchanged data will have
RowBuf.Value(0,Col) = Null. The programmer saves the changed (not Null) values
to the data source (the array in most cases). Note: Only non- Null values of the
RowBuffer indicate data changes.

StartLocation Variant - specifies the row "before" the desired data. We set
"before" apart in quotation marks because its meaning is dependent on the value
of the third argument: ReadPriorRows (described below). StartLocation will
contain a bookmark as a specification of the row.

ReadPriorRows Boolean - indicates the direction in which the grid is requesting
the data. For example, if the grid specifies a StartLocation indicating the 46th
row, a RowCount of 5 and if the ReadPriorRows property is True, then the
UnboundReadData event should return the following information in the RowBuffer:

     RowBuf.Value(0, col) = data for 45th row
     RowBuf.Value(1, col) = data for 44th row
     RowBuf.Value(2, col) = data for 43rd row
     RowBuf.Value(3, col) = data for 42nd row
     RowBuf.Value(4, col) = data for 41st row

On the other hand, if the value of ReadPriorRows in the above case were False,
the event would return the following information in the RowBuffer:

     RowBuf.Value(0, col) = data for 47th row
     RowBuf.Value(1, col) = data for 48th row
     RowBuf.Value(2, col) = data for 49th row
     RowBuf.Value(3, col) = data for 50th row
     RowBuf.Value(4, col) = data for 51st row

NOTE: Regardless of the value of ReadPriorRows, the nearer a row is to the
StartLocation bookmark, the lower its row index in the RowBuffer. In addition,
data for the row indicated by the StartLocation bookmark is not returned.

At first glance, the RowBuffer object may seem complicated and difficult to use.
A closer look, however, reveals that its use is only slightly different from
that of a two-dimensional array. StartLocation and ReadPriorRows may seem
unnecessarily cumbersome as well. However, they are the simplest means of
communicating the row boundaries of the data to the grid. They increase the
speed and performance of the grid. The grid only caches a portion of the data,
and it is with these two properties that you and the user can navigate from one
bookmark to the next.

Example: Suppose there are 100 rows of data, the current row is 75, and the grid
is asked to move to the 3rd row of data using a previous obtained bookmark. The
following sequence demonstrates what might happen in this situation:

- The grid receives a bookmark for the 3rd row. Because the third row data is
  not in the grid cache, the grid requests the data using the UnboundReadData
  event.

- The UnboundReadData event is called with:

        RowBuf.RowCount = 10
        RowBuf.ColumnCount = number of columns.
        StartLocation = bookmark for the 3rd Row.
        ReadPriorRows = False

- The event code responds as follows:

        RowBuf.Value(0,col) = data for the 4th row
        RowBuf.Value(1,col) = data for the 5th row
            ...
        RowBuf.Value(9,col) = data for the 13th row

        RowBuf.RowCount is set = 10, since all 10 rows could be processed.

- The UnboundReadData event is called again, this time with:

        RowBuf.RowCount = 10
        RowBuf.ColumnCount = number of columns.
        StartLocation = bookmark for the 4th Row.
        ReadPriorRows = True

- The event code responds as follows:

        RowBuf.Value(0,col) = data for the 3rd row
        RowBuf.Value(1,col) = data for the 2nd row
        RowBuf.Value(2,col) = data for the 1st row
        RowBuf.Value(3,col) = data for the 0th row

- At this point, the event code stops setting RowBuf values, because there is
  no more data available in the indicated direction from the StartLocation.

- RowBuf.RowCount is set = 4, since only 4 rows could be processed before BOF
  is encountered (i.e. - the beginning of the data).

- Additional UnboundReadData events may be called to obtain the data to
  complete the display.

In the above case, we see that by using the same event interface, we can handle
the special cases of row boundaries (i.e. BOF and EOF). When one of these
special cases is encountered, we simply exit the loop used to fill the RowBuffer
and report the number of rows actually processed.

There is another situation of which you should be aware, in the UnboundReadData
event. This instance occurs when the grid needs data for the first or last row
of the grid. In this case, StartLocation is passed as a Null variant. Whether a
Null StartLocation indicates BOF or EOF depends upon the value of ReadPriorRows.
Example:

     If IsNull(StartLocation) Then
        If ReadPriorRows Then
           ' StartLocation indicates EOF, because the grid is
           ' requesting data in rows prior, and prior rows only
           ' exist for EOF.
        Else
           ' StartLocation indicates BOF, because the grid is
           ' requesting data in rows after, and rows after only
           ' exist for BOF.
        Endif
     Else
        ' StartLocation is an actual bookmark passed to the grid
        ' in the RowBuffer, an event argument (UnboundAddData) or
        ' the setting of a grid bookmark. It is up to the VB
        ' programmer to ensure the bookmark is valid, and to take
        ' the appropriate action if it is not.
     End If

A final note: The programmer cannot make any assumption as to when the grid will
request data, or how many times it will request the same data. In short, it is
the grid's responsibility to display the data properly, while the task of
storing and maintaining the data falls to you. This system will allow you not to
worry about when and how to display data in the grid.

Define the UnboundWriteData Event:

If the grid is up-datable, and if the user has edited data in the row cells, then
moving to another row will trigger an update. The grid will then fire the
UnboundWriteData event, which allows you to record the changes, and which uses
the values passed via a RowBuffer to update the data you are responsible for
storing and maintaining.

     Private Sub DBGrid1_UnboundWriteData(ByVal RowBuf As RowBuffer,
     WriteLocation As Variant)

RowBuffer in this event has the same properties that are used in the
UnboundReadData event described above, though it is used differently.

In this case, the RowBuffer contains values passed by the grid, indicating which
columns have been edited as well as the modified values. The RowCount is always
1 for this event, but should be changed to 0 if, for some reason, the update
cannot be completed. Setting the RowCount to 0 will trigger a trappable grid
error event. To minimize the overhead associated with the update, only RowBuffer
values that have actually been edited require updating (are Non-Null).

WriteLocation Variant - specifies a bookmark for the current row, if it has just
been edited.

     ' Assume that a Visual Basic for Applications function
     ' StoreUserData(bookm, col, value)
     ' takes a row bookmark, a column index, and a variant with
     ' the appropriate data to be stored in an array or database. The
     ' StoreUserData() function returns True if the data is acceptable and
     ' can be stored, False otherwise.
     '
     ' Loop over all the columns of the row, storing non-Null values
     For i% = 0 To RowBuf.ColumnCount - 1
        If Not IsNull(RowBuf.Value(0, i%)) Then
           If Not StoreUserData(WriteLocation, i%,
     RowBuf.Value(0, i%)) Then
              ' storage of the data has failed. Fail the update
              RowBuf.RowCount = 0   ' tell the grid the
                                    ' update failed
              Exit Sub              ' it failed, so exit the event

           End If
        End If
     Next i%

Define the UnboundAddData Event:

If the AllowAddNew property is True, and if the grid is updatable, you must
define the UnboundAddData event. Much like in the UnboundWriteData event, data
is taken from the RowBuffer and stored. Once again, the RowCount is used as an
indicator of the success or failure of the AddNew.

     Private Sub DBGrid1_UnboundAddData(ByVal RowBuf As RowBuffer,
     NewRowBookmark As Variant)

For added rows, the second argument, NewRowBookmark, must be set, returning a
bookmark for the added row.

     ' Assume that a Visual Basic for Applications function
     ' StoreUserData(bookm, col, value)
     ' takes a row bookmark, a column index, and a variant with the
     ' appropriate data to be stored in an array or database. The
     ' StoreUserData() function returns True if the data is acceptable and
     ' can be stored, False otherwise.

     ' First, get a bookmark for the new row. Do this with a Visual Basic for
     ' Applications function GetNewBookmark(), which allocates a new row of
     ' data in the storage media (array or database), and returns a
     ' variant containing a bookmark for that added row.
     NewRowBookmark = GetNewBookmark()

     ' Loop over all the columns of the row, storing non-Null values
     Dim newval as Variant

     For i% = 0 To RowBuf.ColumnCount - 1
        If Not IsNull(RowBuf.Value(0, i%)) Then
           ' A value is specified in the RowBuffer, so use it.
           newval = RowBuf.Value(0, i%)
        Else
           ' the RowBuf does not contain a value for this column.
           ' A default value should be set. A convenient value
           ' is the default value for the column.
           newval = DBGrid1.Column(i%).DefaultValue
        End If

        ' Now store the new value.

     If Not StoreUserData(NewRowBookmark, i%, newval) Then
           ' storage of the data has failed. Delete the added row
           ' using a Visual Basic for Applications subroutine DeleteRow,
           ' which takes a bookmark as and argument. Also, fail the
           ' update by clearing the RowCount.
           DeleteRow NewRowBookmark
           RowBuf.RowCount = 0   ' tell the grid the update failed
           Exit Sub         ' it failed, so exit the event
        End If
     Next i%

Define the UnboundDeleteRow Event:

If the AllowDelete property is True, and if the grid is updatable, the
UnboundDeleteRow event should be defined.

     Private Sub DBGrid1_UnboundDeleteRow(bookMark As Variant)

This is the simplest of all the unbound grid events, though a vital one if rows
are to be deleted from the grid. This event should delete the row indicated by
the bookmark passed from internal storage. If the deletion fails, the bookMark
argument should be set to Null to indicate the failure. Note that following the
UnboundDeleteRow event, the grid is automatically refreshed.

Changing values in code - Refresh the Grid:

In order to change the value of a cell in code, change the value of the
underlying data then refresh the grid. The Columns().Value property is read
only.

     ' changes current cell value in code
     DataVal(DBGrid1.Row, DBGrid1.Col) = NewValue$
     ' Using the Refresh method to repaint the entire grid
     DBGrid1.Refresh

Putting It Together in Unbound Mode:

Following is code for a sample application, using the concepts discussed above.
This example should be viewed as a starting point, intended to show the logical
function of the aspects of Unbound Mode. Example:

     Dim MaxCol As Integer           'Number of columns
     Dim MaxRow As Long              'Number of rows

     Dim GridArray() As Variant      'Place to store the data

     Private Sub Form_Load()
         ' Declare grid data as global array in some global module
         ' Initialize array data in Main() or Form_Load()
         MaxCol = 2
         MaxRow = 3
         ReDim GridArray(0 To MaxCol - 1, 0 To MaxRow - 1)

         For i% = 0 To MaxCol - 1
             For j% = 0 To MaxRow - 1
                 GridArray(i%, j%) = "Row" + Str$(j%) + ", Col" + Str$(i%)
             Next j%
         Next i%

         ' For the sake of efficiency, we use Column objects to
         ' reference column properties, instead of repeatedly going
         ' through the grid's Columns collection object.
         Dim Col0, Col1 As Column

         ' Assuming the control name of the grid is DBGrid1, initialize
         ' grid properties in Form_Load():
         ' Assign the Column objects
         Set Col0 = DBGrid1.Columns(0)
         Set Col1 = DBGrid1.Columns(1)

         ' Define column heading text. This can be done in code at
         ' runtime or in the Columns property page at design time.
         Col0.Caption = "Column 0"
         Col1.Caption = "Column 1"

         ' Columns display widths (in container units)
         Col0.Width = 1500
         Col1.Width = 1500

         ' Column alignment  Specify left, center, or right justified.
         Col0.Alignment = 0      'Left
         Col1.Alignment = 1      'Right

         ' Column Locking - specifies if a column is read-only (i.e.,
         ' user cannot edit that column).
         Col0.Locked = False         'Column 0 is editable
         Col1.Locked = True          'Column 1 is read-only

         ' Initialize current cell position to upper left corner:
         DBGrid1.Row = 0
         DBGrid1.Col = 0
     End Sub
