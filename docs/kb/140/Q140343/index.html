The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you click "Envelopes and Labels" on the Tools menu, Microsoft Word cannot
print a separate envelope or label for each address when your address
information is in one column, as in the following example:

  Joe Howard
  123 Main Street
  Anytown, US 12345

  Jane Clayton
  Microsoft
  456 Elm Street
  Sometown, US 67890

  Leonard Zuvela
  789 Oak Road
  Mytown, US 54321

Important Notes About Using the "Envelopes and Labels" Feature:

- When your address information is in a single column (as in the preceding
  example), Word automatically uses the address that is selected or where the
  insertion point is located.

- On the Envelopes tab, you can print the selected address to one envelope, or
  you can add an envelope to the current document that contains the selected
  address.

- On the Labels tab, you can print a label sheet full of the same (selected)
  address, or you can print a single address to a specific label on the sheet.

- The Envelopes and Labels feature in Microsoft Word is only intended to create
  a printout of a single address.

To create a separate envelope or label for each address, Word requires the
address list to be in either a table or a delimited format. After the address
information is rearranged, you can merge the address list into separate
envelopes or labels for each address.

The "More Information" section of this article describes several methods you can
use to print your address list to mailing labels or envelopes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use one of the following methods appropriate for your situation. For example,

- If you are new to printing mailing labels or envelopes in Microsoft Word, and
  you want to keep your address list in a single-column format, use Method 1.

  -or-

- If you are familiar with printing mailing labels or envelopes by using the
  mail merge feature, and you want to convert your existing single-column
  address list into a table or delimited file, use Method 2.

Method 1: Use Your Existing One-Column Address List
---------------------------------------------------

This is the easiest method to print either mailing labels or envelopes, using an
address list that is in a one-column format similar to the example in the
"Symptoms" section of this article.

NOTE: Close all other open Word documents before you follow these steps.

1. Open the Word document that contains your single-column address list, and
  make sure there is no other text in the document (other than the actual
  addresses), and that the address list is arranged similar to the following
  example:

  Joe Howard&lt;B6&gt;
  123 Main Street&lt;B6&gt;
  Anytown, US 12345&lt;B6&gt;
&lt;B6&gt;
  Jane Clayton&lt;B6&gt;
  Microsoft&lt;B6&gt;
  456 Elm Street&lt;B6&gt;
  Sometown, US 67890&lt;B6&gt;
&lt;B6&gt;
  Leonard Zuvela&lt;B6&gt;
  789 Oak Road&lt;B6&gt;
  Mytown, US 54321&lt;B6&gt;

  NOTE: Each line in your address list must end with a paragraph mark (&lt;B6&gt;), and
  there must be one blank line between each address. To view the paragraph
  marks in your Word document, either click the Show/Hide button (&lt;B6&gt;) on the
  Standard toolbar, or click to select the All check box on the View tab (on
  the Tools menu, click Options).

2. At the beginning of the address list, add a new line, and type "MergeRecords"
  (without the quotation marks). Then press ENTER to add another blank line
  between MergeRecords and the first address of your address list.

3. At the end of the last address of your address list, press ENTER to add a
  blank line. Your address list should now look similar to the following
  example:

  MergeRecords&lt;B6&gt;
&lt;B6&gt;
  Joe Howard&lt;B6&gt;
  123 Main Street&lt;B6&gt;
  Anytown, US 12345&lt;B6&gt;
&lt;B6&gt;
  Jane Clayton&lt;B6&gt;
  Microsoft&lt;B6&gt;
  456 Elm Street&lt;B6&gt;
  Sometown, US 67890&lt;B6&gt;
&lt;B6&gt;
  Leonard Zuvela&lt;B6&gt;
  789 Oak Road&lt;B6&gt;
  Mytown, US 54321&lt;B6&gt;
&lt;B6&gt;

4. On the File menu, click Save to save the changes to your address list.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: Continue with steps 5a through 5g to temporarily rearrange
  your address list, so that Word can create separate envelopes or labels for
  each address. If you save your address list after you perform steps 5a
  through 5g, it will be difficult to correctly add additional addresses to
  your address list in the future.

5. Use the following steps to temporarily rearrange your address list into a
  format that Word can use to create your separate envelopes or labels:

  a. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

  b. On the Replace tab, click More to expand the Replace tab to show the
     additional options.

  c. With the insertion point in the "Find what" box, click Special and then
     click Paragraph Mark. Repeat this step to add a second paragraph mark to
     the "Find what" box. The "Find what" box should contain the following
     text:

  ^p^p

  d. In the "Replace with" box, type an asterisk (press SHIFT+8). The "Replace
     with" box should contain the following text:

  *

  e. Click Replace All.

  f. Click OK to the following message:

  Word has completed its search of the document and has made nn replacements.

     where nn is the number of replacements that Word made.

     NOTE: Word replaced the occurrence of two paragraph marks with an asterisk.

  g. Click Close to close the Find and Replace dialog box. Your address list
     should now look similar to the following example:

  MergeRecords*Joe Howard&lt;B6&gt;
  123 Main Street&lt;B6&gt;
  Anytown, US 12345*Jane Clayton&lt;B6&gt;
  Microsoft&lt;B6&gt;
  456 Elm Street&lt;B6&gt;
  Sometown, US 67890*Leonard Zuvela&lt;B6&gt;
  789 Oak Road&lt;B6&gt;
  Mytown, US 54321*&lt;B6&gt;

6. On the File menu, click New.

7. On the General tab, click to select Blank Document, and then click OK to
  create a new Word document.

8. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

9. In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, click Create and then click either
  Mailing Labels or Envelopes. Then do one of the following:

For Mailing Labels:

  a. Click Active Window to the following message:

  To create the Mailing labels, you can use the active document window &lt;file
  name&gt; or a new document window.

     where &lt;file name&gt; is the name of the current unsaved new document
     that you created in steps 6 through 7.

  b. In the Mail Merge Helper, click Get Data, and then click Open Data Source.

  c. In the Open Data Source dialog box, click to select your Word document
     that contains your address list, and then click Open.

  d. In the Header Records Delimiters dialog box, change the "Field delimiter"
     box to (none), change the "Record delimiter" box to * and then click OK.

  e. Click "Set Up Main Document" to the following message:

  Word needs to set up your main document. Choose the Set Up Main Document
  button to finish setting up your main document.

  f. In the Label Options dialog box, click to select the type of label you
     want, and then click OK.

  g. In the Create Labels dialog box, click Insert Merge Field, and then click
     Mergerecords.

     Word places one MERGEFIELD in the "Sample label address" box. This looks
     similar to the following example:

  &lt;&lt;Mergerecords&gt;&gt;

  h. Click OK to close the Create Labels dialog box.

  i. In the Mail Merge Helper, click Merge.

  j. In the Merge dialog box, change the "Merge to" box to the way you want to
     complete creating your mailing labels.

  k. Do one of the following:

      - If you changed the "Merge to" box to "New document", click Merge. Word
        creates a new document that contains your address list, with each
        address on a separate label.

        If this new document looks exactly like you want your labels to appear,
        click Print on the File menu to print your labels.

        If you want to make additional changes to the labels (such as specific
        formatting or changes to the text on each label), make those changes
        before you click Print on the File menu.

        -or-

      - If you changed the "Merge to" box to Printer, click Merge. In the Print
        dialog box, click OK. Word prints your labels directly to the printer
        you selected in the Printer Name box.

For Envelopes:

  a. Click Active Window to the following message:

  To create the envelopes, you can use the active document window &lt;file
  name&gt; or a new document window.

     where &lt;file name&gt; is the name of the current unsaved new document
     that you created in steps 6 through 7.

  b. In the Mail Merge Helper, click Get Data, and then click Open Data Source.

  c. In the Open Data Source dialog box, click to select your Word document
     that contains your address list, and then click Open.

  d. In the Header Records Delimiters dialog box, change the "Field delimiter"
     box to (none), change the "Record delimiter" box to * and then click OK.

  e. Click "Set Up Main Document" to the following message:

  Word needs to set up your main document. Choose the Set Up Main Document
  button to finish setting up your main document.

  f. On the Envelope Options tab, change the "Envelope size" box to the size of
     your envelope, and then click OK.

     NOTE: On the Envelope Options tab, you can make other changes to the
     delivery address and return address.

  g. In the "Envelope address" dialog box, click Insert Merge Field, and then
     click to select Mergerecords.

     Word places one MERGEFIELD in the "Sample envelope address" box. This looks
     similar to the following example:

  &lt;&lt;Mergerecords&gt;&gt;

  h. Click OK to close the Envelope address dialog box.

  i. In the Mail Merge Helper, click Merge.

  j. In the Merge dialog box, change the "Merge to" box to the way you want to
     complete creating your envelopes.

  k. Do one of the following:

      - If you changed the "Merge to" box to "New document", click Merge. Word
        creates a new document that contains your address list with each
        address on a separate envelope.

        If this new document looks exactly like you want your envelopes to
        appear, click Print on the File menu to print your envelopes.

        If you want to make additional changes to the envelopes (such as
        specific formatting or changes to the text on each envelope), make
        those changes before you click Print on the File menu.

        -or-

      - If you changed the "Merge to" box to Printer, click Merge. In the Print
        dialog box, click OK. Word prints your envelopes directly to the
        printer that you selected in the Printer Name box.

10. After you print your mailing labels or envelopes, several documents remain
  open. Close each of these documents, and do not save the changes. To do
  this, click Close on the File menu. Then click No to the following message:

  Do you want to save the changes you made to &lt;file name&gt;?

11. Repeat step 10 for each open document, including the document that contains
  your address list.

  NOTE: You previously saved the changes to your address list. Do not save the
  changes after you complete steps 5a through 5g, or you may have difficulty
  when you try to add new addresses to your address list in the future.

Method 2: Convert Your One-Column Address List to a Table or Delimited File
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a more advanced method that refers to several articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base to print either mailing labels or envelopes by using an address
list that is initially in a one-column format similar to the example in the
"Symptoms" section of this article.

NOTE: If you use this method, your single-column address list will be permanently
converted to either a table or a delimited address file.

By default, Microsoft Word requires that the address information be laid out in a
table or in a delimited file format. Using an address file that is laid out in a
table (or as a delimited file) provides many more options for merging address
information, such as the ability to use one address file for merging to
different types of documents, or easily filtering and sorting your address
information.

delimited format that Word requires, click the article number below to view the
