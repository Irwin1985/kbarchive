SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article is a copy of the information in the Readme.txt
file included with Microsoft File Transfer (Vvsetup.exe).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95(R) Microsoft File Transfer

INTRODUCTION
------------

These files comprise the Microsoft File Transfer application for Windows 95. You
can use Microsoft File Transfer to exchange files with another user's computer
while you are talking over the telephone when both of you have a VoiceView
capable modem and Windows 95.

The Microsoft File Transfer files included in this package were placed in the
C:\VVSetup directory.

WHEN YOU NEED THESE FILES
-------------------------

You'll need the files in this package if you have Windows 95 on disk, and you are
installing a VoiceView modem. Microsoft File Transfer is included on the Windows
95 CD-ROM version only.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

Errors When Installing Your VoiceView Modem:

If you receive an error when installing your modem indicating that any of the
following Microsoft File Transfer files cannot be found:

    FileXfer.exe
    FileXfer.hlp
    FileXfer.cnt
    Fte.dll
    Wsvv.vxd
    VVExe32.exe

follow the instructions under the Installation section of this document.

Microsoft File Transfer is not Installed:

Microsoft File Transfer (filexfer.exe) may not always be installed when a
VoiceView capable modem is installed. If Microsoft File Transfer is not
installed, you may be able to configure your modem as a generic VoiceView modem
so that you can use File Transfer.

If Microsoft File Transfer is not installed on your computer, first consult your
modem documentation or contact your hardware vendor to make sure that your modem
is VoiceView capable. Then, install File Transfer by following the steps under
Configuring Your Modem as a Generic VoiceView modem.

INSTALLATION
------------

Installing Your VoiceView Modem:

Install your modem through the Control Panel, Modems applet. If you need
additional assistance with installing your modem under Windows 95, search on the
word "modem" in Windows 95 help.

When files are being copied, a VoiceView modem will require the File Transfer
files. When you are prompted for a path to these "missing" files, type in
"C:\VVSetup". The files will be found, and the installation will finish.

To verify that the installation completed correctly, follow the steps below to
determine if Microsoft File Transfer is installed on your machine:

1. Click the Start button.

2. From the Programs menu, select Accessories.

3. A menu item called File Transfer will appear if the File Transfer application
  is installed on your computer.

Configuring Your Modem as a Generic VoiceView Modem:

To configure your modem as a generic VoiceView modem:

1. Click the Start button, select Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-Click the Modems Control Panel applet.

3. Click on the modem you wish to change to generic VoiceView and then click
  Properties. Make a note of the name of your modem and the port being used,
  then click OK. Keep this information in case you want to return your modem to
  the previous settings.

4. Click on your modem again, then click Remove.

5. Click Add.

6. On the Install new modem dialog, click Other.

7. Click on "Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list."

8. In the Manufactures section, click VoiceView Modem Types.

9. Click the description that matches your modem speed and click Next.

10. Click on the port your modem is using and click Next.

11. Refer to the previous section, Installing Your VoiceView modem, to finish up
  the installation.
