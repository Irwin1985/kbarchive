-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can use Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 to specify a
distribution point share name other than the default name, SMSPKGx$. Normally,
using a non-default share name on a distribution point is not a problem. After
the non-default share name has been specified and the share has been created, it
is possible to change the name of the share by entering a different share name.
When the share name is changed, the process to implement the change starts
immediately. If the package for which the change is being made is deleted while
the system is processing the share name change, you may experience the following
symptoms:

- The package is deleted from the Packages panes in the SMS Administrator
  Console, but the share name for the package on the hard disk may not be
  deleted. Instead, it may remain as the original share name or be re-created
  as the new share name, and this is dependant on what point during the process
  the deletion is triggered in the SMS Administrator Console.

- When you view the "Under System Status\Package Status" object, the package
  name is not deleted.

- Distribution Manager may begin to generate error messages about an inability
  to delete this package.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the package is deleted while a change is being made
to the package share name. When this occurs, SMS may not delete all of the
references to the package because modifications continue to be written even
after the package has been deleted in the SMS Administrator Console.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

WARNING: When you edit the SQL database directly, you must use caution because
improper editing may result in a site that is not usable. As with all procedures
of this type, Microsoft recommends that you create a backup of the databases
before proceeding.

Open the SMSPACKAGES table through ISQL/w (SQL 6.5) or Query Analyzer (SQL 7.0),
and then manually remove the row that contains the old package ID by using the
following SQL command:

NOTE: Verify that the focus is on the SMS database before you run this command.

  Delete from SMSPackages where PkgID = &lt;your package ID&gt;

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
