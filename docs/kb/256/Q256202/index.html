-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SQL servers that host the Systems Management Server (SMS) database may
experience error messages when you are upgrading SQL Server from one version to
another or from one service pack level to another. This behavior may also occur
when you attempt to perform an upgrade to the SQL servers by using Smssetup and
the integrated SQL installation methodology.

Note that this behavior may occur with any program that requires SQL connectivity
and is not disabled before you run a SQL upgrade.

CAUSE
=====

When the SQL upgrade starts, SQL services are stopped and then restarted in
Single User mode for the upgrade. If the SMS services (or other software that
actively accesses SQL) are not stopped before you start the upgrade, SMS may
continue to make requests for SQL connections while the SQL service is stopped.
When the SQL service is restarted in Single User mode, SMS may have queued a
request for a SQL connection. At startup, SQL services have a slight delay
before requesting a connection to SQL. Because of this delay, SMS (or other SQL
programs) may have already taken the connection; SQL will not be able to connect
to the database to perform the requested upgrade.

When you perform an upgrade to SQL Server, always disable any program (including
SMS) that relies upon SQL Server. Use the following steps as a general guideline
to make sure that SMS (or other programs or services) does not cause a problem
with a SQL upgrade:

1. Copy the SQL upgrade image locally (that is, do not upgrade over the
  network).

2. Stop all processes and services not directly related to Microsoft Windows NT
  or SQL.

3. For SMS 2.0, stop and disable Windows Management so that no other process can
  restart it.

4. Remove the computer from the network.

5. Run the SQL upgrade from a local CD-ROM or a locally copied image.

6. Put the computer back on the network.

7. Restart Windows Management and reconfigure it for an automatic start.

8. Reboot the computer to ensure a typical startup sequence for all programs and
  services.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have experienced this behavior, stop all services as described earlier,
and then run the SQL Setup program again to allow the installation to run
correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the integrated SQL Setup feature in SMS Setup only supports clean
installations of SQL. Using this feature to upgrade existing installations of
SQL is not supported.
