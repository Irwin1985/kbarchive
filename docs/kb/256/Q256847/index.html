SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to use the WNetUseConnection API function to map a
system-supplied drive letter to a network share. In addition, the
WNetCancelConnection2 API function is demonstrated to show how to disconnect a
mapped drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At times, it is necessary to map a drive letter to a network share. There are
several API functions that can be used to accomplish this, such as
WNetAddConnection, WNetAddConnection2, WNetAddConnection3, and
WNetUseConnection. The primary difference is that with the WNetUseConnection
function, you do not need to specify the drive letter to be used, while it is
required with the other API functions.

Steps to Create Sample
----------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add three TextBox controls to Form1 and name them "txtUNC" (without the
  quotation marks), "txtUser" (without the quotation marks), and "txtPWD"
  (without the quotation marks).

3. Set the PasswordChar property of txtPWD to an asterisk (*).

4. Add two CommandButtons to Form1 and set their Captions to "CONNECT" (without
  the quotation marks) and "DISCONNECT" (without the quotation marks).

5. Paste the following code into the code window of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  ' CONSTANTS
  Private Const NO_ERROR = 0
  Private Const CONNECT_LOCALDRIVE = 256
  Private Const CONNECT_REDIRECT = 128
  Private Const RESOURCE_GLOBALNET = &amp;H2
  Private Const RESOURCETYPE_DISK = &amp;H1
  Private Const RESOURCEDISPLAYTYPE_SHARE = &amp;H3
  Private Const RESOURCEUSAGE_CONNECTABLE = &amp;H1
  Private Const CONNECT_UPDATE_PROFILE = 1

  ' LOCAL VARIABLES
  Private MappedDrive As String

  ' CUSTOM TYPES

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     Dim NetR As NETRESOURCE    ' NetResouce structure
     Dim ErrInfo As Long        ' Return value from API
     Dim buffer As String       ' Drive letter assigned to resource
     Dim bufferlen As Long      ' Size of the buffer

     NetR.lpLocalName = vbNullString
     NetR.lpRemoteName = txtUNC.Text

     ' Initialize the return buffer and buffer size
     buffer = Space(32)
     bufferlen = Len(buffer)

     ' Call API to map the drive
     ErrInfo = WNetUseConnection(Me.hWnd, NetR, txtPWD.Text, txtUser.Text, _
        CONNECT_REDIRECT, buffer, bufferlen, success)

     ' Check if call to API failed. According to the MSDN help, there
     ' are some versions of the operating system that expect the userid
     ' as the 3rd parameter and the password as the 4th, while other
     ' versions of the operating system have them in reverse order, so
     ' if first call to API fails, try reversing these two parameters.
     If ErrInfo &lt;&gt; NO_ERROR Then
        ' Call API with userid and password switched
        ErrInfo = WNetUseConnection(Me.hWnd, NetR, txtUser.Text, _
           txtPWD.Text, CONNECT_REDIRECT, buffer, bufferlen, success)
     End If

     ' Check for success
     If (ErrInfo = NO_ERROR) And (success = CONNECT_LOCALDRIVE) Then
        ' Store the mapped drive letter for later usage
        MappedDrive = Left$(buffer, InStr(1, buffer, ":"))

        ' Display the mapped drive letter
        MsgBox "Connect Succeeded to " &amp; MappedDrive
     Else
        MsgBox "ERROR: " &amp; Str(ErrInfo) &amp; " - Connect Failed!"
     End If
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
     Dim ErrInfo As Long     ' Return value from API

     ' Call API to disconnect the drive
     ErrInfo = WNetCancelConnection2(MappedDrive, _
        CONNECT_UPDATE_PROFILE, False)

     ' Check for success
     If ErrInfo = NO_ERROR Then
        MsgBox "Disconnect of '" &amp; MappedDrive &amp; "' Succeeded"
        
        ' Clear the mapped drive letter
        MappedDrive = ""
     Else
        MsgBox "ERROR: " &amp; Str(ErrInfo) &amp; " - Disconnect Failed!"
     End If
  End Sub

6. Save and run the sample.

7. In the first TextBox, type the UNC path to the share you wish to map to a
  drive letter (such as, \\ServerName\ShareName).

8. In the second TextBox, type your network logon name.

9. In the third TextBox, type your password.

10. Click the CONNECT button.

  RESULT: Provided you have typed a valid user id, password, network share, and
  have the appropriate network permissions, you should receive a message
  indicating that the share was connected and the mapped drive letter is
  given. You can verify the map by opening the Windows Explorer.

11. Click the DISCONNECT button.

  RESULT: The mapped drive is disconnected. Again, this can be verified with
  the Windows Explorer.
