-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1) site, the Site
System Connection account (SMSServer_&lt;xxx&gt;, where &lt;xxx&gt; is the site
code) password is reset when you run a site reset.

If the hotfix described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article is
applied to the site, the site reset does not automatically cause Microsoft
Windows NT Logon Server Manager to perform a logon point update:

  Q253151 SMS: Systems Management Server 2.0 Dependency Package Contents

The Logon Discovery agent that is running on logon points attempts to copy
Discovery Data Records (DDR) to the site server by using the
SMSServer_&lt;xxx&gt; account. If the logon points are not updated after the
site reset, the old password is used and the SMSServer_&lt;xxx&gt; account is
locked out.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

This issue has been addressed in SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2). After you apply
SP2, you are prompted to confirm whether or not the SMSServer_&lt;xxx&gt;
account password should be reset during a site reset. You receive the following
warning:

  If you have account lockout policy enabled, you may not want to reset the
  server connection account at this time. For more information, please refer to
  the release notes.

If you do want to reset the SMSServer_&lt;xxx&gt; account password during a site
reset, you can force a Windows NT Logon Server Manager polling cycle that
updates all logon points with the new password. A polling cycle begins if any of
the following conditions exist:

- A polling cycle is actually due.

- A polling cycle was due to take place during the period Windows NT Logon
  Server Manager was stopped.

- A site control file property changed for Windows NT Logon Server Manager
  since it was stopped.

For additional information, see the SMS 2.0 SP2 Release Notes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
