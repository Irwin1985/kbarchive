SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article may help you decide whether to upgrade from
Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows 98 Second Edition to Windows 2000
Professional. This article lists similarities and differences between the
operating systems and key points to consider.

For the most up-to-date information on hardware and software that is available
for Windows 2000, please refer to the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWS2000/upgrade/compat/ready.asp

Use this link to search for hardware devices and software that are compatible
with Windows 2000. Some search results include links to downloadable Windows
2000 drivers provided by manufacturers. The "References" section later in this
article lists Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that detail various Windows 2000
upgrade issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

System Resources
----------------

Before you upgrade to Windows 2000, be aware that Windows 2000 requires the
following resources as a minimum. If your computer does not have these resources
available, Microsoft does not recommend that you upgrade to Windows 2000:

- 133 MHz or faster Pentium-compatible CPU

- 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM minimum; more RAM memory generally improves
  responsiveness (4 gigabytes [GB] of RAM maximum)

- 2-GB hard disk with a minimum of 650 MB of free space (additional free hard
  disk space is required if you are installing over a network)

Similarities
------------

Some of the similarities among Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition,
and Windows 2000 include:

- Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows 2000 support
  the FAT16 file system

- Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), Windows 98, Windows 98 Second
  Edition, and Windows 2000 support the FAT32 file system

- Universal Serial Bus (USB) 1.1 support

- Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) support

- File and printer sharing

- Plug and Play support

- Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows 2000 support multiple
  monitors

- Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows 2000 support Internet Connection
  Sharing

- Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows 2000 support FireWire 1394

- Long file Name Support

- Dial-Up Networking

- Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows 2000 support DVD

Differences
-----------

Some of the Windows 2000 features not supported by Windows 95, Windows 98, or
Windows 98 Second Edition include:

- The NTFS file system

- Multiple processors--Windows 2000 Professional supports dual processors
  (Microsoft Windows 2000 Server supports four processors)

- Security--you can apply file permissions at the file and/or folder level

- Built-in policies--you can use these for system configuration and security

- The Windows File Protection feature--this prevents designated system files
  from being over written by programs

- Driver signing--Microsoft tests and digitally signs other software
  manufacturers' driver files to make sure they do not cause issues.

- Enhanced power management and Plug and Play capabilities for Advanced
  Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) computers

- Fewer reboots--fewer reboots are required after you make system changes such
  as changing your computer's IP address

Overall
-------

In most cases, Windows 2000 is best suited for business environments in which
high system security is a must, or if you have programs that require the power
of dual processors. If you use your PC mainly used for Web surfing, computer
games, 16-bit programs, or MS-DOS-based programs, you should consider staying
with Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows 98 Second Edition. These operating
systems offer compatibility with the latest software, hardware, and PC games.
Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98 Second Edition also support some earlier
("legacy") hardware and software, including MS-DOS-based and 16-bit programs,
that is not supported in Windows 2000.
