The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Remote Access Services (RAS) client may not succeed
in being authenticated on a RAS server, and may return the following error
message:

  Error 5: Access is Denied

This behavior can occur in the following circumstances:

- The client is running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 or later.

- You enter a blank space in the Domain box when you log on.

- The server that is authenticating the client does not make use of domain
  names for authentication.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, place the mouse pointer in the Domain box, and then press
BACKSPACE all the way to the left to ensure that the box is cleared of blank
spaces.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs starting with Service Pack 6 and is by design for security
reasons. The Windows NT 4.0 RAS client passes authentication credentials
differently in this circumstance starting with Service Pack 6. Before Service
Pack 6, if a blank space is left in the Domain box, the domain name is ignored
and only the user name is passed. With Service Pack 6 and later, the domain name
is passed, even if a blank space exists in that box.

Some authentication methods do not use a domain name for authentication. This is
typical in scenarios in which RAS users are validated by using a product such as
Secure ID. When using such a security product, a user is typically not required
to type a domain name but is validated by means of a user name and a number (or
secure ID). In this scenario, a blank space in the Domain box may not be
noticed. The credentials are passed with the blank space as the domain name, a
backslash, and then a user name: &lt;domainname&gt;\&lt;username&gt;.
Authentication methods that do not make use of domain names in this way may not
succeed in this circumstance.

The following sample information is from a sample Ppp.log file. This example
shows how credentials are passed in Service Pack 6 and later when the Domain box
contains a blank space. In this example, the user name is "Alfred":
