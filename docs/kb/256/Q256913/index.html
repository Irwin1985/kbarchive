-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a computer running Systems Management Server 2.0 Site Server,
or Systems Management Server Administrator console system, running on Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000, you may not be able to connect to the Systems
Management Server database from the Administrator console. You may not be able
to schedule reports from Crystal Info snap-in of the Administrator console, or
run reports directly from the Info Report Designer.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 2000 upgrade removes the WMI ODBC driver (wbemdr32.dll) from the
WinNT\system32 directory. A clean install of Windows 2000 does not install this
driver. Systems Management Server 2.0 installs the WMI ODBC driver on Systems
Management servers and remote Administrator console computers as part of the WMI
install (Wbemsdk.exe). Therefore, this problem occurs when either an Systems
Management Server 2.0 site server or remote Administrator console computer is
upgraded from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this issue, do one of the following:

- Run the WBEMSDK.EXE /SERVER command on a Systems Management Server 2.0 site
  server, from the SMS\BIN\I386 folder (if the site server has been upgraded to
  Windows 2000 and is exhibiting the problem).

- For a computer running the Administrator console, connect to the computer
  running Systems Management Server 2.0 Site Server, and then run the
  WBEMSDK.EXE /SERVER command from the SMS\BIN\I386 folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 2000 Setup program removes the Windows Management Interface (WMI)
ODBC driver, Wbemdr32.dll, from the System32 folder. Open Database Connectivity
(ODBC) requires this driver to connect to WMI. Programs that use this driver
cannot connect to WMI or the Systems Management Server database. Programs that
use the WMI driver include Crystal Reports, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel
and others.

NOTE: For Systems Management Server 2.0 SP1 and earlier versions, the driver
installed by this method does not work on Windows 2000 for Crystal reports when
the site server is on the computer as the Systems Management Server provider.
The version in Systems Management Server 2.0 SP2 functions correctly.

An alternative location for the WMI ODBC driver DLL is the ValueAdd directory of
the Windows 2000 CD (ValueAdd\MSFT\MGMT\WBEMODBC); it can be installed from
here. However, this version of the driver (Wbemdr32.dll) does not work on
Windows 2000 for Crystal reports when the site server is on the same computer as
the Systems Management Server provider.

WMI is the Microsoft implementation of an industry standard called Web Based
Enterprise Management (WBEM). For more information about Systems Management
Server architecture and WMI, see Chapter 1 of the Systems Management Server
Administrators Guide.
