SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Code Complete, ISBN 1-55615-484-4.

As errors are found in our books, corrections are made so that these errors do
not appear in future printings. The following list of corrections is broken down
by the printing number the errors were found in. If the printing you have is
later than the printing the error was found in, the error will not exist in your
copy of the book.

The printing number can be found on the Library of Congress page, immediately
following the Title page. Just below the line that says "Printed and bound in
the United States of America" are a row of numbers. The very first number is the
printing number.

The following topics are covered:

- Errors Found In The First Printing

- Errors Found In The Sixth Printing

- Errors Found In The Tenth Printing

- Errors Found After The Tenth Printing

- Page 237: Add Colon Before Equal Sign in First Example

MORE INFORMATION
================

Errors Found In The First Printing
----------------------------------

Page 48, 2nd paragraph, last 2 sentences:

Change to:
"IBM popularized Basic on microcomputers by including a Basic interpreter with
the IBM PC. It is now commonly available in both interpreted and compiled
forms."

Page 48, last paragraph, line 3:

"&lt;&gt; NULL"

To:
"&lt;&gt; nil"

Page 176, sentences in the paragraph below the code fragment:

Change:
"In a development environment with a group of programmers, only the package
specification would be released. It would be impossible for a programmer working
on another package to look up the underlying type of Coordinate_t. The
information is literally hidden."

To:
"In a development environment with a group of programmers, you could distribute
only the package specification, which would make it harder for a programmer
working on another package to look up the underlying type of Coordinate_t. The
information would literally be hidden."

Page 204, code fragment at bottom of page. Two lines should have "i"s added to
read:

     ipaReformat = ipaFirstReformat;
     ipaReformat &lt;= ipaLastReformat;

Page 205, second code line:

Change:
"paLastReformat"

To:
"ipaLastReformat"

Pages 256-7. The code fragment that begins on page 256 and continues on page 257
should be replaced with the following:

  void insert_link
     (
     NODE * CrntNode,
     NODE * InsertNode
     )
     {
     /* insert "InsertNode" after "CrntNode" */ 

     InsertNode-&gt;Next = CrntNode-&gt;Next;
     InsertNode-&gt;Previous  = CrntNode;

     if ( CrntNode-&gt;Next != NULL )
        {
        CrntNode-&gt;Next-&gt;Previous = InsertNode;
        }
     CrntNode-&gt;Next = InsertNode;
     }

Page 257, first paragraph, sixth line:

Change:
"CrntNode.Next"

To:
"CrntNode-&gt;Next"

Pages 257-8, change the code fragment that begins on the bottom of the page and
continues onto the next page to:

  void insert_link
     (
     NODE * StartNode,
     NODE * NewMiddleNode
     )
     {
     NODE * FollowingNode;

     /* insert "NewMiddleNode" between "StartNode" and "FollowingNode */ 

     FollowingNode = StartNode-&gt;Next;
     NewMiddleNode-&gt;Next = FollowingNode;
     NewMiddleNode-&gt;Previous = StartNode;
     if ( FollowingNode != NULL )
        {
        FollowingNode-&gt;Previous = NewMiddleNode;
        }
     StartNode-&gt;Next = NewMiddleNode;
     }

Page 461, code fragment at bottom of page:

4th line change:
"Sum := 0;"

To:
"Sum := 1;"

8th line should be deleted:
"OldSum := Sum;"

11th line change:
"Crnt := OldSum;"

To:
"Crnt := Sum;"

Page 471, second code fragment:

Change:
"MaxPos := Length( InputStr );"

To:
"MaxLen := Length( InputStr );"

Page 701, line of code inside the for loop at the top of the page:

Change:
"Quantity"

To:
"Net"

Page 709:

The code fragment at the bottom of the page, in the comment line, the order of
the "BC" pairs should be changed to read:
"/* !B!C !BC B!C BC */"

In the line below the comment line, the "0, 2, 3, 2" sequence should read:
"0, 3, 2, 2"

In the line below that one, the "1, 1, 2, 1" sequence should read:
"1, 2, 1, 1"

Page 719, code fragment at bottom of page, 3rd line:

Change:
"Value = Value + Coefficient( Power ) * x"

To:
"Value = ( Value + Coefficient( Power ) ) * x"

Page 734:

The page numbers in the table are wrong and should be corrected. They are all off
by 4. To get the right page number, take the current page number and subtract
4.

Page 802, first full paragraph from the bottom of the page, last sentence:

Change:

Page 826, after the paragraph that begins "Yourdon, Edward, 1989b" insert the
following new paragraph:

"Yourdon, Edward, 1992. Decline &amp; Fall of the American Programmer. Englewood
Cliffs, N.J.: Yourdon Press."

Page 838:

added.

Page 853:

The index entries for the books Software Tools and Software Tools in Pascal are
missing and should be added. The page references are as follows:

Software Tools, 497, 511-12
Software Tools in Pascal, 497, 511-12

Errors Found In The Sixth Printing
----------------------------------

Page 313, code fragment, second line:

Change:
"&lt;"

To:
"&lt;&gt;"

Page 395, last paragraph:

Delete the phrase:
"described in Table 17-2,"

At the end of the paragraph, add the sentence:
"Table 17-2 describes a method for counting decision points."

Page 395, last line of the table:

Delete the sentence:
"If the case statement doesn't have a default case, add 1 more."

Page 455, second code example, second block of code, change the following:

- The "for" line should have a "begin" appended to the end.

- The "begin" in line 4 of the block should be moved to the end of the
  preceding line.

- The "end" currently at the end of the block should be outdented to left align
  with the "while" above it.

- At the end of that block, after the first "end;", a line should be inserted
  with another "end;". The new "end;" should be left aligned with the "for"
  above it.

The result of the above changes should look like:

       for Factor := 2 to Num / 2 do begin
          FactorableNumber := Factor + Factor;
          while ( FactorableNumber &lt;= Num ) do begin
             IsPrime[ FactorableNumber ] := False;
             FactorableNumber := FactorableNumber + Factor;
