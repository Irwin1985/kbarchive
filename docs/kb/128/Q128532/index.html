- Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you promote different backup domain controllers (BDCs) to the role of
primary domain controller (PDC) several times, the File and Print Services for
NetWare (FPNW) server is not able to access the PDC and one or more of the
following symptoms occur:

- The following message appears in the system log:

  Event ID #2625 - (EVENT_BINDLIB_PDC_SERVER_IS_DOWN)
  Description: The BINDERY library could not access the PDC for write.

- JetAdmin and PConsole can set up a PServer but JetAdmin and PConsole do not
  successfully set a password. This leads to an invalid password response from
  the server.

- When you attempt to manipulate PServers, the following error messages appear
  in Server Manager:

  - Invalid File Name

  - File Not Found

NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

  http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/cposupport /ccsearch/getdoc?doc=bpj05973

  or

  http://www.hp.com/cposupport/network ing/support_doc/bpj06765.html

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX based). For further
information see:

  http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/cposupport /ccsearch/getdoc?doc=bpj06723

  or

CAUSE
=====

FPNW does not attempt to get the new PDC location. It fails the call and
postpones obtaining a new PDC location until the next call. Consequently, the
write handle on the PDC is lost.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop and restart FPNW service in Control Panel
Services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for A
supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should be
applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the service pack release containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information. Microsoft does not recommend implementing
this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more
information on the availability of this fix.
