                        Magic School     pixels. The brightness

                        System           and 1 byte of "V"; the color
                                         information is kept. This totals
                                         18 bytes or 144 bits of
                                         information per block. Thus 9

                                         stores its files in a sequence
                                         of three planes. Each plane
                                         represents one of the "Y," "V,"
                                         and "U" color space.

needed.
