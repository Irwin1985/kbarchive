SUMMARY
=======

Trust relationships may be established between domains so that they may share
user account information. A secure channel is established between a domain
controller (DC) in the trusting domain and a domain controller in the trusted
domain. The secure channel ensures that only servers with the proper access
rights can send and receive privileged information. Primarily, the trusting DC
uses the secure channel to pass validation requests to the trusted domain
controller.

This article contains information on the accounts used to create and maintain the
secure channel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The accounts and procedures used in a trusted domain relationship are discussed
in this article. Similar accounts and procedures are used in the trust
relationship between a primary domain controller (PDC) and a backup domain
controller (BDC), and between a Windows NT DC and a Windows NT Workstation in
the domain.

For simplicity, the trusted domain is referred to as MASTER and the trusting
domain is referred to as RESOURCE. The trusted domain, MASTER, contains the user
account information. RESOURCE is the trusting domain; it trusts MASTER to
validate user access to its resources.

On each Domain Controller in RESOURCE, the existence of the trust is represented
by an LSA trusted domain object. It contains the name of the trusted domain and
the domain security ID (SID). The LSA trusted domain object is replicated from
the trusting domain PDC to each of the BDCs in the trusting domain.

On each DC in RESOURCE, a password is stored in an LSA secret object
G$$&lt;TrustedDomainName&gt; (for example, G$$MASTER). This object is stored in
the registry key HKEY_Local_Machine\Security\Policy\Secrets. The LSA secret
object for the trusted domain trust relationship is replicated from the trusting
domain PDC to each of the trusting domain BDCs.

On each DC in MASTER, the password is stored in a SAM user account marked as
INTERDOMAIN_TRUST_ACCOUNT (for example, RESOURCE$). This can be viewed in the
registry path \SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree).
This account is replicated from the trusted domain PDC to each of the trusted
domain BDCs.

These accounts are created when a trust is initially established. The
administrator of the trusted domain, MASTER, uses User Manager to permit
RESOURCE to trust MASTER's accounts. When the domain is added in the Permit to
Trust dialog, a password is provided by the administrator. At this time, a
hidden user account is created in the SAM for the trusting domain. The account
contains the specified password (for example, RESOURCE$).

The administrator of the trusting domain then establishes the trust. The
administrator provides the password specified earlier. User Manager creates the
LSA secret object. The server in RESOURCE attempts to setup a session with the
DC in MASTER using the account RESOURCE$. The DC controller in MASTER responds
with the error "0xc0000198, Status_Nologon_Interdomain_ Trust_Account" because
the special Inter-Domain Trust Account cannot be used in a normal session logon.
The session request fails because of this condition.

This error is informative to the DC in the RESOURCE domain. Receiving this error
indicates that the trust account exists and a trust is possible. Upon receiving
that response, it establishes a null session and then uses RPC transactions to
use remote API calls that establish the trusted domain relationship. A secure
channel is set up later by the netlogon service in the trust domain using the
trust information that was stored by the user manager.

After the trust is established, the RESOURCE PDC changes the trusted domain
object password. The procedure for this is detailed below. All DCs in each
domain receive the trust account objects through normal intra-domain
synchronization of the SAM and the LSA databases. The DCs in RESOURCE receive
the LSA secret object during the update of the LSA database, and the DCs in
MASTER receive the account in the SAM update. With these objects, any DC in the
trusting domain can set up a secure channel to any DC in the trusted domain.

Maintenance of these accounts consists of periodic password changes. Every seven
days the PDC of the trusting domain changes the password of the trusted domain
object. It does this by:

1. Picking a new password.

2. Setting the OldPassword field of the LSA secret object to the previous
  NewPassword field.

3. Setting the NewPassword field to the LSA secret object to the password picked
  in step 1. This allows the DCs to always have a password around that works in
  the event of a crash.

4. Remoting an I_NetServerPasswordSet RPC call to a DC of the trusted domain
  asking it to set the password on the SAM user trust account to the value
  picked in step 1. The trusting PDC remotes the RPC call to whatever trusted
  DC it has the secure channel with. That machine passes the request through to
  the trusted PDC.

The password is now changed on both PDCs. Normal replication distributes the
objects to the BDCs.

A domain controller of the trusted domain (MASTER) never initiates the password
change; it is always initiated by the trusting domain PDC.

It is possible, but not likely, that the trusting domain DC will change the
password without updating a DC in the trusted domain. Initiating the password
change requires that the secure channel has been set up. It is remotely possible
that the trusted side my have gone down at some point during the process and not
received the updated password. For this reason, both the old and new passwords
are kept in the LSA Secret object on the trusting side. Additionally, the PDC in
the trusting domain never changes the new password unless it has successfully
authenticated (set up a secure channel) using the current new password.

If authentication fails using the new password because the password is invalid,
the trusting PDC tries the old password. If it authenticates successfully with
the old password, it immediately (within 15 minutes) continues the password
change algorithm with step 4 (above). It does not start over with step 1 because
that might lead to problems where role changes have occurred.
