SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Microsoft Access 2 for Windows Step by
Step."

- DISK: Setup error "Insert DISK1"

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Page 95: Step 3 Error "Couldn't find net path or user name"
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following issue is caused by Microsoft Access 2.0, and is not a problem
caused by the Practice Files disk provided with "Microsoft Access 2.0 Step by
Step."

Under certain rare circumstances, Microsoft Access 2.0 does not properly update
the MSACC20.INI to allow you to import and attach Paradox files. When this
occurs, you receive the following error message:

  Could not find Paradox Net Path or User Name.

This error may occur when you try to attach or import SHIPPING.DB. (You will
first attempt this on page 95.)

Correction:

This is not a problem caused by an error in the book. See the "Comments" section
below for the proper method of correcting the Access 2 initialization file,
MSACC20.INI.

Comments:

To solve this problem, you will need to add the following line in the [Paradox
ISAM] section of the file MSACC20.INI:

  Add ParadoxUserName=&lt;your name&gt;

To modify the MSACC20.INI, do the following:

1. Close Microsoft Access 2.0 (if you currently have it open).

2. In Program Manager, open Notepad.

3. From the File menu, choose Open, and type the following path:

  " C:\WINDOWS\MSACC20.INI" (without the quotation marks)

4. Choose OK to open MSACC20.INI.

5. Scroll through the MSACC20.INI file to the [Paradox ISAM] section, which is
  about two-thirds of the way down. Q126498Q126498 NOTE: Do not mistake this
  section for either the [Paradox 3.X] or [Installable ISAMs] section.

6. Add the following as a new line in this section:

  " ParadoxUserName=&lt;any user name or other unique identifier&gt;" (without
  the quotation marks)

7. Save changes to this file and quit Notepad.

When Access is restarted, this setting will allow proper attachment to the
Paradox database. The following is an example of a properly defined [Paradox
ISAM] section:

        [Paradox ISAM]
        ParadoxUserName=Zephan Schroeder
        ParadoxNetPath=C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS
        ParadoxNetStyle=3.x
        CollatingSequence=Ascii

Page 95: No data sources available for Paradox
----------------------------------------------

The default installation of Microsoft Access 2 provides several importing filters
for other database files such as Paradox, FoxPro, dBASE, and Btrieve. However,
custom installations can omit these importing filters.

If the Paradox file format filter is not installed with Microsoft Access 2,
lesson 7 will not make sense because the Paradox data source is not available.

Correction:

Add a margin note left of Step 1:

"If Paradox does not appear in the list of data sources, you may need to run the
Access setup program to install the Paradox importing filters. These are
included as part of the standard Access 2 installation. Please refer to the
Microsoft Access 2 Getting Started manual or the Microsoft Access 2 User's Guide
for more information."

Page 95:  error "Could not open PARADOX.NET"
--------------------------------------------

The following error might occur while trying to attach a Paradox table as
instructed on page 95:

  Could not open PARADOX.NET

Comments:

This error is typically caused by not having permission to write to the directory
in which Microsoft Access is located. Microsoft Access 2.0 creates a PARADOX.NET
file in the Microsoft Access program directory the first time you try to access
Paradox data. An entry is made in the MSACC20.INI file in the [Paradox ISAM]
section pointing to the location of the file. The MSACC20.INI file should be in
your Windows directory. The entry will be similar to:

     [Paradox ISAM]
     ParadoxNetPath=C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS\ 

A network installation of Microsoft Access will typically have a read-only server
directory that contains the primary shared files necessary to run Access,
including PARADOX.NET. Unfortunately the shared directory is typically read-only
for users, which causes Access to fail when trying to open the PARADOX.NET
file.

There are three methods of resolving this issue: Grant users write access to the
server share, reinstall Access on the local hard disk (typical Access
installation), or change the MSACC20.INI to refer to PARADOX.NET on the local
drive.

Method #1: Grant users write access to the server share. For several lessons in
this book you must have permission to write to the server directory in which
Microsoft Access is located in order to open the shared file named PARADOX.NET.

Note: A system administrator is typically the only person with the permission to
change your access rights to a network directory.

Method #2: Reinstall Access on the local hard disk (typical Access installation).
That is, have Microsoft Access installed completely on your computer such that
you do not need to access a network to run Microsoft Access. You always have
permission to read, write, and change files that are located on your computer's
hard drive, so once Microsoft Access is installed completely on your computer
you will have permission to open (and write to) the PARADOX.NET file.

Method #3: Change the MSACC20.INI to refer to PARADOX.NET on the local drive. The
following steps should resolve the problem:

1. Open Microsoft Notepad (in the Accessories group)

2. Click File, then click Open, and then type in the filename:

  " C:\WINDOWS\MSACC20.INI" (without the quotation marks)

3. Scroll down to the [Paradox ISAM] section (about two thirds of the way down
  the file), and locate the ParadoxUserName entry

4. Change the ParadoxNetPath entry to refer to a local directory.

  For example:

  ParadoxNetPath=C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS

  or ParadoxNetPath=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP

5. Exit Notepad and save changes to MSACC20.INI.

Please contact your system administrator or Microsoft Access Technical Support if
you require assistance configuring Microsoft Access on your computer.


For information regarding resolving this problem in Microsoft Access for Windows
95, please refer to the following Knowledge Base article:

  Q142479 PRB: "Couldn't Open Paradox.Net" Error Message (7.0)

Page 232 : Entering New Order to Orders Subform Causes Error
------------------------------------------------------------

When you attempt to add a new order, you cannot add any boxes in the Orders
Subform without causing the following error:

  Current field must match join key '?' on 'one' side of outer join.

Correction:

In the SWEET.MDB file, the details section of the Orders Subform must have the
Default Value property removed from the following text boxes:

- Size

- Box Price

Comments:

To correct the problem, do the following:

1. Open the Orders Subform in Design view.

2. Double-click the Size text box in the details section to bring up the
  property sheet for this control.

3. In the property sheet, delete the Default Value property, which is set to 0.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the Box Price text box.

5. Close the Orders Subform and save changes.

Once these corrections are made, the Orders Subform will no longer cause this
error.

Knowledge Base:

DISK: Setup error "Insert DISK1"
--------------------------------

If the Setup program requests that you enter the disk labeled "DISK1" and refuses
to continue, please exit the setup and perform the following steps:

1. (Windows 3.x) From the program manager, click the File menu and then

click Run.

(Windows 95) Click the Start menu, and then click Run.

1. Insert the Practice Files disk in drive A and then type the following

command:

  " LABEL A: DISK1" (without the quotation marks)

Once these steps are completed, the setup program will recognize the disk and
continue the installation.
