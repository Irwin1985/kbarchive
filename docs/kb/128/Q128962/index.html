The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

NOTE: Please read all the procedures prior to performing the workaround.

The following steps will allow Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows users to update
their Microsoft Schedule+ calendar files on the postoffice, because they cannot
be synchronized using the Windows Remote Mail clients as described in

  Q96531 PC WRmt: Using Mail Remote with Schedule+

In order for this to work, the Remote user will have to assign Assistant access
privileges to a user that maintains a LAN-type connection to the postoffice.
This can be done in one of the following ways:

- The Remote user is in the office attached to the network and assigns the
  Assistant. (Easiest way.)

  -or-

- The Remote user passes his or her password to the designated user, allowing
  that user to launch Schedule+ as the Remote user and assign Assistant rights
  to the designated user.

  NOTE: This will create a USERNAME.CAL for the Remote user on the designated
  user's workstation. To prevent errors regarding MMF files maintained locally
  on the workstation, the designated user should rename the MSMAIL.MMF to
  USERNAME.MMF. After signing out of Schedule+ as the Remote user, the new
  MSMAIL.MMF should be deleted and the USERNAME.MMF file should be renamed to
  back to MSMAIL.MMF. The Remote user's USERNAME.CAL file can be deleted at
  this time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once the Assistant has been designated, and the Remote user is away from the
office:

1. Sign into Schedule+.

2. From the File menu, choose Export. The Remote users should export the
  appointments out to a USERNAME.SCH file.

3. Sign into the Windows client.

4. Create a message to the Assistant and attach the USERNAME.SCH file to the
  message as a normal attachment. Send the message.

When the Assistant receives the message from the Remote user in the Windows Mail
client, he or she should:

1. Save the attached USERNAME.SCH file.

2. Login to Schedule+, if not already logged in.

3. From the File menu, choose Open Other Appointment Books.

  The Assistant can now open the Remote users calendar file.

4. With the active window being the Remote user's calendar file, from the File
  menu, choose Import.

5. In the Import Appointments dialog box, select the saved USERNAME.SCH file,
  and select the OK button.

6. In the Import Format dialog box, select Schedule+ format and the Do Not Add
  Duplicate Appointments button. As a precaution select the Ask About
  Conflicting Appointments check box. Select the OK button.

7. The Assistant can now close or minimize the Remote user's calendar file.
