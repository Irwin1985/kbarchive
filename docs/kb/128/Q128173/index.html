SUMMARY

This article contains a copy of the information in the DEINSTAL.TXT file
included with the Microsoft Windows Sound System versions 1.0 and 1.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MICROSOFT WINDOWS SOUND SYSTEM
Copyright (C) 1991-1992 Microsoft Corporation

The following is a list of the files that make up the Windows Sound
System and a list of initialization file changes.

Not all these files can be found on any given computer due to differ-
ences in installation and use.  Moreover, when installed on a computer
that is running from a shared Windows installation on a remote network
drive, all the files listed as being in the Windows System directory
are actually located in the local Windows directory.

To remove the Windows Sound System, you must remove these files and
entries. Please delete files and remove entries from within MS-DOS
after you have exited Windows. If you try to delete the files from
within Windows, some of them might be in use, and you will not be
able to do so.

Files in the Windows directory (for example, C:\WINDOWS):

WINDOWSS.GRP
SNDSYS.HLP
SNDSYS.INI
VOICEPIL.INI
SNDCNTRL.DLL
SND.HLP
SNDSCAPE.HLP
SNDSCAPE.SCR
MCIPLAY.EXE
MUSICBOX.INI

Backup versions of existing files:

CONTROL.WSS    (Backup version of CONTROL.INI)
SYSTEM.WSS     (Backup version of SYSTEM.INI)
VOICEPIL.WSS   (Backup version of VOICEPIL.INI)
WIN.WSS        (Backup version of WIN.INI)

Files in the Windows System directory
(for example, C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM):

SNDSYS.DRV
SNDSYS.PAT
VSNDSYS.386    (When you restart Windows after deleting this file,
              you may receive a warning that you can ignore.)
SNDSYSW.CPL
MIDIMAP.CFG    (original file replaced)
SND.CPL        (original file replaced)
MSACM.DRV
MSADPCM.ACM

CAUTION: The files MSACM.DRV and MSADPCM.DRV can be used by other
        applications. Therefore, their removal could hinder these
        applications' proper functioning.

Backup versions of existing files:
MIDIMAP.WSS    (Backup version of MIDIMAP.CFG)

Files in the Microsoft Excel directory
(for example, C:\EXCEL): XLRDR.INI

Files in the Microsoft Excel Library directory
(for example, C:\EXCEL\LIBRARY): PROOF.XLA

Files in the Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows directory
(for example, C:\123WIN): 123RDR.INI

Files in the directory where the Windows Sound System was installed.
(The default is C:\SNDSYS.)

In some cases, you may not be able to delete the dictionary (*.DCT)
files that are installed with ProofReader. To delete them, start
Windows File Manager, and select all the files with the .DCT
extension. Then, from the File menu, choose Delete. File Manager
warns you that the files are "system, hidden or read-only" and
provides you with options. Choose the Yes button.

All files and directories should be removed.

The following is a list of modifications made to initialization
(.INI) files that were not created by Windows Sound System. The
files created by Windows Sound System are listed above.

Note: Depending on how you installed Windows Sound System and how
you use it, some of the entries below may not be present in the
specified files. Also, C:\SNDSYS is replaced by the full directory
name where you installed Windows Sound System if you did not choose
the default C:\SNDSYS location.
