SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses topics related to MFC database transactions. Some
material here is a clarification and expansion of existing documentation. Other
material describes the specific transaction behavior of the Microsoft Access
version 2.0 ODBC driver.

Beginning with Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.2, please refer to the following
two Visual C++ Technical Notes for information on performing transactions using
the MFC Database classes: TN047 (Relaxing Database Transaction Requirements) and
TN068 (Performing Transactions with the Microsoft Access 7 ODBC Driver).

MORE INFORMATION
================


MFC Database Transactions
-------------------------

MFC exposes database transactions through three member functions of the CDatabase
class, BeginTrans(), CommitTrans(), and Rollback(). There is a member variable,
m_bTransactions, that indicates whether the driver provides the capabilities
that MFC's model of transactions require. These capabilities are checked in the
CDatabase::Open() member function. CDatabase::CanTransact() can be called to
retrieve the state of that member variable.

One major requirement of the MFC transaction model is that the driver support
cursor preservation across transaction commits and rollbacks. This requirement
prohibits transaction support when using most ODBC drivers. None of the drivers
shipped by Microsoft to date meet this requirement.

There is a way, however, to use transactions with some ODBC drivers that provide
a lesser degree of transaction support than what is required by the MFC model.
The steps involved in getting this support are:

1. Query the driver for capabilities.

2. Manually set the m_bTransactions member variable.

3. Close or Delete the cursor after finishing the transaction.

The following sections discuss these three steps in detail.

Step 1 - Query the Driver for Capabilities
------------------------------------------

An application must check two items to determine if it is able to use
transactions as described in this article. They are transaction support and
cursor behavior. There are ODBC API calls that must be used to do this checking.
To check for transaction support, an application must call SQLGetInfo() with the
SQL_TXN_CAPABLE flag. If SQLGetInfo() returns SQL_TC_NONE, transactions are not
supported in any way by the driver and the application will not be able to use
transactions with that driver. For more information about this, please see the
documentation for SQLGetInfo() in the ODBC version 2.0 Programmer's Reference.

After determining that the driver will support transactions, the application must
determine the cursor behavior on commit and rollback. These capabilities can be
determined by calling the SQLGetInfo() function and specifying
SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR and SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR, respectively. These
functions are called by MFC itself when checking driver functionality in the
CDatabase::Open() function. In MFC version 3.0 and later, the results of these
function calls are stored in the CDatabase member variables
m_nCursorCommitBehavior and m_nCursorRollbackBehavior. In earlier versions of
MFC, these variables do not exist, but the application can make the SQLGetInfo()
calls itself to determine the cursor behavior.

The cursor commit and cursor rollback behavior will determine how to treat your
CRecordset after the transaction completes. The following shows the possible
return values and what they mean:

Return Value      Meaning
--------------------------------------------------------
SQL_ERROR         Transactions not supported.

SQL_CB_DELETE     CRecordset::Close() must be called
                 following commit or rollback.

SQL_CB_CLOSE      CRecordset::Requery() must be called
                 following commit or rollback.

SQL_CB_PRESERVE   No special actions need to be taken.
                 (m_bTransactions will be TRUE for a
                 driver that returns this value.)

The cursor behavior will determine what you need to do in step 3.

Step 2 - Manually Set the m_bTransactions Member Variable
---------------------------------------------------------

The m_bTransactions member variable of CDatabase is protected. Because of this,
you must derive a class from CDatabase to be able to change its value. This is
one way to do it:

     class CMyDatabase : public CDatabase {

     public:
        void SetTransactions() { m_bTransactions = TRUE; }
     };

Now, just call SetTransactions() on your CMyDatabase object to change the
m_bTransactions member to TRUE and enable transactions on your database after
making sure that transactions are supported.

Step 3 - Close or Delete the Cursor After Finishing the Transaction
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the cursor behavior determined in step 1, you must either Close() the
recordset if the cursor behavior is SQL_CB_DELETE, or Requery() the recordset if
the cursor behavior is SQL_CB_CLOSE -- after the transaction is done.

An Additional Consideration When using the Microsoft Access 2.0 ODBC Driver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the Microsoft Access version 2.0 or 3.0 ODBC driver, which uses the
Microsoft Access Jet database engine, you must also account for the Jet database
engine's requirement that you cannot begin a transaction on any database that
has an open cursor. In the MFC CRecordset class, an open cursor means a pending
result set.

Here are a couple of ways to handle this situation:

- Be sure that the recordset is closed when starting a transaction, open the
  recordset after calling the database's BeginTrans() member function, and
  close the recordset immediately after ending the transaction. If you are
  doing multiple transactions, the multiple opening and closing of the
  recordset can negatively affect the application's performance.

  -or-

- Use the ODBC API function SQLFreeStmt() to explicitly close the cursor after
  ending a transaction and then call Requery() after starting the next
  transaction. When calling SQLFreeStmt(), specify the recordset's HSTMT as the
  first parameter and SQL_CLOSE as the second parameter. This second technique
  is faster than closing and opening the recordset at the start of every
  transaction. The following code fragment demonstrates this technique when
  doing two transactions:

     CMyDatabase   db;
     db.Open("MY_DATASOURCE");
     CMyRecordset  rs(&amp;db);

     db.BeginTrans();                       // start transaction 1
     rs.Open();                             // open the recordset

     // manipulate data

     db.CommitTrans();                      // or Rollback()

     ::SQLFreeStmt(rs.m_hstmt,SQL_CLOSE);   // close the cursor
     db.BeginTrans();                       // start transaction 2
     rs.Requery();                          // now get the result set

     // manipulate data

     db.CommitTrans();                      // end transaction 2

     rs.Close();
     db.Close();
