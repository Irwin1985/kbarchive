SUMMARY
=======

A SoftRIP error message is an indication of depleted or insufficient resources
(most likely GDI) that usually occurs when you try to print a complex image.

Even though the Program Manager may show a lot of available resources, it cannot
accurately report how much of each kind of resource is available. As a result,
you cannot use the percentage of resources available as an indication of whether
a specific action is possible or will produce a SoftRIP failure. (The RIP
portion of the term SoftRIP stands for "raster imaging program.")

MORE INFORMATION
================

When this error occurs, the workaround is to take the same steps you would
normally take for any reduced resources problem. The following is a list of
things you can do to increase the amount of resources available. Where the
action suggested requires making modifications to an .INI file, be sure to make
a backup copy of the .INI file before making any changes.

1. Reduce the number of resources being consumed by the application by closing
  open windows, eliminating custom menu bars and commands, turning off resource
  consuming options (that is, in Word for Windows, don't display the Ruler or
  Ribbon because of the many icons they contain).

2. If the application allows you to print the same image from different views,
  print from a view that consumes fewer resources (that is, in PowerPoint for
  Windows, try printing from the Title Sorter view).

3. Reduce the number of applications running concurrently.

4. Reduce the number of icons being used by the Program Manager (eliminate
  groups by removing the appropriate line(s) in the PROGMAN.INI file and
  restart Windows).

5. Remove the unused screen fonts from your WIN.INI [FONTS] section, and restart
  Windows.

6. Remove the unused soft fonts from your WIN.INI printer section and restart
  Windows.

7. Reduce the complexity of the image or document.

A common situation that can produce this error message is printing a complex
image to a device that has no internal memory. As a result, the entire image
must be rendered in the computer's memory and then sent to the device as a
bitmap (raster imaging program - RIP). A common device of this type is the
Hewlett-Packard (HP) PaintJet.

The measure of an image's complexity is the number of graphics primitives that
must be used to render that image. An image that may not seem too complex, might
actually consume a great deal of resources. Typically images that contain ovals
with gradient fills or shading require far more resources to render than
rectangular objects.
