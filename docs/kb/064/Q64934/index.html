ISAMCVT.EXE is a utility provided with Microsoft BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for the purpose of
converting files created with other database-management systems,
including IBM BASIC Compiler version 2.00, to the Microsoft ISAM
format.

You can also convert the database using the REBUILD.EXE utility
provided in IBM BASIC Compiler version 2.00. IBM's REBUILD can be used
to strip the header information off the IBM ISAM data (.DAT) file. The
file can then be read in as a random access file and written out to a
Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00 or 7.10 ISAM database.

This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.

For more information on the ISAMCVT.EXE utility, see Pages 391-393 of
the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's Guide" for versions 7.00 and
7.10.

This article contains the sample program CONVERT.BAS, which reads,
with random access, the file created by the REBUILD utility with the
/S option and writes the information out to a Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00
or 7.10 ISAM database. Please note that this process does not save
indexes, so they will have to be rebuilt.

When an IBM BASIC 2.00 ISAM file is created, two files are actually
created: an index file with a .KEY extension, and a data file with the
.DAT extension. The .DAT file has a structure very similar to a random
access file except for the additional header information, known as the
"data dictionary." The data dictionary can be removed by using the
REBUILD utility with the /S option. The syntax is as follows:

   REBUILD SOURCE.DAT, TARGET.DAT /S;

The "Single-key" switch (/S) tells REBUILD to copy the source file
(the BASIC 2.00 data file) into the target file, removing the data
dictionary and any free space. No key file is built. The format of the
target file is a random access file with an additional 3-byte field
added to the beginning of each record. When reading the random file
into a BASIC 7.00 or 7.10 program, the TYPE...END TYPE statement must
be formatted the same way as the corresponding FIELD statement used in
the IBM BASIC 2.00 program, with the additional 3-byte field at the
beginning of each record. For example:

Used in BASIC 2.00 Program       Corresponding BASIC 7.00, 7.10 Declaration
--------------------------       ------------------------------------------

    FIELD #1, _                    TYPE BASIC20Rec
     25 as Name$, _                      Basic2Index AS STRING * 3
     30 as Address$, _                   Name AS STRING * 25
     4 as Zip$, _                        Address AS STRING * 30
     1 as Sex$, _                        Zip AS STRING * 4
     2 as Age$, _                        Sex AS STRING * 1
     4 as Income$                        Age AS STRING * 2
                                         Income AS STRING * 4
                                   END TYPE

Now you need to set up a TYPE...END TYPE statement to write the
appropriate information to an ISAM database or to another random
access file. This is to mask the BASIC 2.00 index off from the record.
You will have to dimension a variable or array of each type and assign
each of the individual fields, ignoring the 3-byte Basic2Index field.
For example:

     TYPE BASIC70Rec
           Name AS STRING * 25
           Address AS STRING * 30
           Zip AS DOUBLE        '7.00/7.10 ISAM doesn't support SINGLE
           Sex AS STRING * 1
           Age AS INTEGER
           Income AS DOUBLE     '7.00/7.10 ISAM doesn't support SINGLE
     END TYPE

     DIM OldRec AS BASIC20Rec
     DIM NewRec AS BASIC70Rec
               .
               .
               .
     NewRec.Name = OldRec.Name
     NewRec.Address = OldRec.Address
     NewRec.Zip = CVS(OldRec.Zip)
     NewRec.Sex = OldRec.Sex
     NewRec.Age = CVI(OldRec.Age)
     NewRec.Income = CVS(OldRec.Income)

Note that if floating-point values in records were written to the
file, you will need to convert them by invoking the QBX environment
with the /MBF option. This is because IBM BASIC Compiler 2.00 uses the
Microsoft Binary Format (MBF) for floating-point numbers, and
Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00 and 7.10 use the IEEE format. For example:

   QBX /MBF

Code Example
------------

'Below is CONVERT.BAS, the sample program that converts the sample ISAM
'file "MAIL.DAT" found on the IBM BASIC Compiler 2.00 disks. MAIL.DAT
'is rebuilt to the file "MAIL2.DAT" when the following command is typed
'at the DOS prompt:
'
'   REBUILD MAIL.DAT, MAIL2.DAT /S;
'
'The file is then read as a random file and each record is inserted
'into the database "CUSTOMER.MDB". For this example, invoke QBX.EXE
'with the /MBF option and load the PROISAMD.EXE TSR program.

DEFINT A-Z

'  Record description of data file MAIL2.DAT after REBUILD utility is
'  used:

TYPE BASIC2Rec
     Basic2Index AS STRING * 3  'This is the 3-byte index from REBUILD
     Name AS STRING * 25        'First and last name
     Address AS STRING * 30     'Address
     Zip AS STRING * 4          'Zip, SINGLE written to file using
                                'MKS$
     Sex AS STRING * 1          'Sex
     Age AS STRING * 2          'Age, INTEGER written to file using
                                'MKI$
     Income AS STRING * 4       'Income, SINGLE written to file using
