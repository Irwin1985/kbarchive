-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In some situations, an invalid object is placed in the directory through a
third-party program or a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) import.
You cannot modify or delete the object using the Exchange Server Administration
program, and you cannot delete the object in raw mode. In addition, the
following error message is displayed:

  The object cannot be found in the directory. This may be because replication
  has not completed. c1010aae

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove the affected mailboxes, use the following procedure.

NOTE: Two versions of LDP.EXE are available, one for Exchange Server 5.5
directory and one for Microsoft Windows 2000 Active Directory. The LDP.exe file
can be found on the 2000 Server CDROM in the CD:\support\tools directory. Run
2000RKST.MSI to install. The Exchange version is found on the Exchange 5.5
Resource Kit.

During this procedure, you will need to obtain both versions. Rename the Exchange
5.5 version of the file to "LDP1.EXE" (without the quotes). Use Ldp1.exe for all
operations involving the Exchange Server 5.5 directory, and Ldp.exe when working
with the Windows 2000 Active Directory.

WARNING: Ldp1.exe and Ldp.exe are LDAP programs that expose the directory in raw
mode. Care should be taken when using these tools.

Step 1: Find the Directory Name of the Affected Mailbox
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Run a Directory Export of the Recipients container where the mailbox(es)
  exist.

2. Open the .csv file that is created.

3. Find the Directory Name header, and identify the directory name for the
  mailbox(es) you want to remove.

4. Copy the DN string that is listed into Notepad.

Step 2: Modify the Directory Name so You Can Use it in LDP
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Type "cn=" (without the quotation marks) before the directory name and add a
  comma (,) after it.

2. After the comma, type "cn=Recipients,ou=Site,o=Org" (without the quotation
  marks) (the cn= parameter may be different, depending on which container the
  account exists in), as shown in the following example:

  cn=UserName?,cn=Recipients,ou=Site,o=Org

NOTE: The question mark (?) remains after UserName, because it is the invalid
character and is the reason for this deletion. The entry is ready for use in
Ldp1.exe.

Step 3: Remove the Mailbox
--------------------------

1. Run Ldp1.exe.

2. On the Connection menu, click Connect.

3. When you are prompted for a server name, type the name of the Exchange Server
  computer where the mailbox resides. Verify that the port is 389, and make
  sure the Connectionless check box is cleared.

  NOTE: Port 389 is the default LDAP port. This port may have changed for
  technical reasons, so please verify this with your system administrator.

4. Click OK. You should see that a connection is established.

5. On the Connection menu, click Bind.

6. Type a user name that has administrative rights to the Exchange Server
  computer, and then type the password for the user.

7. Click to select the check box next to Domain, type the domain name for the
  account, and then click OK. The following message should be displayed at the
  bottom of the LDP screen:

  Authenticated as dn:&lt;username&gt;

8. On the Browse menu, click Delete.

9. Cut and paste the entry you created in Notepad into the DN field in the
  Delete dialog box, and then click OK. You should see a message confirming the
  deletion at the bottom of the LDP screen.
