SUMMARY
=======

To start or run a program that is not designed for Microsoft Windows 2000 on a
Windows 2000-based computer, you must log on to the computer as a member of the
Administrators group or the Power Users group.

NOTE: If you are unable to run the program successfully as a member of the Power
Users group, you need to log on as a member of the Administrators group.

If you experience any problems when you start or run the program while logged on
as a member of the Administrators group, remove and reinstall the program, and
then attempt to start and run the program.

For maximum security and to ensure that the program functions properly, Microsoft
recommends that you run a program that is designed for Windows 2000 on a Windows
2000-based computer. If you do this, you can run the program successfully when
you are logged on as a member of the Users group.

To determine if your program is designed for Windows 2000, visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/professional/howtobuy/upgrading/compat/search/software.asp

MORE INFORMATION
================

On a Windows 2000-based computer, a member of the Users group cannot run most
programs that are designed for earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. Microsoft
Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98 do not support file system and registry
security, and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 uses lower file system and registry
security settings by default.

When you are logged on as a member of the Users group on a newly installed
Windows 2000-based computer with an NTFS-formatted hard disk, if you experience
a problem when you attempt to start or run a program that is not designed for
Windows 2000, use one of the following methods to resolve or work around the
issue:

- Install a version of the program that is certified for Windows 2000.

- Log on as an Administrator, and then move users from the Users group into the
  Power Users group.

- Use the Compatible security template to change the default security
  permissions for the Users group.

  For more information about security templates, see the "Predefined security
  templates" and "security templates, compatible templates" topics in the
  Windows 2000 online Help file.
