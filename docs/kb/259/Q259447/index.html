-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) client supports Multilingual User Interface
(MUI) language switching capabilities on Windows 2000 Multilingual User
Interface systems. However, there are some limitations in the implementation and
these are described in this article.

Required Software and Configuration:

Server:

- SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) English Site Server must be installed.

- SMS 2.0 SP2 ICPx (ICP1, ICP4 or ICP5) must be installed.

Client:

- The client system must have Windows 2000 with Multilanguage User Interface
  installed.

- The client system must have the SMSMUIActive registry key enabled.

- The client user interface language of the Windows 2000 system must be
  supported by the current System Default Locale as set in Regional Settings.

STATUS
======



MORE INFORMATION
================

If the user selects a Windows 2000 user interface language that is supported by
the code page referenced in the current System Default Locale, then they can log
off, and then log on again to have the SMS client user interface be displayed in
the same language as the Windows 2000 user interface. An example of this would
be a user who has an English Windows 2000 user interface, and then decides to
set the menus and dialogs to German in Regional settings, logs off, and then
logs back on and has the German user interface. In this example, the user would
also have a German SMS client. This level of language switching functionality at
log on time is identical to the multilingual user interface language switching
that is supported natively in Windows 2000.

If the user selects a Windows 2000 user interface language that is from a code
page other than that which is supported by the System Default Locale, the
log-off/log-on level of language switching is not supported. An example of this
would be a user who starts with an English Windows 2000 user interface and then
decides to set the menus and dialog to Japanese in Regional settings, logs off,
and then logs on. In this case, the user would have an English version of the
SMS client because the code page for Japanese is not supported by the System
Default Locale.

In order for the user to switch to a language that is not supported by the
current System Default Locale, the system has to be logged on to with a user
account that has Administrator rights. This can be either the local user or an
Administrator that is remote controlling the system. After logging on, the local
user or the Administrator needs to go to Regional settings in the Control Panel,
and then set the System Default Locale to the corresponding target language.
They then must restart the system, and when the user logs on, the normal SMS
localized client installation process starts.

Default Behavior:

The SMS 2.0 SP2 English release did not have the SMS client MUI support enabled
by default. To enable SP2 clients to support Windows 2000 MUI, the administrator
must set a registry key.

The default SMS 2.0 SP2 client language is English, and this is true regardless
of an ICP being installed or not. There are three cases when the SMS client is
in English on an MUI system:

- The system UI of the client is English.

- The SMS localized client language files are not on the local client system.

- The logged on user interface language does not match one of the languages
  supported by the current System Default Locale (which is the code page
  referenced in the current System Default Locale).

Enabling SMS Client MUI Functionality:

The client system must have the SMSMUIActive registry key and it must be enabled
(set to "1" (without the quotation marks)).

This is the SMS Client MUI registry key:

  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client
  Properties]

  "SMSMUIActive"=dword:00000001

Additional query words: prodsms; MUI; Windows2000
