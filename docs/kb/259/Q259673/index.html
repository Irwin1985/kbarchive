SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes you may want to change the icon associated with an application. This
application icon is what appears when you use the ALT+TAB key combination to
switch between applications that are currently running on your computer. The
icon can be changed by using the SendMessage API function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All Visual Basic applications have an invisible top-level window that processes
events and messages. In design mode, the window is ThunderMain, in run mode, the
window is ThunderRT6Main. The RT6 reflects the version of Visual Basic that is
being used. Both windows have the name of the project, or the executable name as
the window caption. This is where the application icon is set.

You need to use the GetWindowLong function to walk up the window chain until the
function returns a 0, indicating that there are no more parent windows.
Alternatively, you could search for ThunderRT6Main with the FindWindow API
function, but there might be more than one instance of your application.
(FindWindow searches for a window based on it's window class name and/or the
window text. If there are two instances of the application, both windows are
exactly the same. Therefore, it's not certain that you always find the one that
you are actually working with.)

The following Visual Basic sample demonstrates this.

When you set the Icon property, you can get the source Icon in several ways:

- By using the Picture property of a PictureBox control (as demonstrated
  later).

- By using the LoadPicture function to load the Icon from an .ico file. For
  example:

  Set Me.Icon = LoadPicture("C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual " _
        &amp; "Studio\Common\Graphics\Icons\Misc\BULLSEYE.ICO")

- By using the LoadResPicture function to load the Icon from a resource (.res)
  file. For example:

  Set Me.Icon = LoadResPicture(101, vbResIcon)

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. From the Project menu, add a new module to the project.

3. Add the following API declarations to Module1:

  Option Explicit

  Public Declare Function GetWindowLong Lib "user32" Alias "GetWindowLongA" _
      (ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal nIndex As Long) As Long
  Public Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias "SendMessageA" _
      (ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As Any) As Long
  Public Declare Function LoadIcon Lib "user32" Alias "LoadIconA" _
      (ByVal hInstance As Long, lpIconName As Any) As Long

  Public Const GWL_HWNDPARENT = (-8)

  Public Const WM_GETICON = &amp;H7F
  Public Const WM_SETICON = &amp;H80

  Public Const ICON_SMALL = 0
  Public Const ICON_BIG = 1

4. Click on Form1 and set an icon in the Properties window. This becomes the
  default application icon.

5. Add a PictureBox control to Form1.

6. Click the Picture property and click the ellipsis (...) button. This allows
  you to choose which picture you want to put in the PictureBox. Choose an icon
  (.ico) file extension.

7. Add a CommandButton control to Form1.

8. Add the following code to the code window of Form1:

  Private nRet         As Long
  Private nMainhWnd    As Long

  Private Sub Form_Load()
      nRet = GetWindowLong(Me.hWnd, GWL_HWNDPARENT)
      Do While nRet
         nMainhWnd = nRet
         nRet = GetWindowLong(nMainhWnd, GWL_HWNDPARENT)
      Loop
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim hIcon As Long
      
      ' set the icon
      Set Me.Icon = Picture1.Picture
      ' get a handle to ICON_BIG
      hIcon = SendMessage(Me.hWnd, WM_GETICON, ICON_BIG, ByVal 0)
      ' send ICON_BIG to the main window
      SendMessage nMainhWnd, WM_SETICON, ICON_BIG, ByVal hIcon 
  End Sub

9. Compile the project and run the new executable file. Press the ALT+TAB key
  combination to see what your application icon is. If you are testing this in
  the Visual Basic IDE, note that the default Microsoft Windows icon appears.

10. Click the CommandButton and press ALT+TAB again. Note that the application
  icon has changed.
