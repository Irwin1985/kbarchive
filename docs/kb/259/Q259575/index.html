SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use Diagnostics Logging to determine which
Administrator account deleted an Exchange Server recipient.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a typical production Exchange Server environment, many individuals and groups
may have Administrator permissions to an Exchange Server site. In some cases,
recipients may be accidentally or purposely deleted when you use the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program or the Directory Import feature.

To determine when the recipient was deleted, and which Administrator account
deleted the recipient, set the Diagnostics Logging level on the
MSExchangeDS\Security object to Maximum:

1. Start the Administrator program, expand the Site\Configuration\Servers
  container, and then click a server.

2. On the File menu, click Properties.

3. Click the Diagnostics Logging tab.

4. In the Services section, click MSExchangeDS.

5. In the Category section, click Security.

6. In the Logging Level section, click Maximum, and then click OK.

Use this procedure on every server in the site. If you use the Administrator
program on one server to change the Diagnostics Logging level, the diagnostic
information is not logged until the changes are replicated to the other servers
in the site.

NOTE: If Diagnostics Logging for the Security object is not enabled on every
server in the site, a user who has Administrator permissions is able to
establish a connection to a server that does not have the Diagnostics Logging
level set to Maximum, and delete a mailbox without being detected.

When the Diagnostics Logging level for the Security object is set to Maximum, if
a mailbox is deleted on the server, an event similar to the following event is
logged:

  ***BEGIN***
  Date: &lt;date&gt; Event: 1053
  Time: &lt;time&gt; Source: MSExchangeDS
  User: (User who deleted mailbox) Type: Information
  Computer: Local Exchange server Category: Security

  Description:
  The security descriptor granted 0x10000 access on object /o=Org Name/ou=Site
  Name/cn=Recipients Container/cn=Deleted Recipient for this user.
  ***END***

To use this event to find out more information about the deleted recipient
mailbox:

- Look for the type of access granted. 0x10000 represents delete access.

- Look in the User section in the header of the event to determine which
  Administrator account deleted the mailbox.

- Look at the full distinguished name path to the deleted recipient. The
  distinguished name section begins with "/o=.../ou=...". In this section,
  "cn=" marks the directory name of the deleted recipient. By default, the
  directory name is the same as the alias name of the mailbox unless the alias
  was modified when you created the mailbox.

- Look at the Date and Time headers to determine when the mailbox was deleted.

The server that reports an event ID 1053 that contains a 0x10000 access
hexadecimal code is the server that the Administrator program was connected to
when the mailbox was deleted.

An event ID 1053 is also logged when you modify or create a recipient. The
following list contains a few of the possible hexadecimal codes and the type of
access each code represents:

- 0x10000: A recipient has been deleted.

- 0x1: A recipient has been created.

- 0x80: Permissions have been added or modified.

- 0x4: Display or alias name has been modified.

Additional query words: custom recipient, distribution list, dl, mailbox, deletion
