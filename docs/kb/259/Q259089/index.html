-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a private Allegiance Server game on your local area network
(LAN), players who want to join may be unable to find the LAN game in
Allegiance.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if one of the following conditions is true:

- The version of Allegiance Server installed on the LAN server does not match
  the version of Allegiance installed on the player's computer.

- The first three segments of the IP addresses for the player's computer do not
  match the first three segments of the IP addresses for the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

AutoUpdate Allegiance and Allegiance Server
-------------------------------------------

To make sure that the version of Allegiance installed on the player's computer
matches the version of Allegiance Server installed on the LAN server, update the
Allegiance software on both the player's computer and on the LAN server.

Update Allegiance on the player's computer:

To update the Allegiance software software automatically:

1. Start Allegiance.

2. Click Allegiance Zone.

3. Click Games List.

4. If updated files are available, Allegiance downloads and installs them
  automatically.

After the installation is finished, Allegiance quits and then automatically
restarts. For additional information about how to update the Allegiance
software, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q253337 Allegiance: How to Update the Microsoft Allegiance Software

Update Allegiance Server on the LAN server:

To update the Allegiance Server software automatically, create a new public game
in Allegiance Server.

If a new update becomes available when a public game is running on Allegiance
Server, the program waits until no players are connected, and then it downloads
and installs the update.

When the update is installed, Allegiance Server quits and restarts itself
automatically. However, it does not re-create any games that were running before
the update was installed. You must create or re-create any games that you want
to run on Allegiance Server.

Check the Client and Server IP Addresses
----------------------------------------

Make sure that the first three segments of the IP address for the player's
computer match the first three segments of the IP address for the server. Only
the last segment of the IP addresses can be different.

The following table shows the results of several example combinations of IP
addresses:

  
  +-------------------------------------------------------+
  | Server IP Address | Player IP Address | Game Visible? | 
  +-------------------------------------------------------+
  | 123.45.6.78       | 123.45.6.42       | Yes           | 
  +-------------------------------------------------------+
  | 123.45.6.78       | 123.45.108.42     | No            | 
  +-------------------------------------------------------+
  | 123.45.108.78     | 123.45.6.42       | No            | 
  +-------------------------------------------------------+

To determine the IP address for your computer:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "winipcfg" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. In the adapter box, click the adapter that you want to use to play
  Allegiance.

4. In the IP Address box, note your IP address.

5. Click OK.
