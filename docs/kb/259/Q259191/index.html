-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator or Microsoft Flight Simulator
98, your aircraft may unexpectedly stop in midair with the aircraft nose pointed
straight down. However, you can still fire your guns, and other aircraft in the
game continue to fly normally.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

- A sound card based on the Vortex Aureal chip set is installed in your
  computer.

- The sound driver for your sound card is outdated.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire
about how to obtain and install the latest version of the sound driver for your
sound card.

For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your sound card, click
the appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

If the issue continues to occur, use the following methods in the order in which
they are presented.

Reduce Hardware Sound Acceleration in Dxdiag
--------------------------------------------

If you run Combat Flight Simulator or Flight Simulator 98 on a computer that is
running Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows 2000,
reduce the Hardware Sound Acceleration setting:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. Click the Sound tab.

4. Under DirectX Features, move the Hardware Sound Acceleration Level slider all
  the way to the left (the "No acceleration" setting).

5. Click Exit.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce the Sound Playback Quality
---------------------------------

If the issue is resolved when you disable sound in the game, your sound card may
be unable to properly process game port signals and high quality game sounds at
the same time.

To reduce the sound playback quality in the game:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

2. If you are running Combat Flight Simulator, type "Combatfs.cfg" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Named box.

  If you are running Flight Simulator 98, type "Fltsim98.cfg" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Named box.

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, double-click the Combatfs.cfg file or the
  Fltsim98.cfg file.

5. If you are prompted to select the program that you want to use to open the
  file, click Notepad in the "Choose the program you want to use" box, and then
  click OK.

6. Scroll to the end of the file, press ENTER twice, and then type the following
  lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:

  [SOUND]
  Channels=1
  SamplesPerSec=11025

7. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

8. Close the Find: Files Named Combatfs.cfg or Find: Files Named Fltsim98.cfg
  window.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Under Playback on the Audio tab, click Game Compatible Device in the
  "Preferred device" box.
