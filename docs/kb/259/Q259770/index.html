-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Baseball 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Baseball 2001, you may receive the following error
message:

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

When you click Details, you receive the following error message:

  Baseball2001 caused an invalid page fault in module Graphics.dll.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- The Graphics Hardware Acceleration setting on your computer is not set to
  Full.

- Less than 2 megabytes (MB) of video memory is installed on your primary video
  adapter.

- Your primary video adapter does not support DirectDraw.

- The video driver for your primary video adapter is outdated or does not
  support DirectDraw.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Increase the Graphics Hardware Acceleration Setting to Full
-----------------------------------------------------------

To increase the Graphics Hardware Acceleration setting to Full:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider all the way to the right (the Full
  acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method:

Check the Amount of Video Memory Installed on Your Primary Video Adapter
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To play Baseball 2001, a video adapter with at least 2 MB of video memory must be
installed in your computer. However, if only 2 MB of video memory is installed
on your video adapter, you can only play the game in Software mode.

To play Baseball 2001 in 3D Hardware mode, a Direct3D-compatible video adapter
with at least 4 MB of video memory must be installed in your computer.

If less than 2 MB of video memory is installed on your video adapter, install
additional video memory, upgrade to a video adapter with at least 2 MB of video
memory to play the game in Software mode, or upgrade to a Direct3D-compatible
video adapter with at least 4MB of video memory to play the game in 3D Hardware
mode.

To determine the amount of video memory that is installed in your computer:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. Click the Display tab.

4. Under Device, note the amount of memory on the Approx. Total Memory line.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each Display tab in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool.

If the amount of memory on the Approx. Total Memory line on the Display tab that
corresponds to your primary video adapter is more than 4 MB, and the issue
continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Obtain and Install an Updated Video Driver
------------------------------------------

Contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to inquire about how to obtain and
install the latest version of the video driver for your video adapter.

For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your video adapter,
click the appropriate article number in the following list to view the article

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.
