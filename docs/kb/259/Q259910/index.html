SUMMARY
=======

You can control the access to TN3270 resources (LUs and/or Pools) when you
configure which TCP/IP addresses, subnets, or workstation names that have access
to the resources. For additional information, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190446 Restricting Access to TN3270 LUs

An alternative method is available that allows administrators to set up a
"default" TN3270 resource for TN3270 clients, while they control access to the
resource without the use of the methods described in the referenced article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TN3270 server, included with SNA Server, supports the following two types of
session requests:

- Generic

- Specific

If a TN3270 client specifies a blank device name, the TN3270 server views this as
a "generic" request. Generic session requests are satisfied by any of the
display LUs/Pools that are assigned to the TN3270 server as "generic displays."
LUs/Pools configured to be generic displays constitute the TN3270 server's
default pool of display LUs/Pools. Resources assigned to the TN3270 server are
configured as generic resources by default.

Display LUs/Pools assigned to the TN3270 server can be configured as "specific
displays." Resources configured as "specific" are accessed by TN3270 clients
that explicitly request the resources by name.

ITN3270 clients that specify an invalid TN3270 LU/Pool name cannot connect to any
TN3270 session. The TN3270 clients that specify an invalid TN3270 LU/Pool name
cannot connect to any TN3270 session.

NOTE: This information also applies to printer sessions assigned to the TN3270
server. Printers can be "associated printers." Associated printers are print
sessions associated with a display session. (This means that a TN3270 client is
allocated the print session at the same time they are it is allocated the
display session.)

Configuring TN3270 LUs/Pools as specific or generic to control access is used in
environments where some TN3270 clients (for example, managed clients) require
the use of specific TN3270 resources, while other clients (for example,
unmanaged clients), should connect to "default" TN3270 resources.

The following is a method to configure TN3270 resources to control access though
the use of specific and generic LU types:

- Assign the managed users' resources to the TN3270 server as "specific
  displays," either individually assigned or grouped together into pools of
  interchangeable resources. The managed users' TN3270 emulators are configured
  to specify their required device name (for example, LU/Pool name).

- Assign the un-managed users' resources to the TN3270 server as "generic
  displays" (for example, the Default Pool). Un-managed users who do not know
  or care which resource they should use, can leave the device name blank in
  their TN3270 emulator when connecting to the TN3270 server.

TN3270 clients that enter an invalid device name are not allowed access to any
TN3270 resources.

TN3270 clients that enter a valid device name are allowed access to the specified
TN3270 resource whether the resource is configured as specific or generic.
TN3270 clients can access generic resources either when entering a valid device
name or when leaving the device name blank.

The following steps describe how to check or change the session type for TN3270
sessions:

1. Open the SNA Server Manager.

2. Select the TN3270 folder under the appropriate SNA Server.

3. Right-click, and then select Properties on a resource assigned to the TN3270
  server.

4. Select the TN3270 tab.

5. Select the appropriate display or printer type in the Type section of the
  TN3270 session properties.
