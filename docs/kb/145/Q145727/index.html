SUMMARY
=======

Solely declaring and calling the Unicode versions of 32-bit API functions in the
same way that the ANSI versions are used will not work. This article shows one
way that the Unicode version of an API function can be used without the need to
create a type library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic, like Windows NT and Windows 2000, is based internally on the
double-byte Unicode standard. However, Visual Basic assumes that the world
outside of itself still uses the single-byte ANSI model. Any strings passed as
parameters to an external function will be converted by Visual Basic from their
internal Unicode representation to an ANSI representation before the call to the
function is made. In the same way, all strings that return to Visual Basic from
an external function are assumed to be in an ANSI representation, and Visual
Basic will attempt to make the conversion to a Unicode representation for
internal use. This behavior makes it impossible to call an external function
that expects or returns a Unicode string in the same way as a function that
deals only with ANSI strings.

One way to call a Unicode function is to create a type library referring to the
Unicode function to be called, refer to this type library from within Visual
Basic, and then make all calls to the Unicode function via the type library.

For more information on this approach, see the text file VB4DLL.TXT or
VB5DLL.Doc, located in the same directory as your Visual Basic executables.

Unicode functions can also be accessed by using Visual Basic ability to create
arrays of the new Byte data type. If the string(s) that are passed to and from
the external function are represented in Visual Basic as byte arrays, then
Visual Basic will not do any conversion when passing or receiving data to or
from the outside world.

The following code shows how to declare and call both the ANSI
(GetWindowsDirectoryA) and Unicode (GetWindowsDirectoryW, for Wide) versions of
the GetWindowsDirectory API call:

     Declare Function GetWindowsDirectoryA Lib "Kernel32" _
         (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long
     Declare Function GetWindowsDirectoryW Lib "Kernel32" _
         (lpBuffer As Any, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long

     Sub mainA()
         Dim sBuf As String
         Dim cSize As Long
         Dim retval As Long

         sBuf = String(255, 0)
         cSize = 255

         retval = GetWindowsDirectoryA(sBuf, cSize)

         sBuf = Left(sBuf, retval)
         Debug.Print sBuf
     End Sub

     Sub mainW()
         Dim Buf() As Byte, sBuf As String
         Dim cSize As Long
         Dim retval As Long

         ReDim Buf(254)
         cSize = 255

         retval = GetWindowsDirectoryW(Buf(0), cSize)

         sBuf = Left(Buf, retval)
         Debug.Print sBuf
     End Sub

The mainA() procedure makes a call to the ANSI version of GetWindowsDirectory,
while the mainW() procedure does the same for the Unicode version. Both
procedures output the same result, although the method they use to do so
differs.

The call to the ANSI version is done in the same way that has always existed for
passing and returning strings to and from an external DLL. A Visual Basic string
is dimensioned and padded with a certain number of spaces, and the function is
called with this string and the length of the string as parameters. After the
function returns, the extra spaces are stripped off of the returned string and
the value is printed out. The ByVal in front of the string in the Declare for
GetWindowsDirectoryA indicates that a reference to a null-terminated string
should be given to the DLL, not that a copy of the Visual Basic string should be
passed.

The call to the Unicode version works a bit differently. In addition to
dimensioning a string variable, sBuf, we also dimension a dynamic array of
bytes. The ReDim statement then sizes the byte array to be 255 bytes large
(indexed from 0). When GetWindowsDirectoryW is called, it is passed a reference
to the first element of the byte array and the size of the array.

The call fills in the Buf array with the Unicode codes for the characters
representing the Windows directory and returns the number of bytes it has
modified. Remember that, since the function is returning Unicode info, each
character will take two bytes to store. For example, if your Windows directory
is 'C:\WINNT' then Buf(0) will be 67 and Buf(1) will be 0, Buf(2) will be 58,
while Buf(3) is 0, and so on. The values may differ if a non- English code page
is used.

The line of code immediately following the call to GetWindowsDirectoryW uses
Visual Basic byte array-string coercion features to coerce the byte array into a
string. When assigning a byte array to a string Visual Basic assumes that the
information stored in the byte array is in a Unicode format. From then on, the
sBuf variable holds a Visual Basic string representing the current Windows
directory and can be manipulated as such.

The example above shows how to pass an uninitialized and empty byte array to a
function. A byte array initialized with some string can also be passed to an
external function. For example, the following code snippet declares,
initializes, and passes a byte array to a function called MyPassFunction:

     Dim bArray() As Byte
     bArray = "Hello" &amp; vbNullChar
     MyPassFunction bArray(0)
