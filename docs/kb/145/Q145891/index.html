SYMPTOMS
========

When a form contains a combo box that has its RowSource set to the same table
that other controls on the form are using as their ControlSource, the record
pointer may move to a different record when the user activates the combo box.
There are two different scenarios where this unwanted moving of the record
pointer can occur. This article outlines both scenarios.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use an SQL statement for the RowSource of the combo box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are not familiar with the Form Designer or with the different form
controls, please see Chapters 9 and 11 in the Developer's Guide.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form and add the Customer table (found in the Samples\Data
  directory) to the form's Data Environment.

2. Drag the cust_id and company fields from the Customer table in the Data
  Environment onto the form.

3. Add a combo box (Combo1) to the form and set these properties:

     RowSourceType = 6 - Fields
     RowSource = Customer.Cust_id

4. Add the following code to the following indicated Combo1 events:

  Init event:

        This.Value = Cust_id

  GotFocus event:

        SET ORDER TO Cust_id

  InteractiveChage event:

        ThisForm.Combo2.Value = This.Value

5. Add a second combo box (Combo2) to the form and set these properties:

     RowSourceType = 6 - Fields
     RowSource = Customer.Company,Cust_id
     BoundColumn = 2
     ColumnCount = 2
     ColumnWidths = 200,0

6. Add the following code to the following indicated Combo2 events:

  Init Event:

        This.Value = Cust_id

  GotFocus Event:

        SET ORDER TO Company

  InteractiveChage Event:

        ThisForm.Combo1.Value = This.Value

7. Save and run the form.

8. After the form is up and running, click Debug on the Tools Menu. In the Debug
  window, enter RECNO().

Scenario Number One
-------------------

Activate the drop down list in Combo1, and select BERGS. Look in the Debug window
to see what record number you are on. Then click in the text area of Combo2 to
place your mouse pointer in it. Look in the Debug window, and you will see that
the record number has changed. Now place your mouse pointer back in Combo1, and
you will see in the Debug window that the record number has moved back to what
it was when you first made the selection in Combo1.

Scenario Number Two
-------------------

Activate the drop down list in Combo1, and move your mouse pointer down the list
until the last item in the visible list is highlighted. Without making a
selection, click in one of the text boxes on the form. Look in the Debug Window,
and you will see that the record pointer has moved. In both scenarios, if you
were to activate one of the text boxes, you would see the value of the text box
change to match what is stored in the record.
