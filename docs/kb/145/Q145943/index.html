-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 includes the StarSQL ODBC/DRDA drivers for Windows 3.x
and Windows NT client computers. The drivers allow applications that are
designed to use the ODBC interface and SQL access to databases on IBM host
computers and AS/400 without a host-based database gateway.

NOTE: SNA Server 2.11 and SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 include a single license
of the StarSQL ODBC/DRDA driver. Therefore, the driver can only be used on a
single client computer. If you want to install the driver on multiple client
computers, make sure you have a valid SNA Server Client Access License (CAL).
You can purchase additional licenses for the ODBC/DRDA driver from StarWare at
(510) 704-2000.

The SNA Server 2.11 includes the following informational ODBC files:

  ADVOPTS.TXT
  APPLICS.TXT
  DBSMVS.TXT
  HINTS.TXT
  README.TXT

SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 includes the following ODBC files:

  ADVOPTS.TXT
  APPLICS.TXT
  AS400.TXT
  CMNSRVR.TXT
  HINTS.TXT
  JAPANESE.TXT
  README.TXT

MORE INFORMATION
================

The configuration procedure of ODBC connection to an AS/400 varies. It depends
on the StarSQL driver and OS/400 version on the AS/400. The following
information is in AS400.TXT:

One Time Setup for StarSQL to AS/400
------------------------------------

The following instructions detail the latest setup procedure for StarSQL on an
IBM AS/400. On v3r05 &amp; earlier all steps must be carried out by a user with
QSECOFR authority or the equivalent. Please read all instructions carefully and
take special note of Isolation Level considerations and of differences between
installation procedures for OS/400 v3r1 and OS/400 v3r05 &amp; earlier.

StarSQL v1.05 and later:

Upon successful completion the user should be able to access all physical files
(journaled and non-journaled) on an AS/400 running any version of OS/400.

StarSQL pre-v1.05:

Upon successful completion the user should be able to access all physical files
(journaled and non-journaled) on an AS/400 running OS/400 v3r1.

NOTE: For access to journaled physical files on OS/400 v3r05 and earlier, follow
StarSQL instructions for creating a datasource which uses collections (see
"CREATING COLLECTION ON THE AS/400" IN "HINTS.TXT").

Begin Installation:

1. Create a new library (using a 5250 terminal session) where the SQL packages
  used by StarSQL will be created. This library does not need to be a SQL
  collection, but it should be accessible to all StarSQL users.

  Example:

  Create a new library STARSQL:

  "CRTLIB STARSQL" (without the quotation marks)

2. Determine the RDB (Relational Database) name of the AS/400, creating an entry
  if one does not already exist. This name will be used in Step 2 for the
  "Database Server Name" in StarSQL data source setup.

  From the AS/400 command line, work with Relational Database Directory Entries
  by typing:

  "WRKRDBDIRE" (without the quotation marks)

  Look for an entry with the value of Remote Location set to *LOCAL. If such an
  entry does not exist, create it with the 1=Add option. A suggested convention
  is to use the same name as the AS/400 system name.

3. Create a new StarSQL data source through Control Panel | ODBC Administrator
  and specify:

  Database Server Name= &lt;Database Server Name&gt; (specified in Step 2)
  Catalog Qualifier = QSYS (v3r01 and earlier) or QSYS2 (v3r1)
  Package Collection = &lt;library&gt; (created in Step 1)

  Example:
  Create a StarSQL data source:

  (v3r05 &amp; earlier)
  Catalog Qualifier = QSYS
  Package Collection = STARSQL

  (v3r1)
  Catalog Qualifier=QSYS2
  Package Collection=STARSQL

  IMPORTANT NOTE:

  Using QSYS or QSYS2 in the Catalog Qualifier field will cause the StarSQL
  driver to return a list of all physical files on the AS/400. If there are a
  large number of tables on the AS/400 you may want to use the filtering
  capability available in StarSQL version 1.04.19.19 or later. This will allow
  users to filter the table and view names returned when you retrieve a list of
  available tables (views and physical files) to what is available in a single
  AS/400 collection or library.

  To filter table and view names returned from the list, change the Catalog
  Qualifier to QSYS.library_name (v3r05 &amp; before) or QSYS2.library_name
  (v3r1).

  MSSNA 2.11 RELEASE CUSTOMERS:

  The above filtering option is not available with the version of StarSQL that
  is included in the Microsoft SNA 2.11 Release.

4. Connect to the AS/400 using the data source specified in Step 2. When you
  connect to the AS/400, SQL packages are created in the library specified in
  the data source. These packages are named QSYS and either SWRC0000, SWRU0000
  or SWNC0000 (depending on the isolation level used). Creation of the packages
  may take several minutes.

5. Grant *USE authority to PUBLIC on the packages that were created Step 4 using
  one of the following methods:
  a. From the AS/400 command line:

     WRKLIB STARSQL
     12  (work with objects)
     2  (edit authority on each object one at a time)
     change PUBLIC *EXCLUDE to PUBLIC *USE

  b. Use the GRTOBJAUT command (using a 5250 terminal session) to grant *USE
     authority for the library and execute authority for the packages to all
     StarSQL users.

     Example:

     GRTOBJAUT OBJ(STARSQL) OBJTYPE(*LIB) USER(*PUBLIC) AUT(*USE)
     GRTOBJAUT OBJ(STARSQL/*ALL) OBJTYPE(*ALL) USER(*PUBLIC)
     AUT(*USE)

  c. Use SQL/400 or SQL commands sent from an ODBC-enabled application:

  "GRANT EXECUTE ON PACKAGE STARSQL/QSYS, STARSQL/SWRC0000 TO PUBLIC" (without
  the quotation marks)

ACCESSING NON-JOURNALED PHYSICAL FILES ON OS/400 V3R1 (PRE-STARSQL V1.05):

To access non-journaled physical files on OS/400 v3r1, edit WINDOWS\ODBC.INI (16
bit) or NT Registry (32 bit). Add the following to the StarSQL data source
description:

  IsolationLevel=0

Example:

For WINDOWS or WFW (16bit):

  [STARSQL]
  Driver=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\swodbc16.dll
  Description=example for v3r1
  Server=RDBELLE
  CatQual=QSYS2
  PkgColId=STARSQL
  Netlib=SWWAPPC.DLL
  ReadOnly=No
  LocalLU=SISYPHUS
  RemoteLU=ELLE
  ModeName=QPCSUPP
  AutoTypDefNam=QTDSQL400
  AutoTypDefOvr=37,0,0
  UID=PETER
  IsolationLevel=0

For Windows NT (32 bit):

The NT registry is found in WINNT35\SYSTEM32\REGEDT32.EXE. To edit data sources,
go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER. On Local Machine, go to SOFTWARE | ODBC | ODBC.INI |
&lt;data source name&gt;. Highlight the appropriate StarSQL data source name. To
add IsolationLevel:

Go to EDIT | Add Value. Enter "IsolationLevel" with a Data Type of REG_SZ. Select
OK, then Enter, and add the appropriate number (0) for the Value.
