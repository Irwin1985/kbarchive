ANSWERS
-------

1. Good job! The loggerhead sea turtle has been around for millions of years,
  and we should make sure it sticks around for a lot longer!

2. There's no fooling you! The brown pelican dumps the water out of its pouch,
  leaving only the fish inside!

3. That's right! If you want to take a shell for a ride, make sure that
  nothing's still inside!

4. Right you are! A daisy brittle star can cast off an arm when it's attacked.
  If the brittle star manages to escape, it grows its arm back!

5. Good sleuthing! Rockweeds are designed to be able to lose almost all of their
  water and still recover completely when the tide comes back in.

6. Exactly! The algin produced by kelp plants is used in foods like ice cream to
  keep them smooth.

7. Right you are! Sea anemones look like flowers, but they're really animals
  that are related to jellyfish and corals.

8. Nice work! The sea otter is an endangered species because people hunted them
  for their fur, but now federal laws protect them from hunters!

9. Great job! Garbage can kill all sorts of animals in the ocean, so let's keep
  our seas clean!

10. Nice work! The kelpfish is camouflaged. Its colors help it to blend in and
  hide among kelp plants.

11. Great work, detective! A kelp is made up of a holdfast, which keeps the kelp
  from floating away, a stipe which holds the blades, and the blades which
  soak up the sunlight!

12. Good job. You've completed an experiment showing how Kelp grows best on hard
  surfaces and in cooler waters.

13. Great job! Clownfish aren't harmed by the sea anemone and hide among the
  anemone's tentacles to protect itself from predators.

14. Bravo! The name of the algae that live inside coral polyps is
  "zooxanthellae."

15. Despite their enormous size, blue whales are unable to protect themselves
  from hunters. That's why there are now laws to protect this endangered
  species.

16. You're a super sleuth! Spinner dolphins sometimes die from getting caught in
  fishing nets meant for tuna. Let's get mom and dad to buy dolphin-safe tuna!

17. I'm impressed! The swordfish is the animal that wounds fish with its sword
  and then swallows them whole.

18. Pretty perceptive! Phytoplankton are the tiny algae that are the base of so
  many food chains.

19. Correctamundo! The ocean floor is full of nodules, which consist of valuable
  metals, like manganese and copper!

20. Good going, detective! The gulper eel can open its mouth to an almost 180
  degree angle if it needs to eat something huge.

21. That's right! The giant tube worm that lives near the deep sea vents gets
  all its food from the bacteria that live inside it.
