SUMMARY
=======

Although Visual Basic includes the SaveSetting and GetSetting functions to save
and retrieve information from the registry, these functions only operate on a
specific section of the registry, the Visual Basic and VBA Program Settings of
the HKEY_CURRENT_USER root key.

This article outlines the use of 32-bit Windows API functions, which can be used
to set and retrieve values from anywhere in the registry. The topics and
function references in this article can be generalized to program the 16-bit
registry.

The 32-bit API functions also include support for security, although an overview
of security is outside the scope of this article.

NOTE: The SaveSetting and GetSetting functions are not part of the VBA function
library. However, the sample code below still applies to 32-bit applications
that implement VBA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

General Registry Information
----------------------------

The registry is used by applications and Windows to store configuration data. It
is a replacement for the large numbers of INI files that proliferated on Windows
3.x machines and is also used heavily by OLE.

The registry is organized using a hierarchical series of keys and values
resembling a tree. Each key, beginning with one of the six predefined root keys,
can have sub-keys and values associated with it. The keys are organizational and
naming units and appear in the Windows Registry Editors as file folders. Values
are data entries and appear as text entries in the right pane of the Registry
Editor window. Keys need not have any associated values, but may have many. Each
value has an associated data type. The two most commonly used registry data
types are REG_SZ, a null-terminated string; and REG_DWORD, a 32-bit number.

The basic process used to write or read from a location in the registry is the
same. To reference any given key or value, you must have a handle to the key.
Once this handle is obtained, values and sub-keys of the key that this handle
refers to can be read, set, or listed (enumerated).

Given a location in the registry, to obtain a handle to that key, you must begin
with one of the six predefined keys (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER,
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, and HKEY_DYN_DATA) and
traverse the registry tree until the desired key is reached. User programs most
often read and write from HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. If the keys
being traversed exist already, you can use a series of calls to the RegOpenKey
or RegOpenKeyEx functions. If the keys need to be created, the RegCreateKey and
RegCreateKeyEx functions do the job.

With the handle to the desired key, the functions used to list, set, and retrieve
information can be called. In all cases, the functions with the Ex suffix will
work only on 32-bit platforms. Functions without the suffix may work on both
16-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows. Keep in mind that not all registry
functions lacking the 'Ex' suffix are functions provided for 16-bit
compatibility. The Ex suffix was only added when the capabilities of 16-bit
functions were expanded. Functions that are totally new and specific to 32-bit
platforms do not possess an Ex extension.

The RegSetValue and RegSetValueEx functions allow the settings of a value to be
modified, while RegQueryValue and RegQueryValueEx retrieve the current setting
of a value. The limitations of the non-Ex, 16-bit versions of these APIs are
very evident here. When using the 16-bit RegSetValue function there is no way to
name a value, and because of this, RegSetValue can't be used to associate more
than one value with each key. In addition, all values written with RegSetValue
have a data type of REG_SZ. These limitations are inherent with the 16-bit
Registry. RegSetValueEx allows the creation of a multiple number of values with
any available data type.

How to Write to a Specific Registry Location
--------------------------------------------

After determining what functions you will need to use for your project, copy the
relevant declares from the code at the end of this article to a basic module.
The two Visual Basic procedures included (SetValueEx and QueryValueEx) are
wrappers for the RegSetValueEx and RegQueryValueEx API functions and greatly
simplify their use. The notes below make use of these Visual Basic functions;
however, you are free to make calls directly to the API if you wish.

Creating/Modifying Keys and Values:

With the declarations and procedures available, you can create and open keys, and
add, modify, and read values. The three following sections explain how to create
a key, set or modify a value, and query a value.

Creating a New Key:

Creating a new key is as simple as using the following procedure. CreateNewKey
takes the name of the key to create, and the constant representing the
predefined key to create the key under. The call to RegCreateKeyEx doesn't take
advantage of the security mechanisms allowed, but could be modified to do so. A
discussion of Registry security is outside the scope of this article.

     Private Sub CreateNewKey (sNewKeyName As String, lPredefinedKey As Long)
         Dim hNewKey As Long         'handle to the new key
         Dim lRetVal As Long         'result of the RegCreateKeyEx function

         lRetVal = RegCreateKeyEx(lPredefinedKey, sNewKeyName, 0&amp;, _
                   vbNullString, REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, _
                   0&amp;, hNewKey, lRetVal)
         RegCloseKey (hNewKey)
     End Sub

With this procedure a call of:

     CreateNewKey "TestKey", HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

will create a key called TestKey immediately under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

Calling CreateNewKey like this:

        CreateNewKey "TestKey\SubKey1\SubKey2", HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

will create three-nested keys beginning with TestKey immediately under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER, SubKey1 subordinate to TestKey, and SubKey3 under SubKey2.

Setting/Modifying a Value:

Creating and setting a value of a specified key can be accomplished with the
following short procedure. SetKeyValue takes the key that the value will be
associated with, the name of the value, the setting of the value, and the type
of the value (the SetValueEx function only supports REG_SZ and REG_DWORD, but
this can be modified if necessary). Specifying a new value for an existing
sValueName will modify the current setting of that value.

     Private Sub SetKeyValue (sKeyName As String, sValueName As String, _
     vValueSetting As Variant, lValueType As Long)
         Dim lRetVal As Long         'result of the SetValueEx function
         Dim hKey As Long         'handle of open key

         'open the specified key
         lRetVal = RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, sKeyName, 0, _
                                   KEY_SET_VALUE, hKey)
         lRetVal = SetValueEx(hKey, sValueName, lValueType, vValueSetting)
         RegCloseKey (hKey)
     End Sub

A call of:

     SetKeyValue "TestKey\SubKey1", "StringValue", "Hello", REG_SZ

will create a value of type REG_SZ called "StringValue" with the setting of
"Hello." This value will be associated with the key SubKey1 of "TestKey."

In this case, "TestKey" is a subkey of HKEY_CURRENT_USER, but this can be
modified by changing the call to RegOpenKeyEx. This call will fail if
"TestKey\SubKey1" does not exist. To avoid this problem, use a call to
RegCreateKeyEx instead of a call to RegOpenKeyEx. RegCreateKeyEx will open a
specified key if it already exists.

Querying a Value:

The next procedure can be used to ascertain the setting of an existing value.
QueryValue takes the name of the key and the name of a value associated with
that key and displays a message box with the corresponding value. It uses a call
to the QueryValueEx wrapper function defined below, that only supports REG_SZ
and REG_DWORD types.

     Private Sub QueryValue (sKeyName As String, sValueName As String)
         Dim lRetVal As Long         'result of the API functions
         Dim hKey As Long         'handle of opened key
         Dim vValue As Variant      'setting of queried value

         lRetVal = RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, sKeyName, 0, _
     KEY_QUERY_VALUE, hKey)
         lRetVal = QueryValueEx(hKey, sValueName, vValue)
         MsgBox vValue
         RegCloseKey (hKey)
     End Sub

With this procedure, a call of:

     QueryValue "TestKey\SubKey1", "StringValue"

will display a message box with the current setting of the "StringValue" value,
and assumes that "StringValue" exists in the "TestKey\SubKey1" key.

If the Value that you query does not exist then QueryValue will return an error
code of 2 - 'ERROR_BADKEY'.

Additional Notes:

The above examples use the extended 32-bit versions of the registry functions
exclusively. These functions allow more than one value to be associated with
each key. As discussed above, the 16-bit RegSetValue and RegQueryValue act on a
single value associated with the current key (which is always of the type
REG_SZ). These functions appear in the 32-bit Registry Editor with a name of
&lt;NO NAME&gt;. To set, modify, or query this special associated value, one
must use the 16-bit registry functions. Reading and writing from the registry in
a 16-bit environment is much simpler than in a 32-bit environment. The same
basic procedure is followed: open a key and get a handle and then call your
modification function with that handle, but no consideration needs to be made
for multiple associated values or for different value data types. A 16-bit
application can create and modify keys and values with the declarations of the
RegCreateKey, RegOpenKey, RegQueryValue, RegSetValue, and RegCloseKey
functions.

In some cases, there is no need for any values to be associated with a key. An
application may only need to know if a certain key or value exists, and not care
about the nature of the key's values. In a situation like this, the RegEnumKey,
RegEnumKeyEx, and RegEnumValue functions can be used to determine whether a
certain key or value exists. For more information on these functions refer to
the API Text Viewer and/or Windows API reference.
