SYMPTOMS
========

When an ActiveX Scripting host calls a method on an ActiveX Scripting engine,
such as Visual Basic Script or Java Script, from a thread other than the one
that created the engine, the call might fail with HRESULT E_FAIL or
E_UNEXPECTED.

CAUSE
=====

After an ActiveX Scripting engine has received a reference to its host by
calling the IActiveScript::SetScriptSite method, the scripting engine can no
longer accept calls from non-base threads. This happens because the scripting
engine checks the thread that makes each call and rejects any calls from
non-base threads. NOTE: The base thread is the one that called
IActiveScript::SetScriptSite.

RESOLUTION
==========

After the IActiveScript::SetScriptSite method has been called, you cannot call
scripting engine methods on non-base thread, however, there are two notable
exceptions to this rule:

- You can call the IActiveScript::InterruptScriptThread method from any thread,
  thus giving the host a chance to stop a script that has become stuck.
- You can call the IActiveScript::Clone method from any thread, thus giving the
  host the ability to set up a standard scripting engine and then replicate it
  for multiple job runs.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

ActiveX Scripting engines were designed to behave this way because a truly
free-threaded scripting engine would require that every single method in the
engine be shielded with critical sections, mutexes, or some other
synchronization method. This would result in massive overhead and slow downs.
