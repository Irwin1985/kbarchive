SUMMARY
=======

Novell GroupWise Gateway (Beta 1.01 build 3.99) connects the Novell GroupWise
5.5 Post Office to Microsoft Mail 3.x postoffices. This File Format Application
Programming Interface (FFAPI) gateway is able to transfer the GroupWise
addresses to the global address list of the MS Mail postoffice acting as the
directory synchronization (dirsync) server (DSS). It uses several files to
transfer the mail, such as Gtwcfg.exe, Mstogw.cfg, Gtwget, and Gtwput. The
GroupWise addresses are not propagated to the global address list of downstream
MS Mail postoffices, however.

This article explains the requirements and procedures to propagate the GroupWise
names to the downstream MS Mail postoffices.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Confirm that mail is flowing between the downstream postoffice and the DSS.

2. Confirm that Microsoft user's address updates are propagated successfully
  both ways.

3. Confirm that the GroupWise addresses conform to the 10 by 10 by 10 format of
  Microsoft. This information should be obtained from the manufacturer
  (http://www.novell.com).

4. In the MS Mail Admin program, on the Config menu, click Dirsync, click
  Requestor, and click Export (CDRE).

5. Then, on the Config menu, click Dirsync, click Requestor, and click Import
  (CDRI).

6. Let dirsync cycle for one night.

7. After a successful dirsync, the global address list on the downstream
  postoffice should be populated with the GroupWise users.

8. Confirm that mail is sent successfully to user names selected from the global
  address list on the downstream postoffice.

9. If these steps fail, use the IMPORT command with the following switches to
  export the addresses to a text file and then reimport them.

Command line for export to text file:

  import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -x -fgwise.txt -d&lt;m&gt;

Command line for reimport into dirsync stream:

  import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -e -fgwise.txt -d&lt;m&gt;

In the examples above, &lt;password&gt; refers to the password for the Admin mail
account, Gwise.txt is the file that contains the addresses that are exported and
imported, and &lt;m&gt; refers to the drive letter that is mapped to maildata.

This imports all addresses from the FFAPI post office and the MS Mail postoffice
that hosts the FFAPI post office into the dirsync stream.

GroupWise addresses are of the PCM type (10/10/10) and the post office is created
by dirsync with a default routing that matches the route to the DSS by default.

IMPORTANT: Check the routing to the FFAPI gateway to be sure routing is correct.
Routing should be indirect through the postoffice that hosts the FFAPI gateway
or indirect through the next hop in the path to the postoffice that hosts the
FFAPI gateway.
WARNINGS:

- Do not put Beta software in a production environment.

- This gateway is manufactured by Novell, and is not supported by Microsoft.
