SUMMARY
=======

What is the ODK IExpress Deployment Kit?
----------------------------------------

The Outlook Deploymnent Kit (ODK) IExpress Deployment Kit (IDK) method is a
modular and extensible way of using the Internet Express (IExpress) program to
generate user-specific profiles as well as rollout hotfixes or patches by
bundling all files together into one custom package. This custom package can be
executed at the end of the ODK setup, or run as a stand-alone executable.

Why use the IDK?
----------------

Administrators using the Outlook Deployment Kit need to dynamically generate
profiles and update Outlook with the various patches and hotfixes available. By
using the IDK method and the IExpress program included with the ODK,
administrators can accomplish both of these tasks during installation in one
step.

How does the IDK work?
----------------------

Administrators accomplish multiple tasks in one step by bundling program files
and patches into one self-extracting executable and then specifying the launch
order of the programs by using a custom .inf file. The programs to run are
listed in the .inf file along with any command-line switches. This way
applications can run in quiet mode or particular options can be specified. A
sample .inf is supplied with the IDK. This gives administrators more control
over deployment; they are not tied to using utilities running in the background
where environment parameters can't be easily changed. They can now generate
custom profiles and deploy several patches at one time.

Is this another utility?
------------------------

No. The IDK is not a program but a method to aid in deployment. It uses existing
utilities, such as Profgen and Newprof for profile generation. It also works
with patches, such as the Outlook Security Patch, and others. With this method
there is no code to update. In fact, the only thing that needs to be updated is
the various ways in which you can use this method.

Can I only generate profiles?
-----------------------------

No. With this method you can apply QFE hotfixes, patches available with a Service
Pack, patches downloaded from the Web, replace .dll files, or install full
applications.

Can I install a program that contains its own Setup?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes. Use of a batch file which would require extensive modification to allow for
a complex setup routine is not necessary. The IDK can use a command-line switch
placed at the end of the Setup.exe line to wait until the running Setup
completes before continuing. This correct syntax would be: "setup.exe -SMS"
(without the quotation marks).

Does it only work with Outlook and the ODK?
-------------------------------------------

No. The IDK methodology can be used to generate a self-extracting stand-alone
executable, which can accomplish the above tasks for almost any application.
Your update could then be emailed to users, deployed through Systems Management
Server, used in logon scripts, and so on.

What is included with the IDK?

The IExpress Deployment Kit contains all the files and Knowledge Base articles
necessary to guide you through:

Steps for the creation of an IExpress package:

Steps and a sample .inf file to cleanly generate profiles with user specific settings:

Steps and filenames for applying the patches available for Outlook:

  Odk.inf file

Steps on how to correctly extract and run other Setup programs:

  Examples in the Odk.inf file

Instructions for adding your package to the ODK for easy deployment:

A fix for the "Out of Memory or System Resources" error when creating new journal items that can sometimes happen after installing Outlook with the ODK:

  Q190495 OL98: ErrMsg: Out of Memory or System Resources

Profile Designer (Designer.exe):

  Profile Designer is a graphical utility to help in the generation of the
  custom package needed for a user specific profile. The utility can generate a
  custom .prf file with specific services and Outlook settings. It can generate
  an .inf file to be used as a building block for building a custom package. It
  can create the whole self-extracting archive with the click of a button. This
  will eliminate the need to completely understand .inf and .prf files if all
  you wish to do is make a custom profile package.
