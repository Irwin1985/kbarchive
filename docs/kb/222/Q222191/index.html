-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Two new performance monitor counters for Exchange Server have been added. The
new counters are found in Performance Monitor on the Edit menu by clicking Add
to Chart, and selecting MSExchangeDS in the Object drop-down list. They are
listed as:

- Incoming Inter-Site Replication Updates/sec

- Outgoing Inter-Site Replication Messages/sec

These counters show replication activity between sites. This activity would
normally be monitored on bridgehead Exchange Server computers.

The Incoming Inter-Site Replication Updates/sec counter monitors updates as they
are being applied to the directory. The Outgoing Inter-Site Replication
Messages/sec counter reflects replication messages sent from one site to other
sites. A single message can contain more than one directory object to be
updated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the new counters, the old counters must be unloaded, new files copied
onto the system, and the new counters loaded.

The following batch file can be used to install the counters. Modify the file to
reflect the paths to the Exchsrvr\Bin folder and the location of the new files.
The steps can also be run manually from the command prompt.

NOTE: The Exchange Server computer must be version 5.5 with Service Pack 2
installed.

Possible Batch File
-------------------

  REM use a Windows NT account that is allowed to "act as part of the operating system"
  REM put the new files in a directory called c:\dsactr
  REM stop Exchange services

  cd c:\exchsrvr\bin

  unlodctr MSExchangeDS

  ren c:\exchsrvr\bin\dsactrs.ini dsactrs.SP2.ini
  ren c:\exchsrvr\bin\dsamain.exe dsamain.sp2.exe
  ren c:\exchsrvr\bin\perfdsa.dll perfdsa.sp2.dll
  ren c:\exchsrvr\bin\dsactrnm.h dsactrnm.sp2.h

  copy c:\dsactr\dsactrs.ini c:\exchsrvr\bin
  copy c:\dsactr\dsamain.exe c:\exchsrvr\bin
  copy c:\dsactr\perfdsa.dll c:\exchsrvr\bin
  copy c:\dsactr\dsactrnm.h c:\exchsrvr\bin

  cd c:\exchsrvr\bin
  lodctr dsactrs.ini
