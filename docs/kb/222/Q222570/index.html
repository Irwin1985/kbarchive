The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

The Lotus Notes mail system is based on several databases, some of which are
specialized. The Microsoft Exchange Notes Connector interfaces with the
following files: Names.nsf, Mail.box, Exchange.bad, Exchange.box, Exchange.nsf,
and any replicated Names.nsf file for other Notes domains.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Notes Connector account needs the following access rights to
perform the actions necessary for it to work:

- In Names.nsf, the Connector account needs Read rights to be able to read the
  Notes mail address information so it can pull the Notes custom recipient
  information to Exchange Server. If you perform directory synchronization
  (dirsync) with that database, you need Manager rights with Delete rights. But
  it is better, simpler, and safer to run dirsync with a specific database such
  as Exchange.nsf, because Names.nsf is the primary Notes database.

- In Mail.box, the Connector account needs Deposit right to be able to drop
  mail messages and to perform the database maintenance operations.

- In Exchange.bad, you need Manager rights with Delete rights to be able to
  move bad mail to this database and to run database maintenance operations.

- In Exchange.box, you need Manager rights with Delete rights to pick up mail
  from this database and to run database maintenance operations.

- In Exchange.nsf, you need Manager rights with Delete rights to deliver and
  write the Exchange Server custom recipient address information and to run the
  database maintenance operations.

NOTE: The other Notes domain-replicated database will have an
administrator-specified name because in Notes, only one Names.ncf file can exist
and it is reserved for the local Notes system.
