The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you right-click a Word document in the Open dialog box (click Open on the
File menu) and then click Print on the shortcut menu, the Print dialog box does
not appear and you are unable to select which document property to print.

  -or-

When you select a Word document in the Open dialog box (click Open on the File
menu) and then click Print from the Commands And Settings button, the Print
dialog box does not appear and you are unable to select which document property
to print.

NOTE: This functionality is different from that in Word for Windows 95. When you
click Print on the shortcut menu (or click Print from the Commands And Settings
button), the Print dialog box does appear and you can select which document
property you want to print from the Print What box. (For example, you can select
to print Key Assignments.)

NOTE: The information in the Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Help file was not
changed to reflect the change in functionality and is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design. The right-click and print functions were
changed in Word 97 to be consistent with other Windows programs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To select which document property to print, follow these steps:

1. Open your Word document.

2. On the File menu, click Print.

3. In the Print dialog box, in the Print What box, select which document
  property you want to print, and then click OK.

  For example, if you want to print the Key Assignments for your document, in
  the Print What box, select Key Assignments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you click Print on the File menu, you can select which document property
information of your document you want to print.

For example, in the Print dialog box, in the Print What box, you can choose to
print Document Properties, Comments, Styles, AutoText entries, or Key
Assignments.

NOTE: If you select anything other than Document in the Print What box, the
document will not print.

The information in the Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Help file was not changed to
reflect the change in functionality. To see the incorrect information about
printing document properties, click the Office Assistant, type "print document
information," click Search, click the topic "Print property information or other
document information" and then click to view "Print property information for
several documents at once."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
