The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs in a situation where a distribution list is created on a
server. On the Advanced tab of its properties in the Exchange Server
Administrator program, the Report to Message Originator checkbox is cleared. The
membership of the distribution list consists of users on this server and other
servers.

A message is now sent to the distribution list with a request for read receipts
and/or delivery receipts. The expected behavior is that no read receipts and/or
delivery receipts from individual recipients will be generated. However, if the
recipient is located on a server other than the originating server, a read or
delivery receipt is generated.

CAUSE
=====

When the mail is sent to a DL (the PRIV_DL_REPORT_TO_ORIG bit of which is off)
on Server1 that has recipients on both Server1 and Server2 with Read/Delivery
Receipts requested, the message is transferred to Server2, with the
PR_DL_REPORT_FLAGS preserved on the envelope. However, the store on the
receiving end fails to suppress reports based on the flags. Consequently the
store delivers to recipients on Server2 and emits Read/Delivery Receipts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
