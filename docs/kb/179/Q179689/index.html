SUMMARY
=======

This sample provides a generic technique to hook into:

- The IUnknown members of the interfaces implemented by a CCmdTarget- derived
  COM object that is not an aggregate.

- The members of the inner IUnknown of a CCmdTarget-derived COM object that is
  created as an aggregated object.

By hooking into the IUnknown members of a COM object, useful debug information,
such as the current reference of the object when it changes, and the symbolic
names of the object's interfaces that are queried for, can be determined. Also,
the hook gives the flexibility to control what interfaces of an object can be
made available to other applications. The more information section details the
use of this functionality with an example.

This sample applies the hooking technique to an OLE control generated using
ControlWizard. However, note that the same hooking technique could be applied to
any CCmdTarget-derived COM object that provides one or more interface
implementation(s).

In MFC, when a COM object instance is created in the implementation of
IClassFactory::CreateInstance, the component pieces (that is, the aggregates) of
this object, if any, are created by calling the virtual function
CCmdTarget::OnCreateAggregates. The default implementation of OnCreateAggregates
provided in CCmdTarget does nothing by returning TRUE.

In COM, an object that is aggregated to an outer object stores the latter's
IUnknown, which is called as the outer unknown or the controlling unknown. This
is done so that the inner object can delegate all the IUnknown calls from its
own interfaces to this outer unknown. MFC stores this controlling unknown for an
object in a public member variable of CCmdTarget called "m_pOuterUnknown".

An object that is not aggregated by any other outer object has the above variable
set to NULL, implying that the controlling unknown for this object is the same
as its own IUnknown. This concept of outer unknowns being NULL for an object
that isn't aggregated can be used to hook in to its IUnknown functions. This can
be accomplished by replacing the object's IUnknown implementation with a custom
implementation. This custom implementation (for example, IUnknownHook) can be
made to provide more debug information by displaying the object's current
reference count whenever it changes, by displaying the symbolic names of the
object's interfaces that are queried for, and so on. In addition, the IUnknown
hook can be used to control what interfaces of an object are accessible from
other applications.

This sample illustrates the above hooking technique by applying it to an OLE
control generated using the ControlWizard. Installing the hook to an OLE control
gives access to the IUnknown implementation for all of its interfaces when it is
not created as an aggregate, and to the control's inner IUnknown implementation
when it is created as an aggregate.

The sample retrieves the symbolic name of the control's interfaces by calling
AfxGetIIDString, which is an undocumented MFC function. Also, the sample
replaces CInnerUnknown, which provides the implementation for the inner IUnknown
when an object is created as an aggregate, with CMyInnerUnknown in order to gain
access to the inner IUnknown implementation.

Finally, the sample also demonstrates the use of this hook to control interfaces
that are not accessible from outside by returning E_NOINTERFACE from
IUnknownHook::QueryInterface. For example, if an OLE control wants to use
IPersistStorage for storing its persistence information, it can choose not to
expose IPersistStreamInit and IPersistMemory by returning E_NOINTERFACE for the
latter two interfaces. Note that the above example assumes that control
container uses one of these interfaces for storing the control's persistence
information: IPersistMemory, IPersistStreamInit, or IPersistStorage.
