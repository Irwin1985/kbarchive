The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Despooler log shows:

     Cannot find the package file. we'll fail the job (Job ID = M020002D1
     Package ID = W_M0200024)
     CDeltaSource: InitDeltaFile - couldn't get file name
     CDeltaSource: AddObjectAndDeliver - couldn't initialize Delta file
     Despooler failed to execute the instruction, error code = C000000b

If new Run Command on Workstation jobs are sent after this Despooler error is
logged, they fail at the Scheduler level and the Scheduler log displays the
following message:

  ERROR: Cannot connect to secondary source. Scheduler will not attempt to
  transfer jobs from secondary to primary source.

No Run Command on Workstation or Share Package on Server jobs are able to get
past the Scheduler.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the logon (Sender) account specified does not have
permissions on the Site.srv\Despoolr.box\Receive directory (that is, the
SMS_SITE share) of the Systems Management Server site server. You can check the
permissions by opening the Site Properties, clicking Addresses, and then
clicking Properties (of the local site code), and finally clicking Details.

If a Sender Service is configured to use an account that is not the same as the
Systems Management Server service account, then the security context of this
Sender Service account is used by some other Systems Management Server
subservices of the SMS Executive program.

If this Sender account does not have permissions on the SMS_SITE share, then the
Scheduler and the Despooler services stop working.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Logon (Sender) Account is used by the Sender to connect to the SMS_SITE
share of the Systems Management Server site server and must have Full Control
permissions for the SMS_SITE share. The account must also have Read and Write
permissions for the Site.srv\Despoolr.box\Receive directory on the site server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Sender Account that the site uses to connect to itself should usually be the
same as the SMS service account for that site, but you can use a different
Sender Account to connect to other sites in the hierarchy.

IMPORTANT: If you change the Systems Management Server Service Account using
Systems Management Server Setup, the Sender Accounts are not changed. To
successfully change the permissions, you must manually change the Sender
Accounts in the Site Properties of the Systems Management Server site server.
