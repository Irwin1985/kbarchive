IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the updated TCP/IP printing components that are available
in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3). There are two new registry entries that
allow line printer remote (LPR) to use any available port higher than 1,023.
With these entries, LPR is no longer restricted to only using the 11 TCP Ports
(721 through 731) and will not conflict with reserved ports, even on very busy
print servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TCP/IP printing (LPR) in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and earlier
defaults to using TCP ports 512-1,023. In Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, LPR
defaults to using TCP ports 721-731, as described in RFC 1179 (Windows NT 3.51
Service Pack 4 and earlier versions). In addition, LPR in Service Pack 3 is now
configurable through two registry entries, that enable the use of TCP ports
1,024 and greater.

For information on setting LPR printers to be RFC compliant, please see the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q141708 Printing to LPD Printer Is Slow or Fails with Windows NT

Method 1
--------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

In Service Pack 3, a new registry entry is automatically generated when a new LPR
port is created. This setting is defined on a per printer port basis and
defaults to 0, which is RFC compliant. To enable individual IP address ports to
use TCP ports 1024 and higher, apply Service Pack 3 and then use the following
steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\LPDSVC\lpr

2. If the following value exists, double-click the entry. If the value does not
  already exist, on the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then type the following
  information:

  Value Name: &lt;IP address of LPR printer port&gt;
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Value : 0 or 1
  Value Type: Binary
  0 = uses ports 721-731 (default)
  1 = uses any port &gt;1024

3. Restart the Spooler service for the changes to take affect. At an MS-DOS
  command prompt type "net stop spooler" (without the quotation marks). To
  restart the Spooler service, at an MS-DOS command prompt type "net start
  spooler" (without the quotation marks).

Method 2
--------

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) and later enables a new registry value,
UseNonRFCSourcePorts, to configure LPR printers to use TCP ports higher than
1,024 with one registry entry that will incorporate a global change. Use this
method on print servers that have a large number of LPR ports.

NOTE: If all LPR ports were created prior to applying SP4 or later, an individual
port entry exists in the registry for all LPR ports. These individual ports take
precedence over the global entry, UseNonRFCSourcePorts, so these individual
ports must be deleted from the registry before the UseNonRFCSourcePorts global
setting will work for all LPR ports. The step-by-step instructions below will go
through removing these individual entries and adding the new entry.

Obtain and apply SP4 or later, and then use the following steps to enable this
new registry key:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\LPDSVC\lpr

2. On the Registry menu, click Save Key and type a filename.

3. Delete the Lpr key to remove all of the individual IP address entries.

4. Select the LPDSVC key.

5. On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and then in the Key Name box, type "lpr"
  (without the quotation marks).

6. Select the newly created Lpr key.

7. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then type the following information:

  Value Name: UseNonRFCSourcePorts
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 0 or 1
  Value Type: Binary
  0 = uses ports 721-731 (default)
  1 = uses any port &gt;1024

NOTE: SP4 or later must be applied prior to restarting the Spooler in step 8. If
you do not apply SP4 or later before you restart the Spooler, the individual
port entries are automatically recreated.

1. Restart the Spooler service for the changes to take affect. At an MS-DOS
  command prompt type "net stop spooler" (without the quotation marks). To
  restart the Spooler service, at an MS-DOS command prompt type "net start
  spooler" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

In addition, you can use UseNonRFCSourcePorts in conjunction with the individual
port keys to specify an exception scenario where a specific LPR port needs to be
RFC compliant. After adding the UseNonRFCSourcePorts entry, create an individual
IP address port using method 1, setting the default for that port back to 0.

If you create or have LPR ports and start the spooler service with SP3, a
registry entry is created for each LPR port with a default value of 0. This is
"RFC 1179" compliant. Changing this value to 1 makes it non "RFC 1179" compliant
and allows for port usage 1024 or above.

If you then apply SP4 or later, the registry values have already been created and
need to be reviewed in the case that you delete them and use server-wide
settings. Adding new ports after SP4 or later does not automatically create
port-specific entries.

With SP4 or later installed, UseNonRFCSourcePorts sets the RFC 1179 compliance to
0 (721-731) and off to 1(&gt;1023). However, entries for individual printers are
exceptions to this rule.

Windows 2000:

Windows 2000 includes an improved port monitor that accomplishes the same results
as making the registry changes noted above. The Microsoft Standard Port Monitor
(SPM) allows for more dynamic IP printing. SPM uses port 9100 by default, but
uses non-RFC source port LPR (ports greater than 1024) as a fallback.

If you have upgraded to Windows 2000 from an earlier version of Windows NT, you
can convert your existing LPR ports to the SPM by running the Portconv.vbs tool
located in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit. Note that the supporting documentation
for this is located in the Prnadmin.doc file.

For additional information about SPM please see Windows 2000 Help, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q246868 TCP/IP Printing Options in Windows 2000 Standard Port Monitor

LPR:
LPR Ports can be configured on a Windows 2000 Server after Print Services for
Unix has been installed in the Other Network File and Print Services section of
the Add/Remove Windows Components wizard in Add/Remove Programs. If you are
configuring a LPR port (not a Standard TCP/IP Port), this port will default to
the LPR RFC Source and Destination ports (TCP:721-731, TCP:515). Both of the
registry keys discussed in this article work in Windows 2000 and can be used
seperately or together to set LPR ports to use RFC or non-RFC source ports for
the whole spooler or just individual LPR ports.

Standard TCP/IP Port: Windows 2000 includes an improved port monitor that
communicates with a print server device like a JetDirect card over Source Ports
&gt;1024 and the destination port 9100. The Microsoft Standard Port Monitor
(SPM) allows for more dynamic IP printing. Though SPM uses Destination Port 9100
by default it will change down to Destionation Port 515 if configured to do so,
or if the target device will not support Destination Port 9100.

If you have upgraded to Windows 2000 from an earlier version of Windows NT, you
can convert your existing LPR ports to the SPM by running the Portconv.vbs tool
located in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit. Note that the supporting documentation
for this is located in the Prnadmin.doc file.

NOTE: AIX may randomly stop printing to Windows 2000 Line Printer Daemon (LPD).
This issue occurs because AIX 4.3.3 patch level 8 is not RFC1179-compliant. For
AIX to print to Windows 2000 LPD, create the following registry value:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\LPDSVC\lpr

  Value name: UseNonRFCSourcePorts
  Value Data: 1

Network (WAN), click the article number below to view the article in the
