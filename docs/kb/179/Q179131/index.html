The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) client workstation and you
save a Microsoft Office document (such as a Microsoft Word document), the
document may be saved in the temporary folder.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you open a Microsoft Office document that you have
received as an attachment to an e-mail message, and then save the document. The
document is saved to the temporary folder by default.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Microsoft Office program that opens the attached document, the temporary
folder becomes the folder in which documents are saved by default until you quit
the program. If you want to reopen a document you have saved in the temporary
folder, click Open on the File menu, and then type the complete path to the
document in the File Name box. For example, to open the Test.doc file located in
the C:\Temp folder, type the following path in the File Name box:

  c:\temp\test.doc

You may also be able to open the document using the Documents menu. The Documents
menu lists the documents you have used recently. To view the Documents menu,
click Start, and then point to Documents.

ZAK client workstations are not restricted from creating or modifying files in
the temporary folder because many programs, including Microsoft Office, do not
function properly if the temporary folder is restricted. However, you are not
able to view the temporary folder in Windows NT Explorer or My Computer. On a
ZAK client workstation, the default temporary folder is C:\Temp.
