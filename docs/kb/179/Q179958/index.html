The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Already Verified Authentication option is specified on the Security tab of
the COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) Remote Environment (RE) Properties dialog
box.

Under certain circumstances when you select that option, only a user ID is sent
to the mainframe; no password is sent. The mainframe determines that this user
ID has already been authenticated and does not require a password. This is
possible when COMTI uses Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) package credentials
or Windows NT user credentials for authentication.

However, if the COMTI security override is being used instead, the transport
always insists on having both the user ID and the password. Both are sent to the
host. If the Already Verified Authentication indicator is set on the RE, it is
ignored in this case.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Rationale for Using "Already Verified Authentication"
-----------------------------------------------------

When using integrated host security with MTS package credentials or Windows NT
user credentials, mainframe credentials cannot be ascertained by COMTI or the
client application.

COMTI and SNA Server act as a trusted entity, verifying the user's identity
first. Therefore, there is no need to send a password to the mainframe, which
would waste more cycles to check it on the mainframe side.

Rationale for Ignoring "Already Verified Authentication" When Using COMTI

Security Override
-----------------

In this case, COMTI has direct access to the mainframe credentials. If COMTI
would send only the user ID, an application could easily guess at one or another
user ID, because user IDs are similar in most installations. Without having to
know a password, the application could do things on the mainframe using the
pilfered user ID.

Identify security (ATTACHSEC=IDENTIFY in the CICS Connection definition) implies
that the local logical unit (LU) on the computer has already verified the
identity of the user, so the host can trust you. However, in the case of the
application override, that is not true; COMTI is unable to determine who the
user is.
