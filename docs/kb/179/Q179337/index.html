SYMPTOMS
========

When you record a macro that does the following:

- Inserts a Next Page section break.

  -and-

- Turns off Same As Previous for the header or footer in the newly created
  section (on the Header/Footer toolbar click Same As Previous).

the macro appears to record correctly; however, when you play back the recorded
macro, Same As Previous may still be on for the header or footer in the new
section.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro inserts a Next
Page section break, and turns off Same As Previous for the header in the new
section:

     Sub InsertSectionTurnOffSameAsPrevious()
        Dim hHeader As HeaderFooter
        Dim iSection As Integer
        ' Insert Next Page Section Break.
        Selection.InsertBreak Type:=wdSectionBreakNextPage
        ' Get current section number.
        iSection = Selection.Information(wdActiveEndSectionNumber)
        ' For each Header type in the current section,
        ' turn off Same As Previous.
        For Each hHeader In ActiveDocument.Sections(iSection).Headers
           hHeader.LinkToPrevious = False
        Next hHeader
     End Sub

The following sample macro turns off Same As Previous for all headers and footers
in the document.

     Sub TurnOffSameAsPrevious()
        ' Create variables.
        Dim sSection As Section
        Dim hfHeaderFooter As HeaderFooter
        ' Go to each section in the document.
        For Each sSection In ActiveDocument.Sections
           ' Turn off "Same As Previous" in all Headers.
           For Each hfHeaderFooter In sSection.Headers
              hfHeaderFooter.LinkToPrevious = False
           Next
           ' Turns off "Same As Previous" in all Footers.
           For Each hfHeaderFooter In sSection.Footers
              hfHeaderFooter.LinkToPrevious = False
           Next
        Next sSection
     End Sub
