-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An ActiveX control is created using Visual Basic and compiled into an OCX file.
The compiled OCX is then referenced in a Visual Basic standard EXE project. When
the standard EXE project is run in the IDE, tabbing between the controls on the
form and the ActiveX control results in a beep and the focus does not change.
This problem occurs after the ActiveX control has shown a modal form.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem only occurs when a project in the IDE references the compiled OCX;
the problem does not occur when the project is made into an EXE.

To work around this problem, create a project group and reference the ActiveX
control from the ActiveX control project. Reference the compiled version of the
ActiveX control just before you compile your Visual Basic project.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This section show you how to create a sample project that demonstrates this
behavior.

Steps to Create the ActiveX control
-----------------------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic. UserControl1 is created
  by default.

2. Add a textbox to UserControl1.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of UserControl1:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Text1_DblClick()
           Form1.Show vbModal
        End Sub

4. Add a form to the ActiveX control project.

5. Add a CommandButton to Form1. Copy the following code to the Code window of
  Form1:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Unload Me
        End Sub

6. Change the Project name to "TestControl" and select the File/Make
  TestControl.ocx menu option to create TestControl.ocx. After creating the
  control, save and close the project.

You are done creating the ActiveX control. The next section shows you how to
create the Standard EXE project that uses the ActiveX control you just created.

Steps to Create Standard EXE Project
------------------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add an MDI Form to the project.

3. Set the MDIChild property of Form1 to True.

4. Reference the ActiveX control you compiled in the previous section by
  completing the following steps:

  a. From the Project menu, click Components. The Components dialog box
     displays.

  b. Select the Controls Tab. Check TestControl in the list box.

  c. Click OK to close the Components dialog box.

5. Add two instances of the TestControl ActiveX control to Form1. Position the
  two ActiveX controls so both controls are visible on the form.

6. On the Run menu, click Start, or press the F5 key to start the program.

  a. Press the Tab key to change the focus between the two controls.

  b. Double-click the text box on one of the TestControl ActiveX controls.
     Form1 appears. Click the CommandButton to close the form.

  c. Set the focus to one of the TestControl ActiveX controls.

     RESULTS: Pressing the Tab key results in a beep and the focus does not
     change.

The next section shows how to work around this bug using the projects you created
in the previous sections.

Workaround
----------

1. Open the ActiveX control project you used to create the ActiveX control.

2. From the File menu, click Add Project to add a standard EXE project. Form1 is
  created by default. Set the MDIChild property of Form1 to true.

3. Close the ActiveX control project. Note than an ActiveX control is added to
  the toolbar.

4. Add two instances of the ActiveX control to Form1. Position the two ActiveX
  controls so both controls are visible on the form.

5. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program.

  a. Press the Tab key to change the focus between the two controls.

  b. Double-click the text box on one of the TestControl ActiveX controls. A
     form is displayed. Click the CommandButton to close the form.

  c. Set the focus to one of the TestControl ActiveX controls.

  You can now tab between the text boxes of both ActiveX controls.
