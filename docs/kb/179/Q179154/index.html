SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to add OEM drivers to Windows NT so that the drivers
appear in the list of available drivers when using the Display tool. It also
discusses how to enable the ability to use the 'detect' button to automatically
find the appropriate driver.

This article contains two sections. The first section is how to add the drivers
so they appear in the list and can be installed manually. The second section is
how to make them appear in the list and be detectable.

To install OEM video drivers during NT unattended setup, please refer to the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q166028
  TITLE : Installing 3rd-Party Video Drivers with Txtsetup.oem Unattended

This article discusses detailed editing of .inf files supplied on the Windows NT
installation CD. While in depth knowledge of .inf files is not required, it is
recommended that the user should have some basic understanding of how the files
work and function. Because this involves the use and content of OEM supplied
.inf files, Microsoft cannot guarantee that every video card will work.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Section One
-----------

Adding OEM Drivers to the List:

This procedure will make the drivers appear in the list of available drivers so
that a user can install them by using the Display tool. In this example, the
Matrox Millennium II (MGA64) is used. To get the key of your OEM video adapter,
please see the manufacturers supplied OEM video .inf file and look in the
[%manufacturers%.mfg] section. For example, to get MGA64, look at the following
in the MGA64.inf file:

  [Matrox.Mfg]
  %Matrox% Millennium II = mga64
  %Matrox% Millennium = mga64
  %Matrox% Mystique = mga64

1. Copy the files and subdirectories in the I386 directory to a server share
  that the users will connect to set up Windows NT.

2. Copy the manufacturer's OEM video drivers to the this share. Put the files in
  the root of the I386 subdirectory. In this example, MGA64 consists of the
  following files:

  MGA64.dll
  MGA64.sys

3. Using the Expand.exe utility, expand the Dispoem.in_ file to Dispoem.inf.
  Rename the Dispoem.in_ file to Dispoem.sav so the setup will copy the correct
  file. This also maintains the integrity of the original file for backup
  purposes.

4. Use any text editor to edit the Dispoem.inf file and add the following:

  a. In the [DestinationDirs], add the following lines to tell the display
     routine where to copy the files.

       [DestinationDirs]
       n9i128v2.Miniport  = 12  ; drivers
       n9i128v2.Display   = 11  ; system32
       ;*****************added lines*****************
       ;mga64.Display = 11 ; again we add these sections so it knows where to copy
       ;the files
       ;mga64.Miniport = 12 ; when installing the driver.
       ;************ ends here************************
       

  b. In the next section, just copy the manufacturer's supplied .inf file
     starting from Driver information (section that begins with [Manufacturer])
     all the way down to, but not including, the Source file information
     (section beginning with [SourceDisksNames.x86]). Follow the example
     below.

       ;********* section added - just copiedMGA64.inf**********
       ;
       ; Software Installation
       ;

       [n9i128v2.SoftwareSettings]
       AddReg = n9i128v2_SoftwareDeviceSettings
       
       [n9i128v2_SoftwareDeviceSettings]
       HKR,, InstalledDisplayDrivers,     %REG_MULTI_SZ%, n9i128v2
       HKR,, VgaCompatible,               %REG_DWORD%,    0
       
       ;
       ; Driver information
       ;

       [Manufacturer]
       %Matrox%   = Matrox.Mfg

       [Matrox.Mfg]
       %Matrox% Millennium II = mga64

       ;
       ; General installation section
       ;

       [mga64]
       CopyFiles=mga64.Miniport, mga64.Display

       ;
       ; File sections
       ;

       [mga64.Miniport]
       mga64.sys

       [mga64.Display]
       mga64.dll

       ;
       ; Service Installation
       ;

       [mga64.Services]
       AddService = mga64, 0x00000002, mga64_Service_Inst, mga64_EventLog_Inst

       [mga64_Service_Inst]
       ServiceType    = 1                  ; SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER
       StartType      = 1                  ; SERVICE_SYSTEM_START
       ErrorControl   = 0                  ; SERVICE_ERROR_IGNORE
       LoadOrderGroup = Video
       ServiceBinary  = %12%\mga64.sys

       [mga64_EventLog_Inst]
       AddReg = mga64_EventLog_AddReg

       [mga64_EventLog_AddReg]
       HKR,,EventMessageFile,0x00020000,"%SystemRoot%\System32\IoLogMsg.dll;%Syste
       mRoot%\System32\drivers\mga64.sys"  ; This should appear on one line
       HKR,,TypesSupported,0x00010001,7
       
       ;
       ; Software Installation
       ;
       
       [mga64.SoftwareSettings]
       AddReg = mga64_SoftwareDeviceSettings
       
       [mga64_SoftwareDeviceSettings]
       HKR,, InstalledDisplayDrivers,     %REG_MULTI_SZ%, mga64
       HKR,, VgaCompatible,               %REG_DWORD%,    0
       
       [mga64.OpenGLSoftwareSettings]
       
       ;*********************ends here****************************
       
       

  c. Next, add the following information in the [SourceDisksFiles] section:

       ;***************added**************************************
       mga64.sys  = 1,  ; again, just added the location at which the *.inf can
       mga64.dll = 1,  ; find the files.
       ;************ends here************************************
       

5. Save the file and start the installation. Again, this will not make the
  adapter detectable during Windows NT setup but, when installing or
  reinstalling the video drivers, the Display tool will have the selection in
  the list without having to find OEM files on a floppy disk. From the Display
  tool, select the display type; it will appear in the list. When selected, you
  will be asked for the location of the files and users can enter the network
  path of the installation location.

Section Two
-----------

Making OEM Video Detectable Through the Display Tool:

This procedure adds the OEM video driver to the Display tool and also makes it
detectable when the 'detect' button is selected. For this example, the Matrox
Millennium II (MGA64) is used.

NOTE: This option requires some detailed editing of Display.inf.

1. Copy the files and subdirectories in the I386 directory a server share that
  the users will connect to set up Windows NT.

2. Copy the manufacturer's OEM video drivers to the this share. Put the files in
  the root of the I386 subdirectory. In this example, MGA64 consists of the
  following files:

  MGA64.dll
  MGA64.sys

3. Using the Expand.exe utility, expand the Dispoem.in_ file to Dispoem.inf.
  Rename the Dispoem.in_ file to Dispoem.sav so the setup will copy the correct
  file. This also maintains the integrity of the original file for backup
  purposes.

4. Use any text editor to make the following changes and additions to the
  Display.inf file:

  a. In the [DestinationDirs] add the following lines so that the display
     routine knows where to copy the files:

        mga_mil.Display      = 11
        ;***************added*****************************
        mga64.Miniport  = 12 ; This tells setup where the files go, 11 = system, 12
        ; = system32\drivers
        mga64.Display   = 11 ; The keys actually point to [section-headers] later
        ; in the file
        ;***************ends******************************
        

  b. Below the [detect.Display] section, add the following information:

        ;***************additions begin here**********************
        [mga64.Display] ; [section-header] referred to by the first section in the
        ; file
        mga64.dll
        ;***************ends here**********************
        
        ;***************additions begin here**********************
        [mga64.Miniport] ; [section-header] referred to at beginning of file.
        mga64.sys
        ;***************ends here**********************
        

  c. The next section is called the Models section. This will display your
     adapter in the tool. Add the following information based on the
     manufacturer of your OEM video:

        [Matrox.Mfg]
         %Matrox% IMPRESSION                           = mga, MGA_COMPAT
         %Matrox% IMPRESSION PCI                       = mga
         %Matrox% IMPRESSION VLB                       = mga
         %Matrox% MILLENNIUM PCI                        = mga_mil, MGA_MIL_COMPAT
         %Matrox% MILLENNIUM 220HZ PCI                  = mga_mil
         %Matrox% ULTIMA PCI                           = mga
         %Matrox% ULTIMA VLB                           = mga
         %Matrox% ULTIMA + PCI                         = mga
         %Matrox% ULTIMA + VLB                         = mga
        ;***************additions begin here**********************
         %Matrox% Millennium II                        = mga64, MGA64_COMPAT
        ;The above line adds the name to the list of available drivers when adding
        ;a driver manually through the display applet.  The 'mga64' is the key in
        ;the registry, and the
        ;"MGA64_COMPAT" is a name used in the [detect] section and can be anyname
        ;as long as it does not contain any '-' (dashes) since they are not
        ;allowed.
        ;***************ends here**********************
        

     In the [detect.Services] section, the adapter must be added so that it
     knows to resets the value in the registry to start the next time it start,
     therefore making it detectable.

        [detect.Services]
        mga         = MGA_COMPAT
        mga_mil     = MGA_MIL_COMPAT
        mga         = MGA_COMPAT
        mga_mil     = MGA_MIL_COMPAT
        ;***************added*****************************
        mga64       = MGA64_COMPAT
        ; must match what is in the %matrox% section so
        ; that detection will work when
        ; selecting 'detect display' in
        ; display applet.
        ;***************ends******************************
        

     This solution requires two steps. Because this sections sets all the
     registry keys noted above in HKLM\system\Currentcontrolset\services, the
     key for the OEM video driver must exist. If the video card has never been
     started, the key must be added to the registry using Regedit.exe. To get
     the correct file, install the adapter to another computer manually, and
     then change the display to VGA. This will set up the key like the other
     video keys so it can be ported over to the new installations.

     After the system starts into VGA mode, use Regedit to export the OEM video
     key. In this example, exporting the Mga64 key created the following .reg
     file:

        REGEDIT4
        
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\mga64]
        "Type"=dword:00000001
        "Start"=dword:00000004
        "ErrorControl"=dword:00000000
        "Group"="Video"
        
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\mga64\Device0]
        "InstalledDisplayDrivers"=hex(7):6d,67,61,36,34,00,00
        "VgaCompatible"=dword:00000000
        

  d. Next, add the installation information for the OEM video in the next
     section, which is the driver section. This information will come directly
     from the OEM supplied .inf file. Depending on the .inf file, it may be in
     a different order. Please follow one of the Microsoft supplied video
     drivers in the Display.inf file as a guide, or the example below:

        ;**************additions start here********************
        ; mga64 Driver Section
        ; This section installs the driver.  All the information was pulled from ;
        ; the manufacturers
        ; *.inf file.  Just follow an example of one of the existing cards in the
        ; display.inf.
        
        [mga64]
        CopyFiles=mga64.Miniport, mga64.Display
        
        ; mga_mil-II Software section
        
        [mga64.SoftwareSettings]
        AddReg = mga64_SoftwareDeviceSettings
        
        ; Service Installation
        
        [mga64.Services]
        AddService = mga64, 0x00000002, mga64_Service_Inst, mga64_EventLog_Inst
        
        [mga64_Service_Inst]
        ServiceType    = 1                  ; SERVICE_KERNEL_DRIVER
        StartType      = 1                  ; SERVICE_SYSTEM_START
        ErrorControl   = 0                  ; SERVICE_ERROR_IGNORE
        LoadOrderGroup = Video
        ServiceBinary  = %12%\mga64.sys
        
        [mga64_EventLog_Inst]
        AddReg = mga64_EventLog_AddReg
        
        [mga64_EventLog_AddReg]
        HKR,,EventMessageFile,0x00020000,"%SystemRoot%\System32\IoLogMsg.dll;
        %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\mga64.sys"
        HKR,,TypesSupported,0x00010001,7
        
        ;******************ends here****************
        

  e. In the display driver registry entries section, add the following based on
     your OEM supplied video card.

        ;***************additions begin here**********************
        [mga64_SoftwareDeviceSettings]
        HKR,, InstalledDisplayDrivers,     %REG_MULTI_SZ%, mga64
        HKR,, VgaCompatible,               %REG_DWORD%,    0
        ; This section reffered to by the MGA64 section that installs the video ;
        driver
        ;***************ends here**********************
        

  f. In the [detect.Display] section, add the OEM supplied .dll file so it
     knows what file to copy:

        cirrus.dll
        framebuf.dll
        mga.dll
        ;***************additions begin here**********************
        mga64.dll
        ; entry needed so that the files are copied over when trying to
        ;"detect" the display using the display applet.
        ; The same entry must exist for the mini-
        ; port file (*.sys)
        ;***************ends here**********************
        

     Do the same for the OEM supplied .sys file:

        [detect.Miniport]
        ati.sys
        cirrus.sys
        dell_dgx.sys
        et4000.sys
        mga.sys
        mga_mil.sys
        ;***************added **********************
        mga64.sys   ; again needed for manual detection of video cards.
        ;***************ends **********************
        

5. Save the Display.inf file and place it back in the distribution share created
  above. Again, this only makes the adapter detectable after setup has
  completed.

6. Start the Display tool, select the 'change driver' button and then click
  'detect' to find the added display adapter. When the button is selected,
  Windows NT will prompt for the location of the I386 directory; redirect it to
  the share created in step 1. Windows NT will then copy all the video files
  over that are needed for detection and the system will restart. The system
  will restart in VGA mode but, when you log on, it will detect your display.
