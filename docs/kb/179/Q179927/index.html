SYMPTOMS
========

After you delete a Directory Replication Connector on a bridgehead server, site
objects previously associated with the deleted replication connector may not
completely disappear as expected. In particular, one of the remaining site
objects may display only a "Site-Addressing" object under "Configuration." (This
likely indicates a configuration problem originating in this "blocked" site, and
will likely need to be repaired in that site first. See RESOLUTION and MORE
INFORMATION below.)

Additionally, the Knowledge Consistency Checker may report that it failed in
removing a particular context and could not continuing processing.

With the following Directory diagnostic logging enabled

  Knowledge Consistency Checker = MAX
  Internal Processing = MIN

the following events are logged:

  1171
  Exception e0010004 has occurred with parameters -1026 and 0 (Internal ID
  2060400). Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for
  assistance.

  1214
  Couldn't remove the replica of naming context
  /O=&lt;orgname&gt;/OU=&lt;sitename&gt;/CN=Configuration from
  EX:/o=&lt;orgname&gt;/ou=&lt;sitename&gt;/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers
  /cn=&lt;servername&gt;/cn=Microsoft DSA because of error 22. Run the
  consistency checker on directory
  EX:/o=&lt;orgname&gt;/ou=&lt;sitename&gt;/cn=Configuration
  /cn=Servers/cn=&lt;servername&gt;/cn=Microsoft DSA. If this condition
  persists, stop and restart this Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  1124
  The consistency checker encountered an internal error and can't continue
  checking the consistency of this directory. Stop and restart this
  Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

CAUSE
=====

A Site-Addressing object attribute (limited to a single 4-KB page) is full of
data. In tagging the object for deletion, a 4-byte attribute must be added to
this page, but 4 bytes are not available. The Site- Addressing attribute most
likely to be this large is the Site-Proxy-Space attribute.

To verify that this is the cause:

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Administrator program in raw mode against the server failing KCC.

2. Highlight the "&lt;orgname&gt;\&lt;sitename&gt;\Configuration\Site
  Addressing" object of the context that corresponds to the naming context
  reported in the 1214 event log error.

3. Select "File, Raw properties"

4. Scroll through the listbox of "Object attributes:" and select "Site-
  proxy-space."

5. View the "Attribute values" count (to the right). It will be in the hundreds.

RESOLUTION
==========

Resolution and prevention require ensuring that none of the Exchange Server
organization site's Site-Proxy-Space attributes includes hundreds of entries.
The actual limit can vary (up to 350 or more), but the practical limit should be
less than 20. This can only be controlled within each individual site.

NOTE: The site failing KCC and the site where the problem originates are
different.

Generically, resolution requires:

1. Addressing the problem in the originating site.

2. Re-establishing replication in the site failing KCC.

3. "Pulling" a replica of the fixed object to the site failing KCC. (Pulling the
  replica should start at the site adjacent to the originating site along the
  replication path to the site failing KCC, and at each subsequent site in the
  path, ending with the site failing KCC.)

The first step to addressing the problem is to determine why hundreds of entries
exist. Either many site mailboxes include incorrect or inappropriate X.400 proxy
addresses, or some of the "general purpose" X.400 attributes within the range of
"C" through "OU4" have been implemented to define mailbox "uniqueness."

If the former case, delete or modify the X.400 proxy addresses of the mailboxes
as appropriate. For the second case, there are two options:

- Redesign the X.400 addressing scheme to use an X.400 attribute originally
  intended to insure "uniqueness" (see MORE INFORMATION below);

  -OR-

- Apply the hotfix referenced below.

Redesign the X.400 Addressing Scheme
------------------------------------

This solution is recommended because it encourages good design and implementation
by using X.400 attributes appropriately. This may benefit interoperability with
foreign X.400 systems. It is recognized that the X.400 addressing scheme may
have originated from legacy systems, and that changing the scheme is not an
option.

To apply the Hotfix
-------------------

A hotfix is available that addresses this problem (see the Status section below).
A new MTA and registry value will be available for configuring Exchange Server
to accommodate interoperability with and migration from legacy systems that were
implemented using the range of "C though OU4" X.400 attributes for address
uniqueness.

The registry value is as follows:

  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters
  Value (case sensitive):  Site Proxy Recalc Limit
  Data Type:               REG_SZ
  Data (case insensitive): &lt;one-valid-string&gt;
  (valid strings: c, a, p, o, ou1, ou2, ou3, ou4)

Adding the registry value and specifying a valid string, for instance OU2,
configures the RID to exclude all X.400 attributes beyond OU2 from the
calculation of Site-proxy-space entries. This masking mechanism may be used to
ensure that Site-Proxy-Space includes only the minimum number of entries
required for accurate local (site) mailbox routing.

Installation notes:

- Technically, the new message transfer agent (MTA) and registry value must be
  installed only on the originating site's RID server. But it is recommended
  that all site servers apply the fix, since the RID server can be changed at
  any time within Admin from any server in the site. To determine a site's
  current RID server, view: &lt;sitename&gt;, Configuration, Site Addressing,
  General, "Routing Calculation Server:" listbox.

- After applying the MTA, all Exchange Services must be restarted (because RID
  recalculation is spawned from under the System Attendant Service).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a concern for Exchange Server version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Controlling Site-Proxy-Space
----------------------------

Within each site, an additional entry is added to Site-proxy-space (by the
Routing Information Daemon [RID]) from among all the mailboxes within the site
for *every unique* X.400 address string out to and including the "OU4"
attribute.

This string could include any combination of the following X.400 attributes:

C (country), A (administrative domain), P (private domain), O (organization),
OU1, OU2, OU3, OU4 (organizational units).

Generally, it is not intended that the X.400 attributes listed above would
contain values *unique* to each X.400 address. Other values such as S (surname),
G (given name), X.121, DDA Type\Value, etc., are typically relied upon to insure
"uniqueness" of X.400 addresses.

Site-Proxy-Space values are cached at MTA startup (and refreshed as required). As
the MTA routes mail, a partial X.400 target address that matches one of these
cached values is considered to be "local to the site" - thus the MTA "expects"
to find a DN (X.500 address) that matches the recipient and "expects" to be able
to route the message locally. NOTE: this assumes the "Share address space with
other X400 system" is NOT enabled - which is the Exchange default. (This can
lead to NDRs of "one-off" mail addressed to X.400 addresses if a site mailbox
maintains an inappropriate X.400 proxy address - see Q175498).

In a default Exchange Server install, there will be a single entry for Site-
Proxy-Space. This may change as secondary X.400 proxies are added to mailboxes
within the site, or as additional mailboxes are generated via import. Most
secondary proxies are created in order to maintain interoperability with legacy
email systems, or in order to maintain migrated users' previous X.400 address
(as either the primary, or proxy) for routing purposes.
