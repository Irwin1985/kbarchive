Setup
 
Using Microsoft Plus! for Kids with Microsoft Plus! for Windows
 
If you install both products, and then remove Plus! for Windows (or the
Desktop Themes component of Plus! for Windows), the Control Panel icon
for Desktop Themes will be removed and Desktop Themes might not work in
Plus! for Kids. To restore the Control Panel icon and run Plus for Kids
Desktop Themes, run Plus! for Kids Setup again, and click Reinstall when
that option appears.
 
Installing on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
 
To install Plus! for Kids on NT 4.0, you need administrator privileges.
If you do not have administrator privileges, contact your system
administrator or the person who normally runs the computer.
 
Protect It! and Desktop Themes cannot be installed on Windows NT 4.0.
This is due to design differences between Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.
The Microsoft Network, Microsoft Demonstration program, and SurfWatch
Trial Version are not designed to run on Windows NT.
 
Removing Protect It!
 
Because Protect It! is a system component, it cannot be removed by Setup.
Although it is not recommended that you remove Protect It! (because you
will lose your computer security), complete the following steps if you
want to remove the program.
 
To remove Protect It!
 
  Start Protect It!

  Click the Set/Change button, and then making sure that none of the
  check boxes are selected in the Select Family Member Options dialog
  box.

  Click the Summary button, and then make sure that there are no green
  check marks next to options, only dotted check marks.

  Clear the Protect It! check box on the main screen of  Protect It!.

  Click the Close button.

  Follow the instructions in the Tips section of the jewel case booklet.
 
Installing Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 (Plus! for Kids Version)
 
  Place the Microsoft Plus! for Kids disc into a caddy (if required) and
  then insert it into your CD-ROM drive. The Plus! for Kids AutoPlay
  program should start.

  Click the Internet Explorer 3.02 button.

  Follow the instructions.
 
The above steps run \ie\msie302r.exe from the compact disc.
 
Note: You may also want to install a full version of Microsoft Internet
Explorer 3.02. You can run the following programs directly from the
compact disc:
 
  \ie\msie302n.exe - This is the full version of Microsoft Internet
                     Explorer for NT.
 
  \ie\msie3029.exe - This is the full version of Microsoft Internet
                     Explorer for Windows 95.
 
ClipArt
 
Sharing ClipArt
 
Creative Writer 2.0 and Plus! for Kids use the same ClipArt system. If
you install both products, you will find that the ClipArt for the two
products can be used interchangeably.
 
Desktop Themes
 
Screen Saver Hotspots Require System Agent
 
System Agent must be installed in order for you to use the mouse hotspots
in some Plus! for Kids screen savers. You can set hotspots on the General
tab of the Screen Saver settings button on the Display Control Panel
Applet. You can find the Display Control Panel in the Control Panel.
 
System Agent is a component of Microsoft Plus! for Windows, a separate
product.
 
Paint It!
 
Palettes or Colors Paint It! Uses for Your Picture
 
If you start Paint It! and create a picture in 256-color mode, Paint It!
will choose the colors that it thinks best match your picture. This may
mean that certain colors may be unavailable. If you want to use different
colors, you can either:
 
  Start Paint It! by opening the picture with the colors you want. For
  example, double-click the file mypicture.bmp.
 
-or-
 
  Click Options on the menu, and then click Edit Colors.
 
If you start Paint It! in 16-bit or 24-bit color mode, Paint It! will use
any color that you want.
 
Play It!
 
Gravis Ultrasound Classic
 
You may experience certain problems using the Gravis Ultrasound Classic
sound card with older audio drivers. Contact your supplier or Gravis for
an updated driver if you experience problems.
 
Protect It!
 
Resetting Your Password
 
If you forget your password, follow the instructions on the last page in
the Tips section of the jewel case booklet.
 
Making Your Security Tighter
 
In addition to the steps listed in Protect It! Help and the jewel case
booklet, the following steps will help you make your computer more secure.
 
  Be sure to assign a password to everyone on the system. When Protect
  It! creates a user, that user is given a blank password. You can
  easily set their password for them. You can do this by logging on as
  the user you want to set the password for. Then enter the password
  that you wish to give them. You will be asked to confirm the password
  by entering it again.

  Remove Setup programs from the Start menu and the list of allowed
  programs. Setup programs allow anyone to change the configuration of
  software. This is not always desirable.

  Remove explorer.exe from the list of programs that can be run. This
  will prevent family members from browsing the disk drives and
  potentially starting applications.

  Remove the ability to AutoPlay compact discs. See the section later in
  this document titled Interactions with AutoPlay for more information.

  Set restrictions on the .Default user. See the .Default Users section
  later in this document for more information.

  Remove items that you do not want users to set from the taskbar. For
  example, you might want to remove the volume control for an audio
  card. See the Windows Help topic "Customizing the Start Menu or
  Taskbar" for further instructions.

  Make certain that the family member does not have any desktop icons
  that give them access to undesired files or programs. If they do, they
  might be able to start these programs or remove them. To check this,
  you should log on as the family member and look at the items on their
  Windows desktop.

  Make certain that the family member does not have any documents in the
  Start Menu - Documents folder that give them access to undesired
  files. To check this, you should log on as the family member and look
  at the items on their Start menu - Documents. Protect It! does not
  restrict access to documents, only to programs.

  Restrict physical access to any MS-DOS boot diskettes.

  If a family member has Explorer running and logs on again, Explorer
  will start again. If you restrict access to Explorer for that family
  member, they must exit Explorer before logging on again.
 
".Default" User
 
You will normally see a user called ".Default" listed in Protect It!.
That's the exact name that will show up in the listing of family members
inside Protect It!. This user is automatically created by the system. The
system uses this user for two things:
 
  The first is when a family member clicks Cancel or presses the ESC key
  when logging on. The restrictions assigned to the .Default user
  determine what the family member can do. If you want to make your
  system more restrictive, assign the appropriate restrictions to the
  .Default user. A .Default user with no restrictions will allow any
  user without a proper logon to do anything they wish on your computer
  system.

  The second use for .Default user is as a template for creating new
  users. When you add a new user to Protect It!, all of the Start menu
  entries and Document entries from the .Default user are initially
  assigned to your new user. You can then customize the user's entries.
 
Default User
 
In certain cases you might find a family member named "Default". That's
the exact name that will show up in the listing of Family Members inside
Protect It!. Do not confuse the "Default" user with the ".Default" user
described in the section above. If you see the Default user, it's a good
idea to set the appropriate restrictions just in case someone tries to
logon as Default.
 
Windows Logon
 
It is recommended that you make Windows logon the Primary Network Logon.
 
To verify that the Windows logon is the Primary Network Logon:
 
  Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
  Panel.

  Double-click the Network icon.

  Click the Configuration tab.

  Check the field for Primary Network Logon.
 
Normally this should be Windows Logon. Consult your system administrator
or the person who configured your network before changing this setting.
Changing it may affect your ability to use networking or run programs
that depend on networking.
 
Interactions with AutoPlay
 
Certain compact discs are designed to start when you insert them into
your CD-ROM drive. This is called AutoPlay. If you wish to restrict this
ability, you can usually do so by removing "autorun.exe" from the list of
allowed programs. Note that this is not always the case. To be sure, open
the root level file on the disc called autorun.inf with notepad or some
other text editor. In the file you will find a line that reads:
 
  open =
 
with a filename after it.  For example
 
  open = setup\autorun.exe
 
Make sure that the filename (autorun.exe) is not included in the list of
allowed programs unless you want your family member to be able to use
AutoPlay.
 
Note: AutoRun can also be disabled on a case-by-case basis by holding
down the SHIFT key while inserting the compact disc.
 
Using Internet Ratings Settings
 
To use the Internet Ratings setting for all family members, you must
install Internet Explorer (IE) version 3.0, or higher, or another browser
that uses the Microsoft Ratings System. To install IE 3.02, follow the
steps listed in the Setup section of this document for Installing
Microsoft IE 3.02.
 
If you want the ability to prevent your family members from seeing all
sites, but still want to go to a particular site, do the following in
Protect It!
 
  Make sure Enable Internet Ratings is checked.

  Click Settings.

  Enter a password for the Content Advisor.

  Click the General tab of the Content Advisor.

  Check the boxes that you want in the User Options field.
 
Interactions with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0
 
If you have Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 or higher installed
when you install Microsoft Plus! for Kids, you may receive a warning
about the Content Advisor being tampered with. This warning will appear
because the Content Advisor settings have not been saved. To clear this
warning do the following in Protect It!
 
  Click on Settings in the Family Members Options screen.

  When asked enter a password for the Content Advisor.

  Click the OK button.
 
Modem and Internet Browser Interactions
 
If you prevent a family member from using a modem, it will, in most
cases, prevent the family member from gaining Internet access. This will
depend on how your system is configured to reach an Internet Service
Provider.
 
Dial-Up Networking
 
Protect It! cannot prevent users from running Dial-Up Networking from My
Computer. This means that family members may be able to create Dial-Up
Networking files. However, if you have modem restrictions turned on, the
family member will not be able to access modems.
 
Windows Startup
 
If you restrict family members to running only certain Allowed Programs,
some programs may cause error messages to be issued during startup. You
can either remove these programs from Windows Startup (see Windows Help)
or add them to the list of Allowed Programs in Protect It!.
 
Deleting Users
 
There is no safe way to remove user names from your Windows system. This
means that all users entered into Windows by either Protect It! or
Windows log on will appear in the list of Family Members. If you have
inactive users or users that you do not wish to allow on your system, be
sure to severely restrict their access.
 
Microsoft Network Trial Version
 
You may install The Microsoft Network (MSN) trial version by running
\msn\setup.exe from the Microsoft Plus! for Kids disc. This allows you to
use MSN for 30 days for free.
 
After you install MSN, you may have to configure your system to connect
to MSN. You can do this easily by installing the Internet Explorer
Connection Wizard.
 
To install the Internet Explorer Connection Wizard:
 
  Install Internet Explorer 3.02, if you have not yet done so.

  Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
  Internet Tools, and then click Get on the Internet.

  Follow the instructions.
 
SurfWatch 15-Day Trial Version
 
SurfWatch lets you prevent X-rated Internet material from appearing on
your computer. When you install SurfWatch, a list of X-rated World Wide
Web, FTP, and Gopher sites, Usenet newsgroups and Internet chat rooms is
installed on your computer. SurfWatch automatically filters out any sites
that are on that list. No other configuring is necessary.
 
To install the SurfWatch trial version:
 
  Start the AutoPlay program.

  Click the Fun Stuff button.

  Click the Install SurfWatch button.

  Follow the instructions.
 
If you are using ProtectIt! and have restricted access to programs, be
sure and add surfctl.exe to the list of Allowed Programs. This file can
be found in your Windows\System directory.
 
If you wish to remove SurfWatch, follow the instructions for removing
SurfWatch in this document on your Microsoft Plus! for Kids disc:
 
  \SrfWatch\Win95\ReadMe95.doc
 
Please note that the uninstal.exe program referenced in the document can
be run from your Microsoft Plus! for Kids disc. It is located in
\SrfWatch\Win95\uninstal.exe.
 
Thanks for purchasing Microsoft Plus! for Kids!
