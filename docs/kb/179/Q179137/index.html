SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to ensure default command processing when subclassing
the standard Windows Button control to create an MFC ActiveX control. It also
discusses how to determine when a control is the default command in both design-
and run-time modes so that the control is drawn correctly. Finally, the article
addresses how to ensure that the ENTER key gets routed to the current default
command.

The following sections and the DefButn.exe sample code describe how to:

- Make a Subclassed Control That Supports Extended Properties

- Set a Control to Be the Default Command at Run Time

- Use the Caption Property to Display the Command Text

- Draw Correctly Depending Upon Default Command Status

- Ensure That the ENTER Key Gets Routed to the Current Default Command

Make a Subclassed Control That Supports Extended Properties
-----------------------------------------------------------

To create a control that supports extended properties so that the container can
display its extended Default property in the Property Browser window when the
control is selected at design time, do the following:

1. Use the MFC ActiveX ControlWizard in Microsoft Visual C++ to create a new
  project called DefBtn.

2. Accept all defaults in step 1.

3. In step 2, select the Button control in response to "Which window class, if
  any, should this control subclass?" and accept all other defaults.

4. Click Finish to create the control.

5. In DefBtnctl.cpp add the following miscellaneous status bit to the
  _dwDefBtnOleMisc bit mask:

        OLEMISC_ACTSLIKEBUTTON

  This allows a container that supports extended properties, such as Visual
  Basic, to present the Default extended property in its Property Browser
  window during design time. When using the control in an application, a
  programmer can make your control the default command by setting this property
  to "True." Note that in an environment that does not support extended
  properties, such as Visual C++, this flag has no effect.

Set a Control to Be the Default Command at Run Time
---------------------------------------------------

To set the default command at run time in an MFC dialog-based container
application that does not support extended properties, add the following call to
the OnInitDialog processing:

     CDialog::SetDefID

and pass in the control ID of DefBtn. This will override any other control that
was selected as the default command at design time. You do not need to make any
modifications to the control[ASCII 146]s source code nor to its property page.

Use the Caption Property to Display the Command Text
----------------------------------------------------

To display the command text both at run time and design time, do the following:

1. Expose the stock Caption property using ClassWizard. The subclassed control
  automatically draws this property at run time.

2. To display the text at design time you have to include drawing code in the
  CDefBtnCtrl::OnDraw member function to check whether the UserMode ambient
  property is set to "False" (indicating design mode).

3. Use the CDC::GetInternalText member function to get the current value of the
  Caption stock property and draw it using the CDC::DrawText member function.

Draw Correctly Depending Upon Default Command Status
----------------------------------------------------

ActiveX controls implement functionality that the older, pre-Ole Windows controls
(such as the Button control) do not. Because the MFC method of subclassing a
control is a way to support older technology, there tend to be inconsistencies
in certain operations (especially drawing) between subclassed controls and those
developed without subclassing. For example, the Button control does not draw its
border in accordance with Windows 95 user interface guidelines for a default
command.

You can add logic to a subclassed control so that its border is drawn to reflect
the default command status. Look at various CDC member functions such as
DrawEdge to do so. Note that the DefButn.exe sample does not include the code to
do this.

The DefButn.exe sample does include the logic to detect any change in the default
command status when overriding the CDefBtnCtrl::OnAmbientPropertyChange member
function. To determine when a control has been set as the default command on a
form at design time, and to draw correctly depending upon the default command
status in both design- and run-time modes, do the following:

1. If the DISPID of the ambient property passed in is:

        DISPID_AMBIENT_DISPLAYASDEFAULT

  then obtain the value it changed to by calling the GetAmbientProperty
  function.

2. Pass in this DISPID and the address of a BOOL class member variable called
  m_bDefault. If "True," the control becomes the default button; "False" means
  it is no longer the default button.

3. Call the InvalidateControl function to redraw the control (use
  CDefBtnCtrl::OnDraw) with the shadow outline border that indicates that a
  command is the default. Use the value of m_bDefault to determine whether you
  should draw the outline (True) or remove it (False).

Note that the control draws correctly with respect to focus (user has tabbed to
it). There is no need to manually draw the interior dotted rectangle.

Ensure That the ENTER Key Gets Routed to the Current Default Command
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes how to receive the WM_COMMAND message when the ENTER key
is pressed, and the default command is a subclassed control. In Microsoft Visual
C++ Books Online, "Programming with MFC: Encyclopedia," the article called
"Keyboard Interface" contains the following paragraph:

  The container traps the ENTER and ESC keys by including them in its
  accelerator table. When one of these keys is pressed, the container
  calls the standard method Click in the appropriate control's primary
  dispatch interface. The standard Click method is described in Control
  Methods.

If you want to do special processing within your control when the ENTER key is
pressed and your control is the default command, you must use the ClassWizard to
expose the DoClick custom method. You should send the Click event back to the
container when your control[ASCII 146]s DoClick method has been called. Use
ClassWizard to expose the Click stock event and call the FireClick() event from
within the CDefBtnCtrl::DoClick() member function to do this.

If no special processing is needed and you just want to ensure that the Click
event gets fired back to the container, then expose the DoClick stock method and
the Click stock event. In MFC's default processing, FireClick will be called for
you.
