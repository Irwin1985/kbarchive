The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Draw 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

If you remove the Office Art component from Microsoft Publisher through Publisher
Setup, the Microsoft Draw 98 component will not be removed. If you completely
remove Microsoft Publisher, Microsoft Draw 98 still will not be removed if you
have any other OLE client Microsoft Office programs installed on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. Microsoft Publisher uses the shared component Microsoft Draw
98. Shared components cannot be removed as long as any program that uses the
same component is still installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft Draw 98 can be removed only after Microsoft Publisher and any other
Microsoft Office products (Microsoft Office for Windows 95 or Office 97) have
been removed. However, you can remove the program manually. To remove Microsoft
Draw 98 manually, you must delete the program files and the registry entries
made by Microsoft Draw 98.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Delete the following files from the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft
  Office\Office" folder:

     Msdraw8.cnt
     Msd8intl.dll
     Msdraw8a.exe
     Msdraw8.fts
     Msdraw8.gid
     Msdraw8.hlp
     Msdraw8.opt

2. Delete the following file from the "C:\Windows\System" folder:

     Hlp95en.dll

3. To delete the registry entries made by Microsoft Draw 98, click Start, click
  Run, and then type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box.

4. Locate and delete the following key:

     HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MSDraw.Drawing

5. Locate and delete the following key:

     HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MSDraw.Drawing.8

6. Locate and delete the following key:

     HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MSDraw.Drawing.8.1

7. Locate and delete the following key:
