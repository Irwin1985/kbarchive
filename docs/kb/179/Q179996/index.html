-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange Server administrator hides an address for the Exchange Server
address book, no delete transaction is sent to the PROFS/OV environment to
remove the user from the address book.

CAUSE
=====

When administrators hide an address from the Exchange Server address book, they
need the address to be hidden across mail systems such as PROFS/OV. This
functionality is not present in the LinkAge directory synchronization agent that
ships with Exchange Server version 5.5. The problem is that the directory
synchronization agent always ignores entries with the "Hide-from- address book"
flag. This means that when an entry is public but the Administrator hides it,
the appropriate delete transactions will not be sent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LinkAge Message Exchange version
3.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has added this functionality in a hotfix. With the hotfix in place,
the appropriate delete transactions will be sent. If a hidden entry is changed
twice, two deletes will be propagated. In this case, the second delete will log
a message that says "Cannot delete a previously deleted entry." This message is
harmless and can be ignored.
