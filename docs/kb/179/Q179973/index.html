-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Direct Mail Manager for Windows 
- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Word to create a mail merge document from Direct Mail
Manager, you may receive one of the following error messages:

  Error (5922) - Word was unable to open the data source. This error occurred
  while trying to set the data source.

  -or-

  Another application has locked access to the data file (Commonly caused by a
  2nd instance of Word). Please close the other application. Then click the
  "View Sample Data" button on the DirectNET toolbar to attempt to attach to
  the data file.

NOTE: This problem may occur when you use either the Simple Form Letter, the
Letter Wizard, the Flyer Wizard, or the Postcard Wizard in Direct Mail Manager.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word is attempting to use the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) Text
driver to process the mergedata.txt file that Direct Mail Manager created when
it imported your address list. For more information about why this happens, see
the "More Information" section of this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Remove the ODBC Text Driver
-------------------------------------

This method allows Word to use its own text converter instead of the ODBC Text
Driver to read the data file. Use the following steps to remove the ODBC Text
driver:

1. Quit Microsoft Direct Mail Manager, Microsoft Word, and all Windows
  applications.

2. Click the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

3. Double-click the 32bit ODBC icon.

4. On the User DSN tab, select "Text Files Microsoft Text Driver (*.txt, *.csv)"
  and then click Remove.

  NOTE: When you are prompted "Are you sure you want to remove the Text Files
  data source," click Yes.

5. Click OK.

6. Restart Direct Mail Manager and complete your mail merge.

Method 2: Perform the Merge from Microsoft Word
-----------------------------------------------

You can perform the merge process manually from Microsoft Word and choose the
type of data connectivity you want to use. That is, you can manually choose to
connect to the data file using the Text Converter rather the Text ODBC driver
and bypass some of the limitations of the Text ODBC driver. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Click OK to close the error message listed in the Symptoms section of this
  article.

2. In Word, click Mail Merge on the Tools menu.

3. Attach to the Mergedata.txt file that Microsoft Direct Mail Manager created
  as your data source using the text converter.

  a. In the Mail Merge Helper, click "Get Data and Open Data Source."

  b. Navigate to the Microsoft Direct Mail Manager folder. By default, this is
     (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Direct Mail Manager).

  c. From the Files of type list, select Text Files.

  d. Click to select the Select Method check box.

  e. Click the Mergedata file and click Open.

  f. In the Confirm Data Source dialog box, click Text Files (*.txt) and click
     OK.

4. Continue with the merge, adding merge fields as needed. Perform the merge, by
  either merging directly to the printer, or merging to a new document and then
  printing the new document.

Method 3: Submit the Mailing to a Mailing Service
-------------------------------------------------

Rather than printing the mailing out yourself, you can submit the mailing to a
mailing service and have them process the mailing for you. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Step 3 of the Microsoft Direct Mail Manager wizard gives you the following
  options:

  Quick and Simple - First Class Mail
  Standard Mail
  Easy - Use a Mailing Service
  Do not print the mailing now.

2. Rather then printing the mailing yourself, you choose the third option "Easy
  - Use a Mailing Service" and have a Mailing Service perform the task for you.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Direct Mail Manager prints the mailing by connecting to Microsoft Word
using OLE Automation and handing the task off to Microsoft Word for processing
and printing. Microsoft Word will then connect to the data source text file
generated by Microsoft Direct Mail Manager and process the request.

When using a text file as a data source, Microsoft Word can either connect
through a Text ODBC driver or a text converter. For performance reasons,
Microsoft Word will always attempt to use the Text ODBC driver to connect to the
data source, if the Text ODBC driver is installed. If the driver is not
installed, Word will use the text converter.

The Text ODBC driver that ships with Microsoft Office can process only certain
types of information. If the text file contains tab-delimited text, comma and
quote delimited text, or extended characters, you will receive one of the error
message listed in the Symptoms section of this article.
