SYMPTOMS
========

When scavenging or running a consistency check against WINS replication
partners, a WINS server may assign local version IDs to records of the
replicated database.

This may result in one of the following scenarios if you have the UseRplPnrs
registry key enabled:

- If there is a PUSH/PULL relationship between the WINS servers, the version ID
  of the server that is scavenging or consistency checking will be pulled to
  the replication partner and will cause an unnecessary version jump in the
  replicated database where the scavenge or consistency check is performed.

- If there is a PUSH relationship between the WINS servers and the version ID
  of the server that is doing the scavenge or consistency check is higher than
  the PUSH partner, replication will stop until the version ID of the partner
  catches up to that of the replication partner. In the cases where the version
  ID of the partner is extremely high, the partner will never catch up or it
  would take years to catch up. To work around this problem you will have to do
  a "delete owner" on the replicated database to reset the version ID and then
  re-enable replication.

  NOTE:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet
  \Services\Wins\Parameters

  UseRplPnrs - REG_DWORD
  Range: 0 or 1 (nonzero)
  Default: 0
  Description: Determines which pull partners WINS uses when performing
  consistency checks. If the value of this entry is set to 0, WINS contacts the
  owner WINS server. If it is set to a nonzero value, WINS randomly picks a
  WINS from its list of pull partners unless the owner WINS server also happens
  to be a pull partner. In that case, the owner WINS is contacted.

If you DO NOT have the UseRplPnrs registry key, the symptoms will be the same,
but the WINS server running the consistency check will contact the owner of the
replicated database directly instead of the replication partner.

CAUSE
=====

During a scavenge or consistency check, there is a problem where a replica
record was flagged indicating that the WINS server should update a record. This
results in a version ID increase. Record ownership is not verified and the
version ID is incorrectly assigned.

Additionally, as a result of the check done on the records, another problem is
addressed with group names that are in the released or tombstone state. There is
a problem where group names in the released or tombstone state can cause
symptoms similar to the symptoms stated above after a scavenge or consistency
check was run against the WINS database.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is now a check in place to ensure that only owned records are
manipulated.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
