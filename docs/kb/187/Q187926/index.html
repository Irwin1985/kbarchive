SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the use of the SAP Agent service in Windows NT Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SAP Agent service will listen for network clients' SAP requests for IPX
based services that are installed and running on the server.

Software that is designed to be advertised as a service over the network by means
of a SAP broadcast will issue the SAP announcements every 60 seconds, without
having the SAP Agent installed. However, in order for network clients to quickly
locate an IPX network service, a server that maintains a service database must
be available on the network, to respond to the service location request.

This service database is usually maintained by a Novell NetWare or by a NetWare
compatible server. Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare will also
maintain an IPX network service database.

If there are no servers capable of maintaining an IPX network service database
installed on the network, clients will have to wait for the periodic
announcements issued by the service, to be able to locate the service on the
network. When you install the SAP Agent, the Windows NT Server will be able to
respond to queries for the service that is being advertised, decreasing the
amount of time necessary for network clients to locate the service.

The SAP Agent will only maintain a database of IPX based services that the
Windows NT Server advertises. Windows NT will not respond to SAP requests for
other services unless File and Print Services for NetWare is installed.
Additionally, since SAP broadcasts are not forwarded by IPX routers to other IPX
subnets, the SAP Agent will not respond to service queries by network clients
located on remote IPX subnets.

To install the SAP Agent, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Setting, click Control Panel, and double-click Network.

2. Select the Services tab.

3. Click Add and select SAP agent from the list.

4. Verify path information to the Windows NT installation files (Windows NT
  CD-ROM, hard drive, or network drive).

5. Click Continue.

6. After binding, click Close.

7. When prompted to restart the computer, click No.

8. Re-apply the latest service pack currently installed.

9. Restart the server for the change to take effect.
