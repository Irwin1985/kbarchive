-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

The full version of Network Monitor does not install for single-user use, (for
example, for an administrator working at the console). During installation you
receive this message:

  Only Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.51 and up are supported.

This problem can be resolved by setting an application compatibility flag.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Typically, applications installed on Terminal Server are installed for multiuser
use. This would require that the application be installed after you place the
server in Install Mode (change user /install), or when you install the
application through the Add/Remove Programs option in Control Panel. However,
since you normally install Network Monitor for a single user, the administrator
would install Network Monitor in Execute Mode (the default mode or choosing to
install for a single user in Add/Remove Programs).

When the server is in Execute Mode, software requests for the location of the
Windows directory are answered with the user's Windows directory (typically
located under the user's profile), rather than with the systemroot directory.
Since Network Monitor looks for the systemroot directory as part of its
version-checking routine, when the server tells it that the administrator's
Windows directory is the systemroot, Network Monitor assumes this can't be
either Windows NT or Windows 95.

This is a common application problem and can be resolved in two ways for Network
Monitor.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. You can successfully install Network Monitor if you install it for all users.
  Access can then be restricted through NTFS permissions. When the server is in
  Install Mode, requests for the systemroot are answered with the real
  systemroot rather than the user's Windows directory.

2. You can also successfully install Network Monitor for single-user use by
  adding a compatibility flag to the Terminal Server Registry for Network
  Monitor. In this case, add the application compatibility flag value of 0x400
  to any existing flag value for the component that is looking for the
  systemroot. A value of 0x400 tells the system to report the real systemroot
  as the Windows directory.

The application that does version checking is called _MSTEST. This is a common
Windows NT component, and is preconfigured in the registry with a compatibility
flag. So, you need to locate this flag value and modify it.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Be sure to reset the flag after you have completed installation. Use the
following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (regedt32 not regedit)

2. Navigate to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal
  Server\Compatibility\Applications\_MSTEST

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Add 0x400 to the Flags value. For example, if the existing flags value is 0xc
  (the default), change it to 0x40c.

4. Install Network Monitor.

5. After installation, change the Flags value back to the original value.
