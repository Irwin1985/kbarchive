-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to migrate accounts and resources from a Novell
NetWare server to a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server using the
Migration Tool for NetWare. It also discusses the options that are available and
how NetWare permissions and rights interoperate with Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Migration Tool for NetWare (NWConv.exe) is included with Windows NT Server
versions 3.51 and 4.0 and File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW).

NOTE: Gateway Services for Netware (GSNW) must be installed on the computer
running Windows NT Server in order for the Migration Tool for NetWare to run.

Using the Migration Tool for NetWare, you can transfer NetWare accounts and/or
files and directories from NetWare volumes to a Windows NT Server domain
controller. When you transfer users to a Windows NT domain with FPNW installed,
the Maintain NetWare Compatible Login option is automatically selected for the
users.

NOTE: It is recommended that you perform the migration in two steps:

1. Migrate user accounts.

2. Migrate file resources.

When NetWare accounts and volume data are transferred to a computer running
Windows NT Server, the NetWare permissions and security information is also
migrated, assuming NetWare file and directory resources are transferred to NTFS
volumes. Additionally, migrated volumes are automatically shared for Microsoft
network client users and NetWare clients when FPNW is installed.

Starting the Migration Tool for NetWare
---------------------------------------

To start the Migration Tool for NetWare, follow these steps:

1. In Windows NT 3.51, open Program Manager, and then click Run on the File
  menu. Type "NWCONV" (without quotation marks), and then click OK.

  -OR-

  In Windows NT 4.0, click the Start button, click Programs, click
  Administrative Tools, and then double-click Migration Tool for NetWare.

2. In Select Servers For Migration, in the From NetWare Server box, do one of
  the following:

  Type the name of the Novell server to be migrated.

  -OR-

  Click the ellipses (...), and then click the appropriate Novell NetWare server
  to be migrated.

3. In Select Servers For Migration, in the To Windows NT Server box, do one of
  the following:

  Type in the name of the Windows NT Domain Controller to which the Novell
  NetWare server listed above will be migrated.

  -OR-

  Click the ellipses (...) button, then click the appropriate Windows NT Domain
  name and Windows NT Domain Controller to which the Novell NetWare server
  listed above will be migrated.

  NOTE: The computer running Windows NT Server that you select must be a Domain
  Controller.

Overview of Migration Tool for NetWare Dialog Buttons
-----------------------------------------------------

ADD            : This option allows you to migrate multiple servers at
                 the same time.

DELETE         : This option removes the selected NetWare and Windows
                 NT Servers currently selected in the Server for
                 Migration list.

USER OPTIONS   : This option is used to specify how the migration will
                 affect each user account and group.

FILE OPTIONS   : This option is used to determine which folders and/or
                 files are migrated to the computer running Windows NT
                 Server, and to specify the new location for these
                 resources.

START MIGRATION: This option begins the migration. This actually brings
                 information over from the NetWare server.

TRIAL MIGRATION: This option starts a rehearsal migration. The benefit of
                 this option is that it behaves just like the real
                 migration would, except that it does not actually
                 perform the migration. You can analyze error logs after
                 a trial migration and make any corrections before doing
                 the real migration.

LOGGING        : Specifies error login detail level.

NOTE: The Error.log, Summary.log, and Logfile.log files are located in the
%systemroot%\system32 directory.

Details of the User Options Button
----------------------------------

Passwords:

Use this section to determine the passwords for the migrated accounts.

NOTE: Make sure that the password option you select conforms to the password
policy set in User Manager for Domains; otherwise, errors may occur when you
perform the migration.

Usernames:

Use this section to specify the action to be taken when a duplicate account name
is found in the Windows NT domain being migrated to.

Group Names:

Use this section to specify the action to be taken when a duplicate group name is
found on the Windows NT domain being migrated to.

Default:

Use this section to specify account policies to be used and whether or not
NetWare Supervisor rights should be transferred to the Windows NT domain.

NOTE: The Migrate NetWare Specific Account Information option on the Defaults tab
is only available if File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) is installed on
the computer from which you are running the Migration Tool for NetWare.

Advanced:

Click the Advanced button to specify a trusted domain that you want to migrate
users to.

Transfer Users and Groups:

When this check box is selected, the tool transfers NetWare-specific account
information including grace logins, limiting concurrent connections, and station
restrictions.

NOTE: User disk volume restrictions are not supported, nor are they transferred.
Also, when transferring NetWare accounts, new passwords must be set for the
accounts because Windows NT cannot read users' passwords, as they are stored in
encrypted form.

Use Mappings in File:

When this option is selected, the mapping file specifies how account information
is transferred to Windows NT. The mapping file will only transfer those user
accounts and groups that are included in the mapping file.

You can create a new mapping file, or edit an existing file when you transfer
user or group account information. The mapping file also has a comma-delimited
format that makes it easier to transfer the information into a spreadsheet. The
format is as follows:

  &lt;old name&gt;, &lt;new name&gt;, &lt;password&gt;

When you create a new mapping file, it is created as a text file and is
automatically stored in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder as a *.MAP file.

To create a mapping file when you transfer accounts, follow these steps:

1. In the Migration Tool for NetWare, click User Options.

2. In the User and Group Options dialog box, click the Use Mappings in File
  check box to select it, and then click Create.

3. In the Create Mapping File dialog box, type a name for the mapping file in
  the Use Mappings in File field.

  NOTE: You can also click the ellipses (...) button to browse for a file.

4. Click to select the Include User Names check box to include user names in the
  mapping file.

5. Click to select one of the following password options:

   - No password: User accounts are transferred with a blank password.

   - Password is Username: The new password is the same as the user name.

   - Password is &lt;field&gt;: The text entered here is used for all
     passwords.

6. To include group names in the mapping file, click the Include Group Names
  check box to select it.

7. Click OK, and you should receive the following message:

  Mapping file created successfully. Do you want to edit it?

NOTE: Clicking Yes opens the mapping file in Notepad.exe and allows you to remove
user accounts that you do not want transferred by deleting those user names. You
may also change users' names and passwords, as needed.

Details of the File Options Button
----------------------------------

Clicking File Options in the Migration Tool for NetWare allows you to customize
what resources, such as files and folders, are to be migrated.

Transfer Files:

In the upper left-hand corner is a check box for the Transfer Files option. If
you click to clear this check box, the migration process migrates only user
groups and individual users. No directories or files from the NetWare server are
migrated. Therefore, to ensure files migrate from NetWare to Windows NT, do not
click this check box to clear it.

Below the Transfer Files check box is a double-column list box. On the left side
is the NetWare server from which information will be migrated. On the right side
is the computer running Windows NT Server to which the information will be
migrated.

ADD   : This button allows you to select NetWare volumes to migrate.
        Because all volumes are selected for migration by default, this
        button is unavailable unless a volume has been previously
        deleted.

DELETE: This button deletes the currently selected NetWare volume and
        Windows NT Server share that is highlighted in the list.

MODIFY: This option allows you to modify the location where resources
        will be located on the computer running Windows NT Server. Also,
        a new share can be created in this dialog box.

FILES : This option allows you to selectively pick which files and
        folders are to be migrated.

Security:  NetWare Migrated to Windows NT
-----------------------------------------

When the NetWare volumes are migrated to a computer running Windows NT Server,
permissions on files and folders are only preserved if the volume is migrated to
an NTFS volume.

In NetWare, a user with explicit trustee rights to a low-level folder in the tree
is automatically allowed read and file scan access to folders higher than that
low-level folder, even if they are not given trustee rights to do so. However,
Windows NT Server enforces security at every folder level. On a computer running
Windows NT Server, if a user has no permissions for a high-level folder, then
the user cannot access that folder or see its contents.

So that NetWare users do not lose the ability to browse the tree if they have
permissions on lower-level folders, the Migration Tool for NetWare checks
whether trustee rights are set at the root of the NetWare volume being
transferred. If there are no trustee rights set at that level, then the
Migration Tool for NetWare grants the Domain Users group the Read Execute (RX)
permissions for every folder of the transferred volume, allowing users to browse
the volume.

If you want to change these permissions after the volume has been transferred,
you should use the CACLS tool. Using CACLS, you can use a single command to
revoke the permissions granted to Domain Users throughout the tree, without
altering any other permissions granted at any level in the tree.

To use CACLS to revoke the permissions of Domain Users for all folders in the
volume, change to the root of the volume and type the following command:

CACLS /T /E /R "domain users"

In this command, the /T switch specifies to revoke the permissions for every
subfolder of the current folder, the /E switch specifies to not change
permissions granted to other groups or users in those folders, and the /R
"domain users" switch revokes the permission granted to domain users.

Permissions: NetWare Migrated to Windows NT
-------------------------------------------

The individual permissions (and their abbreviations) are:

  Read (R)
  Execute (X)
  Change Permissions (P)
  Write (W)
  Delete (D)
  Take Ownership (O)

Directory Permission   Explanation
----------------------------------

No Access             User cannot access the directory in any way, even
                      if the user is a member of a group that has been
                      granted access to the directory.

List (RX)             User can only list the files and subdirectories in
                      this directory and change to a subdirectory of this
                      directory. User cannot access new files created in
                      this directory.

Read (RX)             User can read the contents of files in this
                      directory and can run applications in the
                      directory.

Add (WX)              User can add files to the directory but cannot read
                      or change the contents of current files.

Add &amp; Read (RWX)      User can add files and change the contents of
                      current files.

Change (RWXD)         User can read and add files and change the content
                      of current files.

Full Control (All)    User can read and change files, add new ones,
                      change permissions for the directory and its files,
                      and take ownership of the directory and its files.

File Attributes
---------------

Both NetWare and Windows NT operating systems have assignable file attributes.
The following table shows how file attributes are mapped between the NetWare and
Windows NT operating systems:

NetWare File Attributes   Windows NT File Attributes
----------------------------------------------------

NetWare File Attributes   Windows NT File Attributes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Read Only (Ro)            Read Only (R)
Delete Inhibit (D)        Read Only (R), or remove user permissions to
                          delete the file.
Rename Inhibit            This is assigned at the directory level by
                          removing user permissions to write to the
                          directory.
