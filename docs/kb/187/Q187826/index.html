The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

SNA 4.0 Server can be configured to send backup information to SNA 4.0 clients.
This feature eliminates the requirement to manually update or configure each SNA
client locally.

This can be configured from within the properties of the subdomain by clicking
the Client Backup Configuration tab. The Backup Domain and Backup Sponsor Server
information can be configured from within the same tab and sent to SNA 4.0
clients automatically through the sponsor connection. This feature only works
with SNA 4.0 clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before an SNA client can establish a session with a host computer, they must
establish a sponsor connection.

Please refer to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for more
details on client sponsor connections:

  Q160849 How the SNA Server Client Chooses a "Sponsor" SNA Server

During an SNA client installation, a choice is made between installing the client
locally or remotely. There are benefits gained from using each approach.

Local clients have an advantage of not being affected when SNA Servers are
retired or renamed in an existing SNA subdomain. However, local clients cannot
be used when SNA Servers are on different TCP/IP subnets and separated from the
client by a router. Requests for members of an SNA subdomain are broadcast and
will generally not get through a router to another TCP/IP subnet.

Remote clients are useful when SNA Servers are located across a WAN or another
TCP/IP subnet. However, they may not be able to get SNA sponsor connections when
SNA Servers are retired or renamed in an existing SNA subdomain, depending on
their original client configuration. This problem can be solved by taking
advantage of the new feature in SNA 4.0 Server that can update client
configurations with new backup server or domain information as required.
