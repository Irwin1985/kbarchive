SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how you can list the processes that are currently
running on a computer. The approach is different for Windows 95/98 and Windows
NT; this article illustrates both solutions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation requires that you first test to see which version of Windows is
in use. Once that determination is made, the correct code can then be run to
examine and list the current processes. On Windows NT, requests for information
on some system processes may be denied for security or other related reasons.
The approach taken in this article will ignore any process that cannot be
accessed.

PSAPI.DLL is the library used to gather process information on Windows NT and
must reside in the \SYSTEM32 directory. There are two versions of this file,
3.51 and 4.0. Either version will work for this example, but using the most
recent version is recommended. If you have installed the Windows NT 4.0 Resource
Kit or the Windows NT 4.0 SDK, this file will be present on your computer. The
4.0 version of the file is available on the Visual Studio Visual C++ CD-ROM in
the following directory:

  \DEVSTUDIO\VC\BIN\PSAPI.DLL.

The 3.51 version of the file is available on the Visual Studio Visual Basic
CD-ROM in the directory:

  \TOOLS\UNSUPPRT\WSVIEW\WINNT\PSAPI.DLL

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new Standard Exe project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Add a ListBox to Form1.

4. Copy the following code to Form1:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
        List1.Clear
        Select Case getVersion()

        Case 1 'Windows 95/98

           Dim f As Long, sname As String
           Dim hSnap As Long, proc As PROCESSENTRY32
           hSnap = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0)
           If hSnap = hNull Then Exit Sub
           proc.dwSize = Len(proc)
           ' Iterate through the processes
           f = Process32First(hSnap, proc)
           Do While f
             sname = StrZToStr(proc.szExeFile)
             List1.AddItem sname
             f = Process32Next(hSnap, proc)
           Loop

        Case 2 'Windows NT

           Dim cb As Long
           Dim cbNeeded As Long
           Dim NumElements As Long
           Dim ProcessIDs() As Long
           Dim cbNeeded2 As Long
           Dim NumElements2 As Long
           Dim Modules(1 To 200) As Long
           Dim lRet As Long
           Dim ModuleName As String
           Dim nSize As Long
           Dim hProcess As Long
           Dim i As Long
           'Get the array containing the process id's for each process object
           cb = 8
           cbNeeded = 96
           Do While cb &lt;= cbNeeded
              cb = cb * 2
              ReDim ProcessIDs(cb / 4) As Long
              lRet = EnumProcesses(ProcessIDs(1), cb, cbNeeded)
           Loop
           NumElements = cbNeeded / 4

           For i = 1 To NumElements
              'Get a handle to the Process
              hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION _
                 Or PROCESS_VM_READ, 0, ProcessIDs(i))
              'Got a Process handle
              If hProcess &lt;&gt; 0 Then
                  'Get an array of the module handles for the specified
                  'process
                  lRet = EnumProcessModules(hProcess, Modules(1), 200, _
                                               cbNeeded2)
                  'If the Module Array is retrieved, Get the ModuleFileName
                  If lRet &lt;&gt; 0 Then
                     ModuleName = Space(MAX_PATH)
                     nSize = 500
                     lRet = GetModuleFileNameExA(hProcess, Modules(1), _
                                     ModuleName, nSize)
                     List1.AddItem Left(ModuleName, lRet)
                  End If
              End If
            'Close the handle to the process
           lRet = CloseHandle(hProcess)
           Next

        End Select
        End Sub

5. Add a Standard Module to the Project. Module1 is created.

6. Paste the following code into Module1.

        Public Declare Function Process32First Lib "kernel32" ( _
           ByVal hSnapshot As Long, lppe As PROCESSENTRY32) As Long

        Public Declare Function Process32Next Lib "kernel32" ( _
           ByVal hSnapshot As Long, lppe As PROCESSENTRY32) As Long

        Public Declare Function CloseHandle Lib "Kernel32.dll" _
           (ByVal Handle As Long) As Long

        Public Declare Function OpenProcess Lib "Kernel32.dll" _
          (ByVal dwDesiredAccessas As Long, ByVal bInheritHandle As Long, _
              ByVal dwProcId As Long) As Long

        Public Declare Function EnumProcesses Lib "psapi.dll" _
           (ByRef lpidProcess As Long, ByVal cb As Long, _
              ByRef cbNeeded As Long) As Long

        Public Declare Function GetModuleFileNameExA Lib "psapi.dll" _
           (ByVal hProcess As Long, ByVal hModule As Long, _
              ByVal ModuleName As String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long

        Public Declare Function EnumProcessModules Lib "psapi.dll" _
           (ByVal hProcess As Long, ByRef lphModule As Long, _
              ByVal cb As Long, ByRef cbNeeded As Long) As Long

        Public Declare Function CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Lib "kernel32" ( _
           ByVal dwFlags As Long, ByVal th32ProcessID As Long) As Long

        Public Declare Function GetVersionExA Lib "kernel32" _
           (lpVersionInformation As OSVERSIONINFO) As Integer

        Public Type PROCESSENTRY32
           dwSize As Long
           cntUsage As Long
           th32ProcessID As Long           ' This process
           th32DefaultHeapID As Long
           th32ModuleID As Long            ' Associated exe
           cntThreads As Long
           th32ParentProcessID As Long     ' This process's parent process
           pcPriClassBase As Long          ' Base priority of process threads
           dwFlags As Long
           szExeFile As String * 260       ' MAX_PATH
        End Type

        Public Type OSVERSIONINFO
           dwOSVersionInfoSize As Long
           dwMajorVersion As Long
           dwMinorVersion As Long
           dwBuildNumber As Long
           dwPlatformId As Long           '1 = Windows 95.
                                          '2 = Windows NT

           szCSDVersion As String * 128
        End Type

        Public Const PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION = 1024
        Public Const PROCESS_VM_READ = 16
        Public Const MAX_PATH = 260
        Public Const STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED = &amp;HF0000
        Public Const SYNCHRONIZE = &amp;H100000
        'STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED Or SYNCHRONIZE Or &amp;HFFF
        Public Const PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS = &amp;H1F0FFF
        Public Const TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS = &amp;H2&amp;
        Public Const hNull = 0

        Function StrZToStr(s As String) As String
           StrZToStr = Left$(s, Len(s) - 1)
        End Function

        Public Function getVersion() As Long
           Dim osinfo As OSVERSIONINFO
           Dim retvalue As Integer
           osinfo.dwOSVersionInfoSize = 148
           osinfo.szCSDVersion = Space$(128)
           retvalue = GetVersionExA(osinfo)
           getVersion = osinfo.dwPlatformId
        End Function

7. Run the project and click the Command button on Form1. You should see a
  listing of the currently running processes.

8. If you are running Windows 95/98, try running the example project on Windows
  NT or vice versa. The processes should be listed regardless of operating
  system version.
