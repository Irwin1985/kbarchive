Page 30: Lab 2 Directions Are Incorrect
---------------------------------------

Use the following directions to correctly proceed through Lab 2:

Exercise 1: Sharing a Directory:

1. From the Start Menu, open Windows Explorer. Open the Networking Essentials
  directory and select Lab2.exe.

2. Right-click the My Computer icon, and then select Explore. This opens the
  Windows NT Explorer.

3. In the left pane, click the C: drive to open it.

4. Now right-click the DOS directory and select Sharing.

  NOTE: For purposes of this simulation, DOS is the only directory that can be
  shared.

  The DOS Properties window appears. Select the Sharing tab and click Shared As:

5. Notice that you have several options in the Shared As: section.

  Share Name -- Shows the name users specify to connect to the shared directory.
  In order for Microsoft MS-DOS-based computers to connect, the name must
  conform to the MS-DOS 8.3 naming convention. On a Windows NT-based network,
  the name can be up to 12 characters long.

  By default, the share name is the name of the selected directory.

  NOTE: Normally, you can type a different name in the Share Name: box. However,
  if you change the name of the share, when someone accesses the share, they
  will use the share name and not the directory name.

  Comment -- The comment is optional and is displayed with the Share Name in the
  Connect Network Drive dialog box.

  User Limit -- Sets the maximum number of users who can connect to the shared
  directory at one time. By default, no limit is set.

  Permissions Button -- You can control access to a shared directory by setting
  permissions on it. Permissions are covered in a later lesson.

6. Accept the default name DOS for the share by clicking OK.

  Notice the small hand holding the DOS folder. This indicates that the folder
  is shared.

Exercise 2: Stop Sharing a Directory

1. Right-click the DOS directory and click on Sharing.

  The DOS Properties window appears. Select the Sharing tab and click Not
  Shared:
  Notice that the small hand holding the DOS folder has disappeared.

2. On the File menu, click Exit Lab 2.


Page 80: Thicknet Cable Does Not Use BNC Connectors
---------------------------------------------------

On page 80, in the first paragraph, first sentence change:
"Both thinnet and thicknet cable use connection components, known as a BNC
(British Naval Connector), to make the connections between the cable and the
computers."

To:
"Thinnet cable uses connection components, known as a BNC (British Naval
Connector), to make the connections between the cable and the computers."


Page 93: Typographical Errors
-----------------------------

a. On page 93, under Fiber-Optic Considerations, the statement is made:
  "Do not use fiber-optic cable if you:
  ...are under a tight budget. (Note: pricing for fiber optic cable is
  competitive to hi-end copper cabling.)"

  Change: 'competitive to hi-end'

  To: 'competitive with high-end'

b. Also on Page 93, the statement is made:
  "...Do not have the expertise to properly install it and connect devices
  to it. (Note: fiber optic cable is increasingly easier to work with.
  Polishing and terminating techniques require fewer parts and less
  expertise.)"

  Change: 'teminating'

  To: 'terminating'


Page 97: Clarification For Question 3
-------------------------------------

On page 97, question 3 should specify "some devices" rather than "each", as the
documentation indicates on page 95.

Change:
"3. Each device on a _________ network can transmit and receive at the same
time."

To:
"3. Some devices on a _________ network can transmit and receive at the same
time."


Page 99 Contradicts Page 103
----------------------------

Page 99 has a table entitled "IBM Cabling System". It indicates: "IBM Type 3"
"Voice Grade Cable" "Consists of four solid, unshielded, twisted-pair 22 or 24
AWG cables".

Page 103 States: "IBM has its own cabling system complete with its own types. IBM
Type 3 cabling, for example, is a voice grade, shielded twisted-pair cable
otherwise known as STP."

Microsoft Press is aware of this contradiction and will post further information
when available.


Errors in Cable Summary on Page 102 and CD-ROM Demo6
----------------------------------------------------

Slide 11 of Demo 6 (located in the CD-ROM /Demos folder) shows a Cable Comparison
Summary chart which is also displayed on page 102 of the book. There are several
discrepancies between the text in the two different charts.

Specifically:

Under category Thinnet coaxial (10Base2):
Usable cable length:
in book: "185 m or about 607 feet"
in CD: "185 m (600 feet)"
The actual conversion is 607 feet.

Under category Twisted-Pair (10BaseT):
Usable cable length:
in book: "100 m or about 328 feet"
on CD: "100 m (330 feet)"
The actual conversion is 328.08 feet. The book is correct.

Transmission rates:
in book: "10MBps, 4-100 MBps"
on CD: "4-100 MBps"
The actual range is 4-100 MBps.

Ease of installation:
in book: "very easy; possibly already installed"
on CD: "very easy"
The book is correct. Many buildings already include twisted-pair cable.

Under category Fiber-optic:

Cable cost:
in book: "More expensive"
on CD: "Most expensive"
Both should read "most expensive."

Usable cable length:
in book: "2k or about 6562 feet"
on CD: "2k (6500 feet)"
The actual figure is 6561.68 feet.

Transmission rates:
in book: "100 MBps or more (&gt;1GBps)"
on CD: "100 MBps or more"
Both should read "100 MBps to 2 GBps"

Flexibility:
in book: "Very Flexible"
on CD: "Not flexible"
Both should read "Not Flexible".

Ease of installation:
in book: "Easy to install"
on CD: "Difficult to install"
Both should read "Difficult to install."


More Errors In Cable Summary On Page 102
----------------------------------------

The Twisted-pair (10BaseT) column needs to be broken into to two separate
categories: Unshielded Twisted-pair (UTP) and Shielded Twisted-pair (STP).

Unshielded Twisted-pair

Cable cost: Least expensive
Usable cable length: 100 meters or about 328 feet
Transmission rates: 4 - 100 Mbps
Flexibility: Most flexible
Ease of installation: Very easy; possibly already installed
Susceptibility to interference: Very susceptible to interference
Special features: Same as telephone wire; often pre-installed in buildings
Preferred uses: Smaller sites on budget

Shielded Twisted-pair

Cable cost: More than Thinnet coaxial
Usable cable length: 100 meters or about 328 feet
Transmission rates: 16 - 500 Mbps
Flexibility: Less flexible
Ease of installation: Moderately easy to install
Susceptibility to interference: Good resistance to interference
Special features: Supports higher transmission rates than UTP
Preferred uses: Token Ring in any size

A couple of other corrections are also needed:

Under the Thinnet coaxial column, change the Cable Cost from:
"More than twisted-pair"

To:
"More than UTP"

Under the Thicknet coaxial column, change the Ease of Installation from:
"Easy to install"

To:
"Moderately easy to install"


Page 144: Text Error
--------------------

Page 144, under the subheading Exercise 1: Matching:

Change: "One item in Column B will not be used..."

To: "Two items in Column B will not be used..."


Page 147: Correction To The Answer For Exercise 3, Part 2
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 147, Exercise 3, part 2:
Add "f. Onboard microprocessor" to the list of possible answers.


Page 149: Diagram Correction
----------------------------

In the diagram on page 149, computer G should be connected to the Hub as
outlined
on page 148. However, the line that connects G to the Hub was left off the
diagram.


Page 150: The Distance From J To The Hub Exceeds 328 Feet
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 150, first sentence:

Change:
"The distances for A, B, C, D, E, F, and G to the hub all exceed the maximum
cable length of 328 feet specified by 10BaseT."

To:
"The distances for A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and J to the hub all exceed the maximum
cable length of 328 feet specified by 10BaseT."


Page 171: Information Under Wrong Heading
-----------------------------------------

Page 171, under the heading "Presentation Layer", paragraph 2:
Move the following text to page 170, under the "Application Layer" heading.

"A utility known as the redirector operates at this layer. The purpose of the
redirector is to redirect input/output (I/O) operations to resources on a
server."


Page 176: Error in OSI Information
----------------------------------

Correction:
Page 176:
Under "Enhancements to the OSI Model," the information about the LLC and the MAC
should include the following information:

  Logical Link Control (LLC)--establishing and terminating links,
  controlling frame traffic, sequencing frames and acknowledging frames

  Media Access Control (MAC)--managing media access, delimiting frames,
  checking frame errors and recognizing frame addresses


Page 208: Sequencing Information Is Under Transport Layer
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 208, Figure 3.18 incorrectly shows that sequencing and address
information is added to the packet at the Network layer.

Sequencing information is added to the packet at the Transport layer.


Page 210: APPC Listed as Application Protocol, S/B Transport Protocol
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 210 bullets a number of Application Protocols. The list includes the first
bullet:
"APPC (advanced program-to-program communication)--IBM's peer-to-peer SNA
protocol, mostly used on SNA/400(R)s."

However, on pages 218 and 220, APPC is listed as a Transport Protocol.

On page 210, APPC should be removed from the bulleted list of Application
Protocols. On page 211, APPC should be added to the bulleted list of Transport
protocols.

Please note: APPC uses the LU 6.2 protocol that works in both the Transport and
Session layers of the OSI model, which is why it can be considered a Transport
protocol. However, APPC can also be defined as an application protocol since it
also works in the Presentation layer of the OSI model. The terms APPC and LU 6.2
are often used interchangeably.


Page 212: Some Acronyms In Figure 3.20 Are Not Defined
------------------------------------------------------

Some of the acronyms referenced in Figure 3.20 are not defined in the text of
this book.

TDI: Transport Driver Interface
NBT: NetBIOS over TCP/IP
DLC: Data Link Control

Also note: NDIS 3.0 is no longer used. NDIS 3.0 should be changed to 4.0.


Page 219: Screen Shot From NT 3.51
----------------------------------

Page 219, Figure 3.22:
The third screen shot seen in Demo21.exe is from Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, not
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. This screen shot will be updated with the equivalent
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 screen shot in future reprints and editions.


Page 229: Last Paragraph Confuses Wire And Wire Pair
----------------------------------------------------

On Page 229 the last paragraph confuses wire and wire pair. First stating demand
priority uses four pairs of wires (8 wires total), then stating the four wires
enable quartet signaling.

Change:
"Four pairs of wires are used. The four wires enable quartet signaling, which
transmits..."

To:
"Four pairs of wires are used. These wires enable quartet signaling, which
transmits..."


Page 230: Demand Priority is Non-contention
-------------------------------------------

On page 230, in the Access Methods Summary chart, change the second row in the
Demand Priority column from "Contention" to "Non-contention"


Page 256: Illustration of 10BT UTP Shows Coax/BNC
-------------------------------------------------

The illustration in figure 4.3 shows a repeater being used to extend maximum
cable length beyond 100m. This is in an ethernet system using unshielded,
twisted-pair cable. Two segments of cable with BNC-type connectors are shown at
the repeater.

This illustration should use RJ-45 connectors.


Page 266: Text Errors Confusing 100BVG With 100BT
-------------------------------------------------

Page 266, paragraph 3, sentences 2 and 3:

Change: "100BaseT"

To: "100BaseVG"


Page 266: Corrections To Specifications
---------------------------------------

Change second item under specifications from:
"Ability to support a cascaded star topology over Category 3, 4 and 5 twisted
pair and fiber-optic cable."

To:
"Ability to support a cascaded star topology over Category 5 twisted pair and
fiber-optic cable."

Category 3 and 4 twisted pair do not support data transmission rates of 100
Mbps.


Page 276: Text Error
--------------------

Question 3. on page 276 states:

"3. In a token ring frame the Media Access Control field indicates whether the
frame is a _____ frame or a _______ frame."

The answer given afterwards is :

token or data

The sentence should read:
"In a token ring frame the Access Control field indicates whether the frame is a
_____ frame or a _______ frame."

Note that in the table on the previous page, there is a field called an Access
control field, which not only indicates frame priority, but also indicates
whether the frame is a data frame or a token frame.


Page 281: Text Incorrect
------------------------

Page 281:
The last sentence of the second paragraph is incorrect. Up to 33 MSAUs can be
connected together to form a Token Ring.


Page 282: Cable Lengths Expressed Inconsistently in Meters or Feet
------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 282 and 283, cable lengths are given in text and in a figure. In the
first two paragraphs, lengths are expressed in meters (with feet in
parentheses).

In the figure, only meters are given. In the third and fourth paragraphs, only
feet are given. On page 283, only feet are given.

Corrections for this situation appear below:

Figure 4.16:
101 meters
change to: "101 meters (330 feet)"
100 meters
change to: "100 meters (328 feet)"
45 meters
change to: "45 meters (148 feet)"

3rd paragraph:
150 feet
change to: "150 feet (46 meters)"
500 feet
change to: "500 feet (152 meters)"

Fourth paragraph:
500-foot limit
change to: "500-foot (152-meter) limit"

Page 283:
First paragraph:
150 feet
change to: "150 feet (46 meters)"
45 meters (150 feet)
change to: "46 meters (150 feet)"


Pages 300, 323, 335, 507, 617, 834: Minor Text Errors
-----------------------------------------------------

Page 300: Exercise 1: Matching
Column B, Item B) "Uses bus star topology with UTP."
should read: "Uses star bus topology with UTP."

Page 323: Text of Figure 5.6 indicates a directory as:
"F:\=\Network server\Data directory"
should read: "F:\\Network server\Data directory"

Page 335: Last sentence reads: "For those services that are set to Manual
startup, you can use the above window and the Startup... button to change them
to start automatically."
should read: "Start... button"

Page 507: Exercise 3, Question 2), second paragraph reads: "Local groups consists
of individual user accounts that have rights and permissions on the local
computer and other group accounts."
should read: "other Global group accounts".

Page 617: Exercise 2: Matching, Column B, Item K, reads "SDN".
should read: "ISDN"

Page 834 (Index):
Under T:
"T1 Service, 586-587, 799"
should read: "T1 Service, 587-588, 801"


Pages 328: Minor Text Errors
----------------------------

Page 328: Under IP Address, 4th sentence, "The ID identifies a specific host on a
network."
Should read "host ID identifies".


Pages 432, 547: Minor Text Errors
---------------------------------

Page 432, 1st paragraph, 4th sentence, states: "Access permissions are rules
associated with a resource, usually a directory file or printer."
Should read "directory, file or printer".

Page 547, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence, states: "PPTP provides a way to route IP,
IPX, or NetBEUI PPP *pckets* over a TCP/IP network."
Should read "packets".


Page 396: Description Of Centralized Computing Unclear
------------------------------------------------------

Page 396, under the Centralized Computing subheading:

Second paragraph, first sentence:

Change:
"The entire database travels in message-sized pieces..."

To:
"The requested information travels in message-sized pieces..."

Fourth paragraph, second sentence:

Change:
"If it is a large database, moving what could be vast amounts of data takes time
and ties up the network."

To:
"Moving vast amounts of data takes time and ties up the network."


Page 443: Text Corrections
--------------------------

a. Page 443, third bullet:

  Change: "System Groups"

  To: "Special Groups"

b. Page 443, section "Built-in Groups," second paragraph:
  Sentence should refer to three types of built-in groups, not four.


Page 444: Invalid Information
-----------------------------

On page 444, in the "Server Operators" row of the table:

Change: "Lock or override the lock of a server."
To: "Lock a server."


Page 537: International Standards Text Error
--------------------------------------------

On Page 537, under the section titled "International Standards", the definition
and origin of the word "terbo" are incorrect, and the definition of "bis" is
technically incorrect as well.

Terbo is not French for third. The word "bis" is French, but it does not actually
mean second. It is more likely to be interpreted to mean again or twice.

Change:
"Sometimes it also includes the word 'bis,' which means second in French."

To:
"Sometimes it also includes the word 'bis'."

Also change:
"If the standard also contains the word 'terbo,' which is French for third, it
indicates that the second, or bis, standard was also modified."

To:
"If the standard also contains the word 'terbo,' it indicates that the second, or
bis, standard was also modified."


Page 556: Error In Bridge Definition
------------------------------------

The list on page 556 outlines the abilities of a network bridge. The last bullet
is incorrect.

Change:
"Link unlike network segments such as Ethernet and Token Ring, and forward
packets between them."

To:
"A translation bridge can link unlike network segments such as Ethernet and Token
Ring, and forward packets between them."


Page 565: Fig. 7.14, Lower Left Router C Not Labeled
----------------------------------------------------

Figure 7.14 on page 565 shows a diagram of routers. In the text box for A's table
routing, Adjacent Router C is described; however, there is no router labeled as
C in the figure.

Line 2 of the small text box states:
Dest. Adjacent router Hops
H C 5

Instead, the text should state:
Dest. Adjacent router Hops
H F 4


Pages 567-569: Missing Page
---------------------------

In some copies of the "Networking Essentials, Second Edition" text, a printing
error resulted in problems with pages 567-569. In the affected books, The
