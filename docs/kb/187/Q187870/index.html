-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For troubleshooting purposes or because of corruption, you may find it necessary
to remove and reinstall the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, which includes Internet
Information Server (IIS) 4.0, as well Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) 2.0,
Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ) 1.0, and Internet Connection Services for
Microsoft RAS.

This article describes how to:

- Remove and reinstall just the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.

- Remove and reinstall both the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack and Microsoft
  Internet Explorer.

Short, general overviews of how to remove and reinstall the Windows NT 4.0 Option
Pack and/or Internet Explorer are provided for users who are familiar with these
products. Following the overview, more detailed instructions are also provided
for those users who are less familiar with them.

CAUTION: Virtual directories and virtual servers are NOT preserved when IIS is
removed.

servers, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

NOTES
-----

- It has been reported that some customers who have installed the final,
  released version of the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack over a beta version have
  needed to remove and reinstall the released version.

- IIS uses Windows NT Challenge Response as one of its security authentication
  options. For IIS to install correctly, the NT LM Security Support Provider
  service must be installed and running. If it is not, the Windows NT 4.0
  Option Pack Setup program may fail.
