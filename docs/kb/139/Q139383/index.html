SUMMARY
=======

Unimodem V is the newest release of Unimodem, the Windows universal modem
driver/telephony service provider for data/fax modems. Unimodem V provides the
driver support that sits between telephony applications and voice modems and
allows them to work together. This driver adds the most requested features to
support data/fax/voice modems, including wave file playback and recording to and
from the phone line, wave file playback and recording to and from the handset,
and support for speakerphones, Caller ID, distinctive ringing, and call
forwarding.

Independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
can include Unimodem V with voice modem hardware so that telephony applications
can run on their hardware. Independent software vendors (ISVs) can include
Unimodem V with telephony applications so that their applications can run on
voice modems that may not already include Unimodem V. Users can use Unimodem V
with a telephony application or a voice modem if neither includes Unimodem V.
