The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to play a sound clip on MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive
the following error message:

  Navigator not found

CAUSE
=====

You may receive the error message stated above if any one of the following
conditions exists:

- You are trying to play an incorrectly authored sound clip.

- You are trying to play a sound clip when MSN is very busy.

- You are trying to play a sound clip on a computer with mixed beta and release
  version DLL files. You may have installed the released version of MSN over a
  beta version, which may have left you with a mix of beta and release version
  DLL files.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the sound clip was incorrectly authored, we can fix it.

If MSN is very busy when you try to play a sound clip, the only solution is to
try to play the sound clip later.

If you installed the released version of MSN over a beta version, perform a clean
install of MSN. If the clean install does not solve the problem, call MSN Member
Support with the following information:

- Which sound clip were you trying to play?

- Where is the sound clip located on MSN?

- What was the time and date when you tried to play the sound clip?
