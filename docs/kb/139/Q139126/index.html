Last Modified: 08-AUG-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to access remote NetWare resources from a Windows for Workgroups
3.11, Windows NT 3.5x, or Windows 95 Remote Access (RAS) client. This article
discusses the requirements for accessing remote NetWare resources for each of
these RAS clients. This article assumes the use of a Windows NT 3.5x Server as
the RAS server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Client
----------------------------------

The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client only supports the NetBEUI protocol.
Therefore, the RAS server must act as a gateway to the NetWare resources.

On the RAS server, or any other Windows NT Server on the same network as your RAS
server, you must perform the following steps:

1. Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

2. Install Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW). GSNW is only available on
  Windows NT Server.

3. Use the GSNW icon in Control Panel to configure one or more Gateways to
  NetWare resources on your LAN. By configuring a Gateway to these NetWare
  resources, you are allowing access to NetWare resources from clients that are
  unable to connect directly to your NetWare servers but are able to connect to
  your Windows NT server.

  On the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client, connect to the NetWare
  resources by specifying the server name of the Windows NT Server running GSNW
  and the share name defined for the NetWare resources. Choose the Windows NT
  Server and share from the browse list or use the following format to connect
  directly to the share using the Path field of File Manager's Connect Network
  Drive dialog:

  \\&lt;Server_Name&gt;\&lt;Share_Name&gt;

Windows NT 3.5x RAS Client
--------------------------

Windows NT 3.5x RAS supports the IPX protocol over a RAS connection, eliminating
the need to use a Gateway to access NetWare resources from the RAS client. The
user account you use on your RAS client computer must have proper access
permission to resources you connect to on the NetWare servers.

On the RAS server, you must perform the following steps:

1. Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

2. Configure the RAS Server to allow remote clients running IPX. To enable this
  option, use the Network Control Panel applet and configure the Remote Access
  Service. Choose the Network button and select IPX in the Server Settings
  section. NetBEUI and TCP/IP can be enabled or disabled.

3. Choose the Configure button to the right of the IPX Checkbox. Make sure IPX
  clients have access to the entire network by selecting the Entire Network
  radio button.

On the Windows NT RAS client, you must perform the following steps:

1. Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

2. Install Client Services for NetWare (CSNW).

3. Edit your Remote Access PhoneBook entry for your RAS server and enable the
  IPX protocol. To enable the IPX protocol, select the Network button and
  select the IPX checkbox. You must use PPP as SLIP does not support the IPX
  protocol.

4. Once you are connected to the RAS server, connect to NetWare resources on the
  remote network using File Manager or the NET USE command. If you connect
  directly to the NetWare server instead of selecting the server and share from
  the browse list, the server name you enter should be the server name of the
  NetWare server and the share name should be the name of the volume on the
  NetWare server.

Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking Client
------------------------------------

Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking also supports IPX over the RAS connection. The user
account you use on your Dial-Up Networking client computer must have proper
access permission to resources you connect to on the NetWare servers.

On the RAS server, you must perform the following steps:

1. Install the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

2. Configure the RAS Server to allow remote clients running IPX. To enable this
  option, use the Network Control Panel applet and configure the Remote Access
  Service. Choose the Network button and select IPX in the Server Settings
  section. NetBEUI and TCP/IP can be enabled or disabled.

3. Choose the Configure button to the right of the IPX Checkbox. Make sure IPX
  clients have access to the entire network by selecting the Entire Network
  radio button.

On the Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking client, you must perform the following
steps:

1. Install the IPX/SPX Compatible protocol.

2. Install the Microsoft Client for NetWare networks.

3. Edit the properties of your Dial-Up Networking icon for your RAS server and
  enable the IPX protocol. To enable the IPX protocol, choose the Server Type
  button and enable the IPX/SPX Compatible checkbox in the Allowed Network
  protocols section.

4. Once you are connected to the RAS server, use the Network Neighborhood
  application to connect to resources on remote NetWare servers.

NOTE: If you use Windows NT RAS and you are running CSNW or Windows 95 Dial-Up
Networking and you are running the Microsoft Client for NetWare networks and you
connect with IPX to a remote, you will lose connectivity to all local NetWare
servers. You will only have NetWare connectivity to the remote network. You
cannot browse or reconnect to local NetWare servers as long as the RAS or
Dial-Up Networking connection exists.
