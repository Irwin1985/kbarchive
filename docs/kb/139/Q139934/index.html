INTRODUCTION
============

For the purposes of this document, a mobile user is defined as someone who
typically accesses the Microsoft Exchange Server from a remote location
over a slow link. Most roving users have a portable computer or laptop. The
Microsoft Exchange solution for mobile user support is to establish a
remote network connection to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer. Once a
remote networking connection has been established, the mobile user has
complete access and the same functionality that the LAN user has, but over
a slow link.

The Microsoft Exchange client provides a number of slow-link optimizations,
including the ability to work offline. Users can download all of their mail
or selectively download items using the Remote Mail window, which lists
only preview header information for each message. In addition, users can
choose to have only important messages downloaded over the modem and
download the other messages when a LAN connection is available. Also
available in the Remote Mail window is the ability to set up scheduled
connections that can remotely connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer at a pre-set time, download new mail, and disconnect
automatically. Users of the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system can also
take advantage of location settings, such as dialing prefixes and time
zones, that ease the process of connecting remotely.

Files that reside on the user's workstation include personal folder files
(.PST), personal address book (.PAB) files, and, optionally, an offline
copy of the corporate address book. The corporate address book is
configured on both the server and the client. On the server side, options
such as the server-generated offline address book, and generation frequency
are configured in the Administration program using the Site Directory
Configuration Object. The offline address book is stored in a public folder
and can be optionally replicated to other Microsoft Exchange Server
computers. On the client side, users can download the address book on
command either on the LAN or when connected remotely.

MODES OF OPERATION
==================

Two basic modes of operation are available for remote use of Microsoft
Exchange Server: a batch connection and a continuous connection. In a batch
connection, users have a local inbox or message store, and they can
selectively download mail using preview headers. Users can set up scheduled
connections and/or use filters to download mail. For example, users could
choose to only download messages sent directly to them or messages sent
from their manager. In a batch connection environment, users typically have
an offline copy of the corporate address book. The batch connection is the
most efficient method of receiving mail remotely, although it does not
allow access to public folders or Microsoft Schedule+ group scheduling,
which are available with a continuous connection. Continuous connections
also allow users to keep their inbox and corporate address book on the
server.

Client Installation
-------------------

Mobile users have a choice of installation options for the Microsoft
Exchange client. If they have a network connection, either on the LAN or
via a dial-up connection, they can install the Microsoft Exchange client
from an installation point on a server. Users can also install the
Microsoft Exchange client from compact disc or a disk set. Administrators
can also preconfigure installations for users by using the Client Setup
Editor, which ships with the Microsoft Exchange Administration utility.

Architecture for Mobile Users
-----------------------------

It's helpful to understand the architecture that enables remote access to
Microsoft Exchange. First, the server consists of a corporate network,
Microsoft Exchange Server running on Windows NT, and a dial-up server.
Dial-up servers include Windows NT RAS server, Shiva LanRover, and other
third-party remote access servers. Other optimizations may include a phone
switch that allows multiple users to connect remotely using the same
telephone number. The client must have:

- Remote network connectivity

- Network operating system

- Network protocols

- Modem with driver support

- Microsoft Exchange client

- Messaging profiles

Dial-Up Networking
------------------

The following table lists available dial-up networking solutions for
Microsoft Exchange.

  Windows NT client       Microsoft remote access service
                          (included with the operating system)

  Windows 95 client       Microsoft dial-up networking
                          (included with the operating system)

  Windows 3.x client      ShivaRemote
                          (included with the Microsoft Exchange client)

  MS-DOS client           ShivaRemote
                          (included with the Microsoft Exchange client)

Installing and Configuring ShivaRemote on Windows 3.x
-----------------------------------------------------

To install ShivaRemote on Windows 3.x, select the ShivaRemote component
during Microsoft Exchange client setup; this will install the Setup
program. Run the Shiva setup program from the icon located in the Microsoft
Exchange program group.  Next, install and configure ShivaRemote Dial-In
Driver and protocols (refer to Shiva's software configuration notes,
CONFIG.HLP).

Support for Roving Users and Messaging Profiles
-----------------------------------------------

A number of files can be stored on a network share to support roving users.
These include personal folders, personal address book, security files
(.EPF), and messaging profiles. Messaging profiles contain configuration
information such as folder and file locations, user preferences, and
service information. Windows NT and Windows 95 use a key in the user's
private branch of the registry. Windows 3.x profile information is stored
as an .INI file in the user's WINDOWS\MAPI directory. MS-DOS keeps profiles
as .PRO files in the user's EXCHANGE directory.

Roving User Support
-------------------

The following table describes roving user support for Windows NT, Windows
95, Windows 3.x, and MS-DOS.

  Windows NT &amp;   To store messaging profiles on a network file server,
  Windows 95     create and configure user profiles with User Profile
                 Editor and User Manager for Domains. Users must have
                 user rights on Windows NT computers and access to
                 appropriate domains.

  Windows 3.x    Clients can be installed on a network file server by
                 storing messaging profiles in the user's home directory
                 or network file server. Clients can also be installed
                 locally: In WIN.INI, under the [MAPI] section, add
                 ProfileDirectory16=&lt;path to profile&gt;.

  MS-DOS         Store messaging profiles in the user's home directory
                 on the network file server. Clients can also be
                 installed on a network file server.

Microsoft Schedule+
-------------------

Schedule+ has two modes of operation: offline or group enabled mode. Group
enabled mode requires a continuous connection to the Microsoft Exchange
Server computer, either on the LAN or connected remotely. The user's
Schedule+ file is stored both locally on the user's machine and in a hidden
folder in the user's mailbox on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
Changes to these files are synchronized when the user connects to the LAN
either directly or with a dial-up connection. Synchronization is performed
automatically by default every 15 minutes and can also be done manually.
Only changes are sent over the wire during the synchronization process.
Free/busy time is not available to users offline and is stored in a hidden
public folder on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
