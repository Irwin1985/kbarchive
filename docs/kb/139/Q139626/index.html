SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to drag objects between containers. This
example uses a custom container class and drags a bitmap image between the
containers. This example also shows how to drag an image within the control.
However, this example does not cover all the possible variations of dragging and
dropping objects; it is intended to demonstrate only the basic principles and
code necessary to implement drag and drop. You should be prepared to modify the
sample code given here to meet the needs of your situation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new class (on the File menu, click New, and then click Class).

2. In the New Class dialog box, name the class Containerx, select Container from
  the Based On combo box, and select a class library in which to store the
  class.

3. In the Class Designer, resize the container to make it perhaps one inch wide
  by two inches high. Accept the remaining defaults. Exit the Class Designer,
  and save your changes.

4. Create a new form, making it big enough to hold two containers.

5. Click the View Classes button on the Forms Control toolbar. Click Add, and
  select the library in which you stored the container class. Locate the button
  for the container class you created (Containerx), click it, and add it to the
  form. Repeat this step so that you have two containers (Containerx1 and
  Containerx2).

6. Add an image (Image1) to Containerx1. To do this:

  a. Select the Containerx1 container.

  b. Right-click the container, and then click Edit.

  c. Add the image (Image1) to the Containerx1 container.

     NOTE: Adding the image in this manner ensures that the image is added to
     the container, rather than simply floating on top of it.

7. Select the Image1 control. Set its DragDrop property to 1 (automatic), and
  set its Picture property to a bitmap image. The Fox.bmp in the Vfp directory
  is a good choice.

  NOTE: Because the DragMode property is set to automatic for the image, you do
  not need to code any events for the image. If the DragMode property were 0
  (manual), you would have to code the MouseDown and MouseUp events to call the
  Drag method.

8. To allow the image to be dragged or moved between containers, you need to
  provide a way to check and see if an image already exists in the container.
  Two custom properties can be added to help. On the Form menu, click New
  Property. Name the first property Container1pict and the second
  Container2pict. Click the Other tab of the Property sheet. Locate the
  Container1pict property, and set it to True (.T.). Keep the default value of
  False (.F.) for the second property (Container2pict).

9. Add code to the DragDrop event of both containers. This code executes when
  the object is released (dropped).

  a. Enter the following code in the DragDrop event of Containerx2:

           * The first line is already there.
           * oSource is a reference to the object being dragged.
           * nXcoord and nYcoord are the coordinates of the mouse pointer
           * within the target form. Their coordinates are taken from the
           * position of the tip of the mouse pointer.

        LPARAMETERS oSource, nXCoord, nYCoord

        oName = oSource.name
        * The IF test checks the Container1pict property. It it is true (.T),
        * the object already exists and you are moving it, so you can skip
        * the addobject procedures. If it is false (.F.), you need to run the
        * addobject procedures

        IF thisform.container1pict = .T.

        * Addobject adds an object of the type specified by oSource.class to
        * the container and gives it the name referenced by the oName
        * variable.
           this.addobject(oName,oSource.class)
           oRef=eval('this.'+oName)
           oRef.picture = oSource.picture

        * nXcoord and nYcoord are absolute form coordinates.
        * They need to be recalculated relative to the container.
          oRef.top = (nYcoord -(oRef.height/2))- this.top
          oRef.left = (nXcoord-(oRef.width/2)) - this.left

        * Addobject always sets the visible property to false (.F.).
        * This property must be reset when you are ready to display it.
          oRef.visible = .t.

        * You want only one copy or instance of the object:
          thisform.containerx1.removeobject(oName)
          oRef.dragmode = 1
          thisform.refresh
          thisform.container1pict = .f.
          thisform.container2pict = .t.

        ELSE

        * If the object already exists, you are moving it within the
        * container nXcoord and nYcoord are recalculated differently and
        * the move event is called.
        nXcoord = nXcoord - this.left
        nYcoord = nYcoord - this.top
        oSource.move((nXcoord-oSource.width/2),(nYcoord-oSource.height/2))
        oSource.visible = .t.

        ENDIF

  b. Enter the same code in DragDrop event the for Containerx1. Then edit the
     following lines of code in the DragDrop event of Containerx1:

        Containerx1 should read:
           IF thisform.container2pict = .T.
        Containerx2 should read:
           IF thisform.container1pict = .T.

        Containerx1 should read:
           thisform.containerx2.removeobject(oName)
        Containerx2 should read:
           thisform.containerx1.removeobject(oName)

        Containerx1 should read:
           thisform.container1pict = .t.
           thisform.container2pict = .f.
        Containerx2 should read:
           thisform.container1pict = .f.
           thisform.container2pict = .t.

10. Run the form. You should be able to drag the image from Containerx1 to
  Containerx2. The image should disappear from Containerx1. You should Then be
  able to move the image within Containerx2, or drag it back to Containerx1.
