The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

After you install Windows NT Service Packs (SPs), you may need to reinstall
customized Windows NT components or drivers provided by original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs). The following message may be displayed during Service Pack
Setup:

  Windows NT Service Pack Setup

  &lt;Path&gt;\&lt;Filename&gt;

  Your computer vendor installed this file on your computer. Do you want Service
  Pack Setup to replace this file?

Some OEM-provided drivers and components can be required to ensure proper
operation of some Windows NT installations. An example of OEM software is the
Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD). Installed Compaq SSD components can
require reinstallation or updates after installing a Windows NT Service Pack.
While Service Packs can update some OEM related components, Microsoft recommends
to reinstall the OEM provided software after installing a Microsoft Windows NT
Service Pack.

For best results, contact the supplier of the OEM drivers to obtain current
drivers, or to inquire about compatibility with Microsoft Windows NT Service
Packs. The manufacturer usually has special instructions for updating operating
system components.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compaq SSD's (Software Support Diskettes, also called SoftPaq's) create the
Compaq Support Software for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 diskette plus four
other diskettes that support the subsystems and features for Compaq Servers and
Professional Workstations. These device drivers / files are written by Compaq to
maximize hardware capabilities. Updates and/or additions to their driver files
are periodically rolled together into a single deliverable or "version".
SoftPaq's can copy files directly to harddisk or make installation diskettes.

Each version can be recognized by the date/time stamp on the files themselves.
Files issued together in a single version have a common timestamp (ie, Version
1.22, Revision A files show a timestamp of 1.22am.)

Current (7/7/97) is Version 1.22 Revision A (Release date 13 May 1997). It
includes:

* NetFlex/NetFlex-2/NetFlex-3 network adapter family * NetFlex-3 network adapter
monitoring, configuration and duplex utility * Compaq 10T PCI UTP and 10/100 TX
PCI UTP * IDA/IDA-2 disk controller * SMART/SMART-2 array controller * 32-Bit
SCSI-2 Family of controllers * ProLiant Storage System * System
Management/Health driver * UPS support * Compaq HAL Support (ISA, Uniprocessor,
and Multiprocessor) * Compaq Recovery Server, Standby Agent with SMART-2 support
* Compaq Recovery Server, Online Agent with SMART-2 support * Compaq Remote
Insight Board driver * Compaq Support Software diskette Installation utility *
Matrox Millennium video controller * ELSA Gloria-L video controller * ESS
AudioDrive audio controller

The following diskettes can be created when the SoftPaq is unbundled:
* Disk 1 - Compaq Support Software for Microsoft NT 3.51 and 4.0 Disk #1
* Disk 2 - Compaq Support Software for Microsoft NT 3.51 and 4.0 Disk #2
* Disk 3 - Matrox MGA Millennium Video Drivers and ESS 1868 Audio Drivers for
Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0
* Disk 4 - ELSA Gloria-L Video Drivers for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
* Disk 5 - ELSA Gloria-L Video Drivers for Microsoft Windows NT 3.51

For the previous Version, see Ver. 1.21 Revision A (27 March 1997)

An ASCII version list of the current SoftPaq files can be found at Compaq's Web
site or on their FTP server at:

ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/allfiles.txt

SPECIAL NOTE:
Prior to version 1.21a, SSD/SoftPaq's were Windows NT version specific - one for
WinNT 3.51 and a different SSD / SoftPaq for WinNT4.0.

Beginning with version 1.22a, the same SoftPaq/SSD works for either WinNT version
3.51 or 4.0 and for server or workstation.

The process of applying SSD's is similar to an upgrade of NT or the application
of a service pack. It essentially updates the existing files and drivers already
installed on the machine. It does not load new drivers or modify configuration
settings. Registry entries are used to identify the existing device drivers and
hardware configuration that will be updated. There is no detection process (like
what happens during an initial install of Windows NT) that allows new drivers to
be added or configuration changes to be made. New drivers must be added
manually.

For best results, contact Compaq to obtain current version or to inquire about
compatibility with Microsoft Windows NT Service Packs. Compaq may have special
instructions for updating operating system components depending on which NT
service pack is installed.

The latest SSD / SoftPaq can be downloaded from Compaq's Website via the
following link:

Windows NT Service Packs, contact Compaq Technical Support at (800) 652-6672.
