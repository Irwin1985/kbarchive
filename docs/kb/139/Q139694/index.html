-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the wizards that are available in Visual FoxPro along with a
brief description of each. Wizards are interactive programs that help you
quickly accomplish common tasks, such as creating forms, formatting reports, and
setting up queries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro contains the original wizards as well as new ones. Each Wizard and
its associated functions are listed below.

Cross-Tab Wizard
----------------

The Cross-Tab Wizard creates a cross-tab query for displaying the results of a
query in a spreadsheet format. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as
you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify the databases,
tables, and fields that you want to use in your Cross-Tab query.

Form Wizard
-----------

The Form Wizard creates a form for data entry from a single table. The wizard
prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in
which you specify the table and fields you want to use to create controls that
appear on your form. The size of the form is based on your Maximum Design Area
setting on the Forms tab of the Options dialog box.

Graph Wizard
------------

The Graph Wizard creates a graph from a Visual FoxPro table using Microsoft
Graph. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief
series of steps in which you specify the table and fields that you want to use
in your graph.

Group/Total Report Wizard
-------------------------

The Group/Total Report Wizard creates a summary report. The wizard prompts you
with simple questions and creates the expressions that group your data.

Import Wizard
-------------

The Import Wizard imports data into Visual FoxPro tables from other file formats.
The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of
steps in which you specify a source file and whether you want to create a new
file or append the data to an existing file.

Label Wizard
------------

The Label Wizard creates labels from a table. The wizard prompts you with simple
questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify the
table and fields that you want to use to create controls on your report.

Local View Wizard
-----------------

The Local View Wizard creates views using native data. The wizard prompts you
with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you
specify the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in your view. You
must have an existing database in which to store your view.

Mail Merge Wizard
-----------------

The Mail Merge Wizard creates either a data source for a Microsoft Word merged
document or a text file that can be used by any word processor. The wizard
prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in
which you specify the table and fields that you want to use.

One-to-Many Form Wizard
-----------------------

The One-to-Many Form Wizard creates a form for data entry from two related
tables. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief
series of steps in which you specify the tables and fields that you want to use
to create controls that appear on your form. The size of the form is based on
your Maximum Design Area setting on the Forms tab of the Options dialog box.

One-to-Many Report Wizard
-------------------------

The One-to-Many Report Wizard creates a report that groups records from a parent
table with records from a child table. The wizard prompts you with simple
questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify the
table and fields that you want to use to create controls on your report.

PivotTable Wizard
-----------------

The PivotTable Wizard creates pivot tables. A pivot table is an interactive
worksheet table that enables you to summarize and analyze data from existing
tables. You can choose either to save the pivot table directly in Microsoft
Excel or to add the pivot table as an embedded object on a form.

Query Wizard
------------

The Query Wizard creates queries. The wizard prompts you with simple questions as
you go through a brief series of steps in which you specify the databases,
tables, and fields that you want to use in your query.

Report Wizard
-------------

The Report Wizard creates reports using a single table. The wizard prompts you
with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you
specify the table and fields that you want to use to create controls on your
report.

Remote View Wizard
------------------

The Remote View Wizard creates views using remote data (ODBC). The wizard prompts
you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of steps in which you
specify the databases, tables, and fields that you want to use in your view. You
must have an existing database in which to store your view and an existing data
source or connection.

Table Wizard
------------

The Table Wizard creates tables based on typical table structures. You select a
table that fits your needs from the list of sample tables. You can customize the
table's structure and fields as you step through the wizard. You can also modify
the table at a later time after the wizard has saved the table.

The following wizards are included with the Professional version of Visual FoxPro
only.

Documenting Wizard
------------------

The Documenting wizard documents projects and program files. The wizard can also
create an analysis of your code and clean up the formatting in your code files.
The wizard prompts you with simple questions as you go through a brief series of
steps.

Setup Wizard
------------

The Setup Wizard creates distribution disks from the files in your distribution
tree. To learn about the distribution process and how to prepare your
distribution tree before running the Setup Wizard, see Chapter 10, "Creating
Distribution Disks," in the Professional Features Guide.

Upsizing Wizard
---------------

The Upsizing Wizard creates a SQL Server database that duplicates, as much as
possible, the functionality of a Visual FoxPro database.
