SUMMARY
=======

There may be times when you don't want to embed pictures in general fields in a
table. This article shows by example how to store the location of the picture
file in a field in a table. The field holds the absolute path name that points
to where the picture file can be found.

The technique in this article is especially useful for situations where your
pictures are updated on a regular basis but continue to use the same file name.
By using this technique, you can avoid having to update embedded pictures in a
table. As a result, your tables are physically smaller, you always have the most
current picture available to your application, and you continue to achieve the
same functionality as you would with an embedded picture.

Although using an embedded path reference in place of an absolute file reference
is not documented, you can achieve this functionality by using the Report Writer
as documented in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the Visual FoxPro Report Writer, you can place general fields that contain
pictures into your report, or you can place the pictures themselves into your
report. Depending on your requirements, it may be more efficient and easier to
point FoxPro to the location of the picture file instead of embedding the data
in a general field.

When an OLE container is placed in a report, you are given two choices. You can
insert a picture from either a file or a field. When you point Visual FoxPro to
a file, the file contents are physically displayed in the report both while you
are designing it and at run time as well. The other option is to point to a
general field in a table, which will display the picture data only when the
report is run.

The third, undocumented way to display pictures in a report is to put a reference
to a field which contains absolute path and file information in the 'Picture
from file' radio button field contents.

The following steps demonstrate how to achieve this result. To make this work,
you must have the FOX.BMP file in the location specified in the INSERT INTO
statement. If your location is different, modify the statement accordingly.

1. Type each of the following commands in the Command window:

     CREATE TABLE picttest (Cust_name C(5), Pict_Loc C(30))
     INSERT INTO picttest (Cust_name, Pict_Loc) Values ;
        ("McGoo","C:\VFP\FOX.BMP")
     CREATE REPORT picttest

2. Add the Picttest table to the report's data environment by right- clicking
  the report, and then clicking Data Environment. Right-click the data
  environment, and click Add.

3. In the Add Table or View dialog box, click Other and select the Picttest
  table.

4. In the Report Designer, place a field control in the Detail band on the
  report. The field's expression value should be:

     picttest.cust_name

5. Add a Picture/OLE Bound Control field to the report in the Detail band. Set
  the field's Picture from File property to:

     picttest.pict_loc

6. Run the report. You should see a single record displayed along with the
  FoxPro logo.
