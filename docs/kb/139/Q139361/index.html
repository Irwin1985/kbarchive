SUMMARY
=======

This article holds Section 3, Issues and Considerations, of the Readme.wri file
found in the main Visual SourcesSafe directory (Vssafe by default). For more
information about other sections of the Readme.wri file, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139358 Readme.wri: Section 1, Software Installation Information

  Q139359 Readme.wri: Section 2, General Notes and Tips

  Q139360 Readme.wri: Section 4, Documentation Notes

  Q139362 Readme.wri: Section 5, New Features of Visual SourceSafe


MORE INFORMATION
================

Loss of Network Connection Produces Numerical Error Message
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you are in the middle of a Visual SourceSafe session and lose your connection
to a server over the network, the only message you see is a numerical message
informing you of an unknown error. When you see, "unknown error - 20038," or
something similar, you have lost your network connection. Restart Visual
SourceSafe and continue your work.

File List Not Always Automatically Updated for Certain Actions After Search
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file list displayed in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer is not always updated
for certain actions after completion of a global or recursive wildcard or status
search. In these cases, use the Refresh File List command on the View menu to
update the display.

Example 1: A global or recursive search has completed and the results view
displays the results of that search. You share a file from the results view with
Project1. Project1 contained no files meeting the search criteria before the
share action. After the share action, Project1 has a child, Project2, that now
meets the search criteria. The file list display does not show the contents of
Project2 until you use the Refresh File List command. If Project1 is already in
the results view, the shared file shows up in the display.

Adding a file or a project after a search produces a similar situation. If a
parent did not appear in the results view before the share or the add, the
shared or added file does not appear in the results view. If the parent was
there, the new added or shared file does appear in the display.

Example 2: Three projects are displayed in the results view after a search. Two
projects share a file. If you check out the file from one of the projects, you
need to use the Refresh File List command to see the "checked out" icon on all
instances of the shared file in the file list.

Considerations for 16-Bit Systems
---------------------------------

When you run Visual SourceSafe in Windows 3.1 16-bit systems, you are limited to
one instance of Visual SourceSafe Explorer or Visual SourceSafe Administrator at
a time.

In addition, you can run only one instance of Visual SourceSafe-Visual Basic
integration at a time. If you need to run more than one instance of Visual
SourceSafe-Visual Basic integration to debug a program for example, you can use
the following procedure:

1. From the Visual Basic Tools menu, check out the files you want to change.

2. On the Add-Ins menu, click Add-In Manager to display the Add-In Manager
  dialog box.

3. Clear the Source Code Control Add-In check box.

4. Debug your program.

5. On the Add-Ins menu, click Add-In Manager to display the Add-In Manager
  dialog box.

6. Click the Source Code Control Add-In check box.

7. Check in your changed files.

Considerations for NEC PC 9801 Systems
--------------------------------------

The memory manager used by Visual SourceSafe MS-DOS programs is not compatible
with the NEC PC 9801 computer. Visual SourceSafe programs for Windows 3.1,
Windows NT, and Windows 95 are fully compatible with the NEC PC 9801 computer.

If you use an NEC PC 9801 computer, do not run any programs from the command line
in the Visual SourceSafe \Dos directory, which is under the directory in which
you installed Visual SourceSafe. These programs include the following programs
and utilities: Analyze.exe, Ddconv.exe, Delta_Ss.exe, Mkss.exe, Pvcs_Ss.exe,
Ssint.exe, Sslogin.exe, Testlock.exe, and Unlock.exe. If you run these programs
from the \Dos directory, you might have to reboot your computer.

To use these programs, run them from the \Win or \Win32 directories under the
directory in which you installed Visual SourceSafe. This restriction applies
only to the NEC PC 9801 computer.

Considerations when Cancelling a Client Setup
---------------------------------------------

When you choose the Client Setup option to install Visual SourceSafe, you must
type a path for the Visual SourceSafe server directory. If you click Cancel in
the Database Location dialog box, Setup displays the following message in error,
"Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 4.0 Setup was completed successfully." Disregard
this message. The setup was not completed. Although a directory tree was created
on your hard disk for the client, you cannot connect with the database on the
server.

To correct this situation, edit the Srcsafe.ini file created by the cancelled
Client setup. Add a line including the path to the Srcsafe.ini file for the
Visual SourceSafe database server in a #include statement. You can include a UNC
path, for example:

  #include \\SRCSERVR\SRCSHARE\VSS4\SRCSAFE.INI

Alternatively, you can include the path to a mapped drive, for example:

  #include R:\VSS\SRCSAFE.INI

Considerations when Installing on Alpha and Mips Systems
--------------------------------------------------------

When you install Visual SourceSafe 4.0 on an Alpha or Mips system, you might see
two messages informing you that certain files can't be opened. These files are
Mfc30.dll and Msvcrt20.dll, which are installed in the \Windows\System
directory. If you have already installed these files during another the
installation of another product and the files are already open, click Ignore in
the message boxes and continue with your installation of Visual SourceSafe 4.0.

Considerations When Choosing SourceSafe Database from IDEs
----------------------------------------------------------

When you have multiple SourceSafe databases, the Advanced options for Source
Control from within an IDE allows you to choose to be prompted for a database
name to connect to. In your Srcsafe.ini file, you must explicitly name a data
path, by using the Data_Path initialization variable, for each of the multiple
databases. The Choose SourceSafe Database dialog box prompts you for a name, and
uses that name to connect to the database you want.

If you have not explicitly supplied a data path in your Srcsafe.ini file for each
database, the IDE might not find the database you want and you will be connected
to the default database. To connect to one of multiple databases, you must
provide a separate Data_Path value with an explicit path and a named value for
each database you want to connect to. By including a named value within
parentheses, such as Data_Path(scc), you can then use the value in parentheses
when prompted for a data path.

Considerations When Acting on .Frm Files from Within Visual SourceSafe
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you perform an action on a Visual Basic .frm file from within Visual
SourceSafe, the .frx file associated with the .frm file is not affected by the
action you perform. For example, if you check out an .frm form, the associated
.frx file is not checked out. To keep the associated files synchronized, perform
all actions from within the Visual Basic environment, not from standalone Visual
SourceSafe. Alternatively, you can perform the actions from within standalone
Visual SourceSafe, but you must perform the same action on the.frx file that you
perform on the .frm file.

Considerations When Installing on Netware 4.02 and Banyan 5.52 Systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you install Visual SourceSafe on Netware 4.02 and Banyan 5.52 systems, the
Setup program generates a message telling you to use the following command:
SETUP /F. When you use that command, Setup generates error code 997, indicating
that your setup files may have been damaged. Disregard that message. The setup
files have not been damaged.

To install Visual SourceSafe on these systems, follow these steps:

1. Use Setup to install the Visual SourceSafe server option on the hard disk of
  your local computer in a directory such as C:\Vss.

2. Use XCOPY to copy the directory in which you installed Visual SourceSafe and
  all of its subdirectories to your server.

After copying all Visual SourceSafe directories and files to a Netware 4.02 or
Banyan 5.52 system, you can perform all Visual SourceSafe actions, including
Netsetup for client installations. However, removing Visual SourceSafe by using
the Setup program might not work. To remove all Visual Source files and
directories, use the MS-DOS command DELTREE to delete the directory in which you
installed Visual SourceSafe and all its subdirectories and files.
