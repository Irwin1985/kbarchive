- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the availability of Microsoft's 32-bit Data Link Control
(MSDLC32) protocol and provides information regarding Microsoft support policies
for this protocol.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSDLC32 Explanation and Availability
------------------------------------

MSDLC32 is a 32-bit networking protocol for Windows 95. Its primary use is by
3270 emulators for connectivity to IBM mini/mainframe computers. In many
implementations, it replaces the 16-bit MSDLC that is currently available. The
benefits of MSDLC32 are improved performance and an increase of available
conventional memory. A configuration reporting and logging utility, Trcdlc.exe,
is included. To download the Msdlc32.exe file, please see the "Instructions for
Downloading" section later in this article.

MSDLC32 Support Information
---------------------------

Microsoft Product Support Services supports the following: installation of this
protocol through the user interface; functionality of the configuration dialog
boxes; and booting without error with the protocol installed. Desktop Systems
supports the command-line syntax of the Trcdlc utility. For more information
about the command-line parameters for Trcdlc.exe, please consult the Readme.doc
provided with the add-on.

Microsoft will not support issues related to connecting to another computer with
this protocol. For more information about server-related settings or other
information regarding setting requirements to connect to the server with
MSDLC32, please contact your System Administrator or the manufacturer of the
network software.

Installation
------------

1. Double-click Msdlc32.exe in the folder to which you downloaded the file.

  NOTE: Do not run the Msdlc32.exe file in the Windows or Windows\System folder.
  If you downloaded the file to either of these locations, copy it to a
  temporary folder on your hard disk.

2. Create an installation disk or create a temporary folder on your hard disk
  and copy the files included in the Msdlc32.exe file to that location.

3. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

4. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

5. In the Network dialog box, click Add, and in the Select Network Component
  Type dialog box, double-click Protocol.

6. In the Select Network Protocol dialog box, click Have Disk.

7. Specify the drive and path where the Msdlc32.exe files are located. For
  example, if you created an installation disk, type

  &lt;drive&gt;:\

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive where your installation disk is
  located.

  Or if you created a temporary folder, type

  c:\&lt;folder&gt;

  where &lt;folder&gt; is the temporary folder to which you copied the
  Msdlc32.exe file.

8. Click OK.

9. Click "Microsoft 32-bit DLC," and then click OK.

10. When you are prompted to do so, insert the Windows 95 disks so that other
  network components can be reinstalled.

11. When you are prompted to do so, shut down your computer and restart Windows
  95.
