SYMPTOMS
========

If a source file is saved while the project is being built, the relationships
between the source file and the .obj file may be incorrect. The saved source
file may have an earlier date than the .obj file that was created from the
previous version of the source file.


CAUSE
=====

The problem of file modify or save time being incorrect is caused by the
Developer's Studio doing front-end processing on all the files before it creates
the .obj files. This makes it possible to save a changed file after the earlier
version was processed but before the .obj file is created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open one of the files in a project, but don't open the file that will be used
  to create a .pch file (Stdafx.cpp in an MFC application).

2. Start a Rebuild All.

3. Introduce a syntax error in the open file, but do not save it.

4. While the Rebuild All progresses, look in the output window, and wait for it
  to compile the open file.

5. As soon as it finishes compiling the file, and before it says "Generating
  Code," save the changed file that has a syntax error. Because the changes
  occurred after the front end of the compiler has processed the file, there
  will be no errors in the build. The .obj file will however have a later date
  because it was created in the "Generating Code" phase.

6. Do a Build (not a Rebuild All). Nothing will happen, and the changed file
  will not be compiled.

7. Look at the dates of the files, and confirm that the .obj file is newer than
  the file that was changed.
