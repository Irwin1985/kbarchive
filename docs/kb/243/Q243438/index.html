-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server intersite directory replication does not work properly, and the
following events are logged in the application event log on an Exchange Server
replication bridgehead server:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeDS
  Event Category: Replication
  Event ID: 1224
  Description:
  Fatal replication error (internal ID 303025f). Parameter(s) 2615834 941779.
  Contact Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeDS
  Event Category: Internal Processing
  Event ID: 1171
  Description:
  Exception e0010002 has occurred with parameters 9 and 111 (internal ID
  3030260). Contact Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server computer that is receiving these events has one or more
objects in its directory with USN-Changed attribute values greater than the
latest USN-Changed attribute value given to an object in the directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you can use command-line directory export, search for
all objects with a USN-Changed attribute value greater than the latest change
made in the directory, and then modify those objects.

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

To find the highest expected USN-Changed attribute value on the Exchange Server
computer:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Open the properties of a mailbox or custom recipient.

3. Make a change to that object (such as the city or phone number), and click
  OK.

4. Open the raw properties of that same object and look at the value for the
  USN-Changed attribute. Make a note of this value for a future step.

To find the directory objects that have incorrect USN-Changed attribute values,
run a command-line directory export, and analyze the resulting export file:

1. Create a plain text file with the following text, and save it in the
  Exchsrvr\Bin folder with the file name Usn.csv:

  Obj-Class,Directory Name,Obj-Dist-Name,Is-Deleted,USN-Changed

2. Create a plain text file with the following text, and save it in the
  Exchsrvr\Bin folder with the filename Export.ini:

  [Export]
  DirectoryService=&lt;Your_Exchange_Server_Name&gt;
  Basepoint=/o=&lt;Your_Exchange_Organization_Name&gt;
  Subcontainers=Yes
  ExportObject=All
  RawMode=yes
  HiddenObjects=yes
  InformationLevel=Full

3. Open a command prompt in the Exchsrvr\Bin folder, and run the following
  command:

  "admin /e usn.csv /o export.ini" (without the quotation marks)

4. After the export is finished, open the Usn.csv file in a spreadsheet or in
  database software, and sort the information based on the USN-Changed
  attribute values. You need to correct the objects in the spreadsheet that
  have a higher USN-Changed attribute value than the highest USN-Changed
  attribute value found in step 4 of the first procedure.

To correct the USN-Changed attribute values of these problem objects, start the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, and make changes to the objects
whose USN-Changed attribute value is too high. These objects will be assigned
new USN-Changed attribute values that are correct for the server.

After you make the modifications to the problem objects in the Exchange Server
directory, replication should start working again on its own.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an Exchange Server computer receives a request from another site to
replicate information, the server checks all the objects in its local Exchange
Server directory to make sure that all of the USN-Changed attribute values are
equal to or less than the latest USN-Changed attribute value assigned to an
object in the directory.

If it finds objects that have USN-Changed attribute values that are greater than
what that server would assign to the next change in its directory, then an error
condition exists, replication stops, and the two events listed in the "Symptoms"
section are written to the application event log.

In the resolution, the Obj-Dist-Name attribute is included in the .csv file so
that you can find the exact location of the object in the Exchange Server
directory. The Is-Deleted attribute is included so that you can see potential
problem objects that have been deleted but not permanently removed from the
directory (this is called "tombstoning"). If this is the case, the Is-Deleted
value for the objects is set to 1. For additional information about tombstoned
objects, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
