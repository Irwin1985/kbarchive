-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Integrated Debugger, included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When stopping at a breakpoint or stepping over a line in the Visual C++
debugger, you may receive an error like one of the following:

  The instruction at "0x52512627" referenced memory at "0x00000000". The memory
  could not be "read".

  The instruction at "0x5251263e" referenced memory at "0x00000003". The memory
  could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

An internal buffer overflow occurs on some long undecorated symbol names of
functions or variables. (The name won't necessarily appear to be long in the C++
source code.)

==========
