The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Systems Management Server (SMS) service account is the account used by the
SMS_Site_Component_Manager and SMS_Executive services.

The default name for the SMS service account is SMSService. You can change this
name during SMS installation or by following the steps in this article. By
default, the account is a member of the Domain Administrators global group and
has the "Logon as a Service" advanced user right.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is a good idea to create a new account instead of changing the password for
the existing account. This will avoid error messages from the Status system and
possible authentication failure/lockout problems caused by domain and SMS
synchronization. After you establish the new account, you can delete the old
account.

To create a new account:

1. Start User Manager for Domains.

2. Copy the existing SMS service account and give it a new name, such as
  SMSSERVICE2. Microsoft recommends giving the account a strong password (a
  combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).

To update the existing account or specify a new account for the SMS service
account:

1. Modify the existing account in User Manager for Domains or create a new
  account. The account must have "Logon as a Service" rights.

2. Run SMS Setup on the site. Choose to modify or reset the current
  installation, and specify the new account and/or password. The account must
  be in DOMAIN\ACCOUNT format. Note that on a secondary site, you must run
  Setup from the SMS CD-ROM or the original source files because there is no
  local SMS program group.

3. If you are changing the SMS service account used by a secondary site, update
  the new account information by opening the Site properties for the secondary
  site. To do this, right-click the secondary site in the Administrator
  console, click Properties, and then change the account on the Accounts tab.
  After you update the account in the Site properties, reset the account by
  clicking "Modify or Reset the current installation" in SMS setup and
  specifying the new account.

  NOTE: if the site runs Systems Management Server Service Pack 2 or later, you
  need only change a secondary site's service account password in Site
  properties at the parent site. The password is updated at the secondary site
  with no site reset necessary. To verify that the account has been updated at
  the secondary site, enable and view the Hman.log (hierarchy manager log) file
  at the secondary site. It indicates that the service account name has
  changed. A "3309" status message is also generated, indicating the account
  change.

4. If you have specified the SMSService account (which you have just changed)
  for other sites to use when they are addressing this site, you must update
  the account information for every site that has an address for this site. To
  do this, start the SMS Administrator console, open the Site Hierarchy node,
  and then locate the Addresses node. Right-click the address for the site
  whose account has changed, click Properties, and then click Set under
  Account. You must specify the account in DOMAIN\ACCOUNT format.

5. The sites may have had trouble communicating while the accounts and passwords
  were not synchronized. After the site status message processing has caught
  up, reset the component status counts. To determine if there is a backlog of
  status messages, look at the Sms\Inboxes\Statmgr.box folders. Depending on
  how long the accounts were not synchronized, it may take from 1 to 2 days for
  Status Manager to process the messages. To reset the status counts,
  right-click the components with the error messages and warnings, and then
  click Reset Counts, All. When you refresh the site status, all the components
  turn green (no error messages). Note that resetting the counters does not
  delete status messages. You can still see previous messages in the Status
  Message Viewer tool. If a component continues to experience an error, it
  continues to generate status messages and the component status is updated.

For more information about SMS security, refer to the SMS Administrator's Guide,
Chapter 4, "Creating your Security Strategy." The SMS Administrator's Guide is
also available by using the online Help.
