SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft TCP/IP on a computer running Windows NT 4.0, you may be
able to predict a session's initial sequence numbers (ISN). Someone can use this
information to attack a computer by posing as a trusted user.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the individual package referenced below or obtain
the Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup Package. For additional information on the
SRP, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q299444 Post-Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a Security Rollup Package (SRP)

NOTE: This fix was reposted on November 9, 1999 to resolve the following error
message encountered while applying the hotfix:

STATUS
======

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT 4.0.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the TCP/IP protocol suite, data is exchanged in the form of packets. Because
of the way TCP/IP performs routing, the path taken by packets can change
dynamically throughout a session. This means that if Host A and B are
communicating and Host A sends two packets, they could potentially take
different paths to Host B, and could arrive out of order. Host B must therefore
have a way to re-assemble the packets (containing the data in octets) in correct
order.

TCP/IP provides a way to do this using sequence numbers. Starting from an initial
sequence number (ISN) that each host provides as part of the session setup, each
octet is assigned a sequence number that is one larger than that of its
predecessor. For example, if Host B provides 123 as the initial sequence number
for its session with Host A, Host A's first octet is numbered 123, the second is
numbered 124, the third is numbered 125, etc.

If someone attempts to launch an attack against another computer and the attacker
can predict how a host selects ISNs, it's possible to conduct two types of
attacks, known as IP address spoofing and session hijacking. The more random the
ISNs are, the more difficult it is to carry out these attacks.
