-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the rudder control for your game controller in Flight
Simulator 2000 or Flight Simulator 2002, it may not function properly. This
behavior can occur even if the rudder control functions properly when you
calibrate and test your game controller in the Game Controllers tool in Control
Panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following troubleshooting methods in the order in
which they are presented.

Disable Auto-Coordination
-------------------------

The Auto-Coordination feature disables the rudder controller. If the game does
not respond when you use the rudder controls for your game controller,
Auto-Coordination may be enabled. To disable Auto-Coordination:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator.

2. On the Aircraft menu, click Realism Settings.

3. Under "Flight controls," click to clear the Auto-rudder check box.

4. Click the green check mark.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reset the Default Game Controller Actions
-----------------------------------------

To reset the default actions assigned to the game controller:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator.

2. On the Options menu, point to Controls, and then click Assignments.

3. In the "Joystick type" box on the Buttons/Keys tab, click the game controller
  you want to use, and then click "Reset defaults."

4. Click the "Joystick axes" tab.

5. In the "Joystick type" box, click the game controller you want to use, and
  then click "Reset defaults."

6. To check if the default events are selected for your 4-axis game controller,
  verify that the Axis settings for each Event match the settings in the
  following table:

  
  +-------------------------------------+
  | Event                  | Axis       | 
  +-------------------------------------+
  | Elevator axis          | Axis 02    | 
  +-------------------------------------+
  | Ailerons axis          | Axis 01    | 
  +-------------------------------------+
  | Rudder axis (FS2000)   | Axis 04    | 
  +-------------------------------------+
  | Rudder axis (FS2002)   | Z-Rotation | 
  +-------------------------------------+
  | Throttle axis (FS2000) | Axis 03    | 
  +-------------------------------------+
  | Throttle axis (FS2002) | Slider     | 
  +-------------------------------------+

If the default actions are not selected, assign the default actions manually. To
do this:

1. To assign events to the buttons on your game controller, click the
  Buttons/Keys tab.

  To assign events to the axes on your game controller, click the "Joystick
  axes" tab.

2. In the "Joystick type" box, click the game controller you want to use.

3. In the Event column, click an event you want to assign to a button or an axis
  on your game controller, and then click "Change assignment."

4. On the game controller, press the button or move the axis you want to use for
  the selected action.

  If you receive a warning message that a different action is already assigned
  to the game controller button or axis, click the green check mark to accept
  the new assignment, or click Clear to assign the event to a different button.

5. When you finish manually assigning events to the buttons and axes on your
  game controller, click the green check mark, and then click OK.

NOTE: If an event is assigned to an axis on your game controller, but the event
behaves in reverse (for example, up instead of down, or right instead of left),
click to select or clear the check box in the Reverse column for that axis.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Calibrate the Joystick in Flight Simulator
------------------------------------------

To calibrate your game controller:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator.

2. On the Options menu, point to Controls, and then click Calibrate Joystick.

  NOTE: If Calibrate Joystick is unavailable, click Enable Joystick, and then
  repeat this step.

3. In the Game Controllers box on the General tab, click the game controller you
  want to use, and then click Properties.

4. On the Settings tab, move the sliders to the settings you want.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Disable Sound
-------------

NOTE: Only for gameport devices.

To determine if there is a problem with the sound card or sound card driver,
disable the sound in Flight Simulator. To do this, press the Q key.

If the issue is resolved when you disable sound in the game, contact your sound
card manufacturer for information about how to obtain and install an updated
driver for your sound card.

For information about how to contact your sound card manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce Sound Playback Quality
-----------------------------

If the issue is resolved when you disable sound in the game, your sound card may
be unable to properly process game port signals and high quality game sounds at
the same time. If so, you may be able to work around the issue by reducing the
sound playback quality in the game. To do this:

NOTE: The following steps will only work in Flight Simulator 2000. They are not
intended and will not work in Flight Simulator 2002.

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

2. In the Named box, type "fs2000.cfg" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, double-click the Fs2000.cfg file.

5. If you are prompted to select the program you want to use to open the file,
  click Notepad in the "Choose the program you want to use" box, and then click
  OK.

6. Scroll to the end of the file, press ENTER twice, and then type the following
  lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:

  [SOUND]
  Channels=1
  SamplesPerSec=11025

7. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Configure the Game Controller As a Different Device
---------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Only for analog devices. Not for USB devices.

Use the Game Controllers tool in Control Panel to configure your game controller
as a different device.

NOTE: You cannot configure any Microsoft SideWinder game controller except the
SideWinder Standard or the SideWinder 3D Pro as a different device.

For example, to configure a SideWinder 3D Pro joystick as a 3-axis 4-button
joystick with Rudder/Pedals:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers, and then click Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro.

3. Click Remove, and then click Yes.

4. Click Add, click 3-Axis, 4-Button Joystick, and then click OK.

5. Click Properties.

6. On the Settings tab, click to select the Rudder/Pedals check box.

7. Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
  the game controller.

  NOTE: Axis 3 is the throttle control, and axis 4 is the rudder control.

8. Click Test to verify that the game controller functions properly.

9. When you finish calibrating and testing the game controller, click OK, and
  then click OK again.
