SUMMARY
=======

Turning on logging for process accounting can be done for the entire Web server,
for each individual Web site, or even for virtual directories within a given Web
site.

To turn on Process Accounting Logging, do the following:

1. Open the Internet Service Manager MMC.

2. Choose Properties of either the Web server or the Web site.

3. Click on the Enable Logging checkbox.

4. Choose Extended Log Format.

5. Click the Properties button for Extended Logs.

6. Check the available Process Accounting entries.

Below is a list of entries that might appear in the IIS extended log and a brief
explanation of what each entry means.

Process Event - The type of process that triggered the event, either CGI or
out-of-process application. The type can be CGI, Application, or All.

Process Type - What event was triggered: Site-Stop, Site-Start, Site-Pause,
Periodic-Log, Interval-Start, Interval-End, Interval-Change, Update,
Eventlog-Limit, Priority-Limit, Process-Stop-Limit, Site-Pause-Limit,
Eventlog-Limit-Reset, Priority-Limit-Reset, Process-Stop-Limit-Reset, or
Site-Pause-Limit:

- Site-Stop - The Web site was stopped.

- Site-Start - The Web site was started or re-started.

- Site-Pause - The Web site was paused.

- Periodic-Log - This is a regularly defined log entry whose interval was
  specified by the administrator.

- Reset Interval-Start - The Reset Interval has begun.

- Reset Interval-End - The Reset Interval has been reached and reset.

- Reset Interval-Change - The Web site administrator changed the value for the
  Reset Interval.

- Update - One of these events happened: the log interval was changed, an
  interval event took place, the site either stopped, started, or paused.

- Eventlog-Limit - An event log was made for the Web site because its CPU
  resource usage for CGI and out-of-process application reached the event log
  limit set by the administrator.

- Priority-Limit - The Web site had a CGI or out-of-process application set to
  low priority because it reached the low priority limit set by the
  administrator.

- Process-Stop-Limit - The Web site had a CGI or out-of-process application
  stopped because it reached the process stopping limit set by the
  administrator.

- Site-Pause-Limit - The Web site was paused because it had a CGI or
  out-of-process application reach the site pause limit set by the
  administrator.

- Eventlog-Limit-Reset - The Reset Interval was reached or the Eventlog-Limit
  was manually changed.

- Priority-Limit-Reset - The Reset Interval was reached or the Priority-Limit
  was manually changed.

- Process-Stop-Limit-Reset - The Reset Interval was reached or the
  Process-Stop-Limit was manually changed.

- Site-Pause-Limit - The Reset Interval was reached or the Site-Pause-Limit was
  manually reset.

Total User Time - The total accumulated User Mode processor time, in seconds,
that the site has used during the current interval.

Total Kernel Time - The total accumulated Kernel Mode processor time, in seconds,
that the site has used during the current interval.

Total Page Faults - The total number of memory references that resulted in memory
page faults.

Total Processes - The total number of CGI and out-of-process applications created
during the current interval.

Active Processes - The total number of CGI and out-of-process applications
running when the log was recorded.

Total Terminated Processes - The total number of CGI and out-of-process
applications stopped due to Process Throttling during the current interval.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Process Accounting allows IIS 5.0 to track the amount of CPU time each ASP and
CGI application is using. A determination can be made from the log files down to
the millisecond the amount of time during a 24-hour period that any given
application is running.

These data are extremely useful when trying to track down exactly which
applications are running the most on an IIS server or if an application is
taking too much processor time.
