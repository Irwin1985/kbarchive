-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a new advertisement, one or more Systems Management Server
(SMS) clients outside the targeted collection may receive the advertised
program.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the SMS site server assigns an instruction file that
was previously assigned to a client to another client. This condition occurs
when advertisement instruction files are deleted from the
SMS\Inboxes\Offerinf.box folder by the SMS Offer Manager component or manually.

This deletion can occur when an advertisement is deleted and the corresponding
instruction files are set to zero bytes in size. Later, SMS Offer Manager
deletes the zero-byte files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

Because the client's local .lkp file still indicates the name of the old
instruction file, you must delete these files from the client's local
%SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Clicomp\Swdist32\CAP folder. To eliminate any potential for
this problem, delete all of the files and folders in the CAP folder from all SMS
clients. This forces the SMS client to rebuild this information from the data on
the client access point (CAP).

Because this behavior is associated with deleting an advertisement, you can also
avoid the problem by not deleting advertisements. Instead of deleting an
advertisement, you can disable an advertised program on the Advanced tab of the
program's properties.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
