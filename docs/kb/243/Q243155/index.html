-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to download the offline Address Book by using an Exchange
Client or Outlook, the download may not work and the following error message may
be displayed:

  An error occurred while opening the Microsoft Exchange offline address book
  files on the Microsoft Exchange Server. See your administrator.

After you click OK, the following error message is displayed:

  Unable to download the Offline Address Book. The Microsoft Exchange Address
  Book could not be accessed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Perform the following steps to troubleshoot this problem:

1. Attempt to download the offline Address Book while you are logged on with the
  Exchange Server service account. If you can successfully download the offline
  Address Book while you are logged on to a mailbox with the credentials of the
  Exchange Server service account, the Exchange Server service account may have
  been given Search permissions on the Organization, Site, or Site
  Configuration containers.

2. If this problem does not affect Outlook version 8.03 and later, make sure
  that on the Offline Address Book tab of the DS Site Configuration properties,
  the "Microsoft Exchange 4.0 and 5.0 compatibility" option is selected. If
  this option is not selected when the offline Address Book is generated, the
  error message in the "Symptoms" section of this article is displayed with
  Exchange Clients 4.0 and 5.0 and Outlook versions earlier than Outlook
  version 8.03.

3. For testing purposes, create a new Recipients container and place a small
  number of recipients in this container. Click the Configuration container,
  double-click DS Site Configuration, and then click the Offline Address Book
  tab. Remove all of the containers from the list, add the new Recipients
  container, and then click Generate All. This helps you determine whether or
  not the issue is Address container specific.

4. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Configuration
  container, double-click DS Site Configuration, click the Offline Address Book
  tab, and then select another server in the site as the offline Address Book
  server. Add any Address containers that you want to the list, and then click
  Generate All. This step helps you determine whether or not the issue is
  server specific.

5. If step 4 resolves the problem, there may be a problem with the public
  information store on the original offline Address Book server. You may
  resolve the problem with the public information store if you run the Isinteg
  utility. Microsoft highly recommends that you contact Microsoft Product
  Support Services before you run any offline utility against an Exchange
  Server database.
