IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to perform a clean boot in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps can help you to determine if the problem that you are
experiencing is due to the real-mode configuration of your computer. This could
include drivers that are loaded from your Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files.

1. Restart your computer. When the Starting Windows 95 dialog box is displayed,
  press F8, and then choose Step-By-Step Confirmation from the Startup menu.

2. When you are prompted, load the following items (if you are prompted to load
  any other items, press N):

   - Dblspace driver.

   - Himem.sys.

   - Ifshlp.sys.

   - Dblbuff.sys.

   - Load the Windows 95 graphical user interface (GUI), choosing to load all
     Windows drivers.

NOTE: Windows 95 does not require the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files, but some
tools installed on the computer may require them. You should never rename the
Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files until you perform a successful interactive
boot to verify that they are not needed.

If the clean boot of your real-mode configuration eliminates the issue, isolate
the conflict with a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) or real-mode device driver
using the Step-By-Step Confirmation function.

Load Windows 95 by booting to a command prompt and starting Windows 95 by typing
"win" (without the quotation marks), holding down the SHIFT key for the duration
of the boot. This prevents any programs from loading automatically at startup.

If the issue is resolved by preventing programs from loading at startup,
investigate the following possible sources.

The Winstart.bat File
---------------------

The Winstart.bat file is used to load TSRs that are required for Windows-based
programs and are not needed in MS-DOS sessions.

For additional information the Winstart.bat file, click the article number below
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q134402 Some TSRs Moved from Autoexec.bat to Winstart.bat During Setup

The Startup Group
-----------------

If the issue is resolved by bypassing the Startup group, remove each of the
programs from the Startup group individually to isolate the program that is
causing the problem.

The Run Key in the Registry
---------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can prevent programs from loading by removing the program's string from the
following registry keys:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServicesOnce

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunOnce\Setup

Programs may also be loading from the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

The Win.ini File
----------------

The "load=" and "run=" lines in the [Windows] section of the file can start
programs automatically. See the following section for more information.

Test Windows Configuration Files
--------------------------------

To test the Windows configuration files, use the following steps:

1. Boot to a command prompt.

2. Rename the Win.ini file by typing the following command:

  ren c:\windows\win.ini *.bak

3. Start Windows 95 by typing "win" (without the quotation marks). If this
  procedure corrects the problem, ensure that the "load=" and "run=" lines in
  the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file are either blank or preceded with a
  semicolon (;) to prevent the items from loading.

4. Rename the System.ini file by typing the following command:

  ren c:\windows\system.ini *.bak

5. Windows 95 requires a System.ini file to load the GUI. Replace the original
  file by typing the following command:

  copy c:\windows\system.cb c:\windows\system.ini

NOTE: Starting Windows 95 with the System.cb file does not load a driver for the
mouse. Edit the new System.ini file, adding the following lines:

  [386Enh]
  mouse=*vmouse, msmouse.vxd

  [boot]
  drivers=mmsystem.dll
  mouse.drv=mouse.drv

6. Start Windows 95 by typing "win" (without the quotation marks) at the command
  prompt. If replacing the original System.ini file with the System.cb file
  corrects the issue, the problem most likely resides with either the [boot] or
  [386Enh] sections of the original System.ini file. Restore the original file
  to troubleshoot it.

7. To isolate the cause of the problem, place a semicolon (;) at the beginning
  of a line to prevent the item from loading.

For additional information about the System.ini file and its default entries,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q140441 Creating a New System.ini File Without Third-Party Drivers

Protected-Mode Device Drivers
-----------------------------

Safe mode disables all protected-mode device drivers for Windows 95. You can
conduct testing for incompatible components and resource conflicts by disabling
the protected-mode device drivers in Device Manager.

Removing Protected-Mode Device Drivers to Isolate Conflicts:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  System.

2. On the Device Manager tab, click View Devices By Type.

3. Disable each of the protected-mode device drivers. For example:

  a. Double-click the Floppy Disk Controllers branch to expand it.

  b. Click Standard Floppy Disk Controller, and then click Properties.

  c. On the General tab, click to clear the Original Configuration (Current)
     check box, and then click OK.

NOTE: If you have enabled hardware profiles, there is a check box for each of the
configurations. Clear the check box for the hardware profile you are
troubleshooting.

  d. Repeat steps A-C for each device in Device Manager.

4. Click Close, and then restart the computer.

If you resolve the issue by disabling the protected-mode drivers in Device
Manager, you may have a hardware conflict or a driver may be incompatible with
your hardware. For additional information about troubleshooting resource
conflicts in Windows 95, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q133240 Troubleshooting Device Conflicts with Device Manager

If you determine that a Windows 95 protected-mode device driver is incompatible
with your hardware, contact the hardware manufacturer to determine the
availability of new drivers.

Changing the Video Driver to a Standard VGA Display Driver
----------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you followed the directions in the "Removing Protected-Mode Drivers to
Isolate Conflicts" section of this article, you changed the display driver to
VGA and you can skip to the next section. Disabling the display adapter sets
your video to the VGA driver.

Safe mode starts Windows 95 with the VGA display driver. To determine if the
issue you are experiencing is related to your video driver, change to the VGA
driver for testing purposes.

NOTE: To ensure a safe return to your previous configuration, use the following
steps:

1. Back up the System.ini file.

2. Note the current desktop area (resolution) and color palette.

3. Record the name of your current video adapter.

To change to the VGA display driver, follow these steps:

1. Start Windows 95 in Safe mode.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Change Display Type.

4. In the Adapter Type area, click Change.

5. Click Show All Devices.

6. In the Manufacturers box, click (Standard Display Types). In the Models box,
  click Standard Display Adapter (VGA), and then click OK.

7. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.

8. Restart your computer.

If you determine that your video driver is incompatible with Windows 95, contact
the hardware manufacturer to determine the availability of new drivers.

Registry Damage
---------------

When you start Windows 95 in Safe mode the registry is read minimally. Damage to
the registry may not be evident when running in Safe mode; you may need to
replace the existing registry (System.dat) with a backup to determine if the
issue is caused by a damaged registry. To troubleshoot a damaged registry, use
the following steps:

1. Boot to a command prompt.

2. Remove the file attributes from the backup of the registry by typing the
  following command:

  c:\windows\command\attrib -h -s -r c:\system.1st

3. Remove the file attributes from the current registry by typing the following
  command:

  c:\windows\command\attrib -h -s -r c:\windows\system.dat

4. Rename the registry by typing the following command:

  ren c:\windows\system.dat *.dax

5. Copy the backup file to the current registry by typing the following command:

  copy c:\system.1st c:\windows\system.dat

6. Restart your computer.

NOTE: The System.1st file is a backup of the registry created during the final
stage of Windows 95 Setup. Therefore, the "Running Windows 95 for the first
time" banner is displayed and Windows 95 finalizes settings as if it is being
installed.

If replacing the System.dat file with the System.1st file resolves the issue, the
problem may be related to registry damage. Programs and device drivers added
after you installed Windows 95 may require reinstallation to update the new
registry.

If the issue is not resolved, restore the original registry using the following
steps:

1. Restart the computer to a command prompt.

2. Type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each command:

  c:\windows\command\attrib -s -h -r c:\windows\system.dat
  copy c:\windows\system.dax c:\windows\system.dat

NOTE: Overwrite the existing System.dat file if you are prompted to do so.

3. Restart the computer.

the registry. For additional information about these tools, click the article
numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139437 Windows 95 Emergency Recovery Utility

  Q135120 Configuration Backup Tool for Backing Up the Registry

What to Do if the Problem Persists
----------------------------------

If the troubleshooting steps outlined in this article do not resolve the issue,
the issue may be related to one or more of the following items:

- Faulty hardware.

- The computer needs a special machine switch for Himem.sys.

- The CMOS settings may need to be changed (such as disabling shadow RAM).

- The system BIOS may require an upgrade to be compatible with Windows 95.

- A virus may be present.

- An upgrade of a previous Windows installation may have been unsuccessful.

To determine if Windows 95 is compatible with your current system configuration,
you may need to install Windows 95 to a clean directory.

If you have enough free disk space, install Windows 95 to an empty folder (such
as a Win95 folder). For information about how to do so, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q142096 How to Reinstall Windows 95 to a New Folder
