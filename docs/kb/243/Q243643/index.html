-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This article and the hotfix associated with it applies to the initial version of Windows NT Workstation, Windows NT Server, and Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition. This hotfix is not compatible with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or later.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a Windows NT system in an existing domain, you may receive the
following error message when you attempt to log on (or if automatic logon is
configured):

  The system cannot log you on because the system's computer account in it's
  primary domain is missing or the password on that account is incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by Netlogon.dll on the client computer. The update to
correct the problem must be installed on the client computer during
installation.

When a Windows NT-based computer joins a domain during installation, a machine
account is created on the primary domain controller (PDC). If the PDC is running
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 or later, the new account is not replicated to
backup domain controllers (BDCs) until the next scheduled Netlogon replication
interval. Before Service Pack 4, the PDC replicates all machine account updates
immediately. When a domain user logs on or an automatic logon to the domain
occurs, the client computer establishes a session with either the PDC or one of
the BDCs. If a BDC does not have the computer account in its database, it
returns "User Unknown" to the client computer logon request. When it receives
this response, the client computer stop processing the logon request and
displays the error message.

NOTE: The default Netlogon replication pulse is five minutes, but is
configurable. For additional information, click the article number below to view

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date       Time     Size      File name      Platform
  -----------------------------------------------------
  08/04/99   10:06a   152,336   Netlogon.dl_   x86
  08/05/99   10:31a   252,176   Netlogon.dl_   Alpha 



NOTE: There is also a version of this hotfix to the Netlogon.dll file that is
compatible with Service Pack 4 and 5. For additional information, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q223997 Logon Attempt Does Not Work on New Installation of Windows NT

You must use both updates to fully correct the problem described in this article.
The changes in both versions allow the client computer to continue processing
logon responses until it receives a valid response or until a time-out occurs.
The time-out period is related to several factors, but is typically three to
five seconds. The error message is displayed if a time-out occurs and a valid
logon response has not been received by the client.

Because you must modify the installation folder, you must use over-the-network
installations or installations that pre-copy the files to the local hard disk.
You cannot use this fix when you install from one of the standard Microsoft
Windows NT CD-ROMs or Windows NT Service Pack CD-ROMs.

To install, you must replace the Netlogon.dll file that is included with the
original version of Windows NT 4.0 with the version that is associated with this
hotfix.

1. In the appropriate platform installation folder (I386 or Alpha), rename the
  Netlogon.dl_ file to Netlogon.org.

2. Copy the Netlogon.dl_ file that is included with this update to the
  installation folder.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:

- Add all computer accounts before you install Windows NT on the computers,
  making sure that the entire domain is synchronized before you continue with
  the installation.

- Use an LMHOST file that has a #PRE #DOM entry with the PDC's IP address
  specified.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
