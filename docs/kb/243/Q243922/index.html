assistance from the manufacturer of the program that places a check mark back
into Msconfig.

6. After you verify that your computer is clean-booted in step 5, you can
  isolate the issue. If the original issue does not reoccur after the clean
  boot, select one item at a time under Selective startup, and then restart the
  computer to see if the additional entry reproduces the original issue.

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click System Information.
