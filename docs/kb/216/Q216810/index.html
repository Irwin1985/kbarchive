The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 and the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2,
which are implemented as an IBM Distributed Relational Database Architecture
(DRDA) Application Requester, use packages to issue dynamic SQL statements.

The driver and the provider will create packages dynamically in the location to
which the user points using the Package Collection attribute. If either the user
doesn't have the appropriate authority to create packages in designated
"location" or the designated location does not exist, the provider or the driver
might report the following error:

  A SQL error has occurred. Please consult the documentation for your specific
  DB2 version for a description of the associated Native Error and SQL State.
  SQLSTATE: 51002, SQLCODE: -805.

By default, the provider will automatically create one package in the target
collection, if one does not exist, at the time the user issues the first SQL
statement. The package is created with GRANT EXECUTE authority to a single
&lt;AUTH_ID&gt; only, where AUTH_ID is based on the User ID value configured in
the data source. The package is created for use by SQL statements issued under
the same isolation level based on the Isolation Level value configured in the
data source.

Some users might specify a Package Collection value that represents a DB2
collection used by multiple users. This can be a problem if two or more users
with different User IDs try to access a single collection of packages. The first
user will have access to the packages, but the second user likely will not. The
provider includes a command line utility for the administrator to create
packages, called Crtpkg.exe (command line) as well as a graphical user interface
version, Crtpkgw.exe (Windows GUI). These utilities can be run using a
privileged User ID to create packages in collections accessed by multiple users.
These utilities will create five sets of packages and grant EXECUTE privilege to
PUBLIC for all:

- AUTOCOMMIT package (SNANC001)

- READ_UNCOMMITTED package (SNACH001)

- REPEATABLE_READ package (SNARR001)

- READ_COMMITTED package (SNACS001)

- SERIALIZABLE or REPEATABLE_READ package (SNAAL001)

The driver/provider binds the right package according to the Default Isolation
Level selected: NC, UR, RS, CS, or RR. After they are created, the packages will
be listed in the DB2 (Mainframe) SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE and DB2/400 QSYS.SYSPACKAGE.

The following is a successful run of Crtpkg.exe from the command line:

  C:\&gt;crtpkg
  SNA or IP connection?SNA
  SNA configuration
  Local LU Alias?LOCAL
  Remote LU Name?OLYMPIA
  Mode Name?QPCSUPP
  User ID? &lt;user_id&gt;
  Password?
  RDB Name? OLYMPIA
  Package Collection? WNWBASE
  Default Schema? WNWBASE
  Replace existing packages? [Y/N(default)]y

  ...complete.
  End of package creation.

The GUI-based tool, Crtpkgw.exe, will read a Microsoft Data Link (UDL) file for
connection configuration information. After selecting the appropriate Data Link
file, select Create Package from the menu to create the five packages and grant
rights to PUBLIC.
