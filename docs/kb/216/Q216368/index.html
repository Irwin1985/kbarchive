The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running a setup that was created by the Visual Basic Setup Wizard or
Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW), the following error message is generated:

  &lt;file path and name&gt;

  An access violation occurred while copying the file.

where &lt;file path and name&gt; is the name of the file, including the complete
path, that Setup is attempting to copy.

CAUSE
=====

Another open program is using the specified file. In some cases, the file may be
in use by the operating system.

RESOLUTION
==========


Follow these steps to resolve the problem:

1. Verify that the file specified in the error message is redistributable. If
  the file is not listed as being redistributable, rebuild the distribution
  removing that file from the setup files.

  In Visual Basic 5.0, check the files License.txt and Redist.txt, both of which
  are located in the "Program files\DevStudio\VB" folder.

  In Visual Basic 6.0, check the files Eula.txt in the "Program Files\Microsoft
  Visual Studio\Common\Setup\1033" folder and Redist.txt in the "Program
  Files\Microsoft Visual Studio" folder.

2. If the file is redistributable, make certain that the user closes all open
  programs before installing the application. Booting Win9x in Safe Mode
  prevents most applications from loading automatically at startup, as does
  holding down the SHIFT key for the duration of the boot. Neither method
  disables anti-virus software, screen savers, and so forth, so they must be
  shut down manually if they load the problem DLL.

  To determine which program is using the file, use a utility such as DLLView
  for Windows 9x or Process Explorer (formerly HandleEx) for Windows NT/Windows
  2000. Both utilities are available as free downloads from a third-party Web
  site at the following address:

  http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml

  If all open programs are closed, and the user still receives the error
  message, the file may be in use by the operating system. In this case, the
  following alternatives are available to work around the error message:

- Users can click Ignore in response to the error message. When they click
  Ignore, they will receive the same message again with the following
  additional information:

  If you ignore a copy error, the file will not be copied. The application may
  not function properly as a result. Do you want to ignore the error?

  If they click Yes, Setup continues installing the remaining files, and the
  application will often run properly without replacing the file.

- If a version of the file that is compatible with the application is already
  on the user's target system, you can remove the file from the file you
  distribute to avoid the message altogether. See the MORE INFORMATION section
  later in this article for details concerning the files that most commonly
  cause this error message.

- You can customize the Setup Toolkit project (Setup1.vbp). Microsoft Technical
  Support does not provide support for modifying the Setup Toolkit project, but
  the source code is available for customization. For more information, search
  on the phrase "setup toolkit project" in "Books Online" for Visual Basic 5.0
  or the "MSDN Library Visual Studio 6.0."


  For additional information about programmatically replacing files that are in
  use, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140570 HOWTO: Moving Files That Are Currently in Use


- You may want to consider using a third-party Setup program.


MORE INFORMATION
================
