SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the following registry subkey

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters

  Value Name: UseWriteBehind
  Data Type:  REG_DWORD
  Data:       0

on a computer running Microsoft Terminal Server and then try to copy a file to a
remote share over the network, the following error message is displayed:

  To Many Posts Were Made to a Semaphore.

This may occur when you run the Terminal Server console and when a client is
connected to a Terminal Server Session, because both are copying files from the
Terminal Server computer to a remote share.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a problem in the redirector, which manipulates an
operating system semaphore.

- Apply the hotfix mentioned below.
