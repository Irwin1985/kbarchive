-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Systems Management Server client software is installed on a Windows NT
client computer at the same time that Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 setup is
performing its one-time per user configuration, SMSRUN32 may stop responding
with CPU usage greater than 90 percent.

Furthermore, if you use Windows NT Task Manager to list the running processes,
two instances of SMSRUN32 will appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. In the
  &lt;SMS_root_directory&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;platform&gt;.bin
  directory on the site server, replace the Smsrun32.exe file with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

2. In the
  &lt;SMS_root_directory&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;platform&gt;.bin
  directory on the site server, replace the Smssrv32.exe file with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

NOTE: These steps can be performed automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the
supplied Hotfix.ini file.

At the next Maintenance Manager work cycle, the files will be replicated to all
Systems Management Server logon servers, to the
&lt;SMS_root_directory&gt;\Logon.srv\&lt;platform&gt;.bin directory. When that
occurs, new clients will get the new Smsrun32.exe and the existing clients can
be updated.

To update the existing clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or
follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates

NOTE: This hotfix applies only to the 32-bit version of SMSRUN.
