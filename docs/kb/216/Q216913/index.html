Microsoft has determined an incompatibility exists between BIOS3-fix and Kernel-fix. For additional information on Kernel-fix, click the article number below 
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q234557 Executable with Specially Malformed Image Header Crashes Windows

Because of this incompatibility, if you have installed Kernel-fix, you should uninstall it and then reinstall BIOS3-fix. After applying BIOS3-fix, do not apply Kernel-fix. For additional information on how to remove a Hotfix, click the article number below

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 addresses the following problem in Windows NT
4.0:

  When the Windows NT System Time value rolls over from the year 1999 to 2000,
  the Century Byte value stored in the real time clock (RTC) is not changed
  until up to one hour later when the time daemon writes out the date. This
  issue only affects systems with older BIOSes that do not automatically update
  the century byte on reboot (contact your hardware manufacturer for BIOS
  details).
  This issue may cause unexpected behavior under two conditions:

- When your computer is configured using the dual boot option where another
  operating system may not handle this situation properly. All versions of
  MS-DOS fall into this category.

- Some computer hardware BIOS configurations detect this behavior as an invalid
  date and present a query for the correct date. This may prevent a computer
  from restarting without user input.

  NOTE: This problem only occurs if the computer is restarted during the time
  lapse when the dates were out of synch.

On August 5, 1999, Microsoft released an updated version of BIOS-fix (BIOS2-fix)
that was originally included with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5. In addition to
the above, the latest version of this update corrects the following problems:

  

- If a computer is set to a time zone which does not participate in Daylight
  Saving Time, refreshing the real time clock for the Year 2000 does not work.

- The original update did not replace the multi-processor kernel if it existed.
  The updated version does.

On November 3, 1999, Microsoft released an updated version of BIOS-fix (Microsoft
BIOS3 Y2K Update) that, in addition to fixing the above, fixes the problems
listed below:

  

- In rare cirumstances where the real time clock is slightly behind the system
  clock, refreshing the real time clock for the Year 2000 may not work.
