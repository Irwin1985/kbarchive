SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a DNS query and the query returns an error message (such as "Server
failure [rcode 2]"), other servers in the list are not queried. The failure is
passed back to the originator, even though another querying server in the list
could complete the query.

CAUSE
=====

Secondary servers are queried only if no response is received from the primary
server in the server list.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next update that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DNS query algorithm has been modified to try other servers in the server
list if an error response is received from a server that could be resolved by
trying another server in the list. The new algorithm retries servers until:

- The name query is answered successfully
- An authoritative answer is received from a server that the requested host
  does not exists (rcode 3)
- The server list is exhausted
