The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Certificate Server version 1.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes why, when special characters are included as part of a
name in a certificate, they cause that part of the name to be encoded as a
Unicode string rather than a printable string. This process of promoting string
encoding from Printable to Unicode is fully documented in the relevant IETF
standard (pkix part 1). However, applications written before the standard may
have problems processing certificates, particularly CA Certificates, that
contain Unicode names. Before including these special characters in a CA
certificate name, it is advisable to confirm that all applications using
certificates from a CA can correctly process certificates containing the Unicode
names.

This affects all releases of Microsoft Certificate Server, including version 1.0
that shipped with the Windows NT Option Pack, the QFE update for Exchange
Server, and the SP4 update.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IETF standard requires that where possible, the names in certificates be
encoded as Printable Strings. The Printable String character set is as follows:

  Upper case letters (A to Z)
  Lower case letters (a to z)
  Numbers (0 to 9)
  Some punctuation characters (space) ' ( ) + , - . / : = ?

The standard also requires that names containing any character outside of the
Printable String character set are encoded as a type of Unicode string known as
a BMP string. For example:

  Jones and Partner's = Encoded as Printable String
  Jones &amp; Partner's = Encoded as BMP string

If, when installing Certificate Server, you use a character outside of the
Printable String character set as any part on the CA's name, that part of the
CA's name will be encoded as a BMP string. In addition, any certificate that the
CA issues will contain the same name and a BMP string in the issuer name of the
certificate.

As vendors update their products to conform to the new standard, this problem
will diminish. However, it is advisable at this time to only use characters
outside of the Printable String character set in a Certificate Server's name
where you are confident that all applications can correctly process certificates
containing BMP strings.

Because the name is in a signed object (for example a certificate), removal of
the BMP string requires that you reinstall the Certificate Server, and re- issue
the certificates it has issued.
