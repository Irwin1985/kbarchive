-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Internet Mail Service accepts an inbound SMTP message missing the TO:
address in the 822 section, but does have Apparently-To addressed to an
OV/VM(PROFS)/SNADS/Notes user, these connectors will fail to build the envelope.
A non-delivery report will be generated and returned to the orginal sender.

CAUSE
=====

The PROFS/SNADS/Notes Connector does not recognize Apparently-To as a valid
header from which an envelope, or P1, can be built. Thus, the message has no
recipient and is undeliverable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, ensure that inbound SMTP traffic conforms to RFC-822
and RFC 2076.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A close reading of RFC-822 shows that the TO: address is the only field usable
in the body for generating routing information beyond that supplied by the
RFC-821 conversation. Within Exchange Server, the 821 information is no longer
used and is discarded following a successful directory lookup on the recipient.
When the message is transferred to the PROFS/SNADS/Notes connector (or any other
EDK connector), the only routing information available is that found in the 822
body. The Apparently-To field is an optional header defined in RFC-1211. The
following is an excerpt from RFC-2076:

  RFC 2076 Internet Message Headers February 1997
  Apparently-To:
  Inserted by Sendmail when there is no "To:" recipient in the original message,
  listing recipients derived from the envelope into the message heading. This
  behavior is not quite proper, MTAs should not modify headings (except
  inserting Received lines), and it can in some cases cause Bcc recipients to
  be wrongly divulged to non-Bcc recipients. Non-standard, discouraged,
  mentioned in RFC 1211.
