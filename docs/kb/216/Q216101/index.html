SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

A component, including COMTI component libraries, can be installed in an MTS
server package and the package can be exported to a remote Windows NT computer
so the client application can run on the remote computer using DCOM.

The export process produces an executable file to be run on the remote computer
for setting up registry entries (for example, ProgID, CLSID, and so on) for
directing the remote client application to the component on the server where it
runs under the control of Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). Implementing the
client application on the remote computer simply involves running the executable
file on that computer. At that time, additional registry entries are provided
for the future removal of this client application through the Add/Remove
Programs utility in Control Panel. However, under certain conditions, the
application's entry is missing from the Add/Remove Programs Properties dialog
box under the Install/Uninstall tab.

The list entry is specified in the following registry value:

  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\&lt;CLSID&gt;\DisplayName

where &lt;CLSID&gt; is the CLSID of the remote application that is installed by
running the executable file mentioned above.

If the value of DisplayName is more than 63 characters, the name doesn't display
in Add/Remove Programs.

There is a workaround when this situation occurs. Edit the registry to change the
value of DisplayName to a string less than 64 bytes in length. Then the revised
name will appear in Add/Remove Programs list, and the application can be removed
as desired.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To change the registry value, proceed as follows:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the DisplayName value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\&lt;CLSID&gt;

3. On the Edit menu, double-click DisplayName, type in a name no more than 63
  characters long, and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
