-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5, versions Build 2.573.2927, Build 2.573.3513, Build 2.573.3711 
- Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using parameter binding in the Microsoft Oracle ODBC driver to insert
decimal values into an Oracle server installed on UNIX, the following error is
returned:

  [Microsoft][ODBC driver for Oracle][Oracle]ORA-01722: invalid number

This error does not occur when inserting the same values into an Oracle server
installed on Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

During connection, the Oracle driver determines the character to use as a
decimal separator by issuing the following statement:

    SELECT 99/100 FROM DUAL

which should return ".99", and the first character is used as the decimal
separator.

On UNIX platforms, " .9" is returned instead of the expected ".99", which causes
a decimal such as "123.45" to be passed as "123 45". This generates the "Invalid
number" error.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

         Date      Time   Version      Size   File name   Platform
         ---------------------------------------------------------
MDAC 2.0  02/02/99         02.573.3802  136KB  Msorcl32.dll        
MDAC 2.1  02/01/99         02.573.3801  139KB  Msorcl32.dll

This hotfix is engineered to work with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)
builds 2.0 and 2.1. The hotfix contains the MDAC 2.0 MSORACL32.DLL and MDAC 2.1
MSORACL32.DLL. See installation instructions below.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Place the self-extracting zip file (OraUnix.exe) into a temporary directory.

2. Unzip the file with the "-d" option, to preserve directory information. For
  example: "OraUnix.exe -d". Two subfolders - Mdac20 and Mdac21 - will be
  created.

3. Locate msorcl32.dll in the system folder.

4. Verify that no applications or services are using the driver.

5. Copy the new driver from the folder it was extracted to (choosing the
  appropriate version directory) into the system folder.

6. Register the new driver using the following:

  Regsvr32.exe msorcl32.dll

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use parameter binding in your application; instead, just insert the
values hard-coded into an INSERT statement. Install MDAC 2.1 SP2 or higher as
the Oracle ODBC driver is updated with the fix in those versions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
