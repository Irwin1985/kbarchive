SUMMARY
=======

When you use Anonymous authentication in IIS, you have the option to either use
"Enable Automatic Password Synchronization" (IIS 4.0) or to "Allow IIS to
Control Password" (IIS 5.0). This can make administering a Web server using
anonymous users much easier, but it does have a distinctive drawback, which this
article discusses.

When you allow IIS to control the password, what seems to take place, and what
actually takes place are two different things. It would seem that the password
is checked, and if the password in IIS differs from Windows NT, the password
should be "fixed." The way it actually works changes the way authentication is
performed.

Authentication is performed differently when this option is enabled because IIS
informs Windows that the password is correct. A subauthenticator performs this
task. Windows allows a subauthenticator (implemented as subauthentication DLLs)
to be used in conjunction with the normal Windows authentication system.

A subauthentication DLL allows the authentication and validation criteria stored
in the Windows user account database to be replaced. For instance, a particular
server might supply a subauthentication DLL that validates a user's password
through a different algorithm, uses a different granularity of logon hours, or
specifies workstation restrictions in a different format. All of this can be
accomplished using subauthentication DLLs without sacrificing the use of the
Windows user account database and losing its administration tools.

IIS supplies a subauthentication DLL called Iissuba.dll. The function of this
DLL, in terms of anonymous authentication, is to verify that the password is
correct, and then inform Windows that the password is valid and hence log on the
user.

The problem with using a subauthenticator is that the user is no longer logged on
to the server interactively (logged on locally). The user is logged on using a
network logon.

Network logons have a few notable problems when dealing with IIS. For example,
accessing a remote resource on another server (even a Windows 2000 server that
is trusted for delegation) may be impossible. If you find you are having
problems of this manner, turn off the "Enable Automatic Password
Synchronization" option or "Allow IIS to Control Password" option in the
Internet Service Manager. Be sure that you reset the password in User Manager to
ensure that it is correct for this user account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you would like more information about the information in this article, the
Visual Studio 6.0 documentation comes with an example of a subauthenticator
called "SUBAUTH."
