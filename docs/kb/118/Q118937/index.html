Last Modified: 04-AUG-2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After FoxPro files have been converted from MS-DOS format to the Macintosh
format, they do not display the correct FoxPro icons or file kind in a window.
Additionally, viewing the files with a resource editor, such as ResEdit, shows
that they have the wrong resource type and creator.

CAUSE
=====

Because MS-DOS files do not have resources, the tool used to transport them to
the Macintosh usually assigns its creator and file type to the files. Examples
are the Apple File Exchange utility and networks that support connections to
MS-DOS-based machines and Macintoshes, such as Microsoft Windows NT.

WORKAROUND
==========

To fix the files, do one of the following:

- If only a few files are involved, use one of the techniques described in the
  "More Information" section below to change the creator and file types of the
  files.

-or-

- If many files are involved, you may want to use the programmatic workaround
  described in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q114999 PRB: Creators and Types Are Reset After Transport to Macintosh

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Change File Creator and Types by Using File, Save As
-------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This technique does not work on file types, such as tables, that can't be
saved using the Save As command on the File menu.

1. From the File menu, choose Open. Select the appropriate file type in the Type
  list box.

2. Select the file you want to change, and then choose Open.

  NOTE: If the file isn't visible, select the All Files check box.

3. If prompted to transport the file, choose Transport.

4. From the File menu, choose Save As. Keep the current filename and choose
  Save.

5. When prompted to replace the existing file, choose Save.

6. From the File menu, choose Close.

Steps to Change File Creator and Types Using ResEdit
----------------------------------------------------

CAUTION: This workaround uses Apple's resource editor, ResEdit. Because a file
may be damaged if incorrect changes are made, the use of ResEdit is recommended
for advanced Macintosh users only. As a precautionary step, you may want to make
backup copies of the FoxPro files before proceeding.

NOTE: The instructions below are for ResEdit version 2.1.1. If you use a
different version of ResEdit, these instructions may vary slightly. ResEdit does
not come with the Macintosh operating system, but can be obtained from Macintosh
user groups or the Apple Programmers and Developers Association (APDA).


1. Start ResEdit. Press ESC to stop the animated opening screen.

2. In the opening dialog box, choose Cancel.

3. From the File menu, choose Get File/Folder Info.

4. Select the file that needs its creator and type changed. Choose Get Info.

5. Change the type to the appropriate type. Change the Creator to FOXX.

  NOTE: For a list of FoxPro types, see the "Creator File Types" topic in the
  FoxPro online Help system.

6. Close the window for the selected file. When prompted to "save info," choose
  Yes.

7. If you need to change other files, repeat steps 3-6 for each file.

8. From the File menu, choose Quit.

NOTE: If the file kind/type and icon do not change, you will need to rebuild the
desktop. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. While holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys, choose Restart from the
  Special menu. Continue holding down the COMMAND and OPTION keys while the
  Macintosh restarts--this rebuilds the desktop.

2. After the Macintosh restarts, it displays the following dialog box:

  Are you sure you want to rebuild the
  desktop file on the disk "&lt;disk_name&gt;"?
  Comments in info windows will be lost.

  Release the COMMAND and OPTION keys, and then choose OK.
