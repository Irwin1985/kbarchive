SUMMARY
=======

The debugging version of Windows replaces the core Windows code with code that
provides additional error checking and reporting not in the standard
(non-debugging) version of Windows. This information is useful if you are a
developer testing your own application under Windows. The debugging version of
Windows will point you to resource leaks and errors that go otherwise
undetected; therefore, it is a good idea to run your application under the
debugging version at least once, even if the program appears to run without any
problems.

You can install the debugging version of Windows from either the Windows SDK or
the Visual C++ Professional Edition. General installation and use guidelines are
available in the SDK manual "Getting Started" and the Visual C++ manual
"Professional Tools User's Guides." This article provides additional information
on these subjects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

First, follow the guidelines in your manual to install the debugging version of
Windows. If you have already installed the SDK or Visual C++ and did not choose
to install the debugging version, run the setup program again. You only have to
install the debugging version at this point. The debugging version is called the
"debug kernel." The term "kernel" refers to the operating system core. In
Windows, the kernel consists of the GDI.EXE, KRNL386.EXE, and USER.EXE files.

The files that ship with the Windows version 3.1 SDK or Visual C++ work with both
Windows version 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups (WFW) version 3.11. The .SYM
files are specific to the version of Windows that you are running. If you
install from Visual C++ version 1.5 and are using WFW, after installing you need
to copy the GDI.SYM, KRNL386.SYM, and USER.SYM files from the CDs
MSVC\NODEBUG\WFW311 directory to your MSVC\NODEBUG directory, overwriting the
Windows version 3.1 files that are currently in that directory. However, if you
are installing from the SDK or Visual C++ version 1.0, you need to copy those
three files from your system directory before you run the debugging version of
Windows. If you happen to use the wrong .SYM files when not in debugging mode,
Windows will still run OK. However, programs like Dr. Watson that use .SYM files
will occasionally have output that is off by a couple of bytes. If you need the
Windows for Workgroups files, they are available from the Microsoft Download
Center in the file DBG311.ZIP. (Make sure to use the -d flag when using PKUNZIP
to tell it to maintain the directory structure.)

Once the debugging version is installed, you will have the following batch files
available to switch between the non-debugging and the debugging version of
Windows: N2D.BAT and D2N.BAT. By default, they are in either the WINDEV\BIN or
the MSVC\BIN directory. You will probably want to switch to the non-debugging
version when you do not need the extra diagnostics of the debugging version,
because the debugging version runs significantly slower due to the increased
error checking. When you run the debugging version of Windows, you will see the
phrase "Enhanced Mode Debug Windows" in the lower right-hand corner of your
screen.

If you start the debugging version of Windows and the error "Cannot write to
device AUX" displays, most likely COM1 is not available and you should direct
the debugging output elsewhere. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q86263 Redirecting Debugging Information Under Windows

You can control the level of diagnostic information by using the debugging
version of Windows. The groups of output options are break options, debug
options, and trace options. The debug option "break with INT 3" is useful if you
are running your program under the debugger: when the program causes a
general-protection (GP) fault, the debugger stops on the line of code where the
fault occurred. In general, it is a good idea to check all of the trace options
and also clear the "Print on Break Only" check box so that printing occurs
synchronously. For more information on the debugging version of Windows and the
debugging options, see the DBWIN.TXT file that is included with the DBWIN sample
and the "Windows Debugging Version/Debugging Programs" topic in the SDK help
file.

You can use OutputDebugString() or DebugOutput() in your own application to print
debugging output. These APIs are easier to use than MessageBox().

When you run the debugging version of Windows, you may notice errors from other
Windows-based applications that you are running. Other applications can even
cause general protection faults or machine hangs when they are run under the
debugging version. This is a sign that the application developer did not test
the application under the debugging version of Windows. If you have an
application in your startup group that prevents the debugging version of Windows
from loading, hold down the Shift key while booting so that the applications in
your startup group are not started.
