This article discusses some reasons why programs might produce
different floating-point results when compiled with different compiler
options.

The program below produces different results when complied using

   cl -AM -FPi prog.c

than when using the following:

   cl -AM -FPa prog.c

Part of the reason for these differences is that /FPa and /FPi
generate math routines that work differently. /FPi math emulates the
80x87, to the point of actually converting 8-byte doubles to 10-byte
internal format and doing the math in internal format. /FPa uses an
8-byte format for calculations; therefore, it is less accurate. This
often accounts for differences in results.

Also of special interest is the fact that the second number printed in
the /FPi case is smaller than DBL_MIN, as defined in FLOAT.H. This
situation is also correct because DBL_MIN is the smallest possible
NORMALIZED value. (Normalized means that the high-order bit of the
mantissa is a one.)

"Denormals" (numbers where there are zeros in some of the high-order
bits of the mantissa), however, can represent numbers "x" in the
ranges + DBL_MIN &gt; x &gt; 0 and 0 &gt; x &gt; -DBL_MIN. Although this is an
unusual situation, it is not an error. Although it is less precise
than a normalized number, a denormal is still more precise than 0
(zero) (which is the next best representation). By allowing use of
denormal numbers, we make our floating-point result slightly more
accurate. The alternate math library (/FPa) represents denormal
numbers as 0 (zero).

There is a good explanation of floating point exceptions (including
the denormal exception, which is always masked) in the FPEXCEPT.DOC
file that comes with the C compiler. For more detailed background, see
the Intel "80387 Programmer's Reference Manual."

Another possible cause of differences in floating-point results is the
inclusion or omission of the /Op option. When /Op is omitted, the
compiler may skip storing intermediate results as 64-bit objects in
memory, leaving them instead in the 80-bit registers of the 80x87 (or
emulator package). This increases the speed and accuracy of the
calculation. However, this can decrease the consistency of the
calculations because other intermediate results may have been stored
in 64-bit objects in memory anyway. Including /Op forces all
intermediate results to be stored in memory, giving more consistent
results. This option is often handy in programs involving complicated
floating-point calculations.

The program and its output follow:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    // START OF PROG.C
#include &lt;float.h&gt;

main()
{
    double  a,d,c,prod1,prod2;

    _fpreset();
    a=9.5788979e-283;
    b=8.050847e-1;
    c=9.5588526e-28;

    prod1=a*b;
    printf("\n product1 = %1.15le \n",prod1);
    prod2=c*prod1;
    printf("\n product2 = %1.15le \n",prod2);

}  // END OF PROG.C

 // RESULTS OBTAINED USING CL -AM -FPi  PROG.C

 product1 = 7.711824142152130e-283

 product2 = 7.371619025195353e-310 // This value is less than DBL_MIN

 // RESULTS OBTAINED USING CL -AM -FPa PROG.C

 product1 = 7.711824142152130e-283

 product2 = 0.000000000000000e+000
