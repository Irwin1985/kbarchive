-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a custom application created with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT), you may receive the following error message:

  Setup couldn't create a SYSTEM.MDA file. After Setup is completed, reboot
  your computer, then run the Workgroup Administrator before you run this
  application. (-1809)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if no form of file sharing (SHARE.EXE, VSHARE.386, or
network locking) is running when the Workgroup Administrator (WRKGADM.EXE) tries
to create a SYSTEM.MDA file. In order for the Workgroup Administrator to be able
to create the SYSTEM.MDA file, some form of file sharing must be running.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds for this problem:

- Ship a SYSTEM.MDA file with your custom application. To do this, add the
  SYSTEM.MDA file in the Files To Include box in the ADT Setup Wizard. This
  way, the Workgroup Administrator does not need to create a SYSTEM.MDA file.
  Note that the file must be named SYSTEM.MDA in order for this workaround to
  work. No other name (such as MYSYS.MDA) will work.

- Test to see if some form of file sharing is running before starting the
  custom Setup program. You can test to see if file sharing is running in a
  number of ways. To test for file sharing in Microsoft Windows, you can start
  the MS-DOS prompt and then type "share" (without quotation marks). If file
  sharing is running, you will receive a message stating "SHARE already
  installed." You can also test for file sharing with a small Microsoft Visual
  Basic or Microsoft Visual C application (these applications are not discussed
  in this article).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Access Developer's
Toolkit version 2.0. This problem no longer occurs in the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit version 7.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create application disks using the ADT Setup Wizard. Do not include a
  SYSTEM.MDA file with your application.

2. Install your application on a computer that is not running some form of file
  sharing (either loading SHARE.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or loading
  VSHARE.386 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file). Note that you
  receive the error message mentioned earlier in this article.
