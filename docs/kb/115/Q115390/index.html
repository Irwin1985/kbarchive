1.0  Removing Previous Versions
-------------------------------

If you have installed a prerelease version of the upgrade product, you should
delete it before installing this version. Move to the UPGRADE directory and
delete all files.

In addition, remove *.ACL files from the directory &lt;LANROOT&gt;\ACCOUNTS. This
ensures that the Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager uses the correct
*.ACL files to assign file permissions.

2.0 General Upgrade Issues
--------------------------

2.1  Set Svrhidden to No Before Upgrading:

Before upgrading a server, make sure the srvhidden parameter in LANMAN.INI is set
to no. If svrhidden is yes, the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager cannot correctly
verify the synchronization state of domain servers, as described in item 2.3. If
svrhidden is yes, change it to no and then stop and restart the server service.

2.2  Home Directories That Are UNC Names:

LAN Manager supports UNC paths for user home directories (e.g.,
TEST\LAN\USERS\FK) while Windows NT requires logical path names (K:\USERS\FK).
Because the upgrade does not convert UNC paths to logical paths, users with UNC
path home directories may be unable to log on after upgrading to Windows NT
Advanced Server. To give these users full access, change their home directories
to a logical path names before or after upgrading. For the latest status on this
problem, contact Microsoft Support Services.

2.3  Synchronizing Accounts Prior to Upgrading:

Upgrading when user accounts are not synchronized can result in creation of a
NETACC.BKP file that contains incorrect information. To prevent this, the LAN
Manager Upgrade Manager automatically checks for synchronization, as follows:

a) For LAN Manager primary domain controllers, the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager
checks to see that user accounts on backup domain controllers and member servers
are synchronized with the primary domain controller. If accounts are not
synchronized, the Upgrade Manager starts synchronization and then rechecks
status once a minute for 10 minutes. If ynchronization is not complete after 10
minutes, the Upgrade Manager offers the option of exiting or stopping the Net
Logon service and continuing the upgrade.

b) If you run the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager on a member or backup domain
controller and the primary domain controller is not already a Windows NT
Advanced Server, the Upgrade Manager verifies that the local UAS is synchronized
with the primary domain controller. If not, it initiates synchronization as
described in the previous paragraph.

c) If you run the LAN Manager Upgrade Manager on a backup domain controller or
member server and the domain controller is a Windows NT Advanced Server,
synchronization is not checked.

The LAN Manager Upgrade Manager only checks for synchronization on servers that
are running LAN Manager version 2.1 and above. Note that if the Net Logon
service is stopped on one of the servers in the domain, the Upgrade Manager will
report an error during its synchronization attempt and then continue with the
upgrade (if Net Logon is not running on the specific machine being upgraded,
error 2453 is shown).

2.4  Running Acllist on Drives with Large Numbers of Files:

Acllist can cause excessive paging on disks containing large numbers of files
and/or directories. For example, on a LAN Manager server with 16 MB, swapping
activity occurs if a combination of more than 29,000 files and directories
exist. To avoid this problem, run acllist specifying one or more root-level
subdirectories, instead of a drive. For example, type "acllist c:\programs
c:\projects /a" to collect file information for the PROGRAMS and PROJECTS
directory trees and place it in a single ACLLIST.DAT file. (/a appends PROJECT
directory information to the ACLLIST.DAT.) Note that this acllist option is not
documented in the Upgrade Guide and is not available from the LAN Manager
Upgrade Manager.

2.5  Using Hcopy or Xcopy to Restore Files:

The hcopy utility included with the upgrade can be used to back up files to
another LAN Manager server and then to restore files under Windows NT Advanced
Server. Using hcopy is important if you want to preserve hidden files and
extended file attributes (extended attributes are required to upgrade Macintosh
volumes). Hcopy is run from a LAN Manager server using the following options:

  /f  - ensure destination partition supports extended attributes
  /e - copy empty directories
  /v - verify transfer
  /s - copy subdirectories

The Windows NT xcopy command can also be used to restore files. (Xcopy
automatically preserves extended attributes.) Use the following options to
restore files using xcopy:

  /e - copy subdirectories, including empty ones
  /f - display source and destination filenames while copying
  /h - copy files with hidden and system attributes
  /k - copy attributes (read-only, archive, etc.)

Note that after using Hcopy to transfer directories to a clone, the aclcomp
utility reports a mismatch in directory creation time. This reflects the
difference between actual directory creation time under LAN Manager and the time
it was copied to the clone.

2.6  Upgrading File Replication Settings:

To retain LAN Manager file replication settings under Windows NT Advanced Server,
you must create a special service account on the Windows NT Advanced Server
Domain Controller (DC).

If the Windows NT Advanced Server (to be upgraded) is aware of this service
account, the restenv utility will restore file replication. Otherwise, file
replication configuration is not preserved.

To create a service account, log onto an account with Administrative privileges.
If this is the first server to be upgraded with file replication, perform steps
1 through 8 on the Domain Controller. On the remaining servers in the domain,
complete steps 4 through 8. Perform these steps prior to running the Windows NT
Advanced Server Upgrade Manager on the server you are upgrading.

1. Run the User Manager from the Administrative Tools group on the Server
  designated as the Domain Controller (DC).

2. Create a new user account for replication (name this account using the 'Logon
  =' parameter located in the LANMAN.INI file). If a password is desired, use
  the 'Password = ' parameter. Remove the check from the "User must change
  password at next logon" check box. Choose Add, then Close.

3. Choose Exit. Then close User Manager.

4. Run the Control Panel and select Services.

5. Choose the Directory Replicator service and choose Startup. Change the
  Startup Type from Manual to Automatic.

6. In the 'Log On As' control, choose 'This Account'. Then choose Add User.
  Select the Domain Service account created in step 2 above and choose Add and
  then OK.

7. Type the password for the replication account and choose OK. (Note that this
  is the same password specified in Step 2.) Control Panel responds with a
  message such as "The account DOMAIN\REPL has been granted the Log On As A
  Service right and added to the Replicator local group."

8. Choose OK to dismiss this message. Choose Close Services.

Restenv will automatically start Directory Replication Services. If you have
problems with file replication, refer to item 4 in the file INTEROP.TXT .

2.7 Use Convert Utility Included With Windows NT Advanced Server The Upgrade
Guide is incorrect in stating that CONVERT.EXE is included on the upgrade disk.
The Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager converts partitions using the
convert utility included with the operating system.

2.8  Using Portuas with the /U Option:

By default, running portuas adds all LAN Manager groups and users listed in a
specified NETACC.BKP file to an existing Windows NT Advanced Server security
database. To add a single user instead of the entire UAS, you can use portuas
with the /u option. Note, however, that in addition to porting the specified
user, portuas transfers all LAN Manager group names to Windows NT Advanced
Server. For example, typing "portuas netacc.bkp /u johnh" results in the
following:

a) All groups listed in NETACC.BKP are added to the Windows NT security
database.

b) The user "johnh" is added with his group membership preserved.

c) If the groups or the user "johnh" already exist, portuas overwrites previous
information, which in the case of groups is a remark entry.

2.9  Account Expiration Date Set Incorrectly:

Portuas sets all user account expiration dates to be 24 hours earlier than their
original LAN Manager settings.

2.10 Userconv Not Supported on Workstations:

It is not possible to map user accounts by running userconv on a Windows NT
Workstation. Userconv runs only on Windows NT Advanced Servers.

2.11 Aclconv Prompts for File Verification if Run After Userconv By default, the
userconv utility creates a file called ACLWORK.DAT for use by aclconv. If
aclconv detects this file, it prompts the user to verify use of the file to map
permissions.

This verification reduces the likelihood that alconv uses the wrong file to map
permissions. For example, if you run portuas, instead of userconv, it is not
appropriate for aclconv to use ACLWORK.DAT. If ACLWORK.DAT is present from a
previous conversion attempt, aclconv cannot automatically determine if it is
valid.

2.12 Aclconv User Account Mapping:

The Upgrade Guide incorrectly states that Aclconv maps the LAN Manager ADMIN
group to the Windows NT Advanced Server ADMINISTRATOR group. The correct mapping
is as follows:

  LAN Manager Group     Windows NT Group
  -----------------    -----------------
  USERS               USERS
  GUESTS               GUESTS
  ADMINS               ADMINISTRATORS
  ADMIN               ADMIN

2.13 Sfmconv Admin Account Mapping:

If an Admin account exists under LAN Manager, portuas creates a new account
called "Admin" under Windows NT. Sfmconv, however, maps all Admin privileges to
the "Administrator account." This does effect normal operation.

2.14 NBF (NetBEUI) Timeout Settings:

Under Windows NT Advanced Server, the following NetBEUI timeout parameters have a
default value of 5,000,000 (units are in 100 nanoseconds): GeneralTimeout,
AddNameQueryTimeout, and NameQueryTimeout. Appendix B of the Upgrade Guide
incorrectly gives their default value as 500,000.

2.15 Windows NT Backup Issues:

When using the Windows NT Backup program supplied with the upgrade, the following
may occur:

a) Windows NT Backup may have a problem restoring files from a Sytos Plus tape if
the file is in a backup session that spans two Sytos Plus tapes and the file
itself is entirely on the second tape. If this occurs, you can restore the file
by rerunning backup after setting the following Windows NT Registry key to 0:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER \Software\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Backup Engine\Use fast file
restore. After restoring the file, reset the key to 1.

b)When restoring or cataloging a Sytos Plus tape under Windows NT, you get the
error "Fatal tape translation error on Tape drive 1" because the backup error
correction flag value is incorrect in the Registry. To correct this problem,
edit the following registry key:
CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Translators \Sytos Plus ECC flag. This
value can be 0 for OFF, 1 for ON, or 2 for AUTO. Values should be set
accordingly:

     4mm Dat    0        1/4 in. 525    0
     8mm Dat    0        1/4 in. 150    1

Note that if you have previously run the version of Windows NT Backup included
with Windows NT, delete the Windows NT Backup entries in the Registry prior to
running the upgrade version of Windows NT Backup. Otherwise, the ECC flag will
not appear.

2.16 Upgrading UPS Command File Setting:

LAN Manager and Windows NT Advanced Server differ in the specification of the UPS
Shutdown command file. If the Windows NT Advanced Server UPS service issues a
warning that the UPS command file setting is incorrect, ensure that the command
file is specified as a filename only, with no preceding path. The exact wording
of the warning is "There is a problem with a configuration of user specified
shut down command file. The UPS service started anyway." The event log will
contain a similar entry.

3.0 Post-Upgrade Issues
-----------------------

This section discusses post-upgrade steps you can take to ensure that upgraded
servers and domains are fully functional.

3.1 Checking Permissions for Replication/Logon Script Directories

Make sure that permissions for logon scripts and replication directories are set
so that the appropriate users have access to these directories.

3.2 Synchronizing a Domain After Upgrading:

After upgrading, logon scripts will be unavailable to users until user account
replication occurs. To force replication after upgrading:

1) Select the Windows NT Advanced Server domain controller from the list in the
Server Manager window.

2) From the Computer menu, choose Synchronize Entire Domain.

3.3  Checking for Duplicate Server Accounts:

If duplicate server accounts exist in different domains, replication and trust
relationships may function incorrectly. This situation can also cause the Net
Logon service to fail in a LAN Manager domain.

The following circumstances can result in the creation of duplicate accounts:

a) Upgrading a LAN Manager PDC to a Windows NT Advanced Server clone and leaving
the original LAN Manager domain intact. In this scenario, portuas creates
computer accounts on the clone for each of the LAN Manager servers in the
original Servers group. Thus, server accounts exist in both domains. Typically,
this situation prevents LAN Manager users from logging on.

b) Using Server Manager to create an account for a computer that already exists
in another domain. For example, if you add the computer account \\FRISBEE to a
Windows NT domain controller, and \\FRISBEE already exists in another domain,
you will have problems setting up a trust relationship between the two domains.

To rectify this problem, use User Manager for Domains to delete accounts for LAN
Manager server(s) that exist in another domain.

3.4 Re-establishing Audit Settings:

Audit settings are not ported as part of the upgrade. To restore these settings
under Windows NT, manually configure audit parameters for each resource
previously audited under LAN Manager. Then, specify "Everyone". To set up
auditing, choose Auditing from the Security menu in File Manager.

Note that if auditing is enabled for LAN Manager, the aclcomp utility will note
which LAN Manager files and directories were audited in the file ACLCOMP.LOG.

4.0  Localization Notes
-----------------------

The upgrade product supports upgrading from English to another native
language-for example, from an English language version of OS/2 to a French
language version of Windows NT Advanced Server. It also supports upgrading to
the same native language, such as Canadian French to Canadian French.

NOTE: Using Sytos Plus to back up data under one language version and Windows NT
Backup to restore the data under another language version is not presently
supported.

4.1 Code Page Support:

To detect a change from one language version to another, the Windows NT Upgrade
Manager compares OS/2 code page information with the OEM code page under Windows
NT Advanced Server. Code pages determine the character correspondence tables
used to set up foreign language versions of software. For purposes of the
upgrade, code pages indicate how a utility should map various extended
characters that can appear in usernames, account descriptions, and so on.

If code pages differ, the Upgrade Manager modifies the Upgrade Tool Schedule so
that the command lines of various upgrade utilities include a /codepage option
(for example, portuas /codepage:&lt;OS/2 code page number&gt;).

NOTE: The /codepage option is only necessary if changing languages is part of the
upgrade.

The exact steps used to detect code page changes follow.

1) The backenv utility determines LAN Manager code page information by:

  a) Checking CONFIG.SYS.
  b) Calling the DosGetCtryInfo() API
  c) Using the default code page for the current country code (from
     CONFIG.SYS)

2) If a code page is located, backenv writes the information to the LMBAKENV.DAT
and ADVISORY.TXT files. If no code page is found, nothing is written.

3) Next, the Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager reads the code page from
LMBAKENV.DAT. If it differs from the existing Windows NT Advanced Server code
page, the Upgrade Manager edits the Express Upgrade Tool Schedule by appending a
"/codepage:&lt;code page number&gt;" option to the command line for the
following utilities: restenv, portuas, userconv, aclconv, sfmconv, and aclcomp.
If no code page exists, the OEM code page is assumed to be valid.

Note that the Custom Upgrade Schedule always includes a /codepage:### option for
restenv, portuas, userconv, aclconv, sfmconv, and aclcomp. Delete this option if
you are not changing language versions. If you are creating a Custom Upgrade
schedule and also changing language versions:

1) Check the ADVISORY.TXT for OS/2 code page information.

2) Specify this information for each utility you run under Windows NT Advanced
Server. For example, if the code page is 863 ( for Canadian French language
support), the command line for restenv should be "restenv /codepage:863",
instead of "restenv /codepage:###".

These procedures also apply if you run restenv, portuas, userconv, aclconv,
sfmconv, and aclcomp from the command line AND are changing language versions.

4.2 If Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade Manager Fails to Restart After
Converting Partitions

After converting partitions to NTFS, the Windows NT Upgrade Manager schedules a
reboot and then places itself in the Startup Group. This guarantees that the
upgrade will continue automatically after the reboot.

For foreign language versions of Windows NT Advanced Server, the Upgrade Manager
uses the native translation for "Startup group". If the Upgrade Manager cannot
be placed in the default "Startup group" for a foreign language version, then a
group titled "Startup" is created containing an icon for the Upgrade Manager. If
a user double-clicks on this icon, the Upgrade Manager will restart and continue
with the upgrade.

4.3 AT Commands Containing "t" Variable:

Running the backat utility creates a file called RESTAT.CMD that contains AT
commands. If this file contains commands that use the variable "t" (e.g., at
12:00pm /every:t "dir"), the commands will not port correctly to localized
versions of Windows NT Advanced Server.

5.0  Troubleshooting
--------------------

5.1 Sfmconv Error: Unable to Locate DLL:

The following error message under Windows NT Advanced Server typically indicates
that Services for Macintosh has not been installed:

  SFMCONV.EXE - Unable to Locate DLL. The dynamic link library SFMAPI.dll
  could not be found in the specified path.

Install Services for Macintosh and rerun sfmconv.

5.2  Restenv Fails With Error 2:

If various extended characters appear in LAN Manager directory names, uses, or
shares, the uses and shares may not upgrade successfully. Successful porting
depends on whether the Windows NT Advanced Server code page supports an
uppercase version of the extended characters in question.(See item 4.0 for more
information on code pages.)

If restenv encounters an unsupported extended character, it displays "Error 2"
and skips the respective share or directory name.

5.3 Sfmconv Fails to Convert Macintosh Volumes

(Error 3)

If a LAN Manager Macintosh volume uses a directory name with an unsupported
extended character, Sfmconv skips the volume during conversion and generates an
entry in SFMCONV.LOG similar to the following:

  error: open error on G:\AIOSHARE\~AFP\VOLINFO.AFP,
  error=3 The system cannot find the path specified.

where the directory name AIOSHARE contains unsupported characters.

If this error occurs, check unconverted volumes for directory names with any of
the unsupported characters listed in item 5.3. To convert the volumes, remove
these characters prior to running Sfmconv.

Note that, in this case, Sfmconv successfully converts non-offending volumes.

5.4  Sfmconv Fails With Error 2, Can't Find File:

Files or folders with names ending in a period or a space character cause the
error "Can't Find File" during sfmconv execution. These files are converted, but
the access permissions present on the file or folder may be more than they
should be. In addition, the Macintosh volume is not mounted. To correct this
problem, view permissions using File Manager, revoke those that should not be
present, and add the Macintosh volume.

5.5  Aclcomp Erroneously Reports Files Not Found:

When upgrading partitions (particularly Macintosh volumes) with file names
containing certain extended characters, aclcomp may incorrectly report that some
files could not be found.

In addition, the following specific error is not important because the file EA
DATA.SF is normally deleted after conversion:

  Error: the file E:\EA DATA. SF could not be found.

5.6 Problems With User Account Replication in a Mixed Domain

If you experience user account replication problems in a Windows NT Advanced
Server domain that contains LAN Manager servers, consider the following
troubleshooting steps:

1) Does your security database contain usernames with extended characters such as
[ASCII 138], [ASCII 162], and so on? Usernames containing these characters can
cause problems with replication (see item 5.3). Try deleting or changing these
usernames.

2) Try rebooting LAN Manager servers.

3) Try changing the role of LAN Manager backup controllers to standalone and
then, back to backup controllers.

5.7  Error 1219 and Failure to Log On:

The following error message typically indicates that two passwords exist for you
on the domain, one that is case- sensitive and one that is not: System error
1219 has occurred. The credentials supplied conflict with an existing set of
credentials.

See the file INTEROP.TXT for more information on case-sensitive passwords.

5.8  Acllist Causes General Protection Fault:

This may occur if you do not pause the LAN Manager server and delete all sessions
prior to upgrading. The LAN Manager Upgrade Manager prompts you to take these
steps when it first starts up.

5.9 Hcopy Generates Error 2 Copying Macintosh Files

If hcopy generates "Error 2" in the process of copying Macintosh files, check for
folders and file names with nonstandard names. For example, the folder name
"option- a" will cause an error to occur. To avoid this problem, rename the
offending file(s) or folder(s).

6.0  Reporting Problems
-----------------------

If you encounter a system problem, please report it to Microsoft using
BUGREP.TXT. This file is located in the \SUPPORT\SUPTOOLS directory on the
CD-ROM as well as floppy Disk #4 of the floppy install disk set. Additionally,
