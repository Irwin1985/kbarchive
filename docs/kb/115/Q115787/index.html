-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the configuration procedure of FTP Software's PC/TCP
version 2.3 for Windows for Workgroups version 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are three configuration options available of running PC/TCP version 2.3 in
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, which are with NetBEUI only, NetBEUI and
NetBIOS, and NetBIOS only.

NetBEUI Only
------------

1. Choose Real Mode NDIS Driver (NDIS2) during the Windows for Workgroups Setup
  procedure.

2. Make the following changes to the CONFIG.SYS file:

   - Verify the following line:

  "Device=&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\ifshlp.sys" (without the quotation marks)

   - Remove any entries that load the Protocol manager or an NDIS-specific NIC
     driver.

3. Make the following changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   - Make sure that the NET START command precedes any TSRs (Terminate and Stay
     Resident programs).

     NOTE: Remove the NETBIND command if it exists.

   - Add the following line to load the PC/TCP kernel after the NET START
     command:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\Kernel" (without the quotation marks)

4. Make the following changes to the SYSTEM.INI file:

   - Verify and add the following line to the [Boot] section:

  "Network.drv=wfwnet.drv
  Secondnet.drv=&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\pctcpnet.drv" (without the quotation
  marks)

   - Add the following line to the [386Enh] section:

  "Secondnet=drive:\path\vpctcp.386" (without the quotation marks)

   - If you are going to use PC-NFS to mount remote drivers or printers, add
     the following line to the [386Enh] section:

  "Device=drive:\path\wfwftp.386" (without the quotation marks)

     NOTE: You must use the WFWFTP.386 file available through FTP Software
     Technical Support BBS at (508) 659-6240. The filename is WFW311.EXE. The
     WFWFTP.386 file created for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 will also work
     with Windows for Workgroups 3.1, but not the other way around.

   - Verify and add the following entries are in the [network drivers] section:

  "Netcard=&lt;NDIS driver&gt;
  Transport=ndishlp.sys,*netbeui, &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\dis_pkt.gup
  LoadRMDrivers=Yes" (without the quotation marks)

5. Make the following changes to the PROTOCOL.INI file:

   - Add a [PKTDRV] section and the following entries:

  "[PKTDRV] DriverName=PKTDRV$ Bindings=&lt;Windows for Workgroups driver
  section nam&gt; IntVec=&lt;Available Software Interrupt&gt;
  ChainVec=&lt;Available Software Interrupt&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

     NOTE: Common interrupts available for entries IntVec and ChainVec are 0x60
     and 0x65, respectively.

6. Restart your computer to start running Windows for Workgroups over the
  NetBEUI stack.

NetBEUI and NetBIOS
-------------------

1. Follow steps 1 - 5 from the previous section of NetBEUI Only.

2. Add the following line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\Netbios" (without the quotation marks)

3. Make the following changes to the PROTOCOL.INI file:

   - In the [network.setup] section, change the lana0= entry to lanax= (where x
     is the next available adapter number).

   - In the [NETBEUI] section, change LANABASE=0 to LANABASE=x (where x is the
     same number as the adapter number in the previous bullet).

4. Make the following changes to the PCTCP.INI file:

   - In the [pctcp netbios] section, include the following NetBIOS specific
     parameters:

  "[pctcp netbios]
  Ncbs=64
  Names=32
  Sessions=n (where n equals the same value that is assigned to the
  Tcp-Connections= entry in the [pctcp kernel] section of the PCTCP.INI file)."
  (without the quotation marks)

5. Restart your computer to start running Windows for Workgroups over the
  NetBEUI and NetBIOS stacks.

NetBIOS Only
------------

1. Follow all the steps in the two previous sections of NetBEUI Only and NetBEUI
  and NetBIOS.

2. Comment out the NetMisc= and Transport= entries in the [386Enh] section of
  the SYSTEM.INI file by placing a semicolon (;) in front of each entry.

  For example:

  " ;NetMisc= &lt;entry&gt;
  ;Transport= &lt;entry&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

3. Restart your computer to start running Windows for Workgroups over the
  NetBIOS stack.
