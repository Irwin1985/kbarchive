-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is information contained in INTEROP.TXT file that ships with
Windows NT Advanced Server upgrade tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

********************INTEROP.TXT*********************

This document includes notes on Windows NT/LAN Manager interoperation.

1.  Administering a Mixed Domain
--------------------------------

In a Windows NT Advanced Server domain that contains LAN Manager servers and
clients, user account modifications occur at the domain controller and are
subsequently replicated to other servers in the domain. Windows NT Advanced
Servers can administer Windows NT servers and clients, as well as LAN Manager
servers. LAN Manager servers can administer LAN Manager servers and clients, and
Windows NT Advanced Servers and clients to a limited degree. LAN Manager
administration limitations result primarily from the larger feature set
available under Windows NT Advanced Server. It is highly recommended that
Windows NT Advanced Server tools be used to manage domains.

Most aspects of mixed domain user and share administration, including adding,
deleting, and changing users and shares, work from either platform. The
following adminstration features are not supported, in most cases because of
feature differences:

Administration of a Windows NT Advanced Server from the LAN Manager Net Admin
menu:

a) The Users on a Domain dialog (View menu) does not display an entry for the
Windows NT domain controller. b) The Server Options dialog (Config menu) does
not display existing alert names or allow the addition of new alert names. c)
Assignment of Admin privileges is not allowed. d) Cloning a member of the
Administrators group is not allowed. e) Changing the role of the server is not
permitted. f) Listing users logged onto the Windows NT Advanced Server is not
possible.

Administration of a LAN Manager Server from a Windows NT Advanced Server:

a) Forcibly logging out users is not possible because Windows NT does not support
lock-out account settings.

b) Neither LAN Manager nor Windows NT Advanced Server support remote
administration of LAN Manager replication servers.

2.  Password Case Sensitivity
-----------------------------

Password validation in a Windows NT network is case- sensitive as long as the
computer you are logged on to and the computer whose resource you are trying to
access are both Windows NT computers; the case of the password entered and the
password stored in the Windows NT user database must match. However, if a logon
procedure takes place on a non-Windows NT computer (a Windows for Workgroups
computer, for example) or the share being accessed is on a non-Windows NT server
(even if the server is in a Windows NT domain), password validation becomes
case-insensitive. There is one exception to these rules and one error that
results from mismatched case in passwords.

The exception is that if you change your password from a non-Windows NT computer
(using the Windows NT NET PASSWORD command), Windows NT stores your new password
as a case-insensitive password and permits all subsequent logons to be password
case-insensitive. Even if another user logs on from a Windows NT computer, no
password case checking is performed.

An error can be generated if you mismatch the case of your password after you've
already logged onto a Windows NT domain. For example, if you establish a network
session with a Windows NT computer by typing the following two lines:

  net use x: \\winntcomputer\data /u:domain\user PASSWORD
  net use y: \\winntcomputer\apps /u:domain\user password

The following error message is displayed: "System error 1219 has occurred. The
credentials supplied conflict with an existing set of credentials."

To avoid this error message, make sure you always use the same case when
attempting to connect to shared resources.

3.  Cross Domain and Guest Access
---------------------------------

This section discusses cross-domain and guest access on a network containing LAN
Manager and Windows NT Advanced Servers.

Consider this example: Your Windows NT Advanced Server is the domain controller
for DomainA, and you have problems seeing or using printers from LAN Manager
DomainB. This could be a very simple problem: You are connecting to a printer on
a non-Windows NT computer, so you must have the correct printer driver set up on
your own workstation. Often, however, it is a permissions/account problem.

Possibility 1: There may already be an account with the same name on the other
domain or workstation, but one that uses a different password.

Possibility 2: You are logged on as DomainA\eric, and have no account on DomainB.
Unless DomainA is a trusted domain for DomainB you have to rely on guest rights
or secure an account DomainB\eric with the same password you have on your
DomainA account. This is the same the way you must do things now with LAN
Manager.

Use the Administrator account to get access that is denied on other computers,
even if you could have secured guest access.

Possibility 1--Password Problems:

Why would the same account with different passwords cause access to be denied?
The DomainB server receives a request: "Hi, I'm Eric from DomainA, my password
is q," and responds: "You can't be Eric, that's not his password here--Access
Denied." If the request comes from an account that does not exist on the DomainB
server, it responds: "Well, I don't know you Miles, but I'll give you guest
access" (if the server has a guest account enabled).

Windows NT and OS/2 LAN Manager react the same way to Possibility 1. There are
some differences, however, when trusted domains are involved.

Possibility 2--Trusted Domains:

The DomainB controller may not recognize the request "I'm Klaas from DomainA, my
password is q." If DomainA is a trusted domain, however, the DomainB server
checks the password with the DomainA controller, rather than simply deny access.
If the DomainA controller says the password is correct for the account, the
Windows NT server checks the account's access privileges to the resource in
question and grants the same privileges allowed in DomainA.

MS-DOS or OS/2 clients send the Windows NT server only their username and
password because they do not support the extended Server Message Block (SMB)
protocol; Windows NT clients identify their domain as well, which the server
checks against the list of trusted domains. If a domain match exists, the server
grants the requester the same privileges allowed in its own domain. If the
account or domain is unknown, the server compares the requester's password
against the guest account password (if that account is enabled) and grants guest
privileges if a match exists.

4.  File Replication
--------------------

Both Windows NT and LAN Manager use replication to maintain identical copies of
specified files and directories on different computers. Changes made to files on
one computer are automatically replicated to other computers configured to
receive the changes. In a mixed Windows NT Advanced Server domain, designate a
Windows NT Advanced Server(s) to be the export server(s). The import server(s)
can be other Windows NT Advanced Servers, Windows NT workstations, or LAN
Manager version 2.x servers.

The following rules also apply:

a) A Windows NT Advanced Server can be an import and an export file replication
server.

b) A LAN Manager server can function as an import server to both Windows NT
workstations and to Windows NT Advanced Servers.

c) A Windows NT workstation can function as only an import server. A Windows NT
Advanced Server can replicate files across domain trust relationships by
establishing the equivalent Replication accounts and passwords in each domain.

d) When a Windows NT Advanced Server replicates files from NTFS to FAT, it
replicates only 8.3 filenames.

e) Windows NT can support any import and export paths. However, maintaining the
default paths, C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT and C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\REPL\EXPORT,
is recommended.

f) The Windows NT message "The account DOMAIN\REPL has been granted the Log On As
A Service right and added to the Replicator local group.", indicates that the
specified account has been added to the Backup Operators and Domain Users groups
by default in addition to the Replicator group.

g) You can replicate directories or files from a Windows NT NTFS volume to an
OS/2 (with LAN Manager 2.x) FAT volume if the filenames adhere to FAT file
system naming conventions. The same is true for OS/2 as long as the filenames
adhere to OS/2 HPFS style naming conventions.

h) Directories or files can be replicated from a Windows NT Advanced Server NTFS
volume to an MS OS/2 LAN Manager 2.x HPFS volume; however, the names of the
directories or files must adhere to the HPFS conventions, as follows:

  - Names can be up to 254 characters.
  - Paths and filenames can together be up to 259 characters long.
  - Blank spaces and periods can occur anywhere in the file or directory name.
  - These characters can be used in naming HPFS files: [ ] , + = ;
  - These characters are not currently allowed: &lt; &gt; : " / \ | * ? &amp;

If you experience problems during file or directory replication, use the
following steps to troubleshoot.

1) Note what operating system is running on the import computer (Windows NT,
Windows NT Advanced Server, OS/2, UNIX).

2) Is there anything interesting in the error log in the import computer? The
applications log has entries for the Replicator service and often contains
useful information. Look at the logs on both the import and export computers.

3) What file systems are installed in the partitions pointed to by the import and
export paths?

4) How many import computers exhibit incorrect behavior?

5) What time zones are the import and export computers running in?

6) Make sure the import computer has Backup Operator permissions. If these
permissions are not set up, errors 5, 1300, and 1307 will appear in the event
log.

7) Are the import and export computers in the same domain? If so, are the
password and username the same in both domains? Do the domains trust each
other?

8) Are alerts being received by administrative accounts? (Has the Alerter service
been started?)

9) Are there any extended attributes in the files or directories being
replicated?

10) If the source directory is on an NTFS partition, are there an alternate data
streams in the files or directories being replicated?

11) If the source or destination directories are on an NTFS partition, look at
the permissions on the import and export trees with File Manager. Does the
Replicator local group have at least CHANGE privileges to these directories?

12) Is it possible that an account has a file open (on import or export) all the
time? This would appear as a sharing violation in the event log (error 32).

13) Is there a REPL$ share on the export computer? (The share is created as a
side effect of the Directory Replicating dialog box on the export computer. This
dialog box also sets an ACL for the REPL$ share. Using the NET command or any
other means to create the REPL$ share is likely to cause problems.)

14) If you run the NET START command on the export and import computers, do both
computers show "Directory Replicator" (or equivalent) in the list?

15) If you are exporting or importing from an NTFS directory, does either tree
have filenames that differ only in case? Which file gets replicated is not
predictable. It is possible that the export computer will choose one file and
the import computer will choose another. This results in the replication being
out of sync.

16) Some versions of the OS/2 importer leave the archive bit set on all files
imported, whether or not it was set on the export side. This too could result in
continuous copying. One work around is to set the archive bit on all files on
the export computer. (Windows NT to Windows NT replication correctly clones the
archive bit.)

17) Some LAN Manager 2.1a import computers do not set their status file to
OK.RP$. The cause is currently unknown, but there are a few side effects. Files
will not be recopied each pass, but a file comparison will occur. Except for the
status file state, the files are correctly replicated. This behavior does not
occur on LAN Manager 2.2 importers.

18) Some versions of LAN Manager allow hard disk files with reserved names, such
as LPT1 or COM1. This can cause problems with HCOPY.EXE, XCOPY.EXE, and
Replication and should be avoided. These files can be deleted from a DOS
client's commandline using the DEL command. The Windows NT replicator currently
lets these filenames exist.

19) OS/2 LAN Manager only allows one set of credentials to be in use at a time.
(The credentials consist of the user name and password.) If someone is
interactively logged on to one user identification (ID) and the replicator is
trying to use a different user ID, then replication cannot occur until the
interactive user logs off. On the other hand, if the interactive user and the
replicator user have the same user ID, then replication is possible, depending
on the value of the TryUser value in the LANMAN.INI file.

20) LAN Manager importers are generally designed with a limit of 1000 files per
directory. You should be aware that the "." and ".." directory entries use two
of those 1000 entries. Also, some versions may have an off-by-one error that
causes repeated file copies with exactly 1000 entries. This gives a practical
limit of 997 files for those importers. The Windows NT importer does not have
these limitations.

21) Are there some files being replicated from an HPFS partition (written by
OS/2) to a Windows NT server? Do these files have extended attributes (EAs)? If
so, OS/2 may have written the EAs in discontiguous parts of the disk; Windows NT
does not support this. The directory replicator includes the EA sizes in its
checksums, and they may be wrong in this case. The replication may stay out of
sync permanently. You can use Windows NT to rewrite the same EA values to a
single contiguous area, if you know the original EA values. Note that accessing
an HPFS volume over the network while OS/2 is directly reading or writing the
volume will work correctly.
