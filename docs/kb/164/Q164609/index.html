IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SUMMARY
=======

When you diagnose network traffic using a network analyzer, a large series of
address resolution protocols (ARPs) in sequential order may be detected. This
problem can cause network access and traffic to and from all hosts to become
temporarily disrupted. One of the possible causes of this behavior is the result
of Hewlett Packard's JetAdmin JetDirect discovery tool, which is silently
installed when a Hewlett Packard published driver is installed in Windows from a
disk. One of Hewlett Packard's JetAdmin 2.33 methods to discover all JetDirect
devices (printers) running TCP/IP requires that a ping be sent to every address
in the subnet. Although this may provide a very thorough list of devices, it can
also generate a huge amount of network traffic. Take, for example, a Class A
network address. If JetAdmin were to run, approximately 7 million packets, in
succession, will be transmitted upon startup of this utility.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two possible resolutions to this issue:

- Download JetAdmin version 2.40 from Hewlett Packard's Web site. Hewlett
  Packard's JetAdmin version 2.40 also provides discovery of printers through
  broadcasts, as well as the ping method described above. Additionally, the
  ping method has been modified in version 2.40 so that it will, by default,
  not send pings to more than 2000 addresses without modifying the registry.

- WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious
  problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
  cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry
  Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  Hewlett Packard's JetAdmin Tool version 2.33 is designed to work in the manner
  described. On the majority of networks where Class C subnets are used, this
  behavior will not be a problem because of the small number of broadcasts
  generated. However, if you have a subnetted class B or class A network,
  Microsoft recommends that you contact Hewlett Packard for further support. To
  disable this feature, a change in the Registry must be made. To make this
  change, perform the following steps:

  1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe for Windows NT and Regedit.exe for
     Windows 95).

  2. Change the following key located under:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Hewlett-Packard\HPJetAdmin\TCPIP

     Change the Value for NoSubnetSearch to 1.

  3. In addition, if you run the JetAdmin application, the following option can
     be selected and disabled or enabled:

  Options\Preferences\TCPIP Discovery\Broadcast

NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

  or

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX based). For further
information see:
