SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run Setup for the programs listed at the top of this
article, you receive the following error message:

  The software to be installed requires a 68030 CPU, which this computer does
  not have."

CAUSE
=====

This can occur for one of the following reasons:

You do not have the minimum processor required to run the products at the top of
the list.

  -or-

You have upgraded your processor to meet the system requirements, but the program
does not recognize the capabilities of your processor.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not have a computer that meets the minimum system requirements for the
program you want to run, you should purchase a computer that both runs the Mac
OS and meets the minimum system requirements for the desired product.

If you have upgraded your computer with a processor that meets the system
requirements, but the program does not acknowledge this upgrade, contact the
vendor of the upgraded processor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Encarta 97
Encyclopedia for the Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Installing Mac OS 7.6" Read Me document located on the System 7.6
installation compact disc states:

  "Computers upgraded to 68030 or 68040 with a processor upgrade card are not
  supported by Mac OS 7.6.

This statement does not say that Mac OS 7.6 will not work on these machines,
however compatibility and/or detection problems with computers that have these
processor upgrade cards can occur.

Encarta is susceptible to these same problems, even though you may be using a
previous version of the Mac OS.
