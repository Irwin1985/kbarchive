-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
- Microsoft Services for NetWare version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer with a JetDirect interface, which supports
Novell PServer mode, may be configured to service print queues defined on a
Windows NT Server computer running File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW).

NOTE: Only follow the steps in this article if the JetDirect interface used
supports ONLY NetWare (IPX/SPX) connectivity. Use the DLC or LPR/LPD (TCP/IP)
capabilities of the JetDirect interface if available. Any printer configured for
use with Windows NT Server will be available for both Microsoft clients and
NetWare clients (through FPNW) when the printer is shared. Configuring a printer
as a normal Windows NT printer and sharing it is much simpler than the procedure
outlined in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

File and Print Services for NetWare allows a Windows NT Server's printers to
appear as print queues on a NetWare network. These print queues may be monitored
by a JetDirect-equipped Hewlett-Packard printer configured for NetWare printing
support in Queue Server mode.

NOTE: The procedure for creating printers differs between Windows NT Server
version 3.51 and 4.0. Please follow the appropriate section below to create a
printer queue.

Creating a Shared Printer or Print Queue on
Windows NT Server 3.51 with FPNW 3.51
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Print Manager.

2. From the Printer menu, click Create to create a new printer.

3. Type a name for the printer. This name will appear as the print queue name to
  NetWare clients and to the JetDirect device.

4. Select the appropriate driver for the printer and type a description for the
  printer.

5. In the "Print to" list, click NetWareCompatiblePServer0 (or the next
  available NetWareCompatiblePserver port number).

6. Click "Share this printer on the network" and type a share name and
  location.

  NOTE: The share name entered here is for Microsoft clients, while the printer
  name will be used as a NetWare queue name for NetWare clients.

7. Click OK.

A print queue now exists, which the JetDirect device will service. The next
section will create a Print Server on FPNW. This print server may or may not be
required depending on the version of the JetDirect device. Consult the JetDirect
documentation to determine if a print server is required on the file server
being serviced. If not, skip the next 2 sections and continue with the On a
NetWare workstation section.

Creating a Print Server on Windows NT Server 3.51
-------------------------------------------------

1. Start Server Manager.

2. Select the name of the Windows NT Server computer being administered.

3. On the FPNW menu, click Print Servers, then click Add.

4. Name the print server. This name must be the same as the HP JetDirect's
  PServer name, which will be created in step 6 of the NetWare Workstation
  section.

5. In the Full Name list, type a name if desired, then click OK.

6. Click Printers, then click Add in the "Printers on Print Server PServerName"
  dialog box.

7. Select a printer name and port number.

  NOTE: The printer name is arbitrary, but the port number should be different
  than other, previously created printers.

8. For the Type, select Defined elsewhere and click OK.

  The printer will now appear on the list of printers.

9. Click Queues.

10. On the Available Queues list, click the printer name defined in Print
  Manager. Click Add-&gt;, and then click OK.

11. Click Close in the "Printers on Print Server PServerName" dialog box, and
  click close in the "Print Server for FileServer" dialog box.

Creating a Shared Printer or Print Queue
On Windows NT Server 4.0 with FPNW 4.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click the Add Printer icon.

3. In the Add Printer Wizard, select the "My Computer" option (default) and
  click Next.

4. In the Available Ports dialog box, select "NetWareCompatiblePServer0" or the
  next available NetWareCompatiblePServer port number and click Next.

5. Select the appropriate driver for the printer and click Next. Type a name for
  the printer when prompted.

  NOTE: The printer name used here will become the print queue name for NetWare
  clients. The share name for the printer, which will be created later, is for
  Microsoft clients.

6. Select the appropriate option for default printer question, then click Next.

7. Pick the Shared option, and type a Share Name for the printer.

  NOTE: The share name will be used by Microsoft clients to connect to the
  printer.

8. Click Next. Select No for the option to print a test page, then click Finish.
  The new printer will appear in the Printers window.

Creating a Print Server on Windows NT Server 4.0
------------------------------------------------

1. Start Server Manager.

2. Be sure to select the name of the Windows NT Server computer being
  administered.

3. On the FPNW menu, click Print Servers, then click Add.

4. Type the name of the print server. This name must be the same as the HP
  JetDirect's PServer name, that will be created in step 6 of the NetWare
  Workstation section.

5. In the Full Name list, type a name if desired, then click OK.

6. Click Printers, then click Add in the "Printers on Print Server PServerName"
  dialog box.

7. Select a printer name and port number.

  NOTE: The printer name is arbitrary, but the port number should be different
  than other previously created printers.

8. For the Type, select Defined elsewhere and click OK.

  The printer will now appear on the list of printers.

9. Click Queues.

10. On the Available Queues list, click the printer name defined in Print
  Manager. Click Add-&gt;, and then click OK.

11. Click Close in the "Printers on Print Server PServerName" dialog box, and
  click close in the "Print Server for FileServer" dialog box.

NetWare Workstation
-------------------

NOTE: The steps below were completed using Hewlett-Packard's JetAdmin version
A.01.11. This is a 16-bit DOS or Windows application. Exact steps to complete
the JetAdmin functions may vary from version to version.

1. Login as Supervisor (or an Administrator equivalent user) to the FPNW server.

2. Start the Hewlett-Packard JetAdmin utility.

3. In the list of JetDirect printers, select the printer to be configured.

4. Click Configuration.

  NOTE: To change the configuration, you must be logged into or attached to the
  NetWare server that the printer was originally configured from as a
  supervisor-equivalent user.

5. In the Printer I/O Configuration window, ensure that the printer is in Queue
  Server operating mode, not Remote Printer mode.

6. In Queue Server Settings, verify that the print server (printer name) matches
  the print server name created on the FPNW server.

7. In the Selected Bindery Print Queues dialog box, click Add Queue. A list of
  print queues on the FPNW server (Windows NT printer names) is displayed.

8. Select the queue created earlier and click Add. A message will appear
  indicating that the queue was added.

9. Click OK, then click Close on the Available Print Queues listing.

10. Verify that the queue appears in the Selected Bindery Print Queues listing.

11. Click OK, and then click on Exit to leave the JetAdmin utility.

To test the functionality of the configuration, capture an LPT port to the new
queue on the FPNW server using the syntax below:

  CAPTURE L=1 S=FPNWServerName Q=FPNWQueueName NB NT TI=10

This capture command redirects LPT1 (L=1) to the FPNW queue (Windows NT
printer).

Parameter   Stands for or does this
------------------------------------------------------------
NB          No Banner
NT          No Tabs (no conversion of tab characters to spaces)
TI=10       Sets the amount of time to wait for more print data
           before sending the job; referred to as AutoEndCap.

NOTE: NetWare administrators may use different settings.

After you capture the port, use the following command to send a directory listing
to the printer:

  DIR &gt; LPT1:

Verify that the page prints.

NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

  or

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX based). For further
