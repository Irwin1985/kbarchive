SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a project or a file to Visual SourceSafe from one of the
applications that Visual SourceSafe integrates with, the following error message
appears:

  File &lt;filename&gt; could not be mapped to the SourceSafe project
  &lt;projectname&gt;

CAUSE
=====

The Visual SourceSafe project structure does not match the directory structure
on the drive that contains the application project.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create a Visual SourceSafe project structure that mirrors your application
project structure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual SourceSafe
version 6.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To distinguish between the Visual SourceSafe project (for example,
$/develop/newproj) and the "project" concept in an integrated application (that
is, .pjx in Visual FoxPro, .mdp in Visual C++, .vbp in Visual Basic), the
"project concept" is referred to as the "application project" in this article.
The directory that contains the application project file (that is, .pjx, .mdp,
.vbp, and so forth) is the "home" directory.

When you add an application project to Visual SourceSafe, you are prompted to
specify the Visual SourceSafe project where you want to store your files. This
is referred to as the "parent" project. The working folder of the parent project
is set to the home directory. When you add a file from the application project
to Visual SourceSafe, the integration looks at the relative path of that file to
the home directory and attempts to add it to a Visual SourceSafe project that
has the same relative path to the parent project.

To illustrate this, assume that you have the following directory structure:

  C:
     \Develop
         \Greatapp
              Greatproj.vbp (file)
              \Forms
                 Greatform.frm

          \Badapp
               Module3.bas  (file)

The application project Greatproj contains the files Greatform.frm and
Module3.bas. You add Greatproj to Visual SourceSafe, in a project named
$/Apps/Greatapp.

In this example, the home directory is C:\Develop\Greatapp and the parent project
is $/Apps/Greatapp.

Consider how the Visual SourceSafe integration attempts to store the three
files.

Greatproj.vbp is stored in $/Apps/Greatapp.

Greatform.frm is stored in $/Apps/Greatapp/Forms.

NOTE: If the /Forms subproject does not exist, it should be created
programmatically by the integration when you first add Greatproj.vbp to Visual
SourceSafe. However, if project security is enabled, you will receive the "File
or Project not Found" error due to a bug in the integration. Either disable
project security prior to adding the application project under Visual
SourceSafe, or create the subproject manually and add the missing files.


Module3.bas - The integration looks for a sibling project to $/Apps/Greatapp
named $/Apps/Badapp. The relative path from Greatproj.vbp to Module3.bas in the
directory structure is "up one level then down one level into badapp." The
integration attempts to map this relative path accordingly. If $/Apps/Badapps
does not exist, the error message appears. This is correct behavior because the
integration only creates subprojects of the parent project.

Take into account that subprojects of the parent are only created by the
integration when the application project is first added to Visual SourceSafe.
For example, after adding Greatproj to Visual SourceSafe you create a new
subdirectory (C:\develop\greatapp\modules), save Module4.bas in that
subdirectory, and add Module4.bas to the application project. When you attempt
to add Module4.bas to Visual SourceSafe, the error message appears because the
integration is looking for the following subproject:

     $/Apps/Greatapp/Modules.

Again the relative path from Greatproj.vbp to Module4.bas is "down one level into
modules", and fails if there is no matching subproject.
