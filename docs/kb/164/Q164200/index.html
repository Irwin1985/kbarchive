The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files located
in the Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

The following article describes how to turn off (mute) all sounds within
Creative Writer. This can be done by editing the Windows registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To turn off the sounds in Creative Writer, you can change the Mute value to 1 in
the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Kids\ Creative Writer key in
the Windows 95 registry.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk. The registry is a system-wide database used for storing
Windows 95 software and hardware configuration settings.

To mute all sounds in Creative Writer, do the following:

1. Backup your System.dat and User.dat files.

2. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

3. Type the following and click OK:

  "regedit" (without the quotation marks)

4. Change the Mute value to 1 in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\
  Microsoft\Microsoft Kids\Creative Writer key in the Windows 95 registry by
  doing the following:
  a. When the Registry Editor appears, double-click the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
     folder.

  b. Double-click the SOFTWARE folder, and then double-click the Microsoft
     folder.

  c. Double-click the Microsoft Kids folder, and then double-click the Creative
     Writer folder.

  d. Double-click the Mute value.

  e. Change the Value Data from 0 to 1, and then click OK.

5. Close the Registry Editor and launch Creative Writer.

The sounds in Creative Writer are now disabled.

NOTE: If you do not have a sound card installed in your computer, you may receive
the following error message which means you do not have a sound card installed:

  Creative Writer could not access a sound card on your computer.
  The sound card is missing, or one of the sound devices (sound effects or MIDI
  music) is incompatible.
