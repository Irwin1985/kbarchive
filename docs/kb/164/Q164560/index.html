SUMMARY
=======

The following procedures allow you to update a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
client installation point with Microsoft Exchange Server Service Pack 1 binary
files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This allows new users to run the client Setup once and have all the fixes in
Service Pack 1 on their workstation. This also allows an existing Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.0 RTM user to run client Setup just once (instead of twice) to
update the workstation with all of the Service Pack 1 files.

These procedures are very detailed and require a lot of editing by the system
administrator. It is easy to make an editing mistake, so take your time and
double-check your changes. These procedures will work for all client platforms
and languages. Thorough testing is recommended before making this installation
point available to your users.

To update a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Client installation point with
Microsoft Exchange Client Service Pack 1 binary files:

1. Create a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 Client Administration share on your
  network by using the "setup /a" command. This provides all the binary files
  in expanded form and eliminates the CAB files. Name the directory Sp1.mod.

2. Run Setup Editor (if you have done so in the past) and do your normal
  modifications.

3. In a separate directory on your network, copy the contents of the Microsoft
  Exchange 5.0 SP1 client directory that matches the client you set up in Step
  1. Name the directory Sp1.org.

4. Copy the Extract.exe and Sp1extrt.bat files from the Support directory of the
  Service Pack 1 compact disk to the Sp1.org directory. If you have downloaded
  Service Pack 1 from the Internet, and thus do not have the compact disk,
  these files can be found in Sp1_50wh.exe.

5. From the Sp1.org directory, run Sp1extrt.bat. This will create an
  \Sp1.org\Rawsp1 directory and will place all the extracted Service Pack 1
  binary files there.

6. Using your favorite text editor (do not use Edit.com), open
  Sp1.mod\Exchng.inf and \Sp1.org\Rawsp1\Exchng.inf.

7. For each line listed under the [Client Files] section in
  Sp1.org\Rawsp1\Exchng.inf, make the corresponding date, size, and version
  changes in \Sp1.mod\Exchng.inf. If the file does not exist in
  Sp1.mod\Exchng.inf, skip it. Do not do a complete line copy; this will break
  Setup.

  VERY IMPORTANT! Only change the date, the size (if it changes), and the
  version. Be careful not to delete commas or additional fields.

8. After your modifications are complete, save it to its original location and
  close the text editor.

9. Replace the .dll files in \Sp1.mod\System with the corresponding .dll files
  in Sp1.org\Rawsp1.

You are now ready to test your client installation.

NOTE: Extract.exe is a Win16 utility.
