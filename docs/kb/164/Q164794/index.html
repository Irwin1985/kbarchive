-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article only applies to DBCS (double byte character set) code pages.
DBCS code pages include all of the following:

  290 Japanese (Katakana)
  930 Japanese (Extend Katakana)
  931 Japanese (English-lower)
  933 Korean
  935 Chinese (PRC)
  937 Chinese (Taiwan)
  939 Japanese (Extend English)

1. Carriage Return (0x0D) Not Interpreted Correctly with 5250 Printing


2. Print Server Doesn't Send Form Feed (FF) When NL or LF Is on Last Line


3. Last Line Doesn't Print When Using SNA Server Print Server


4. SNA Server Print Server Ignores the First LF and NL


5. Problem with PrintPosition (AbsoluteHorizontalMove)


6. Added Support for Thick Dotted Line, SHF, SPCC, and STO


7. FF Command Is Not Positioned at Line-1 Column-1 of Next Page


8. Application Exception in Snaprint.exe with STO


SYMPTOMS
========

1. Carriage Return (0x0D) Not Interpreted Correctly with 5250 Printing

  SYMPTOMS

  Sending the following sequence to the 5250 Print Service (J version)

  "AAAA"+CR+LF+"BBBB"+NL (interpreted to ASCII for clarity)

  Will result in:

  AAAA
      BBBB

  The expected result is:

  AAAA
  BBBB


2. Print Server Doesn't Send Form Feed (FF) When NL or LF Is on Last Line

  SYMPTOMS

  When using the SNA Server Print Server (J version) to print to an AS/400, and
  a new line (NL) or line feed (LF) character is on the last line of the
  printable area, a form feed (FF) is not generated. Therefore, any remaining
  printable text is not printed on the next page.


3. Last Line Doesn't Print When Using SNA Server Print Server

  SYMPTOMS

  When using the SNA Server Print Server (J version) to print to an AS/400, the
  last line may not print. The SNA Server Print Server (J version) does not
  correctly flush the write buffer for an end-of-page.


4. SNA Server Print Server Ignores the First LF and NL

  SYMPTOMS

  SNA Server Print Server ignores the first line feed or new line it comes
  across.


5. Problem with PrintPosition (AbsoluteHorizontalMove)

  SYMPTOMS

  The following is a sample datastream (converted to ASCII for ease of
  readability):

  "AAAAA"+LF+PP(AHM 3)+"BBBB"+NL

  The expected result is:

  AAAAA
     BBBBB

  The actual result is:

  AAAAA

  ("BBBB" was not printed.)


6. Added Support for Thick Dotted Line, SHF, SPCC, and STO

  SUMMARY

  The following features have been added to DBCS printing in the SNA Server 3.0
  J version:

   - Support for Thick Dotted Line.

   - Support for the Set Horizontal Format (SHF) SCS command to support Max
     Print Position (MPP).

   - Support for the Set Presentation of Control Character (SPCC) command, to
     support the presentation of control characters (SI/SO).

   - Support for the Set Text Orientation (STO) command, to rotate a DBCS
     character.

  These changes were made to the DBCS environment, and do not include SBCS.


7. FF Command Is Not Positioned at Line-1 Column-1 of Next Page

  SYMPTOMS

  The following is a sample datastream:

  Sent data:

  "12345" (NL) "67890" (FF) "ABCDE"
  (NL:New Line)

  The following is the result:

  &lt;Page 1&gt;
  12345 &lt;line 1&gt;
  67890 &lt;line 2&gt;

  &lt;Page 2&gt;
    &lt;line 1&gt;
      ABCDE   &lt;line 2&gt;

  Notice the ABCDE is indented to the right; it should be left justified.


8. Application Exception in Snaprint.exe with STO

  SYMPTOMS

  When printing to an AS/400 using SNA Server 3.0 Print Server and selecting a
  DBCS character set, a general protection fault (GPF) occurs if you send a
  print job with STO in its datastream.

  The GPF is in the following function:

  WinVPRTSetTextOrientation within SNAPrint.exe.

  The following is the assembler call:

  cmp     byte ptr [edx],0x40          ds:00000000=??
