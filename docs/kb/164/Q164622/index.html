SYMPTOMS
========

When you record a macro to insert a picture(on the Insert menu, point to Picture
and click From File), and

- you choose Link to File,

-and-

- the picture is located in the same folder or in a folder belonging to the
  same folder as your document,

the macro records an absolute path for the picture instead of recording a
relative path as expected. When the macro is run, the field code used for the
linked picture is an absolute path instead of a relative path.

WORKAROUND
==========

To change the path for the linked picture, edit the recorded macro and change
the path for the linked picture from "absolute" to "relative."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert a picture into a document and the picture is located in the same
folder or in a folder belonging to the same folder as your document, if you
choose Link to File, the linked path for the picture is stored as a "relative
path".

For example, if the document path is

  c:\My Documents\MyPage\mydoc.doc

and the picture file path is

  c:\My Documents\MyPage\Images\myimage.bmp

viewing the field code, the relative path is:

  {INCLUDEPICTURE "Images\\myimage.bmp" \* MERGEFORMAT \d}

However, when you record a macro to insert a linked picture whose path is
relative to the document in which it is being inserted, the path is recorded and
played back as an absolute path. For example, the resulting macro would record
and play back the path to the picture, in the IncludePicture field, as:

  {INCLUDEPICTURE "c:\My Documents\MyPage\Images\myimage.bmp" \* MERGEFORMAT
  \d}

To toggle the viewing of field codes, on the keyboard, press and hold "Alt" then
press F9.
