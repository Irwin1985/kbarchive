-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 4.0 on a Digital Equipment Corporation DEC
AlphaServer, the setup process may stop responding and may not respond to user
input.

Windows NT 4.0 may stop responding before or during a system boot at the Blue
kernel screen although displaying the Operating system version, number of
processors, and amount of memory. Additionally, the computer's NVRAM variables
may get corrupted.

This can happen during an initial installation, although performing an Upgrade
from Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0, or after Windows NT 4.0 is already
installed and running.

CAUSE
=====

There is a version conflict between certain revisions of the Mainboard, I/O
module, ARC firmware, and Windows NT 4.0 HAL files that can cause your system to
malfunction if you run Windows NT on any of the following systems:

- AlphaServer 2000 4/xxx and 5/xxx

- AlphaServer 2100 4/xxx and 5/xxx

- AlphaServer 2100A 4/xxx and 5/xxx

RESOLUTION
==========

You must upgrade your ARC firmware to version 4.50 or later, and update your
Windows NT 4.0 HAL files to the version posted on Digital's WWW site.

For information on updating your System firmware and to download the updated HAL
files, please contact Digital technical support at:

  http://www.windows.digital.com/support

MORE INFORMATION
================

The methods you use to update the firmware and HAL are different depending on
whether:

- Windows NT 4.0 is already installed.

- You are performing a fresh installation of Windows NT 4.0.

- You are upgrading from Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0.

- You have just replaced your I/O module or mainboard, and your system will not
  boot the ARC firmware.

NOTE: If you are already running ARC firmware 4.50 or later, you can skip the
steps in the instructions related to upgrading the firmware. The ARC firmware
version currently installed in your system is displayed on the ARC Boot screen.

If you are running ARC firmware 4.50 or later, do not downgrade to an earlier
revision.

STEP A: Updating the System Firmware
------------------------------------

For information on updating your System firmware, please contact Digital
technical support at http://www.windows.digital.com/support


STEP B: Upgrading HAL on Systems with Windows NT 4.0 Already Installed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download the updated Hal.dll files from Digital.

  Please contact Digital technical support at:
  http://www.windows.digital.com/support

2. Expand the Hal.zip file you downloaded from DEC, and then put them onto a
  separate floppy disk.

3. On the SYSTEM partition, go to the OS\Winnt40 directory.

  NOTE: If you do not see any files in the right-hand pane, change the File
  Manager or Explorer settings as appropriate to show all files and file
  extensions. These files normally have the hidden, system, and read- only
  attributes set.

4. In your OS\Winnt40 directory, rename the Hal.dll file to Hal.old.

5. Unzip the Hal.zip file you downloaded from DEC into a separate, temporary
  directory on your hard disk drive. Then Copy the new Hal_name.dll file from
  the temporary directory on your hard disk drive into the directory OS\Winnt40
  containing the Hal.old file in your system partition, and rename the file you
  copied to Hal.dll.

6. Shutdown and restart your system.

STEP C: Installing the Upgraded HAL on a Fresh Installation of Windows NT 4.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are performing a first time installation of Windows NT 4.0, follow these
steps to install the updated HAL and firmware files:

1. Upgrade the system Firmware.

  For information on updating your firmware, please contact Digital technical
  support at: http://www.windows.digital.com/support

2. Download the updated Hal.dll files from Digital.

  Please contact Digital technical support at:
  http://www.windows.digital.com/support

3. Expand the Hal.zip file you downloaded from DEC and put them onto a separate
  floppy disk.

4. Begin Windows NT installation. When prompted for your system type, select
  Other and insert the floppy disk containing the updated HAL files into the
  floppy disk drive. Press Enter twice to select and confirm that you want to
  install the files from the floppy disk.

5. Proceed with the remainder of the Windows NT installation normally.

STEP D: Installing the Upgraded HAL and Firmware Files When Upgrading from Windows NT 3.51 to Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you already have Windows NT 3.51 installed and are upgrading to Windows NT
4.0, follow these steps to upgrade the HAL and firmware files:

1. Upgrade the system Firmware.

  For information on updating your firmware, please contact Digital technical
  support at: http://www.windows.digital.com/support

2. Download the updated Hal.dll files from Digital. Please contact Digital
  technical support at: http://www.windows.digital.com/support

3. Expand the Hal.zip file you downloaded from DEC and put them onto a separate
  floppy disk.

4. Begin the Windows NT upgrade. When prompted for your system type, select
  Other and insert the floppy disk containing the updated HAL files into the
  disk drive. Press Enter twice to select and confirm that you want to install
  the files from the floppy disk.

5. Proceed with the remainder of the Windows NT 4.0 upgrade normally.
