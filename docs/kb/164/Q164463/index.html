SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore the information store of a Microsoft Exchange Server computer
from a backup and join an existing site, you may not see any users in the
server's Recipients container.

You may, however, see the recipient resources in the server's Private Information
Store Mailbox Resources property page.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: These steps use the DS/IS consistency adjuster. For additional information
about the rehoming effects that may occur if you use this tool, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q182979 XADM: Function and Effects of Running the DS/IS Consistency Adjuster

To resolve this problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0:

NOTE: If the original mailboxes were located on another container, this container
must first be re-created before performing the steps below.

1. Start DS/IS consistency adjuster as follows:

Select the server name under the Servers container, and then on the File menu
click Properties, click Advanced, then click Consistency Adjuster.

2. Make sure that Synchronize with the directory in the Information Store
  properties is selected, and then click the All Inconsistencies option button
  and click Adjust.

3. Confirm that all the user names are now present in the recipient container.

To resolve this problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0:

NOTE: If the original mailboxes were located on another container, this container
must first be re-created before performing the steps below.

1. Start DS/IS consistency adjuster as follows:

  Select the server name under the Servers container, then click Properties on
  the File menu, and click Advanced.

2. Make sure that the Directory and Information Store check boxes are selected,
  and then select the All Inconsistencies radio button and click Adjust.

3. Confirm that all the user names are now present in the recipient container.

To resolve this problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0:

- Follow the same procedure as above, unless any of the mailboxes are contained
  in the subcontainers. In that case, you must first manually re-create each
  mailbox (using exactly the same DN) before you start the DS/IS consistency
  adjuster.

For additional information on manually re-creating the mailboxes, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
