SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information on troubleshooting possible configuration
problems Internet Protocol (IP) Routing Information Protocol (RIP) when you use
Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following list contains possible configuration problems with IP RIP. All the
options mentioned in these steps are configured on a per-interface basis. You
can accomplish this with the Routing and Remote Access administrator tool found
in the Administrator Tool (Common) group. Routing and Remote Access
administrator can also be started by running Mpradmin.exe. This is not the same
as IP RIP service included with Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0.

- If you have a mixed environment of RIP version 1 and RIP version 2, Check the
  General tab to verify that RIP version 2 is using broadcast instead of
  multicast.

- If you have selected the Enable Authentication box on the General tab, make
  sure that the password in the Password box is the same as the password on the
  router receiving packets from this interface. By default, authentication is
  off. Passwords are case sensitive.

- Ensure that you are only accepting routes from the routers you want. Check
  the Security tab to see which routers are allowed to exchange information. By
  default, all routes are accepted.

- If host routes or default routes are not being propagated as you expect,
  change settings on the Advanced tab. By default, host and default routes are
  not sent or accepted.

- If RIP does not learn routes over a demand-dial link, use multicast instead
  of broadcast. This is because demand-dial links can have endpoints on
  different subnets where broadcast RIP requests cannot be heard.

- When you use Auto-Static RIP on a demand-dial interface, you must manually
  update routes the first time you make a connection. To do this, click Summary
  in the IP Routing folder, select the demand-dial interface, right-click,
  point to Update Routes and then click. This must also be done on the other
  router for the corresponding interface. The routes then appear under Static
  Routes.
