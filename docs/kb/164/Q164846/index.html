SYMPTOMS
========

Invited attendees, including resource accounts, are not sent a cancellation
notice when they are removed from the list of invited attendees for an
appointment.

For example, John invites Robin to a meeting in Conference Room 1.

John creates a new appointment and places Robin in the Required List and places
Conference Room 1 in the Resource List. Robin receives the meeting request and
accepts. The conference room is set up to automatically accept all meeting
requests and does so.

Later, John decides he would like to move the meeting to Conference Room 2
because he also wishes to invite his whole team.

John edits the appointment and adds the group, JohnsTeam, to the Required List.
He removes Conference Room 1 and adds Conference Room 2 to the Resource List.
The team members are sent a meeting invitation and so is the resource Conference
Room 2, which is also set up to automatically accept all meeting requests.

The James decides that he would like to meet Marian on this same day but is
unable to find a meeting place. The only two conference rooms seem to be booked;
Conference Room 1 never received a cancellation message from John's Schedule+
client.

CAUSE
=====

Cancellation messages are not sent to individual users or resource accounts when
they are removed from the list of invitees of an appointment.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you must cancel the entire appointment and then
create a new appointment with the new list of invitees and resources. Canceling
the appointment causes a cancellation message to be sent to all invitees.
