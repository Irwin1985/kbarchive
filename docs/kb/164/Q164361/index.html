The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the SelStart property on an Edit box that is in a PageFrame, Page
tabs appear to freeze and any object outside of the PageFrame do not receive
focus. Additionally, resizing or minimizing and then maximizing, the form
results in improper refreshing of the form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0a.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SelStart property is used with the Edit box to return the starting point of
a text selection made by the user in a text-entry area of the edit box, or it
indicates the position of the insertion point if no text is selected. But using
the SelStart property on an Edit box in a PageFrame causes unexpected behavior
with the objects on a form and with the form itself.

For example, moving through the pages of the PageFrame after the SelStart
property has been activated on the Edit box can only be accomplished by clicking
on a Page tab. Note the Page tab that is clicked does not become highlighted. If
the tab key is pressed or the cursor is used to move to an object on the
PageFrame, it is possible to move through the objects on the PageFrame but any
objects outside of the PageFrame do not receive focus when trying to click on or
tab to them.

The form has refresh problems, also, after the SelStart property is activated on
the Edit box. For example, resizing the form larger than the original size
causes multiple form borders to appear. Minimizing and then maximizing the form
causes the tabs of the PageFrame to disappear. Moving through the objects on the
PageFrame can still be accomplished, but to move to another page of the
PageFrame requires clicking where the tab should be located and then the objects
on that page appear.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and place a PageFrame on it.

2. Right-click on the PageFrame and choose the Edit menu option.

3. Place a text box on page one of the PageFrame.

4. Click on page two of the PageFrame and place an edit box and text box on it.

5. Place the following code in the GotFocus event of the edit box.

  THIS.SELSTART = 0

6. Click on the form to set focus back to the form. Place a text box on the
  form.

7. Run the form and press the Tab key to move through the objects on the form.
  Note that the cursor moves from the text box on the PageFrame and then to the
  text box on the form.

8. Click on page two of the PageFrame and tab to the edit box. Note that trying
  to click back to page one shows the text box on page one, but the tab for
  page two stays highlighted. When trying to click on the text box on the form,
  focus stays on the objects in the PageFrame.

9. Try resizing or minimizing the form and then maximizing it. Note that the
  form does not refresh properly.
