The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access 97 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multi-user skills.

You notice duplicate relationships appearing in a data (back-end) database under
one or both of the following conditions:

- When you import tables into a new database, and the tables you are importing
  are links to a data database.

- When you check in, check out, or get the latest version of the Data and Misc.
  Objects in a database under source code control that contains linked tables

This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for Applications and
with creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided
with Microsoft Access. For more information about Visual Basic for Applications,
please refer to the "Building Applications with Microsoft Access 97" manual.

This article also assumes that you are familiar with using the client-side
capabilities of Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual SourceSafe,
please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or the Help topics
available from the Visual SourceSafe Help menu.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the following custom procedure periodically in your data database to remove
the duplicate relationships that are created when you import linked tables, or
when you check out, check in, or get the latest version of Data and Misc.
Objects in a database under source code control.

Create a module in your data database and type the following procedure:

     Function CleanMeUp()
        Dim db As Database
        Dim relFirst As Relation, relSecond As Relation
        Dim bDifferent As Boolean
        Dim iField As Integer

        Set db = CurrentDb()
        For Each relFirst In db.Relations()
           For Each relSecond In db.Relations()
              ' Make sure the names are different, the foreign tables are
              ' the same, the tables are the same, and they both have the
              ' same number of fields.
              If (relFirst.Name &lt;&gt; relSecond.Name) And _
              (relFirst.ForeignTable = relSecond.ForeignTable) And _
              (relFirst.Table = relSecond.Table) And _
              (relFirst.Fields.Count = relSecond.Fields.Count) Then
                 bDifferent = False
                    For iField = 0 To relFirst.Fields().Count - 1
                     ' If any of the fields are different, these two rels
                     ' are not duplicates.
                        If (relFirst.Fields(iField).Name &lt;&gt; _
                        relSecond.Fields(iField).Name) Or _
                        (relFirst.Fields(iField).ForeignName &lt;&gt; _
                        relSecond.Fields(iField).ForeignName) Then _
                           bDifferent = True
                    Next iField
                 ' If you don't find any differences, then delete the
                 ' second rel.
                 If Not bDifferent Then
                    db.Relations.Delete relSecond.Name
                 End If
              End If
           Next relSecond
        Next relFirst
     End Function

To run this function, type the following line in the Debug window, and then press
ENTER.

  CleanMeUp

After the procedure runs, click Relationships on the Tools menu, or open the
MSysRelationships system table in your data database and note that duplicate
relationships are gone.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. This
problem no longer occurs in Microsoft Access 97 Service Release 1.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The sections that follow contain steps to reproduce the problem in two different
scenarios. To prepare for either example, follow the next 9 steps first.

CAUTION: Following the steps in this example will modify the sample database
Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file and perform these
steps on a copy of the database.

1. Start Microsoft Access and open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. In the Options dialog box, click the View tab.

4. Under the View tab, click System Objects, and then click OK.

5. Open the MSysRelationships table and note the number of rows in the table.

6. On the File menu, click New Database. Create a new blank database called
  Front1.mdb.

7. On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Link Tables.

8. In the Link dialog box, locate the sample database Northwind.mdb, and then
  click the Link button. Northwind.mdb is installed by default in your \Program
  Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples folder.

9. In the Link Tables dialog box, click the following tables, and then click
  OK:

  Categories
  Customers
  Employees
  Order Details
  Orders
  Products
  Shippers
  Suppliers

Steps to Reproduce Problem by Importing Linked Tables
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Perform the nine steps at the beginning of this section.

2. On the File menu, click New Database. Create a new blank database called
  Front2.mdb.

3. On the File menu, point to Get External Data, and then click Import.

4. In the Import dialog box, locate Front1.mdb, and then click the Import
  button.

5. In the Import Objects dialog box, click the following tables:

  Categories
  Customers
  Employees
  Order Details
  Orders
  Products
  Shippers
  Suppliers

6. Click the Options button, and then click Relationships. Click OK.

7. Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

8. Open the MSysRelationships table. Note that the number of rows in the table
  is greater than the number you noted the first time you opened it.

Steps to Reproduce Problem in a Database Under Source Code Control
------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to follow these steps, you must have both the Source Code Control
component of Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools and source code control
software, such as Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, installed on your computer.

1. Perform the nine steps at the beginning of this section.

2. Add Front1.mdb to source code control by pointing to SourceSafe on the Tools
  menu, and then click Add Database to SourceSafe. Follow the instructions on
  your screen to add the database to a SourceSafe project.

3. On the Tools menu, point to SourceSafe and then click Get Latest Version.

4. In the Get Objects from SourceSafe dialog box, click Data and Misc. Objects,
  and then click OK.

5. Open the sample database Northwind.mdb.

6. Open the MSysRelationships table. Note that the number of rows in the table
  is greater than the number you noted the first time you opened it.
