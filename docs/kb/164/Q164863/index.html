The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Connector interchange (MSMI) on Microsoft Exchange, when
acting as a gateway between MS Mail postoffices, sets the Reply-To of all
outbound messages to the MS Mail address of the Exchange user who is sending the
message, or of the custom recipient sending the message if a custom recipient is
defined for the originator of the message. This allows the recipient a reliable
path back to the originator.

This behavior may not be wanted with SNADS addresses as custom recipients. When
the recipient on MS Mail pulls up details about the originator of the message,
the recipient gets only the Network/postoffice/Username portion of the address
rather than the user's full SNADS address. The behavior in question does not
cause any problems with message flow or directory synchronization. However, the
behavior does not allow the recipient to determine who sent the message if the
sender has the same name as another person in the e-mail environment.

For example, a customer has an Exchange Server computer (named SERVER1), which
has an MSMI connecting to an MS Mail postoffice (named SERVER1/PO1), which has a
SNADS gateway installed on it. The customer also has another Exchange Server
computer (named SERVER2), which has an MSMI connecting to another MSMail
postoffice (named SERVER2/PO1). All names from the SNADS postoffices and the MS
Mail postoffices are synchronized into Exchange.

                                          MSMAIL      Exchange Server
 SNADS postoffices &lt;-&gt; SNADS GATEWAY &lt;-&gt; SERVER1/PO1 &lt;-&gt; SERVER1 &lt;-----\ 
                                                                       |
                                                             Exchange MTA
                                                                       |
                                           MSMAIL      Exchange Server |
                                         SERVER2/PO1 &lt;--&gt; SERVER2 &lt;----/  

Assume that SNADS postoffices all have a DGN/DEN according to where that
particular SNADS postoffice is located physically. For example, they have one
with DGN/DEN of EUROPE/PARIS and one with DGN/DEN of AUSTRALIA/SYDNEY. Each of
these two SNADS postoffices by chance has a user named Bob with a SNADS address
of EUROPE/PARIS/BOB and AUSTRALIA/SYDNEY/BOB respectively.

When these users are synchronized into Exchange, each receives a proxy- generated
MS Mail 10/10/10 address. Assuming the connector postoffice name on SERVER1 is
EXCHANGE, the first Bob receives an MS Mail proxy address of
SERVER1/EXCHANGE/BOB, and the second Bob receives an MSMail proxy address of
SERVER1/EXCHANGE/BOB2. (Assume that EUROPE/PARIS/BOB was imported first.)

Assume that the SNADS user Bob (EUROPE/PARIS/BOB) sends a message to an MSMail
user named Mike on SERVER1/PO1. If Mike wishes to obtain information about the
originator of the message, the details of the sender are given as the
proxy-generated MS Mail 10/10/10 address of SERVER1/EXCHANGE/BOB, which does not
convey the location information represented in the SNADS address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 Service Pack 2 and later, you can set a
registry value to indicate to the MSMI that all messages outbound that were
originated by a custom address with a target address of type SNADS are to be
sent with the Reply-To set to the user's SNADS address instead of the user's MS
Mail (PC) type address. MS Mail (PC) type address.

After setting this registry value, users who receive mail from a SNADS user and
get details on that user's address will see the user's DGN/DEN SNADS style
address instead of the user's proxy-generated 10/10/10. The downside to this is
each MSMail postoffice must have the SNADS Access Component installed in order
to reply to these messages.

To change the MSMI's behavior to send out the SNADS address as the Reply-To
instead of the proxy-generated 10/10/10, do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following subkey:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
     \MSExchangeMSMI\Parameters

3. Add the following case-sensitive DWORD value of 1:

     Send SNADS as Reply-To

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Stop and restart the Microsoft Mail interchange service.
