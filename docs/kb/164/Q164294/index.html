SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the ServerName of the FrontPage Personal
Web Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ServerName affects the name the server returns to a client. For example, if a
Web browser requests http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage, the server redirects
that to http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/ (with a trailing slash) so that
relative links are interpreted correctly. The server does not know the name that
was sent in the original request (without the trailing slash), so it typically
uses the host name as returned by the Transport Control Protocol (TCP).

This can lead to problems in three cases:

- Your machine is known by multiple names and you want to control which name is
  returned (for example, mail.example.com and www.example.com).
- Your TCP is configured incorrectly so the server cannot determine its server
  name.
- You are using the FrontPage 1.0 Personal Web Server (PWS), and your hostname
  is not qualified (does not contain any dots). The original PWS would reject
  nonqualified domain names because they would be misinterpreted if they were
  sent outside the local domain.

The recommended solution to case 2 above is to fix your TCP/IP configuration. As
an interim workaround, you might change the ServerName, but this is not
preferred and will lead to problems on a networked machine.

Use the following steps to change the ServerName for the FrontPage Personal Web
Server:

1. Using a text editor, such as Notepad, open the Httpd.cnf file. This file is
  located in the c:\FrontPage Webs\Server\conf subdirectory.

  In FrontPage 1.0, this file is located in the C:\Vermeer\http\conf
  subdirectory.

2. Locate the section which describes the ServerName directive. It looks like
  this:

     # ServerName allows you to set a host name that is sent back to
     # clients for your server. If it's different than the one the
     # program would get (i.e. use "www" instead of the host's real
     # name). Make sure your DNS is set up to alias the name to your
     # system!
     #
     # Format: ServerName &lt;domain_name&gt;
     #
     # no default

3. Add the following line:

  ServerName &lt;domain_name&gt;

  where &lt;domain_name&gt; is the name of your domain.

  NOTE: The server name cannot contain spaces.

  If you are naming your server "localhost" (without the quotation marks), type
  this line so that it looks like this:

  ServerName localhost

4. Save and close the file.

Restart the FrontPage Personal Web Server. It will respond to the name you typed
in step 3.

NOTE: If your computer does not have DNS enabled and your TCP/IP stack supports
it, you can use "localhost" (without the quotation marks) as your computer name
without having to make the changes described in this article. You will also be
able to specify "localhost" if your computer has a host name that is not fully
qualified. To determine if your TCP/IP stack supports this configuration, run
the FrontPage 1.1 TCP/IP test. In FrontPage 97, start the FrontPage Explorer,
click About Microsoft FrontPage Explorer on the Help menu, and then click
Network Test.
