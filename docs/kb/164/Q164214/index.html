SUMMARY
=======

There are two types of distributed routing technologies. They are Distance
Vector and Link State. This article discusses Distance Vector routing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Distance Vector routing algorithm is sometimes referred to as Bellman- Ford.
In Distance Vector routing, each entity keeps a routing database with one entry
for every possible destination in the system.

The Distance Vector routing protocol specifies that each router advertises to its
adjacent neighbors its routing table. For each network destination, the
receiving routers pick the neighbor advertising the lowest cost, and then add
this entry to its routing table. HELLO and RIP are common Distance Vector
routing protocols.

The problem with Distance Vector routing is slow convergence. In Distance Vector
routing, when a change is made, the changes must be propagated to each router.
This propagation causes all routing tables affected by this change to be
recalculated. Distance Vector routing can be very slow converging after a
topical change.

A detailed explanation of the algorithm itself can be found in RFC 1058. The
following is an excerpt from RFC 1058:

  "In simple networks, it is common to use a metric that simply counts how many
  gateways a message must go through. In more complex networks, a metric is
  chosen to represent the total amount of delay that the message suffers, the
  cost of sending it, or some other quantity which may be minimized. The main
  requirement is that it must be possible to represent the metric as a sum of
  'costs' for individual hops.

  "Formally, if it is possible to get from entity i to entity j directly (i.e.,
  without passing through another gateway between), then a cost, d(i,j), is
  associated with the hop between i and j. In the normal case where all
  entities on a given network are considered to be the same, d(i,j) is the same
  for all destinations on a given network, and represents the cost of using
  that network. To get the metric of a complete route, one just adds up the
  costs of the individual hops that make up the route. For the purposes of this
  memo, we assume that the costs are positive integers.

  "Let D(i,j) represent the metric of the best route from entity i to entity j.
  It should be defined for every pair of entities. d(i,j) represents the costs
  of the individual steps. Formally, let d(i,j) represent the cost of going
  directly from entity i to entity j. It is infinite if i and j are not
  immediate neighbors. (Note that d(i,i) is infinite. That is, we don't
  consider there to be a direct connection from a node to itself.) Since costs
  are additive, it is easy to show that the best metric must be described by

     D(i,i) = 0,                      all i
     D(i,j) = min [d(i,k) + D(k,j)],  otherwise k

  and that the best routes start by going from i to those neighbors k for which
  d(i,k) + D(k,j) has the minimum value. (These things can be shown by
  induction on the number of steps in the routes.) Note that we can limit the
  second equation to k's that are immediate neighbors of i. For the others,
  d(i,k) is infinite, so the term involving them can never be the minimum."
