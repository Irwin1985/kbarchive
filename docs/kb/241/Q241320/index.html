The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A 3270 or LUA LU (Logical Unit) may show a "Blank" status in SNA Server Manager
after the host connection it is associated with is moved to another SNA Server
computer. Usually, the "Blank" LU status is only seen on instances of SNA Server
Manager other than the one where the connection move was performed. On the
computer where the connection move was performed, the connection and its LUs
will have the same status as they had prior to the connection move, which may
also be an incorrect status.

This can also occur when a connection and its associated LUs are moved from one
SNA Server service to another SNA Server service on the same SNA Server
computer. A computer running SNA Server 4.0 (or later) can support up to four
SNA Server services.

CAUSE
=====

The Manage components associated with a connection and its LUs are not moved
when the connection is moved to another SNA Server computer. Also, moving a
connection between SNA Server services on the same SNA Server 4.0 (or later)
computer results in the Manage components being duplicated. This can cause LU
status updates to be sent to the incorrect Manage objects, which results in
incorrect an LU status in SNA Server Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example demonstrates how this problem occurs when you move
connections between SNA Servers and SNA Server services on the same SNA Server
system:

Configuration:

  Primary SNA Server 4.0 SP2 system
  Backup SNA Server 4.0 SP2 system

Connections moved using the drag-and-drop operation in SNA Server Manager:

  TEST1 - Originally on the primary SNA Server service on the Primary SNA
  Server (PRIMARY)
  TEST2 - Originally on the primary SNA Server service on the Backup SNA Server
  (BACKUP)

Each connection had one 3270 LU defined.

TEST1 is configured for On Demand startup.
TEST2 is configured for On Server Startup.

1. Open SNA Server Manager on both SNA Server computers.

2. The primary SNA Server service on both SNA Server computers is Active, as is
  the secondary SNA Server service on BACKUP.

3. Use the drag-and-drop operation to move TEST1 from Primary SNA Server
  (PRIMARY) to primary SNA Server service on Backup SNA Server (BACKUP). Assign
  a link service (SNADEMO1) to the connection.

4. Use the drag-and-drop operation to move TEST2 from primary SNA Server service
  on BACKUP to secondary SNA Server service on BACKUP. Assign a link service
  (SNADEMO2) to the connection.

5. Save the configuration.

6. SNA Server Manager, where the connection moves were performed, shows the
  following status:

  Connection LU

  TEST1(Active) Available
  TEST2 (Active) Available

  This is incorrect because a connection moved to a new SNA Server service
  cannot be active and the LU cannot be Available.

7. Other instances of SNA Server Manager that are open show the following when
  the configuration is refreshed:

  Connection LU

  TEST1 (Offline) Blank
  TEST2 (Offline) Blank

8. The SNA Server services on the backup SNA Server (BACKUP) are "Out of Date"
  as expected. Restarting the SNA Server services corrects the status problem
  in SNA Server Manager on the primary SNA server (PRIMARY) where the moves
  were performed.
