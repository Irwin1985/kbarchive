-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After successfully running for a period of time, the SNA Server computer may
stop responding. All active sessions may lock up and new sessions may not
activate. The response to mouse movements, keyboard entry, and video updates may
be slow. This problem is specific to Compaq systems running Compaq Insight
Manager 4.22.

CAUSE
=====

The Compaq Insight Manager CQMGHOST service exhibits a memory leak in version
4.22.

RESOLUTION
==========

Upgrade to Compaq Insight Manager version 4.23 or later. At this time, 4.30 is
the current version.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the Compaq Insight Manager Host Agent.

To disable the Host Agent component, do the following:

1. In Control Panel, click Services, and then choose Insight Agents.

2. From the Active Agents list, click to highlight the Host Remote Alerter and
  the Host Information components, and then click Remove.

3. If you are pointed to "Restart the agents because they have been modified,"
  click Yes.

STATUS
======

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although this issue was observed with Microsoft SNA Server, other applications
may be affected as well.

This issue is caused by the CQMGHOST service leaking private bytes and handles in
Compaq Insight Agent, Host Agent version 4.22.

The steps to troubleshoot include the following:

1. Start Performance Monitor Log and let the log run for two to three days, long
  enough to capture a trend. For additional information, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q150934 How to Create a Performance Monitor Log for NT Troubleshooting

2. When the log has been saved, open Performance Monitor, choose Data From on
  the Options menu, and then select the created log.

3. Choose Edit , and then select Add to Chart.

4. Select the Process Object, all counters, and all instances except idle. The
  window will be quite cluttered; however, you can press the Backspace key and
  the active counter will be displayed in white.

5. Take note to see if one or more lines are trending upwards and never down, or
  down and never up.

6. Delete counters from the top of the list, moving down until you locate the
  counter(s) noted in step 5.

In this issue, CQMGHOST climbs rapidly and never goes down, amounting to a 3-MB
leak of memory per day.
