SUMMARY
=======

During the initial installation of Internet Information Server 4.0 (IIS) onto a
Microsoft Cluster Server, you normally begin installing IIS onto the first Node
of the Cluster. Then you completely install IIS onto the second Node of the
Cluster when prompted, and then you complete the installation of IIS back on the
first Node of the Cluster.

For additional information, please click the article number(s) below to view the
article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191138 How To Install the NTOP on Cluster Server

This technique works fine initially but is not the method one would want to use
if only one Node is lost in the cluster due to a disk failure or other failure
of a Node. If the cluster is working properly the functioning Node should have
taken ownership of the cluster and is continuing to service your system needs
while the non-functioning Node is down.

This article contains a list of steps that can be followed to reinstall Windows
NT Option Pack onto a non-functioning Node once it has been repaired. This will
preserve your existing build of IIS on the functioning Node so that you can use
it as a template to reconfigure the Web and FTP information on the
non-functioning Node.

There is an alternative reason why you might need to install IIS 4.0 onto a
single node in a Cluster. It is possible to corrupt IIS on one node of a cluster
without corrupting IIS on the other node of the cluster. If you feel that it is
necessary to install IIS 4.0 onto a single node in a cluster because of
corruption of IIS on that node, then some critical steps which are different
than a full rebuild must be performed on that node prior to you reinstalling IIS
back onto the node.

Both a full rebuild and an uninstall and reinstall of IIS are covered in this
document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is important that you follow these instructions exactly with regard to
installing IIS 4.0 back onto the single Node of the cluster. Failure to do so
could result in problems with IIS cluster resources being corrupted, which would
require a rebuild of IIS 4.0 on both Nodes of the Cluster. This problem will not
occur as long as you follow the steps exactly as written.

Installing IIS onto a Newly Rebuilt Cluster Node:

The proceeding steps assume that you had to rebuild one of the Nodes of your
cluster, due to a catastrophic failure of the Node. Since that failure you have
repaired the problem, reinstalled Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition onto the
system, applied the same Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack currently installed on the
functioning node and have rejoined the rebuilt Node back into the original
Cluster that it belonged to. If this is indeed the case then you can proceed to
the "Steps to Reinstall IIS 4.0 onto a Single Node of a Cluster" section and
begin installing IIS 4.0 back onto the new Node.

Removing and Reinstalling a Corrupted version of IIS on a Single Cluster Node:

To reinstall IIS 4.0 onto a single node in a cluster it is necessary to uninstall
it first. Use the following steps to uninstall IIS4 from the cluster node.

1. Stop the Cluster Server Service on the Node that you want to uninstall IIS4.
  This can be done by stopping the Cluster Server Service from the Services
  Applet in Control Panel. After you Stop the Cluster Server Service, set the
  Startup Type for the Cluster Server Service to manual.

  IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT YOU DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL YOU ARE CERTAIN THAT THE
  CLUSTER SERVICE IS STOPPED ON THE CLUSTER NODE YOU INTEND ON UNINSTALLING IIS
  4.0 FROM.

2. From the Control Panel Add/Remove Programs Applet chose Windows NT 4.0 Option
  Pack and then click Add/Remove. In the Windows NT Option Pack Setup Program
  Window choose Remove All. Because the IIS build is corrupted you may see some
  errors pointed out during the uninstall process. These errors can be ignored.

3. After IIS has been removed you should restart the Cluster Node. If Service
  Pack 4 or greater is on the Node, then you should re-apply the Service Pack
  before proceeding.

After you have uninstalled IIS 4.0 from the single cluster node you can follow
the steps below to reinstall IIS 4.0 back onto the single node and re-cluster
IIS.

Steps to Reinstall IIS 4.0 onto a Single Node of a Cluster:

1. Make certain that the Cluster Server Service is STOPPED and set to Manual
  Startup before you proceed. You can stop the Cluster Server Service through
  the Services Applet in Control panel. You should also set the Startup Type
  for the Cluster Server Service to Manual.

2. Run the Windows NT Option Pack Setup.

3. It is important that during the setup of the Windows NT Option Pack you
  choose the exact same installation method, Minimal, Typical or Custom that
  was used during the original installation of IIS onto the Cluster Server. For
  example, if you did a Custom install of IIS on the Cluster originally and
  unchecked Index Server and SMTP, then you want to also perform a Custom
  Install of IIS on the single Node choosing to uncheck the Index Server and
  SMTP.

4. Once the installation of the Windows NT Option Pack is completed you should
  restart the node you just installed onto.

5. If you have Windows NT Service Pack 4 or greater on the system then you
  should reapply that Service Pack at this time and restart the Node again.

6. You can now re-enable clustering on this Node. In the Services Applet in
  Control Panel chose the Cluster Server Service and click Start. Then change
  the Startup Type back to automatic.

This completes the re-installation of IIS 4.0 back onto the single node of the
cluster server. Perform the remaining steps to re-cluster the node you just
installed and resynchronize the IIS 4.0 settings on this node with the settings
currently running on the good node.

Reclustering IIS 4.0:

This section discusses the method used to recluster IIS 4.0 after performing a
standalone installation of IIS 4.0 onto a single node of a Microsoft Cluster
Server. When you discuss reclustering IIS what you are referring to is
reclustering the MSDTC Service and re-synchronizing the metabase settings
between the two nodes. If you had to completely rebuild the cluster node, then
when you installed IIS onto the node with the Cluster Service stopped, the MSDTC
service was installed as a standalone version and both nodes will need to have
the MSDTC service re-configured. Because of this, you will have to remove the
MSDTC service and reinstall it in a clustered configuration on both Nodes. This
is a fairly simple process.

If you have uninstalled IIS 4.0 from a single node and then reinstalled IIS 4.0
back onto that node, then you may be able to skip this section. Normally, an
uninstall of IIS will not remove the MSDTC components on the Node. To test this
you should move the resource group that contains the MSDTC resource over to the
second node and make sure that the MSDTC resource comes online. Before you
attempt to move your IIS and MSDTC resources, make sure you configure each of
the IIS Server Instances and the MSDTC resource to NOT "AFFECT THE GROUP". To do
this in the Cluster Administrator, right-click on the Resource and choose
properties. Click on the Advanced Tab and take the check mark out of the box to
the left of the "Affect the Group" item. Do this for each IIS Server Instance
and the MSDTC resource. Do not expect any WEB or FTP Instances to come online
yet because we have not synchronized the metabase settings between the two
nodes. If the MSDTC resource does come online on the second Node, then you can
move the resource group back over to the node it came from and skip down to the
section on "Configuring IIS after Installation". If the MSDTC resource does not
come online then look for the appropriate installation instructions later to
uninstall and reinstall MSDTC onto the cluster.

Reinstalling MSDTC onto the Cluster Server:

There are two techniques that can be used to install MSDTC onto a cluster, the
manual way and by running dtcsetup.exe. If you're running a Windows NT Service
Pack 3 and do not have SQL 7.0 or SQL 6.5 with Service Pack 5a on the Cluster,
then you will need to follow the manual installation instructions. Otherwise you
can use the Dtcsetup.exe method.

a. Installing Clustered MSDTC using Dtcsetup:

  The first step in running Dtcsetup is to obtain the appropriate Dtcsetup file
  for the version of MSDTC already installed on the cluster. Use the following
  guide to determine which Dtcsetup you need and the method used to obtain the
  appropriate version of the file.

  If you have Windows NT Service Pack 4, SQL 6.5 with SQL Service Pack 5a or SQL
  7.0 installed on the cluster then you can download Dtcsetup.exe from:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/distapps/mts/public-fixes/usa/dtc/svcpack

  Both Alpha and Intel versions of the Dtcsetup.exe can be found here.

  If you have Windows NT Service Pack 5 installed on the Cluster Servers then
  you will need to Contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain Dtcsetup.exe.
  Request the hotfix appropriate for your platform from Knowledge Base Article
  Q234673.

  (THIS VERSION OF DTCSETUP.EXE SHOULD ONLY BE INSTALLED
  ON SYSTEMS RUNNING WINDOWS NT 4.0 SERVICE PACK 5)

  For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
  phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
  address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

  Once you have obtained the Dtcsetup.exe appropriate for the version that is
  currently installed on the Cluster Server, you can follow the following steps
  to reinstall a clustered version of MSDTC back onto both nodes of the
  cluster.

  1. Create an empty temporary directory on both nodes of the cluster.

  2. Place the Dtcsetup.exe file in the temporary directory on both nodes of
     the cluster.

  3. Use the MSCS Cluster Administrator to stop the Microsoft DTC cluster
     resource, if it is running. Stop all services that depend on Microsoft
     DTC.

     (including Internet Information Server, Microsoft Transaction Server,
     Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Message Queue, and Microsoft COMTI).

  4. Close Windows NT Control Panel on all systems in the cluster.

  5. Run Dtcsetup.exe on the node that owns the Microsoft DTC cluster resource.
     When you are prompted to install Microsoft DTC on the other nodes in the
     cluster, run Dtcsetup.exe on that node.

  6. Confirm that the MSDTC resource can be brought online in the Cluster
     Administrator and can also be brought online on the second node.

  7. Restart all services that depend on Microsoft DTC.

  Once you have MSDTC properly functioning on both nodes of the cluster you can
  proceed to the section "Configuring IIS after Installation".

b. How to install MSDTC on a Cluster using the Manual Method:

  1. If there is an MSDTC resource in any of the Cluster Server Resource
     Groups, please delete this resource from the group that it is in. It can
     be in only one resource group if it is installed. If there is no MSDTC
     resource in any resource groups, this is OK.

  2. Close the Cluster Administrator on both nodes.

  3. From a command prompt on the working node, type the following:

     " msdtc -remove " (without the quotation marks)

  4. From a command prompt on the node you are reinstalling, type the
     following:

     " msdtc -remove " (without the quotation marks)

  5. From a command prompt on the working node, type the following:

     " msdtc -install -d %windir%\system32 -l &lt;location of DTC log file on
     cluster shared disk&gt; -v &lt;Resource Group Virtual Server Name&gt; "
     (without the quotation marks)NOTE: Make sure that the directory you
     specify for the DTC log file exists on the shared disk. For example, if
     you entered S:\MSDTCLog for the -l variable, check to be sure an MSDTCLog
     directory exists on the root of the S drive. If it does not exist, create
     the directory before running the earlier command. The &lt;Resource Group
     Virtual Server Name&gt; refers to the value you set for the Network Name
     Resource in the Cluster Resource group you want to install the MSDTC
     resource into. For example, if you have a resource group and the network
     name resource has a setting of SQLVServer, you would type:

     " msdtc - install -d %windir%\system32 -l S:\MSDTCLog -v SQLVServer "
     (without the quotation marks)

  6. From a command prompt on the node you re-installed, type the following: "
     msdtc -join " (without the quotation marks)

  7. Before you attempt to bring the MSDTC resources online, set the MSDTC
     resource to NOT "AFFECT THE GROUP". To do this, Open the Cluster
     Administrator, right-click on the Resource and choose properties. Click on
     the Advanced tab and take the unselect the box to the left of the "Affect
     the Group" item.

  8. In the Cluster Administrator, bring the MSDTC resource online. Then move
     the MSDTC resource to the other node to make sure it comes online there as
     well. Move the MSDTC resource back to the first node.

  9. If the MSDTC resource does not come online, check the event viewer on both
     nodes for errors.

  Once you have MSDTC properly functioning on both nodes of the cluster you can
  proceed to the "Configuring IIS after Installation".

Configuring IIS after Installation:

It is necessary to set certain IIS parameters when installing IIS onto a cluster.
This section addresses each of those parameters. Perform each item in the list
to ensure that you're IIS installation on this node in the cluster is properly
configured to handle fail-over of you're Web instances.

- Make sure that the primary copy of IIS is properly configured for MTS
  Replication. Perform the following steps on the active cluster server node.

  1. Open the Internet Service Manager.

  2. Double-click on Microsoft Transaction Server.

  3. Double-click on the Computers Folder.

  4. Right-click on My Computer.

  5. Choose Properties.

  6. Click on the Options tab.

  7. In the Replication Share box, place the administrative share where the
     \Program Files\MTS directory resides on the target server. For example: If
     Transaction Server was installed to the C:\Program Files\MTS directory
     then you would put C$ in the Replication Share box on the Options Page. In
     the Remote Server Name box, place the NetBIOS name of the other node in
     the cluster. (For example, On Node1, put the name of Node2. On Node2, put
     the name of Node1).

- Once you are certain that MTS Replication is properly configured on the
  Primary working cluster server node then you can open a command prompt on
  this same Primary working cluster server node. Be certain to use cmd and not
  command to open the command prompt with. Change directory to
  \winnt\system32\inetsrv.
  Then type the following command:

  " IISSYNC &lt;Netbios Name of the cluster node you just rebuilt&gt; " (without
  the quotation marks) IISSYNC will replicate the IIS and MTS settings from the
  currently running good copy of IIS to the new installation of IIS you just
  installed.

  DO NOT RUN IISSYNC FROM THE NEW INSTALLATION OF IIS YOU JUST INSTALLED. MAKE
  CERTAIN THAT IISSYNC IS ONLY RUN FROM THE WORKING IIS NODE IN THE CLUSTER.

  After IISSYNC completes, it should quit with a status code of zero. If you do
  not get a status code of zero, then you did not get a successful replication
  of your IIS and MTS settings. Refer to the following article for common
  IISSYNC status codes to correct the problem and run IISSYNC again.

  Q224801 Deciphering IISSYNC Status Codes

- After IISSYNC has replicated the IIS and MTS information, you should check
  the following items to make sure that permissions for the IUSR and IWAM
  accounts are properly configured on the new installation. When you first
  installed IIS onto the cluster you should have created a Domain account
  called IUSR_CLUSTER and IWAM_CLUSTER (you may have chosen different names).
  These accounts should be used instead of the default local accounts
  IUSR_&lt;MACHINE NAME&gt; and IWAM_&lt;MACHINE NAME&gt; that get created
  during an IIS install. The following steps will assist in confirming these
  Domain Cluster accounts are properly configured on the newly installed IIS
  cluster node.

  a. Perform these steps on the node you just re-installed IIS.

  b. In User Manager go to Policies / User Rights, select the "Log On Locally"
     and "Access this computer from network" Policy and make sure that the
     Domain IUSR and IWAM accounts are there. If they are not, add them.

  c. Check that both the IWAM and IUSR Cluster Domain accounts are in the
     Guests Local Group. If they are not, add them.

  d. Check that the IWAM Cluster Domain account is in the MTS Trusted
     Impersonators (or it may be named MTS Impersonators) Local Group on the
     Node. If it is not, add it.

  e. Check that both the IWAM and IUSR Cluster Domain accounts are in the Dcom
     Default Access group with Allow Access Permission and the Dcom Default
     Launch Group with Allow Launch Permission. If they are not, add them. To
     check Dcom settings launch the Dcom Configuration Window by clicking on
     Start / Run and type dcomcnfg. When the Distributed COM Configuration
     Properties window opens click on the Default Security tab. To confirm
     settings, click on the Edit Default button in the Default Access
     Permissions and the Default Launch Permissions area of the window.

At this point your installation of IIS onto the single node in the cluster is
complete. You should finish up by scheduling a time, off hours, in which you can
move over all IIS Server Instances in the cluster from the current active node
to the backup node. Test all your Web sites to confirm they are working properly
and then you can move your IIS Server Instances to which ever node you wish to
use as the primary node. After you have tested your system then you should
re-enable the "Affect the Group" settings you disabled earlier so that if a
failure occurs your groups will be moved to the backup node.
