-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) or Collaboration Data
Objects (CDO) application may return an error of MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY (which
is defined as E_OUTOFMEMORY = 0x8007000E) when attempting to perform MAPI or CDO
operations against a particular message.

The user may see an error message similar to the following:

  There is not enough memory available to perform the operation. [Microsoft
  Exchange Server Information Store - [E_OUTOFMEMORY(8007000E)]]

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server information store can return a remote procedure call (RPC)
response to the client's RPC request indicating that the buffer size required
for the RPC data is greater than the maximum allowable buffer size (32 KB). The
client handles this request to set up an "illegal" buffer size as a memory
error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under certain boundary conditions, the Exchange Server information store can
return an RPC response to the client's RPC request, which informs the client
that the buffer the client had originally set up for the request is of
insufficient size. The server's RPC response indicates this with the
"ropBufferTooSmall" string; it also indicates how large the buffer needs to be.
This, in itself, is not a issue for the client, as the client typically sets up
an appropriately sized buffer for the response and makes the request again. This
typically succeeds.

The issue occurs when the information store fails to properly account for all
buffers overhead when it calculates the actual buffer size that is required.
Thus, the information store indicates in the response that the buffer required
is larger that the maximum RPC buffer size allowed. When this is the case, MAPI
or CDO applications can report "insufficient memory" type of errors.
