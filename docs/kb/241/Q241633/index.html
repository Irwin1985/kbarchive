SYMPTOMS
========

While the Windows 2000 Setup program processes a Migration Dynamic-Link Library
(DLL) during GUI-mode setup, the following error occurs unexpectedly:

  Error: Setup cannot process the [Product Name] upgrade pack from [Company
  Name].

CAUSE
=====

Any fatal errors in the Migration DLL cause this message.

A less obvious cause is a time out. On the Windows 2000 side of setup, each
Migration DLL has 60 seconds to process. If processing takes longer than 60
seconds, Setup will unload the DLL and report that an error has occurred. This
is especially undesirable when debugging, because stepping through the code
almost always takes longer than the time-out period.

RESOLUTION
==========

When debugging a Migration DLL, the time out can be avoided by starting Windows
2000 Setup from the command line, as follows:

  winnt32.exe /#u:testdlls

In addition to eliminating the time out, the /#u:testdlls parameter causes the
Migration DLL to load into the Windows 2000 Setup program's process space. Both
of these features are necessary for successful debugging of the Migration DLL on
the Windows 2000 side of setup.

Note that the /#u:testdlls parameter should only be used for debugging. A
Migration DLL should not take longer than one minute to process on the Windows
2000 side of setup. Efficiency is required, because multiple Migration DLLs may
need to be processed during the upgrade.

If it is necessary to perform tasks that take longer than one minute, consider
placing a patch that will do this work on the computer after the upgrade. Use
the [MOVED] section of the Migrate.inf file to indicate that your application's
executable is being renamed to the name of your patch. Setup will change all
shortcut links on the Start menu and Desktop that point to your application's
executable to now point to the patch. By using this method, when the user
launches your application after upgrading, they will be presented with a utility
that will update the application for Windows 2000.

An alternative is to have the stub executable initiate an uninstall of the
product if it is not possible to update it for Windows 2000.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
