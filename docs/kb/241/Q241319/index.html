-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Index Server versions 1.1, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you do a query, you notice that some files do not show up in the results
page, and when you look at the catalog's statistics you may notice that the
value in the "Docs to Filter" column is not zero, and never reaches zero.

CAUSE
=====

There are three reasons that the "Docs to Filter" column would not reach zero or
that certain files would not be indexed:

- There are so many changes occurring on the site that Index Server is
  constantly trying to catch up.
- You are running an anti-virus package on the server, and it is holding open
  files and preventing them from being indexed.
- The System account doesn't have at least Read permission to the files.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no workaround for this issue. When a file is added to the Web site,
both the Index Server and the anti-virus software attempt to access the Web site
in order to complete their tasks. The Index Server will see that the anti-virus
is there, and will back off the indexing process, unless the anti-virus releases
the file correctly after scanning the file, it may not get indexed.

- Monitor the server during a more quiet time to determine whether or not Index
  Server catches up, and the "Docs to Filter" column goes to zero.
- Disable the anti-virus package to determine whether it is effecting the
  indexing process. Some anti-virus packages may require uninstallation before
  Index Server will begin to work correctly.
- Add the System account specifically to the access control list on the data
  files. Do not count on the Everyone group containing the System, to make sure
  to add the System specifically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To check the statistics of the catalog and view the "Docs to Filter" column in
Index Server 2.0 simply open the Microsoft Management Console that contains the
Index Server snap-in. If you select Index Server on Local Machine (or the
computer name you are connecting to) you will see in the right-pane of the MMC a
series of columns one of which is "Docs to Filter".
