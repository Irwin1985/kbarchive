The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0, used with:
   - Microsoft Cluster Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS), under certain circumstances (for
example, both nodes experience a simultaneous power failure after a relatively
long period of cluster activity), one of the following may occur:

- The cluster database file (located in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder) may
  become corrupted on both nodes (for example, the Clusdb file contains zero
  bytes on both nodes).

- The &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp file may be
  inconsistent and, if used by MSCS, may result in Clusdb corruption.

- The &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp file may be
  outdated as a checkpoint file may not have been written during the interval
  when the two nodes were up. If the computer's configuration is changed and a
  recent checkpoint file reflecting this change does not exist, the log files
  (&lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\quolog.log and
  &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp) may contain
  inconsistent quorum resource information.

Symptoms you may experience include:

- MSCS cannot be started, and both nodes are able to access and use the Clusdb
  file, so the cluster cannot be formed.

- MSCS cannot be started with the initial Clusdb file allowed to locate the
  latest checkpoint file, but its contents are inconsistent. If MSCS loads this
  file the Clusdb file may become corrupted. If a retry to form the cluster
  from the other node is done, the second Clusdb file may become corrupt.


- MSCS can start, but the cluster starts in an outdated state (for example,
  during a week of operation no checkpoint was taken, then the next MSCS
  restart uses the last checkpoint file to restore the configuration, and this
  file may be outdated).


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To restart the MSCS Cluster under these special conditions:

1. When the %SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb file is corrupted on both nodes, restart
  from a valid checkpoint file.

2. When the latest checkpoint file is outdated or inconsistent, restart from a
  valid %SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb file.

NOTE: This article assumes that either the Clusdb file on at least one node is
valid, or the checkpoint file is valid. If both Clusdb files and the checkpoint
file are corrupted, start from the most recent backup of the Clusdb file or the
checkpoint file. As both Clusdb files and checkpoint files are system hives, you
can view the contents using Regedt32.exe with the LoadHive function. When the
Cluster Server is running, you can also view the current Clusdb file contents in
the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive using Regedt32.exe.

In a typical MSCS configuration, including disks on a shared bus:

1. Do not boot both nodes from the Windows NT disaster recovery %SystemRoot%
  folder where MSCS was not installed.

2. Never boot both nodes from an MSCS %SystemRoot% folder with both nodes having
  the Clusdisk.sys file startup in manual mode. This may result in the
  corruption of the NTFS structure of all the disks on the shared bus and may
  result in major data loss. As a general rule, perform all recovery procedures
  on the node which forms the cluster and when finished, start the other node
  to join the cluster.

When the cluster is formed:

1. If the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Quolog.log file exists and is valid, the
  cluster is formed from the latest Checkpoint File and the Quolog.log file.

2. If the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs files do not exist, the cluster is formed
  from the %SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb file of the current node.

To start the cluster from a checkpoint file, with Clusdb corruption on both
nodes, restore the corrupted Clusdb file from a valid checkpoint file. The
simplest solution is to boot one node (the other node being turned off) from a
Windows NT disaster recovery %SystemRoot% folder, and then copy the
&lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp file, or another
valid checkpoint file, to the &lt;cluster_systemroot&gt;\Cluster\Clusdb file,
and then restart the cluster. If a Windows NT disaster recovery %SystemRoot%
folder is not available, do the following:

1. Boot node A to form the cluster (with node B powered-off).

2. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Devices.

3. Click ClusDisk, click Startup, click to select Manual, click OK, and then
  click Close.

4. Double-click the Services tool, and then double-click ClusterService.

5. Click to select Manual, click OK, and then click Close.

6. Reboot node A (this starts Windows NT on node A, without loading the
  Clusdisk.sys file)

7. Copy the latest &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp
  file to %SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb.

8. Form the Cluster on node A:

  a. At a command prompt, type "net start clusdisk" (without the quotation
     marks), and then press ENTER.

  b. At a command prompt, type "net start clussvc" (without the quotation
     marks), and then press ENTER.

9. Restart node B to join the cluster, and replicate the Clusdb file from the
  sponsor node A.

10. On node A, after both nodes are running, click Start, point to Settings,
  click Control Panel, and then double-click Devices.

11. Click ClusDisk, click Startup, click to select System, click OK, and then
  click Close.

12. Double-click the Services tool, and then double-click ClusterService.

13. Click to select Automatic, click OK, and then click Close.

To start the cluster from the Clusdb file when the latest checkpoint file is
outdated, you need to rename (or save, and then delete) the
&lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs folder. The simplest solution is to boot one node
(the other node being turned off) from a Windows NT disaster recovery
%SystemRoot% folder and to rename (or save, and then delete) the
&lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs folder, and then form the cluster starting with the
node that has a valid Clusdb file.

NOTE: If a Windows NT disaster recovery %SystemRoot% folder is not available,
both copies of the Clusdb file are required as, during the first system boot,
the cluster server automatically replicates the outdated checkpoint file on the
first node's Clusdb. To do this:

1. Boot node A to form the cluster (node B is turned off).

2. At a command prompt, type "net stop clussvc" (without the quotation marks),
  and then type "cd %SystemRoot% cluster" (without the quotation marks).

3. At a command prompt, type "%SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clussvc -debug
  -noquorumlogging" (without the quotation marks). This allows you to rename or
  delete the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs folder.

4. Rename (or save, and then delete) the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs folder.

5. Shut down node A (do not boot node B before shutting down node A; otherwise,
  the Clusdb file from node A is replicated to node's B Clusdb).

6. Boot node B to form the cluster from node B's Clusdb, creating a new
  &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs folder.

7. Restart node A, join the cluster, and replicate the Clusdb file from the
  sponsor node B.



Cluster Server Startup Process
------------------------------

Cluster Database Management:

Each node participating in a cluster maintains a local copy of the cluster
database in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb file. When the cluster server starts
for the first time on a node, an updated copy of the cluster database is created
and maintained as a registry hive. Subsequent restarts of the cluster server use
and update the existing cluster hive.

On important events, the cluster server takes a snapshot of the cluster hive, in
a file located on the quorum resource. The checkpoint file is located in the
&lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp folder. Every time
a checkpoint is taken in Windows NT 4 Service Pack 5 and Windows 2000, a
checksum record is logged to the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Quolog.log file.
The following events trigger cluster hive checkpointing (Windows NT 4
Service3/Service Pack 4 and Windows 2000):

- When the first node forms the cluster (after the quorum resource comes
  online).

- When a node goes down.

- When the log file (&lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Quolog.log) reaches its size
  limit (default value is 64 KB).

- In Windows NT 4 Service Pack 5 and Windows 2000, a new registry value allows
  to trigger periodic checkpointing, based on a time interval specified as a
  REG_DWORD value:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Quorum\CheckpointInterval (default value is 4
  hours).

Cluster Log Management:

The Cluster Server uses quorum logging to record changes to the cluster database,
when the Global Update Manager cannot propagate database changes to all the
nodes. Quorum logging is:

- Turned on, every time a node goes down and a checkpoint is taken.

- Turned off, every time all cluster nodes are running.

- The Quolog.log file is located in the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs folder

The default behavior, when the cluster is formed, is to use:
- The latest &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp file to
  load the cluster database.

- The &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\quolog.log file to apply all the changes to
  the cluster database since the last checkpoint. This algorithm applies even
  if the node was down for period of time.

Cluster Server Startup:

The order of operations during the cluster server startup process is:

1. If the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive is not available, load the initial
  cluster database from the %SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb file to locate the
  nodes, networks and the quorum resource or use the existing
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive.

2. Try to join the cluster by looking for a sponsor using IP addresses and
  NetBIOS names.

3. If join is successful:

  a. Get the latest database from the sponsor, update the Clusdb file, and then
     reload the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive.

  b. Create and initiate owned groups and resources defined by the updated
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive and bring them online.

4. If the join is not successful, try to form a cluster by arbitrating for the
  quorum resource and, if successful, bring the cluster online.

5. If the &lt;quorum_device&gt;\Mscs\quolog.log file exists and is valid (no
  "tombstone" file present), locate the latest
  &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Chk&lt;sequential_number&gt;.tmp file and test
  for consistency using the checksum record from the Quolog.log file.

6. If the checkpoint file is valid, update the cluster database (Clusdb), roll
  up changes from the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Quolog.log file recorded
  since the latest checkpoint was taken.

7. Write a new checkpoint file and the associated checksum record in the
  Quolog.log file.

8. Create and initiate owned groups and resources defined by the updated
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive and bring them online.

9. If the &lt;quorom_device&gt;:\Mscs\Quolog.log file does not exist or the
  checkpoint file does not pass the consistency check:

  a. Use the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster or the current Clusdb file as the new
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive.

  b. Create the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Quolog.log file.

  c. Write a new checkpoint file and the associated checksum record in the
     Quolog.log file.

  d. Create and initiate owned groups and resources defined by the updated
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster hive and bring them online.

NOTE: The checkpoint file consistency verification, using the checksum mechanism
described, is supported in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5. No separate hotfix is
available for any version before Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5. Periodic
checkpointing is supported in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5. No separate hotfix
is available before Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.

If the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs\Quolog.log file exists and the latest
checkpoint file is valid, the cluster will be formed from the checkpoint file
and the Quolog.log file. If the &lt;quorum_device&gt;:\Mscs files do not exist,
or the latest checkpoint file is inconsistent, the cluster is formed from the
%SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb of the current node.
