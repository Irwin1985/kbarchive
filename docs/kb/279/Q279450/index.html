SUMMARY
=======

Some multi media file formats which can be downloaded from the Internet are not
supported by MSN Companion.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MSN Companion supports these file types:

- Windows Media. This includes MP3, Windows Media audio and video, and
  QuickTime 2.0 and 3.0.

- Java. Java is only supported on Compaq and eMachines devices. Java is not
  supported on Vestel devices.

  Note: MSN Companion supports JavaScript, which is different from Java.

The MSN Companion does not support these file types:

- RealAudio, RealVideo

- QuickTime 4.0 and above

- Downloaded ActiveX controls.

If you are having trouble downloading a file:
---------------------------------------------

- Verify that you're not trying to run one of the unsupported file types. In
  the case of Java, you will need to verify that your device supports Java (see
  above).

- If it was an audio or video file that didn't work, go to windowsmedia.com and
  try a similar file type and see if it works. If it works, there may be a
  problem with the particular Web site from which you were trying to download.

- If the files at windowsmedia.com do not work, record the location of the
  files and report the problem to Technical Support at (888) 386-6497.

- If the file is not an audio or video file type, is supported, and still
  doesn't work, write down the URL of the Web page where you are having the
  problem and the location of the file, and report it to Technical Support at
  (888) 386-6497.
