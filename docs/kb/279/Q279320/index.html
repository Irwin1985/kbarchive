-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Messages that are put in the Internet Mail Service Pickup folder for delivery
may be moved to the Pickup\Archive folder. These same messages may then be moved
back to the Pickup folder, and be delivered.

The Internet Mail Service generates the following Event log entry when this
occurs.

  Event ID 4164
  Source MSExchangeIMS

  Description:
  The file &lt;filename&gt; in the Pickup directory could not be parsed to get
  the originator and recipients due to error 0x80004005. It either contains no
  recipients, or it is not a valid 822 message. It will be moved to the Archive
  directory.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Service may not acquire the correct size of the file that it
is attempting to process. Therefore, the Internet Mail Service behaves as if
there is not enough data in the file to make delivery.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
