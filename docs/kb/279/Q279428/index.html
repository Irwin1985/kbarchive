-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000, used with:
   - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you delete a user mailbox from an Exchange Server computer, you cannot cancel
or modify meeting requests of which this user is the originator.

When you attempt to accept or decline the meeting that resides on your calendar,
you may receive a non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the following one:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject: Declined: Meeting Subject
  Sent: 2/13/2001 12:00 PM
  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

  /O=ORGANIZATION/OU=FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DeletedUser on
  2/13/2001 12:00 PM

  The e-mail account does not exist at the organization this message was sent
  to. Check the e-mail address, or contact the recipient directly to find out
  the correct address.

  &lt;server.domain.com #5.1.1&gt;

RESOLUTION
==========

Cancel the Meeting Request from the Originating User's Mailbox
--------------------------------------------------------------

Before deleting a user's mailbox from the Exchange Server computer, cancel all
pending meeting requests of which the user is the originator.

Change the Primary Microsoft Windows NT Account of the Mailbox:

1. In the Exchange Administrator program, open the property page of the mailbox
  that contains the meeting requests to be canceled.

2. From General/Primary Windows NT Account, click "Select an existing Windows NT
  account", click OK, and then add the Administrator account.

3. Close the mailbox property page.

Cancel the Meeting Requests:

1. In Outlook, open the calendar. On the View menu, point to Current View, and
  then click Active Appointments.

2. On the View menu, point to Current View, and then click Customize Current
  View.

3. In View Summary, click Filter.

4. On the Advanced tab, under "Define more criteria", click Field.

5. Point to All Appointment Fields, and then click Meeting Status.

6. Under Condition, click to select the equals check box.

7. Under Value, click to select the Meeting Organizer check box.

8. Click "Add to List", and then click OK twice.

9. All meeting requests of which the user was the meeting organizer are now
  displayed in the Active Appointments view. Open each meeting request, click
  Action, and then click Cancel Meeting.

Manually Remove the Meeting Request From Invitee Calendars
----------------------------------------------------------

If you have already deleted the originating user's mailbox from the Exchange
Server computer, you must manually remove any meeting requests that were
generated by that user from the calendar of each invitee.

1. In Outlook, open the calendar. On the View menu, point to Current View, and
  then click Active Appointments.

2. On the View menu, point to Current View, and then click Customize Current
  View.

3. In View Summary, click Fields.

4. Under "Select available fields from", click to select the "All Appointment
  fields" check box.

5. Under "Available fields", click to select the Organizer check box. Click Add,
  and then click OK twice.

6. Click the Organizer column header to sort the view.

7. In the sorted view, locate all meeting requests where the organizer is the
  individual that no longer has a mailbox on the Exchange Server computer, and
  then delete those items from the calendar.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
