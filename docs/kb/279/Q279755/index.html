SUMMARY
=======

When a Visual Basic program runs a statement such as 1.26 - 1.25, the answer is
not 0.01, but 0.00999999 because of the complex way in which numbers are
represented in a computer. This article describes how Visual Basic handles
arithmetic precision.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When people count, they use the decimal numbering system, or base 10. Computers
count by using the binary numbering system, or base 2. The binary system is
perfect for a computer because it uses thousands of tiny electrical switches to
store information internally. Each switch can have two states; a high electrical
voltage or a low electrical voltage: essentially, on/off, or one/zero. Each
switch is called a bit. By stringing these bits together, people can store
numbers that are represented by a binary numbering system. Because the computer
is always counting in binary and people are always counting in decimal, the
computer is always converting from one numbering system to the other. A few
simple decimal to binary number conversions are:

  1 Decimal = 1 Binary
  2 Decimal = 10 Binary
  3 Decimal = 11 Binary
  4 Decimal = 100 Binary
  10 Decimal = 1010 Binary

So far, computer switches have only been representing the simplest of numbers
like 1, 2, 3, and so forth. These numbers are often called "natural numbers" or
"whole numbers." When you add, subtract, or multiply a whole number, the answer
is a whole number. However, if you divide two whole numbers, you do not always
get a whole number; you can get a fraction, also known as a "floating-point
number." Sometimes these fractions do strange things. For example: 2317/990 =
2.34040404040.... with the 40 repeating over and over. These positive and
negative integers and fractions, and the number 0, comprise the "rational
number" system. A more formal definition would be: A rational number is any
number that can be written as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are
both integers.

Because there is no fractional part to an integer, its binary representation is
much simpler than it is for a floating-point value. Every base 10 integer can be
exactly converted to a base 2 integer. All that the computer needs is enough
bits. However, this is not true for fractional numbers. For example, the base 10
fraction 1/100 can be represented as the decimal number 0.01. However, when the
same number is converted to binary, it becomes a repeating binary number. The
reason that 1/100 cannot be represented exactly in base 2 is similar to the way
that 1/3 cannot be represented exactly in base 10; only fractional base 10
numbers that can be represented in the form p/q, where q is an integer power of
2, can be expressed exactly with a finite number of ones (1) and zeros (0).

To add to the issue, a computer has a finite amount of space available to hold a
binary number. Computers frequently use a set of eight switches to represent a
number, called a byte. If all eight of these switches in one byte are on or set
to one (11111111), the binary number converts to a decimal number of 255. So 255
would be the largest number a byte could hold. The number 256 requires another
switch, or nine bits. A Visual Basic integer is two bytes long. That is 16 bits
or 16 ones and zeros to represent a binary number. A single in Visual Basic is
four bytes long.

How Computers Represent Fractions

There is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE)
standard that dictates the computer representation of fractions, also known as
floating-point values. The standard uses 32 bits that are numbered 0 to 31 from
left to right. The first bit is the sign bit to represent positive or negative
numbers. The next eight bits represent the exponent, and the remaining 23 bits
are the fraction. Therefore, not only does a floating-point value have a finite
numerical value that it can hold, it has a limit to the accuracy of a number
that it can hold. Taking the example of 0.01, this number cannot be represented
in a finite amount of space. Therefore, this number is rounded down by
approximately -2.78E-17 when it is stored in Visual Basic as a single data
type.

When the mathematical operation 1.26 - 1.25 is performed, Visual Basic actually
returns 0.009999 instead of 0.01. The value of 0.01 cannot be represented as a
non-repeating binary decimal. Microsoft recommends that you always use format
statement when numbers are displayed to avoid the confusion of 9.99999E-03
rather than 0.01. Also, if accuracy is important to your calculation, use the
Decimal data type. A Double gives you more precision but does not completely
resolve the problem.

A simple test to run in Visual Basic is a For loop as follows:

  Dim i As Integer
  Dim Sum As Single

  For i = 0 To 100
    Sum = Sum + 0.01
  Next i
  Text1.Text = Sum

The sum is equal to 1.01, but the Text1.Text displays 1.009999.

For the same reason, you should always be very cautious when you make comparisons
on numbers. The following example illustrates a common programming error:

  Dim i As Integer
  Dim x As Single
  Dim y As Single

  For i = 0 To 1000
    x = x + 0.01
  Next i
  y = 10.082 - 0.072

  If (x = y) Then Text3.Text = "Equal!"
  Text4.Text = x
  Text5.Text = y

This code does not display "Equal!" in the Textbox, because 10.01 cannot be
represented exactly in binary, which causes the value that results from the
assignment to be slightly different in binary than the value that is generated
from the arithmetic expression. In practice, you should always code such
comparisons in such a way as to allow for some tolerance, such as:

  Dim i As Integer
  Dim x As Single
  Dim y As Single

  For i = 0 To 1000
    x = x + 0.01
  Next i
  y = 10.082 - 0.072

  If ((x - y) &lt; 0.01 And (x - y) &gt; -0.01) Then
    Text3.Text = "Equal!"
  End If
  Text4.Text = x
  Text5.Text = y

In addition, you need to be aware that in long mathematical expressions, Visual
Basic stores intermediate values. For example, in the calculation CInt(4.555 *
100), the value 455.5 is temporarily stored and used in the CInt() function. If
you break the calculation into the two steps, x = 4.555 * 100 and CInt(x), you
avoid this internal storage and thus avoid the floating-point rounding error.

Following are other common floating-point errors:

- Round-off error - This error results when all of the bits in a binary number
  cannot be used in a calculation.

- Overflow and underflow - This error occurs when the result is too large or
  too small to be represented by the data type.

- Division by a very small number - This can trigger a "divide by zero" error
  or can produce bad results.

NOTE: This is not specifically a Visual Basic problem. You have the same problem
with C, FORTRAN, or any other language that stores floating-point numbers
according to IEEE standards.
