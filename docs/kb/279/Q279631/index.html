SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the SPCheck tool to determine the service pack
level of installed components on a file-by-file basis.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Description
-----------

You can use the SPCheck to determine the service pack level of installed
components on computers that are running either Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows
2000 Server. The SPCheck tool generates a report that lists the origin of each
file for each installed component.

SPCheck reports on the current service pack level of the following components.

Windows NT 4.0-Based Computers:

- DHCP Server

- DNS

- Remote Access Service (RAS)

- Routing and Remote Access service

- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

- WINS

- Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

- NWLink (IPX/SPX)

- Exchange Server 5.5

Windows 2000-Based Computers:

- DHCP Server

- DNS

- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

- WINS

- Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

- NWLink (IPX/SPX)

- Exchange Server 5.5

SPCheck examines each component one file at a time. Because of this, SPCheck must
run under a security context that is equivalent to the local administrator
account. If SPCheck is not run in this security context, files may be reported
as missing, even though they are installed on the computer. SPCheck searches for
files by using the "PATH" environmental variable. If files are reported as
missing (although they can be found on the target computer), ensure that the
folder or folders which the component is installed in are included in the PATH
environmental variable.

How to Install the SPCheck Tool
-------------------------------

To install SPCheck, view one of the following sections, depending on your
operating system.

Windows XP:

Extract the Xpspchk.exe file to a folder on your hard disk, and then follow the
installation instructions that are listed in the Readme.txt file.

Windows 2000:

Extract the contents of the W2kspchk.exe file to a folder on your hard disk, and
then run Spcheck.exe.

Windows NT:

Extract the contents of the Nt4spchk.exe file to a folder on your hard disk, and
then run Spcheck.exe.

Exchange Server 5.5:

Extract the contents of the Exch55spchk.exe file to a folder on your hard disk,
and then run Spcheck.exe.

How to Use the SPCheck Tool
---------------------------

SPCheck requires the following three files to work correctly:

- Spcheck.exe

- Dbghelp.dll

- Spcheck.ini

Copy these three files into any folder on the target server. By default, the
Dbghelp.dll file is included with Windows 2000, so you do not need to copy the
file to the target computer.

You can use the following switches with SPCheck:

- Use the /i switch to specify the name of the .ini file that is used. If this
  switch is not specified, Spcheck.ini is the default .ini file that is used.

- Use the /r switch to specify the name of the report file that is generated
  when the tool is run. If this switch is not specified, the default report
  name "Spcheck.rpt" is used.

By default, the report is created in the same folder that Spcheck was run from,
and the report has the following format, where Missing indicates that the file
was not found on the target computer, and Unknown indicates that the file was
found on the target computer, but did not match any of the files that were
recorded in the .ini file:

  [WINS]
  C:\WINNT\System32\Jet500.dll SP0-3
  C:\WINNT\System32\Jet.dll SP0-6a
  C:\WINNT\System32\Wins.exe Missing
  C:\WINNT\System32\Winsadmin.exe Unknown
  C:\WINNT\System3232\Winsctrl.dll SP5

Some files are identical in more than one service pack. For example, "SP0-3"
indicates that the file was not changed in any of the first three service packs.
As long as the service pack that should be installed on the computer is included
in the range that is reported for a file, the file can be considered consistent
with that particular service pack. Consider the following example report:

  [RAS]
  C:\WINNT\System32\Rascfg.dll SP0-6a
  C:\WINNT\System32\Rasfil32.dll Q189594
  C:\WINNT\System32\Rasadmin.exe SP0-6a
  C:\WINNT\System32\Rassapi.dll SP0-1
  C:\WINNT\System32\Rasphone.exe SP0-2

If the target computer was supposed to have Service Pack 1 (SP1) installed on it,
this report shows that SP1 is within the ranges that were specified for each
file. Because of this, the target computer contains RAS-related files that are
consistent with the service pack that is installed. SPCheck may also report a Q
article number instead of a service pack number. This indicates that a hot fix
has been installed. Query the Q article number in TechNet for details about the
particular hot fix that was installed. Note that SPCheck only detects a very
small number of hot fixes. Because of this, hot fixed files may be reported as
unknown files.
