-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- MSN Companion, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

MSN Companion has several secret codes that give access to special
troubleshooting information on the device, or that perform special
troubleshooting actions.

The MURMUR code removes all of the current user information and resets the device
so that the customer can enter in a new Member ID.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When should I use the MURMUR code?
----------------------------------

MURMUR should only be used in very specific circumstances:

- Clearing the Member ID from the MSN Companion in order to use a different
  Member ID.
   - Example: you were given a device that had already been set up and used by
     someone else. You need to reset the device, deleting all of the previous
     user's information before you can enter in your Member ID.

   - Example: For some reason you need to create a new account, giving you a
     new Member ID. In order to switch the MSN Companion to this new Member ID,
     you will need to use MURMUR to reset the device and run through its setup
     screens again.

- Re-running the initial setup screens.


When should I not use the MURMUR code?
--------------------------------------

- Do not use MURMUR as a catch-all remedy to fix problems that can't easily be
  diagnosed. This is strongly discouraged. Since MURMUR resets all of the
  device's settings, it will remove your current user information and will
  delete all of your Favorites.

- MURMUR should especially never be used for the following. There are much
  easier ways to fix these:
   - Resetting or changing passwords. (See Q272491 - How to change passwords
     with MSN Companion)

   - Resetting or changing dialing settings. (See Q274364 - MSN Companion
     Troubleshooting Tool HAMMER)

   - Any other problem that doesn't involve switching to a new Member ID. (See
     Q272545 - Contacting Member Support for MSN Companion)

How do I enter the MURMUR code?
-------------------------------

1. Turn on the MSN Companion and immediately click do not connect.

2. On the main troubleshooting page click I have some other problem that isn't
  described above.

3. In the text entry box type murmur and click Go.

4. The MSN Companion will now delete all current user information and will
  restart, returning to the initial setup screens.
