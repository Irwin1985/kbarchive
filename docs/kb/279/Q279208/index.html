  Troubleshoot Joystick Problems (Part 2)

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot joystick issues in the games listed at the beginning of this
article, use the following methods in the order in which they are presented.
After you finish each method, test to determine if the issue is resolved. If the
issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

NOTE: If you use a Logitech Warrior joystick, connect it to the game port in your
computer. Do not connect the Logitech Warrior joystick to the serial port in
your computer. The Logitech Warrior does not function properly with Microsoft
DirectX 5.0 or later when it is connected to a serial port.

Verify That Your Operating System Supports Your Game Controller
---------------------------------------------------------------

To enable support for the game port in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, you must install
Service Pack 3 (SP3) or later. Windows NT 4.0 with SP3 or later supports most
analog game controllers. However, it does not support digital game controllers.

The Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Millennium
Edition (Me), and Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems support both analog
and digital game controllers. For best performance, verify that the latest
version of the game controller driver for your game controller is installed on
your computer.

The following table lists operating system compatibility for all SideWinder game
controllers:

* Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or later only supports the SideWinder 3DPro
joystick in analog mode.

** You can install and run version 4.0 of the SideWinder software on a Windows
2000-based computer. However, all features may not function as expected, and the
SideWinder software may not function properly. To install the SideWinder
software on Windows 2000, you must log on as an administrator.

*** To use a hybrid game port/Universal Serial Bus (USB) game controller with a
Windows 95-based computer, you must connect the game controller to the game port
in your computer. Windows 95 does not support USB.

NOTE: Unless otherwise indicated in the preceding table, support for all current
USB/game port and USB-only SideWinder game controllers is included in Windows
98, Windows Me, and Windows 2000.

Check the Game Controller Connection to the Computer
----------------------------------------------------

If you use a game port game controller, verify that the game controller is
connected directly to the game port in your computer. Daisy-chained game
controllers or game port adapters can interfere with communication between the
game port and the game controller.

If you use a USB game controller, verify that the game controller is connected
properly to the USB port in your computer or to a compatible USB hub that is
connected to the USB port in your computer, and disconnect all game controllers
from your computer except the game controller that you want to use to play the
game.

NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 does not support daisy-chained game controllers, game port
adapters, or USB game controllers.

Disable the SideWinder Game Device Profiler
-------------------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder game controller, disable the SideWinder Game Device
Profiler or SideWinder Game Controller software. To do this, right-click the
Game Device Profiler icon or the Game Controller Software icon in the status

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, and then click OK.

4. Close Control Panel.

To use version 3.x or 4.0 of the Microsoft SideWinder Game Controller software to
test the calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the General tab, click the game controller you want to test in the Game
  Controllers box, and then click Properties.

4. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

6. Close Control Panel.

If you use an analog game controller, or if you use a Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro
or a Microsoft SideWinder game pad with version 1.5 of the SideWinder Game
Device software, you may need to calibrate the game controller manually. To do
this:

  the game controller.

  If you use a SideWinder 3D Pro with version 1.0 of the SideWinder software,
  when you are prompted to press a button on the controller, make sure that you
  press a button on the joystick instead of the joystick base.

  NOTE: Because of differences between analog game controllers, you may notice a
  certain amount of deviation between the graphic display for the joystick
  position and the actual joystick movement. This is normal and does not affect
  the calibration of the game controller.

5. When you receive the "You have successfully calibrated your device" message,
  click Finish.

6. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your game controller, and then
  click OK.

7. Close Control Panel.

NOTE: No calibration option is available in version 1.5 of the SideWinder Game
Device software unless you install Combat Flight Simulator with DirectX 6.0.

If you cannot calibrate your game controller, or if your game controller does not
function properly when you test it, Microsoft Windows may be unable to
communicate properly with the game controller. If this is true, contact the
manufacturer of your game controller for information about how to configure the
device correctly in Windows. You may also need to obtain and install the latest
version of the device driver for the game controller.

If you calibrate and test the game controller successfully, start Combat Flight
Simulator or Combat Flight Simulator 2 to test the game controller in the game.
If the issue continues to occur, calibrate the device in the game. To do this,
use the appropriate method for your version of Combat Flight Simulator.

  between an add-in sound card and an on-board soundcard. If this is the case,
  disable the card not being used and ensure that the joystick is plugged into
  the appropriate port.

3. On the General tab, verify that the game controller that you want to use
  appears in the Game Controllers box.

  If the Game Controllers box contains a different game controller, click the
  game controller in the Game Controllers box, and then click Remove.

4. In the Game Controllers box, click the game controller that you want to use,
  and then click Properties.

5. On the Settings tab, move the sliders to the settings that you want to use.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater:

1. Start a new flight in Combat Flight Simulator 2.

2. On the Options menu, click Settings.

3. Click Calibrate Joystick.

  NOTE: If Calibrate Joystick is unavailable, click to select the Enable
  Joystick check box, and then repeat this step.

4. On the General tab, verify that the game controller that you want to use
  appears in the Game Controllers box.

  If the Game Controllers box contains a different game controller, click the
  game controller in the Game Controllers box, and then click Remove.

5. In the Game Controllers box, click the game controller that you want to use,
  and then click Properties.

6. On the Settings tab, move the sliders to the settings that you want to use.

7. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Reset the Default Actions
-------------------------

To reset the default actions assigned to the game controller:

1. Start a new flight in Combat Flight Simulator or Combat Flight Simulator 2.

2. On the Options menu in Combat Flight Simulator, point to Settings, and then
  click "Controller assignments".

  On the Options menu in Combat Flight Simulator 2, click Settings. On the

  click OK.

6. Click the "Joystick axes" tab.

7. In the "Joystick type" box, click the game controller that you want to use,
  and then click Reset Defaults.

8. To determine if the default events are selected for your 4-axis game
  controller, verify that the Axis settings on Joystick Axes tab for each Event
  match the settings in the following table:

  
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | Event         | Axis (CFS 1) | Axis (CFS 2) | 
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | Elevator axis | Y Axis       | Y-axis       | 
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | Ailerons axis | X Axis       | X-axis       | 
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | Rudder axis   | Z Rotation   | Rz-axis      | 
  +---------------------------------------------+
  | Throttle axis | Slider       | Z-axis       | 
  +---------------------------------------------+

  If the default events are not selected, assign the default events manually.
  For information about how to do this, refer to the "Manually Assign Actions"
  method in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q279210 Combat Flight Simulator/Combat Flight Simulator 2: How to
  Troubleshoot Joystick Problems (Part 2)

  If the default event is assigned to an axis, but the event behaves in reverse
  (for example, up instead of down, or right instead of left), click to select
  or clear the check box under the Reverse column for that axis.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Rebuild the game and joystick configuration file.
-------------------------------------------------

Combat Flight Simulator stores game and joystick configuration settings in the
Combatfs.cfg file.

Combat Flight Simulator 2stores game and joystick configuration settings in the
Cfs2.cfg file.

To rebuild the Combatfs.cfg or Cfs2.cfg file, press and hold down CTRL+SHIFT as
you start Combat Flight Simulator and then start a new flight. Continue to hold
down CTRL+SHIFT until you are in Cockpit view.

NOTE: When you rebuild the configuration file, some of your joystick settings may
change.

If your game controller is installed properly and the Devices.cfg file contains
the default settings for your game controller, Combat Flight Simulator adds the
appropriate entries for your game controller to the Cfs2.cfg or Combatfs.cfg
file.

To view the Device.cfg file:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the appropriate line for your version of Combat Flight
  Simulator, and then click OK

  Combat Flight Simulator 1:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight
  Simulator\Devices.cfg

  Combat Flight Simulator 2:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight Simulator
  2\Devices.cfg

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which you want to
  install Combat Flight Simulator.

3. If you are prompted to select the program that you want to use to open the
  file, click Notepad in the "Choose the program you want to use" box, and then
  click OK.

The settings under the SLEW heading determine how the game controller behaves in
Slew mode. The settings under the RUDDER heading determine how the game
controller behaves when the rudder is enabled. To enable the rudder settings,
click to select the Rudder check box on the Settings tab in the Game Controllers
tool in Control Panel.

NOTE: If your game controller is not defined in the Devices.cfg file, Combat
Flight Simulator may not assign any actions to the buttons on your game
controller. To manually assign actions to the buttons on your game control
device, proceed to the "Manually Assign Actions" method in part 2 of this
article.
