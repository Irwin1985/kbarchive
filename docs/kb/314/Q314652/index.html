This article explains how to troubleshoot video related issues in the Microsoft
games listed at the beginning of this article.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 relies heavily on proper video adapter
performance. Some computer systems may experience sluggishness or poor graphic
display because the video adapter does not perform optimally.

When using Flight Simulator, you may experience one of the following symptoms:

- Poor video performance in the game.

- Poor game performance (choppy game play).

- Graphics in the game are distorted.

NOTE: The following steps are lengthy, so you may wish to print them out before
you begin.
