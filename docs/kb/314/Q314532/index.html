-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot Exchange Server if an Exchange Server
user can successfully use Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) to open the Inbox,
but cannot see the body of a message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

First Issue
-----------

To properly function, OWA requires read, write, and delete access to the WebTemp
and System Temp folders. If a user sees blank bodies in messages, the user's
Microsoft Windows NT account might not have read, write, and delete access to
the system Temp folder on the server.

Changing the Location of Your Server's Temp Folder:

The Temp folder on your server might be in a location that you do not want to
grant the Everyone group read, write, and delete access to (for example,
C:\Winnt\Temp). To move your server's Temp folder to a more secure location, use
the procedure that is appropriate to your server's operating system:

- For Windows NT 4.0:

  1. Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.

  2. Click the Environment tab.

  3. If your server has the TMP value, select the value for TMP in the System
     pane. If your server does not have the TMP value, select any other
     variable in the System pane, and then type "TMP" (without the quotation
     marks) in the Variable Name box at the bottom of the dialog box.

  4. Type the location of your Temp folder in the Variable Value box, and then
     click Set.

  5. Click Apply, and then click OK to close the dialog box.

  6. You must restart your server for the changes to take effect.

- For Microsoft Windows 2000:

  1. Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.

  2. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Environment Variables.

  3. Under "System variables" section, select the value for TMP and then click
     Edit. If your server does not have a value for TMP, click New, and then
     type "TMP" (without the quotation marks) in the Variable Name box in the
     dialog that is displayed.

  4. Type the location of your Temp folder in the Variable Value box, and then
     click Set.

  5. Click OK, and then click OK in the System Properties dialog box to close
     it.

  6. You must restart your server for the changes to take effect.

Granting the Everyone Group Read, Write, and Delete Access to the Temp Folder:

To grant the Everyone group read, write, and delete access to the Temp folder,
use the procedure that is appropriate to your server's operating system:

- For Windows NT 4.0:

  1. Use Microsoft Windows Explorer to find your server's system Temp folder.

  2. Right-click the Temp folder, and then click Properties.

  3. Click the Security tab, and then click Permissions.

  4. Select Everyone, and then click Remove.

  5. Click Add, and then double-click the Everyone group so that it is
     displayed in the lower pane. Grant the Everyone group Full Control access,
     and then click OK.

  6. In the main Permissions dialog box, select the Everyone group again, and
     then click Special Directory Access in the Select box in the lower portion
     of the dialog box.

  7. Click Other, and then click to select the Read, Write, and Delete check
     boxes and make sure that all of the rest of check boxes are clear. Click
     OK to close the Permissions dialog box.

  8. Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.

- For Windows 2000:

  1. Use Windows Explorer to find your server's system Temp folder.

  2. Right-click the Temp folder, and then click Properties.

  3. Click the Security tab.

  4. If the "Allow inheritable permissions from parent to propagate to this
     object" check box is selected, click to clear it. In the dialog box that
     is displayed, click Copy.

  5. Select the Everyone group, and then click Remove.

  6. Click Advanced, click Add, and then click the Everyone group. Click OK.

  7. In the Allow column, click to select the following check boxes:

      - "List folder/read data"

      - "Read attributes"

      - "Read extended attributes"

      - "Create files/write data"

      - "Create folders/append data"

      - "Write attributes"

      - "Write extended attributes"

      - "Delete subfolders and files"

     Make sure that all of the rest of the check boxes are clear.

  8. Click OK to close the Permission Entry dialog box, click OK to close the
     Advanced dialog box, and then click OK to close the Properties dialog box.

Second Issue
------------

Users might also see blank message bodies in OWA if the Exchange Server 5.5.
post-Service Pack 4 (SP4) OWA fixes that are described in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article are installed on a server on which the minimum
required version of Microsoft Internet Explorer is not installed:

  Q313576 XGEN: Exchange Server 5.5 Post-SP4 Outlook Web Access Fixes

To resolve this issue, install the minimum required version of Internet Explorer
on the server, and then restart the World Wide Web Publishing service. The
minimum required version of Internet Explorer is Microsoft Internet Explorer
version 5.0, but Microsoft recommends that all OWA servers be upgraded to
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later.

Third Issue
-----------

Virus-scanning software that runs on the server might deny access to a message
with attachments until the attachments are properly scanned. If a server is
under heavy stress, users might not see the bodies of such messages until the
attachments pass through the virus-scanning queue. The user will be able to open
the message after the virus scan for the attachment is finished. If this is the
cause of the issue, the user also cannot see the attachment by using other
means, such as Microsoft Outlook.
