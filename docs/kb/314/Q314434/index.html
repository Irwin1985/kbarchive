Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 1.2 SP4 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Systems Management Server (SMS) version 1.2 Service Pack 4
(SP4) client with the Windows 2000 support fixes for SMS 1.2 onto a Windows 2000
Professional client, error events 1025 and 6002 are reported in the Application
Event log. Each time you restart the computer, the events are generated. The
event details are:

  

- 1025 (ERROR) Source Snmpelea, Description Unable to load PrimaryModule
  System. Loadlibrary returned 126.

- 6002 (WARNING)Source Snmpelea, Description Mutex object could not be
  released. Reason code is 288. Trap may not be sent.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because during the SMS 1.2 client installation, the SMS
Client Configuration Manager (CCM) attempts to install the SMS SNMP Trap
Translator on any Microsoft Windows NT client on which the SNMP agent is
installed. However, the SMS 1.2 SNMP Trap Translator is not supported on Windows
2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server 1.2 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date         Version    Size      File name   Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------
  14-Dec-2001  1.2(786)   368,544   Clicfg.exe  Intel
  14-Dec-2001  1.2(786)   918,288   Clicfg.exe  Alpha

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMS CCM site component is responsible for the installation of the SNMP Trap
Translator. Because the Trap Translator client component cannot be disabled on a
per-client basis, only per site, the Trap Translator is installed on any SMS
Windows NT client that has the SNMP agent installed. The hotfix that is
documented in this article contains a modification to the CCM component that
detects the operating system version that is running on the client prior to the
installation of the Trap Translator. If the operating system major version is 5
(Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP), the SMS SNMP Trap Translator is not
installed on a new SMS client.

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Apply this fix on all of the primary and secondary sites in the SMS hierarchy. To
manually install the hotfix:

1. Stop the SMS_CLIENT_CONFIGURATION_MANAGER service.

2. Copy the hotfix version of the Clicfg.exe file from the appropriate platform
  folder of the hotfix folder structure to the
  SMS\Helper.srv\&lt;platform&gt;.bin folder of the site server, replacing the
  existing version.

3. Restart the SMS_CLIENT_CONFIGURATION_MANAGER service.
