-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management Server (SMS) client computer that is running the SMS
Remote Control agent (Wuser32.exe), Windows Explorer may suddenly begin to
consume all of the available CPU resources when the Remote Control agent is
stopped. This may result in poor responsiveness and performance. Windows
Explorer may also exhibit other unusual behavior, such as activating the wrong
window, or not responding when you right-click the desktop to adjust your
settings. You must stop and then restart Explorer.exe to recover from this
condition.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next SMS service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

To Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q314271.exe is
  an SMS Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to the site server or the computer that is running the SMS
  Administrator console by using an account with administrative permissions.

3. Make sure that the SMS Administrator console is not running.

4. Run Q314271.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard. You can run the
  file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Note that the default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfixed
files to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, you can create
a software distribution for the Setevnt.exe or Cliutils.exe Resource Kit tool,
along with the appropriate parameters to start a CCIM work cycle. For
information about the proper syntax to use with these tools, see the Resource
Kit documentation.

Manual Installation on the Site Server:

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

2. On the site server, make sure that the SMS Administrator console is not
  running.

3. Replace the Remctrl.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version from the hotfix.

4. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl folder with the version from the
  hotfix. You must rename the Compverremctrl.ini file to Compver.ini.

5. Start the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.
