The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you specify that an advertisement for a program should run only when a user
is not logged on, the advertisement may not run if a screen saver runs.

In the &lt;Path&gt;\Ms\Sms\Logs\Smsapm32.log (where &lt;Path&gt; is the path to
the Ms folder) file, the following information may be logged when a user is not
logged on to the computer and the screen saver is running:

  SCHEDULER : This job needs to be run when there is no user logged on.
  SCHEDULER : Checking if a user is actually logged off.
  SCHEDULER : The user is not logged off the system.
  SCHEDULER : This job requires the user to be logged off the system.
  SCHEDULER : Attempting to schedule this job at some time in the future when
  the logoff process has completed.

CAUSE
=====

The Advertised Programs Manager Systems Management Server (SMS) component
verifies that there is a default interactive desktop on a client computer to
determine whether the user is logged off. The default desktop is not available
after a user is logged off, however, a new interactive desktop is created if a
screen saver runs. When this interactive desktop is created, Advertised Program
Manager does not correctly differentiate between the interactive desktop and the
default desktop that is used by the user who is logged on. When this problem
occurs, Advertised Programs Manager incorrectly determines that the default
interactive desktop is present and that the user is logged on.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
