The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2001 
- Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Encarta, you may receive the following error
message:

  Error starting program.
  A required .DLL file, SHRL30.DLL, was not found.

CAUSE
=====

The W32.Sircam.Worm@mm worm virus can cause this issue. The W32/Sircam virus
spreads itself through e-mail messages or unprotected network file shares and
can reveal or delete information on your computer.


To verify that your computer is infected with this type of virus, follow these
steps.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then press ENTER.

2. If the following registry key is set to C:\recycled\sirc32.exe "%1" %* (with
  quotation marks), your computer is infected with the W32/SirCam worm virus:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command

If this registry setting is anything other than "%1" %*" (with quotation marks),
your computer may be infected with a different virus.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft does not provide software that can detect or remove computer viruses.
If you suspect or confirm that your computer is infected with a virus, obtain
current antivirus software. For a list of antivirus software manufacturers,
click the following article number to see the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

How to Try to Prevent the Virus from Running
--------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: The following procedure only prevents the virus from running so that
you can run an updated antivirus program or W32/Sircam virus-removal tool. While
you work to resolve this issue, physically disconnect all of your infected
computers from the Internet or any other networks. For detailed instructions
about how to recover an infected computer, please see the following Carnegie
Mellon Web site:

  http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/root_compromise.html

Microsoft provides third-party contact information to help you find technical
support. This contact information may change without notice. Microsoft does not
guarantee the accuracy of this third-party contact information.

1. Verify that your computer is infected with the W32.Sircam.Worm@mm worm virus.
  For information about how to do so, view the steps that are included in the
  "Cause" section of this article. If your computer is infected with the
  W32.Sircam.Worm@mm worm virus, continue to step 2. If your computer is not
  infected with the W32.Sircam.Worm@mm worm virus, skip the remaining steps,
  and follow the instructions that are included in the "Resolution" section of
  this article.

2. Use Registry Editor to change the (Default) string value in the following
  registry key to "%1" %* (with quotation marks):

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command\

3. At a command prompt, type "cd \" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER.

4. At a command prompt, type "del /f /s /a sirc32.exe" (without the quotation
  marks), and then press ENTER.

5. At a command prompt, type "del /f /s /a scam32.exe" (without the quotation
  marks), and then press ENTER.

6. Restart the computer.

7. Follow the instructions that are included in the "Resolution" section of this
  article.

The W32.Sircam.Worm@mm worm virus modifies the registry so that all executable
(exe) files are launched through the virus file, Sirc32.exe, which resides in
the C:\recycled folder. This alteration in the registry forces executable
programs to run as a command line argument to the Sirc32.exe file. Through the
course of the upgrade to Windows XP the Sirc32.exe file is removed.

The removal of the Sirc32.exe virus without modification of the
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Exefile\Shell\Open\Command key will invalidate every
executable file on the computer because, according to this line in the registry,
the executable files are to be run as a command line parameter to the Sirc32.exe
file (which no longer exists). This prompts the "Windows cannot find" message
when attempting to start the executable file.
