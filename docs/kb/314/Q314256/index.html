-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition, used with:
   - Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, used with:
   - Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, you may experience poor or
"choppy" game performance when Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro 1.0 is
connected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions is true:

- Your sound card cannot properly process game port signals, force feedback
  effect and high-quality game sounds and at the same time.

- Your computer's onboard sound card is enabled.

- You are using outdated sound card drivers.

- You connect the SideWinder Force Feedback Pro joystick to a Thrustmaster game
  card.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method 1: Disable Forces in the Game
------------------------------------

1. Start the game.

2. Click Options, and then select Controls.

3. Click Forces, and then click to clear the "Enable Force Feedback" option.

4. Click OK, and then try the game again.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 2: Disable Onboard Sound Card
------------------------------------

Some computers include a sound card or audio chip set on the motherboard.

If you install a new sound card with the onboard chip set, you may encounter this
problem because of direct memory access (DMA) conflicts between the onboard
audio chip set and the installed sound card.

Windows cannot manage the DMA channel that may still be assigned to the onboard
audio chip set, and conflicts with the DMA channel assigned to the installed
sound card and game port.

To resolve this issue, disable the onboard sound card:

1. Make sure the onboard sound care is disabled in the computer's Complementary
  Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) settings. Please see your computer's
  documentation or manufacturer for information about how to do this.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click System.

4. If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98, click the
  Device Manager tab.

  If you are using Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP, on the
  Hardware tab, click Device Manager.

5. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers".

6. Click the onboard sound device, and then click Properties.

7. If you are using Windows 95 or Windows 98, on the General tab, under Device
  Usage, click to clear the "Original Configuration (Current)" check box. Or,
  if you do not see this check box, click the "Disable In This Hardware
  Profile" check box.

  If you are using Windows 2000 or Windows XP, on the General tab, select "Do
  not use this device (disable)" under Device Usage.

8. Click OK or Close until you return to Windows.

9. Restart the computer.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 3: Update Sound Card Drivers
-----------------------------------

Contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain and
install the latest version of the sound driver for your sound card. For
information about how to contact your hardware manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

How to Identify the Manufacturer and Model of Your Sound Card:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. If you are using Windows 95 or Windows 98, click the Device Manager tab.

  If you are using Windows 2000 or Windows XP, on the Hardware tab, click Device
  Manager.

4. Expand "Sound, video and game controllers" to expand the branch.

5. Under the "Sound, video and game controllers" branch, note the manufacturer
  and model of your sound card, and then click OK.

6. Close all open windows.
