SUMMARY
=======

Some Microsoft Windows API functions require an extra workaround when they are
called from Visual Basic because Visual Basic cannot handle pointer type
variables. This behavior is very common when you call Microsoft Windows NT
security and printer related APIs. This article discusses the following cases:

- Case 1 - A function that returns a variable-length structure.

- Case 2 - A function that returns a structure by using a second level of
  indirection (requiring a pointer to a pointer as a parameter).

- Case 3 - Using a structure returned with a second level of indirection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article provides some sample code that uses Windows NT security APIs to
illustrate the preceding three cases. A Windows NT computer is required to test
the sample.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a CommandButton control (Command1) to Form1.

3. In the Command1_Click event, add the following line:

      MySample

4. From the Project menu, add a new .bas module.

5. Paste the following code into the module:

6. Save the project.

7. Press the F5 key to run the project.

8. Click Command1 to test the code.

Case 1 - A Function Returns a Variable-Length Structure:

For a function to return a structure with variable length, you need to pass to
the function a pointer to a memory buffer large enough for the structure to be
stored. Usually, functions that return a structure with variable length provide
a way of finding out the size of the memory buffer to allocate. This is what the
RegGetKeySecurity function illustrates in this case. The RegGetKeySecurity
function retrieves a copy of the security descriptor of a registry key, which is
a variable size structure. The third parameter is a memory buffer that is used
to store the structure itself, and the fourth parameter is used as an in-and-out
parameter. When you call the function, the fourth parameter contains the size of
the allocated buffer. If this size is not large enough to store the structure,
then the function fails, returns the following error message

  ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER

and uses the fourth parameter to return the size required for the structure. This
gives you a chance to allocate a larger buffer and call the function again.

One important point to consider is the declaration of the function. You should
always check the function declaration defined in the API Text Viewer and change
it according to the way you are calling the function. In this case, the
declaration is changed to:

  Declare Function RegGetKeySecurity Lib "advapi32.dll" _
    (ByVal hKey As Long, ByVal SecurityInformation As Long, _
    pSecurityDescriptor As Any, lpcbSecurityDescriptor As Long) As Long

Note that the third parameter is declared as pSecurityDescriptor As Any instead
of being declared as a structure. This occurs because you should pass a
reference to a memory buffer instead of a reference to the structure itself. In
this case, the memory buffer is the SecurityDescriptor array that is an array of
Bytes. You need to pass the memory buffer to the function by passing the first
element of the array (SecurityDescriptor(0)) by reference.

Case 2 - A Function Returns a Structure by Using a Second Level of Indirection (Requiring a Pointer to a Pointer as a Parameter):

When a function requires a pointer to a pointer as an output parameter, this is
the same as returning the address of a variable. Just as an address can be
stored in a 4-bytes integer (a type Long in Visual Basic), you can replace this
parameter with a Long parameter passed by reference.

The most common situation when a function returns an address of a structure is
when the function allocates the memory for the structure or when the function
just retrieves the position of a given structure from an already allocated
buffer. In the preceding sample, the GetSecurityDescriptorDacl function is used
to retrieve a pointer to the discretionary access control list (DACL) from the
security descriptor. Retrieving a pointer means retrieving an address, and to
store an address you need a variable of type Long in Visual Basic. Again, it's
very important to use the right function declaration. Note that the declaration
used in the preceding sample declares the third parameter, the one that
retrieves the pointer as a Long by reference.

  Declare Function GetSecurityDescriptorDacl Lib "advapi32.dll" _
    (pSecurityDescriptor As Any, lpbDaclPresent As Long, pDacl As Long, _
    lpbDaclDefaulted As Long) As Long

Case 3 - Using a Structure Returned with a Second Level of Indirection:

Once you retrieve the pointer of a structure from a function, as in Case 2, you
can face two types of problems. The first problem is how to pass this structure
to another function which is expecting to receive the structure by reference.
The second problem is the need to access elements of this structure directly in
Visual Basic. Both problems can be solved by using the GetAce function. The
GetAce function is used to retrieve the pointer of an ACE from a DACL list. The
first parameter expects a reference to a DACL (in other words, the address of a
DACL), and the second parameter returns the address of an ACE. The address of
the DACL has been retrieved by the GetSecurityDescriptorDacl function and is
stored in the pDacl variable. Because the GetAce function is expecting a
reference to a DACL, you can just pass the pDacl parameter by value. Note the
difference here; when you retrieve pDacl in the GetSecurityDescriptorDacl , you
passed pDacl by reference, and now you are passing it by value. This solves the
first problem, which is to pass a structure retrieved by a second level of
indirection to another function.

Take a look at the second parameter of GetAce, which returns the address of an
ACE structure. As in Case 2, you are using a variable of type Long (pAce) to
retrieve the structure's address. However, you cannot do anything with this
variable in Visual Basic if you need to access members of this structure. Unlike
C, Visual Basic doesn't provide you with any features to manipulate pointers.
The workaround here is to allocate another variable of type UDT (user defined
type) with the structure type you need, and copy into it the content of the
structure you are trying to access. In the preceding sample, the type was
declared as ACE_HEADER, and the variable was defined as AceHeader. You can copy
the content of the structure pointed by pAce to AceHeader by using the
CopyMemory function. Now you can access the members of the structure using the
AceHeader variable. Note that pAce is passed ByVal to CopyMemory.

General Comments:

1. The RtlMoveMemory function (usually declared as CopyMemory) is a Win32 API.
  It is not documented in the API Text Viewer, but is documented in MSDN.

2. Always check the declarations for these types of functions carefully. A wrong
  declaration may generate an exception.

3. Always check the declaration of structures used in these types of functions
  carefully.
