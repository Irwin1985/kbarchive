SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use Windows application programming interface
(API) functions in Visual Basic to determine the printer status or the print job
status programmatically. Although an application does not typically have to
check the status of a printer before printing, it may be useful to determine the
status of a printer or print job programmatically.

Description of the Technique
----------------------------

The term "printer" can refer to a hardware device, a queue, a driver, or even a
port. In this article, the term "printer" is defined as a local print queue. The
code sample in this article returns the statuses that the operating system
reports. This is the same status that the spooler reports, which you can check
by watching the local print queue.

For example, to view the queue on a computer that is running Microsoft Windows
98, click Start, point to Settings, click Printers, and then double-click the
icon for the printer whose queue you want to view.

NOTE: You cannot communicate directly with the physical printer. You should not
have to do this because the operating system must arbitrate access to the
hardware.

The sample code in this article examines the local print queue, which obtains
information from the port monitor, which in turn communicates with the physical
device. For a more detailed description of how this works, see the articles that
are listed in the "References" section of this article.

This sample reports the status from the printer and from the jobs, but note that
the job status information is generally more reliable for applications. Ideally,
you should examine the jobs and the printer statuses separately, and the code
should infer the "meta" status of the queue. However, for most uses, your code
can rely on the job statuses. Also, this example loops through the jobs and
checks and reports the status of each job. This is because your job may follow
another job that is reporting a problem, such as being out of paper or getting
jammed.

NOTE: The system only checks the status when the system has a job to spool.
Otherwise, the queue is considered "ready" because the queue can accept jobs,
even if the hardware is in an error state. For example, if the last job that was
printed used the last piece of paper, the operating system does not know this
until the system tries to print again.

Additionally, although there are many statuses that may be reported, many are not
supported in practice. The printer hardware and the port monitor determine which
statuses to report. For example, if the printer is out of paper and offline, the
status may be reported as "Printing" because that is what the job is trying to
do. Therefore, a queue that displays "Ready" does not guarantee that your print
job will complete successfully.

This code sample examines only the local queue, which should suffice for most
applications. However, connecting to remote printers can become fairly complex.
You can have chained queues, in which the port for the local queue is actually
another queue. You can have printer pooling, in which multiple printers work
from a common super queue. When the architecture becomes more complex, the code
to retrieve a meaningful status also becomes more complex, and the usefulness of
the status is reduced.

On Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, and Microsoft Windows Millennium
Edition only, you can also examine the PrinterInfo.Attributes field for the bit
PRINTER_ATTRIBUTE_WORK_OFFLINE. This state is something that typically occurs
because of user action (for example, if the user right-clicks a printer icon and
then clicks Work Offline). This state does not occur because of the state change
of a print job, although the operating system can force state if the printer
cannot be connected to despool a job. In that case, the status is typically
reported as USER_INERVENTION_REQUIRED.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. By default, Form1 is
  created.

2. On the Project menu, click Add Module, and then add the following code:

  Option Explicit

     Alias "lstrcpyA" _
     (ByVal lpString1 As String, _
     ByVal lpString2 As String) _

  Public Declare Function OpenPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" _
     Alias "OpenPrinterA" _
     (ByVal pPrinterName As String, _
     phPrinter As Long, _
     pDefault As PRINTER_DEFAULTS) _
     As Long

  Public Declare Function GetPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" Alias "GetPrinterA" _
     (ByVal hPrinter As Long, _
     ByVal Level As Long, _
     pPrinter As Byte, _
     ByVal cbBuf As Long, _
     pcbNeeded As Long) _
     As Long

  Public Declare Function ClosePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" _
     (ByVal hPrinter As Long) _
     As Long

  Public Declare Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" _
     (Destination As Any, _
     Source As Any, _
     ByVal Length As Long)

  Public Declare Function EnumJobs Lib "winspool.drv" Alias "EnumJobsA" _
     (ByVal hPrinter As Long, _
     ByVal FirstJob As Long, _
     ByVal NoJobs As Long, _
     ByVal Level As Long, _
     pJob As Byte, _
     ByVal cdBuf As Long, _
     pcbNeeded As Long, _
     pcReturned As Long) _

3. Add three CommandButton controls.

4. Add three TextBox controls to Form1, and then configure the TextBox controls
  as follows:

  a. Set the MultiLine property of each TextBox control to True.

  b. Size each TextBox to approximately five inches wide and three inches long.

  c. Set the ScrollBars property of each TextBox control to "2 - Vertical".

5. Add a Timer control to Form1.

6. Add the following code to the Form's module:

  Option Explicit

     'Enable the timer to begin printer status checks.
     Timer1.Enabled = True

7. Go to your print queue, and then pause the printer. Note that you may need a
  local printer instead of a network printer to pause the print queue.

8. Run the sample project, and then click Start.

9. Perform one or more print operations from another application such as
  Notepad. The printer information is displayed in the text boxes. Notice that
  job details appear in the Immediate window.

10. If necessary, click Stop on the form to scroll through the text boxes and
  the Immediate window to view this printer information.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Only a specific device driver can obtain real-time, accurate printer status
  information. This code obtains the same status that the Windows Spooler
  reports.

- The exact status that is reported may vary with different printers and
  drivers.
