The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 1.2, when selecting large numbers of computers to
delete from the Delete Special box, as many as 100 locks may be used to remove
one computer. This could cause poor performance on the database because it is
likely to occur during normal business hours and while that database is under
normal or heavy stress. In Systems Management Server version 2.0, this behavior
has been changed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Systems Management Server 1.2, the deletion of a single computer would have
generated the SQL syntax below to remove it. This potentially resulted in as
many as 100 locks against the database:

  begin transaction
  delete MachineDataTable from MachineDataTable ,#WS where datakey = dwMachineID
  delete MachineDataHistoryTable from MachineDataHistoryTable ,#WS where datakey = dwMachineID
  delete Machines from Machines ,#WS where datakey = dwMachineID
  delete from WorkstationStatus where  LastHWScan &lt; "07/01/96 18:37:16" and (LastSWScan &lt; "07/01/96 18:37:16" OR LastSWScan is null)
  commit transaction

Because most administrators would be performing this maintenance during business
hours, this may have caused locking errors to be recorded on the SQL Server, as
well as hampered overall SQL Server performance.

However, in Systems Management Server 2.0, SMS_SQL_MONITOR automatically performs
the computer removal from the database during times of minimal SQL Server
activity; frequently enough to prevent a backlog. SMS_SQL_MONITOR was designed
to remove computers from the database that have not been inventoried in the last
90 days. This new design will reduce the work of the administrator, as well as
reduce the potential performance hits against the database.

Because SMS_SQL_MONITOR works automatically in the background, it is a more
efficient method of removing computers that have become inactive.
