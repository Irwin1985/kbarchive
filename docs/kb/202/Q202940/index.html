SUMMARY
=======

In Resource Explorer, when you are viewing hardware for a Systems Management
Server 2.0 client, some hardware inventory classes that are displayed may not
contain data, although other clients display data for the same hardware
inventory classes.

This behavior can be seen in the following scenarios:

- A child site reporting to the parent has more options enabled in the
  SMS_def.mof file than other child sites also reporting to the parent, or more
  options enabled than are on the parent site itself.

- A client that is assigned to multiple sites uses the principal site's
  SMS_def.mof file. If this site has enabled more classes in its SMS_def.mof
  file than the other site(s) that the client is assigned to, this problem may
  occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the initial hardware inventory, by default, SMS collects as many as 200
hardware properties with details such as:

- Number of disk drives

- Type of processor

- Amount of memory

- Operating system

- Monitor and display settings

- Computer name and IP address

- Information about peripherals connected to the resource

- Network type

The properties that are collected depend on which classes and attributes are
enabled in the SMS_def.mof file. Classes are categories of hardware resources.
Although this file contains more than 650 properties, it is distributed with
approximately 200 of the properties enabled. This file can be modified by
administrators.

SMS_def.mof contains classes and properties of hardware that are defined by the
Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF). Properties are the attributes of the
classes. SMS_def.mof is used by hardware inventory client components to
determine what classes and properties should be gathered. SMS_def.mof is stored
on CAPs in the \CAP_sitecode\CLIFILES.BOX\HINV directory. A master copy of this
file is stored on the site server in \smsdir\INBOXES\CLIFILES.SRC\HINV. Disabled
properties in SMS_def.mof can be enabled by editing the master copy.

Both Windows 16-bit and Windows 32-bit client computers use the SMS_def.mof file
to determine what hardware inventory should be collected. However, the way the
data is collected on these client computers differs. Windows 32-bit client
computers use the CIM Object Manager (started by the Windows Management Service)
to collect hardware inventory data from providers. Windows 16-bit client
computers use the Hardware Inventory Client Agent to collect inventory data. On
both client computer types, collection data is sent to the Client Access Point
(CAP) by the Hardware Inventory Client Agent and added to the site server
database by threads of the SMS Executive.

Only a subset of the data that is collected by the CIM Object Manager can be
collected by the Windows 16-bit Hardware Inventory Client Agent. Further, most
hardware data processing for Windows 16-bit client computers is done on the site
server. On the other hand, most hardware data processing for Windows 32-bit
client computers is completed on the client computer. So, for example, only
changes in hardware configuration are sent to the CAP by the Windows 32-bit
client agent, while all hardware data is sent to the CAP by the Windows 16-bit
client agent, and the site server must then process the data to find changes in
hardware inventory.
