1.0 Supported Networks

1.1 List of Supported Networks

The following networks have been tested and are compatible with
WinLogin:

NetWare - workstation shell version 3.01 and above
Microsoft LANMan and 100% compatible - versions 1.0 and
         above
Banyan VINES - versions 4.0 and above
DEC Pathworks - versions 4.0 and above
3Com 3+Share - versions 1.3 and above
3Com 3+Open - all versions
IBM DOS LAN Server - versions 1.2 and above
Artisoft LANtastic - versions 3.0 and above

1.2 LANMan version 2.1

The client software will not operate properly under Microsoft LAN
Manager version 2.1. It will be necessary for you to obtain updated
LAN Manager components. If you are using Microsoft LAN Manager 2.1 on
your workstations, please contact Microsoft Product Support for
additional information and updated software

1.3 3Com 3+Share

If you encounter problems when multiple users attempt to access the
database, such as with multiple clients simultaneously attempting to
logon or in attempting to access the database using the Admin tools
while clients are attempting to logon, you may need to increase the
number of concurrent file range locks supported by your server. These
errors may show up as any form of "Error opening the  database",
"Error initializing the database" or "Error accessing &lt;one of the
tables; user, wksta, etc.&gt;".

2.0 File Locking and File Sharing

2.1 SHARE.EXE

MS-DOS based networks often use SHARE.EXE to provide file locking and
sharing capabilities. SHARE must be loaded on both the client and the
server when using these networks.

The default number of files and locks that SHARE.EXE uses may need to
be increased in order for WinLogin to operate properly. We recommend
that you edit the line that you use to load SHARE to read:

    SHARE /L:200 /F:4096.

This line will provide sufficient files and locks for most WinLogin
installations.

2.2 MS-DOS Based Network Servers

Some MS-DOS based networks, including IBM PC LAN Program, do not fully
support the file locking (byte range locking) necessary to use some
types of databases. WinLogin will not work with these networks.

2.3 Sharing Violations

A "Sharing Violation on Drive C:" error may occur after the client
installation has completed. This is due to the file VER.DLL being in
use by both Windows and the WinLogin setup program. Simply OK the
error dialog then close and re-start Windows to boot as a WinLogin
client.

A "Sharing Violation on Drive C:" error may occur if the SETUP does
not complete normally. Check for the existence of the directory "\MS-
SETUP.T" that may have been left on the local hard disk. If this
directory exists, it will most likely contain the file VER.DLL, and
subsequent attempts to setup will result in sharing violations. If
this occurs, delete this directory and re-run SETUP.

3.0 Other Information

3.1 Installation

You must have two floppy disk drives in order to create the client
setup disk on a floppy disk. We recommend that you create the client
setup disk on a network drive and transfer the image to a floppy disk
if you wish to install the WinLogin client from floppy disk.

If you receive the error message "WinLogin Client Setup could not
access the WinLogin Database as described in the WINLOGIN.INI." There
are several possible causes of this error:

    There may be insufficient space on the WinLogin client
    hard disk to initialize SETUP. (You must have a
    minimum of 500Kb free disk space in order to setup a
    WinLogin client.)

The client may not have access to the remote network resource. Make
sure the client has full read-write access to the database, and that
the network share is not password protected.

3.2 Running WinLogin

Do not run the administrative tools on a workstation that is
concurrently running the WinLogin client. Attempting to do so may
result in database corruption. We recommend that you install the
administrative tools on a machine that is not configured as a WinLogin
client.

Do not set the parameter "fallbackdir=" in the WINLOGIN.INI file to
the Windows directory of the client installation. Doing so may cause
the .INI files on the WinLogin workstation to become corrupted, or be
written as 0 byte files.

The WinLogin database must be installed onto a network drive. Do not
attempt to install the database to a local drive.  Doing so will cause
the error message "Cannot connect to remote resource" to be displayed.

3.3 Backing up your data

It is highly recommended that you backup the WinLogin database after
creation and regularly thereafter. You should also backup your
WinLogin installation disks prior to installing to prevent possible
disk corruption.

3.4 Using Shells other than Program Manager

WinLogin defaults to loading the Windows 3.1 Program Manager as the
shell. If you wish to use any other shell, it will be necessary to
edit the client installation disk. Refer to the ADMIN.WRI file for
instructions on editing the client installation disk.

3.5 Removing WinLogin

To remove the WinLogin client software:

1. Copy the *.INI files from the fallback directory to the Windows
  directory.

2. Replace the "SHELL=WINLOGIN.EXE" line in the SYSTEM.INI with
  "SHELL=PROGMAN.EXE" (or other Windows shell).

3. Delete WIN.COM from the Windows directory.

4. Rename W31.COM in the Windows directory to WIN.COM.

5. Delete the *.LGN files.

6. Delete WINLOGIN.*, WLMERGE.DLL, MSINIMRG.DLL, COPYMRG.DLL,
  WLMERGE.INI, WLDAPI.DLL, WLUSERFN.DLL, WLPLATFN.DLL, WLDNET.DLL and
  JET.DLL from the Windows directory
