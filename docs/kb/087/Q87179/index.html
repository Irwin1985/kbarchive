-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A complete listing of command-line options for the gateway program (HostDisp or
VMGATE) can be obtained by typing the program name followed by a question mark
(for example, HOSTDISP ?).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are some of the options that are most useful when troubleshooting problems
with the gateway (listed alphabetically):

  Option   Description
  ------   -----------

  -Inn     "Items." The maximum number of LAN mail items to queue when
           checking for mail. Up to two decimal digits can be entered;
           for example, -i0 to -i99 can be specified.

           Note that HostDisp assumes that the mainframe will process
           all uploaded LAN items within 30 minutes (see the -W option,
           below). If MS-GATE's response time is very slow (for
           example, its priority level has been set to a low value),
           either reduce the -I parameter and/or increase the -W
           parameter. Default is 50 items. An -i0 value indicates that
           you want to receive VM mail only; LAN mail will not be
           uploaded to the mainframe.

  -Knn     "Klicks." Number of seconds to wait after control is
           returned to HostDisp from the spawned SEND and RECEIVE
           programs. Allows time to re-establish internal handshaking
           between the host session and the PC. Default is 3 seconds.
           Valid range: 0 to 99.

  -L       "Log." Copy screen messages to the LOG\VMGATE.LOG file in
           the MS Mail data files. If VMGATE.LOG already exists, new
           messages will be appended.

  -MS      "Messages Sent." Log SENT message synopsis to the
           LOG\SENT.LOG file in the MS Mail data files.

  -MR      "Messages Received." Log RECEIVED message synopsis to the
           LOG\RECV.LOG file in the MS Mail data files.

  -Nnnn    "Next." Time interval between checking for mail. Up to three
           digits can be entered. The valid range is 0 to 999 minutes;
           for example, -n0 to -n999 can be specified.

           Default is 5 minutes; -n0 value indicates continuous
           checking.

  -Tnnnnn  "Terminate." Check for VM host mail nnnnn times, then
           terminate HostDisp. Range: 0 - 2 to the 31st minus one (a
           ten-digit number). HostDisp will still terminate when the
           ESC key is pressed by the operator. Omitting this option
           means terminate only with operator intervention (pressing
           the ESC key), or because the -W, -BT, -BD, or -BR option
           limits have been reached. This option is useful if your site
           uses an automatic logon/logoff program to initiate/terminate
           HostDisp.

  -V       "Verbose." Provides many informative messages. This option
           is useful when learning the behavior of this program. If you
           have also specified the "-L" option, the messages will also
           be copied to the LOG\VMGATE.LOG text file. Whenever an error
           is detected, an appropriate message will be displayed
           whether this option has been specified or not. This option
           automatically invokes the "-aB" option.

  -Wnn     "Wait." HostDisp waits for a maximum of 99 minutes. After
           LAN mail has been uploaded, HostDisp waits until MS-GATE
           signals that it has distributed all LAN mail. Use this
           option if it takes longer than 30 minutes to process a
           Directory Services IMPORT request, or if MS-GATE's priority
           level is low. This option forces an earlier/later exit.
           Default is 30 minutes; range is 1 to 99.

Notes:

- If HostDisp terminates, the LAN mail that had just been uploaded will not be
  deleted from the database and will be moved to the VMGATE\ERR subdirectory.

- If the "-E" option was specified, a diagnostic mail message will be sent to
  that address.
