SYMPTOMS
========

The upgrade instructions provided in the LAN Manager manuals are incorrect.
Attempting to upgrade your operating system before detaching your LAN Manager
installation may result in data corruption and you may need to format your hard
drive to get the system to run again.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following are the full instructions for upgrading to either Microsoft OS/2
version 1.3 or LAN Manager version 2.1. Forgetting steps 1 and 2 may lead to the
problems described above.

1. Run the 20CLEAN utility provided on the LAN Manager OS/2 Setup disk if you
  are upgrading from LAN Manager 2.0 to LAN Manager 2.1.

2. Detach the current version of LAN Manager from within the LAN Manager Setup
  program (from the Actions menu, choose Detach). The network software must be
  stopped first. This will remove HPFS386 and ACLs.

3. Boot the system with an OS/2 1.3 Install disk and follow the instructions.

4. After the OS/2 1.3 upgrade has completed, you will be prompted to continue
  upgrading to LAN Manager 2.1, using the LAN Manager 2.1 OS/2 Setup disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the above steps are not followed, or the upgrade fails with an incomplete
installation, you may observe the following symptoms. The solution(s) to these
symptoms immediately follows each symptom.

- The operating system upgrade appears to complete successfully; however, you
  are left with a mixture of the previous OS/2 version and Microsoft OS/2 1.3.

  To revive the server, perform the following steps:

  1. Copy the following files from the installation disks to your hard disk
     (over the existing ones): BASEDD01.SYS, I0S1X.SYS, DISK01.SYS, and the
     appropriate .BID(s) for your hardware. These files must be decompressed
     using the DECOMP utility found in the \NETPROG directory on the LAN
     Manager for OS/2 Setup disk.

  2. Copy the OS/2 hidden files (OS2KRNL and OS2LDR) to your hard disk. To do
     this, you must use a utility such as CHMODE.EXE, which removes the hidden,
     system, and read-only attributes, so the copy command will copy the files.
     The attributes must be replaced following the file copy. Once the server
     is up and running, you should properly detach LAN Manager and reinstall
     the operating system to ensure that OS/2 is correctly installed.

- Microsoft OS/2 version 1.3 is running; however, the OS/2 1.21 (or earlier
  version) Print Manager is still installed. (This problem is common when
  upgrading from LAN Manager version 2.0c.)

  The 2.0c upgrade placed PMSPOOL.EXE in the \LANMAN\NETPROG directory and
  PMSPL.DLL in the \LANMAN\NETLIB directory. These files are used instead of
  the ones installed by Microsoft OS/2 1.3. Delete these two files, properly
  shut down the system, and reboot. The correct version of Print Manager (OS/2
  1.3) will then be used.
