SUMMARY
=======

Certificates that are installed on computers running Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 are usually set to expire in one year from the issue date
depending on the Certificate Authority that issued them.

If you have a certificate that is about to expire, you have the option of
renewing it to make sure that it continues to be valid. This article describes
the steps in the renew process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If you received your original Web server certificate from a Certificate
Authority that is not running Microsoft Certificate Server 2.0 (for example,
from Verisign), see the following Knowledge Base article for more information:

  

  Q262979 Cannot Renew Verisign Certificates in IIS 5.0

In IIS 5.0, the certificates are set for each Web site. To renew a certificate
bound to a certain Web site, follow these steps:

IMPORTANT: Do not change any of the Web Site or Directory Security properties for
the site until the renewal process is complete.

1. Open Internet Service Manager.

2. Right-click the Web site for which you want to renew the certificate, and
  then click Properties.

3. Under the Directory Security section, click Server Certificate.

4. In the Web Server Certificate Wizard, click Next, click Renew the current
  certificate, and then click Next.

5. If you are running Microsoft Certificate Server 2.0 and it is part of your
  Active Directory, do the following:

  a. Click Send the request immediately to an online certificate authority, and
     then click Next.

  b. From the drop-down list, select Certificate Authority, and then click
     Next.

  c. Confirm your selection, and then click Next to complete the renew process.

  If you are not running Microsoft Certificate Server 2.0, click Prepare the
  request now, but send it later.

6. Choose the request file name, and note the directory where you save it.

7. Click Next twice, and then click Finish to complete the wizard. Click OK to
  close the Web site properties and the Internet Service Manager. You now have
  a renewal request file.

8. If you received your certificate from a third-party certificate authority
  (for example, Verisign), send them the renew request file that you created,
  wait for them to e-mail you a renewed certificate, save the renewed
  certificate file to your hard disk, and then go to step 16. To save the
  renewed certificate file to your hard disk, copy the following lines:

  -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----" until and including "-----END NEW
  CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

  Paste the text into a text editor, such as Notepad, and then save the file
  with a .txt or .cer file extension.

  NOTE: Be careful not to include any blank spaces or extra lines.

9. If you received the original certificate from Microsoft Certificate Server
  1.0 or 2.0, submit the renewal request by using the Web interface.

10. Open the request file that you generated in step 6, and copy the following
  lines:

  -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----" until and including "-----END NEW
  CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

  NOTE: Be careful not to include any blank spaces or extra lines.

11. Open your Certificate Server Web interface (for example,
  http://MyCertificateServer/certsrv).

12. Click Request a certificate, click Next, click Advanced Request, and then
  click Next. (In Certificate Server 1.0, click Certificate enrollment tools,
  click Process a certificate request, and then go to step 13.)

13. Click Submit a certificate request using a base64 encoded PKCS #10 file or a
  renewal request using a base64 encoded PKCS #7 file, and then click Next.

14. Paste the text that you copied in step 10 into the Saved request box, and
  then click Next.

15. Click Download CA Certification Path, and then save the file on your hard
  drive. This is your renewed certificate file.

16. In Internet Service Manager, right-click the Web site for which you are
  renewing the certificate (from step 2), and then click Properties.

17. On the Directory Security tab, click Server Certificate.

18. In the wizard window, click Next, click Process the pending request and
  install the certificate, and then click Next.

19. Browse to the renewed certificate file, select it, click Next twice, and
  then click Finish.

20. Click OK to close the sites properties and the Internet Information Services
  snap-in.

You have successfully renewed the certificate used with IIS 5.0.

IMPORTANT: To confirm that the renewed certificate is correctly bound to the Web
site, type the following command at a command prompt:

  "netstat -an" (without the quotation marks)

If it is correctly bound, the netstat -an listing displays the Web site's IP
address:port address in a LISTENING or ESTABLISHED state. If this is not the
case, restart the IIS service or the computer, and then check the event logs.
