SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the behavior of the Clicore.log file; in particular, its
indication that files are repeatedly being installed each time a user logs on to
the computer, when, in fact, this addition of files does not occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2),
the behavior of the periodic verification cycle on SMS clients has changed. Now,
instead of having to reinstall all client component files during the
verification cycle or during a logon installation phase, only those files that
have changed are copied to the client.

The Clicore.log file, however, often indicates that files are repeatedly being
installed each time a user logs on to a computer (when the SMS site has
Microsoft Windows NT Logon Client Installation enabled). A user may be concerned
that a significant amount of network traffic is being generated by the
installation of these files.

In fact, the message displayed in the Clicore.log file is misleading. Because of
the changes in the SMS Installer (for SP2), the actual location where you must
check for files that are being installed or bypassed (skipped) is in the
Coreinst.log file located in the &lt;WinDir&gt;\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Coreinst.log
folder. The display of the Coreinst.log file reveals that most (if not all) of
the Clicore files are being bypassed (that is, if the correct versions are
already present on the client).

The following entry is an excerpt from the Clicore.log file during a logon
installation process on an existing client:

Installing C:\Winnt\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Clilog.dll
Installing C:\Winnt\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Abnwcli.dll
registering common Nal Dlls
After Nal32 install, Rebootrequired flag setting is 0
Installing NT Nal Dlls
Installing C:\Winnt\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Falclin.dll

The corresponding section from the Coreinst.log file for the same time period
displays the following entry:

Skipped File: C:\Winnt\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Clilog.dll
Skipped File: C:\Winnt\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Abnwcli.dll
