-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user on an Exchange Server 5.5 computer sends an e-mail message to a
recipient on a Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) server that is connected by means of the
Microsoft Mail Connector on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer, the user on the
Exchange Server 5.5 computer may not receive a non-delivery report (NDR) if
either of following conditions exist:

- The MS Mail server is unavailable.

-or-

- The Microsoft Mail Connector (PC) MTA service cannot access the network
  shared point of the MS Mail server postoffice.

CAUSE
=====

On the Exchange Server 5.5 computer that is connected to the MS Mail server by
the Microsoft Mail Connector, Exchange Server 5.5 increases the number of
retries in the delivery process when Exchange Server 5.5 cannot send a message.
An NDR is sent to a sender when the number of retries exceeds the limit of "Max
open retries" in the message transfer agent (MTA) properties.

This problem can occur if the MS Mail server is down or the Exchange Server 5.5
computer cannot access the network shared point of the MS Mail server
postoffice, because Exchange Server 5.5 cannot start the delivery process and
does not increase the number of retry times. Therefore, the number of retries
does not exceed the limit of the "Max open retries" property and an NDR is not
sent.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
service pack that contains this fix.

to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install this fix for the Microsoft Mail Connector (PC) MTA service on
the servers to replace the fixed files, you need to add the EnforceRetryLimits
registry key under the &lt;PCMTA_service&gt; key on each server for which you
want to change the behavior. To do so, you need to edit the registry on each
server.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To add the EnforceRetryLimits registry key:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;PCMTA_service&gt;

  To locate the value for the &lt;PCMTA_service&gt; key:

  a. In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, click the
     &lt;site_name&gt; object, and then click the Configuration object.

  b. Click the Connections object, right-click Microsoft Mail Connector, and
     then click Properties.

  c. Click the Connector MTAs tab, and then click MS Mail Connector (PC) MTA
     Services in the list.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: EnforceRetryLimits
  Data Type: DWORD
  Value: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart the Microsoft Mail Connector (PC) MTA service.
