-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Advertisement Status Viewer (Advertview.exe) tool to determine
the status of an advertisement on an individual Systems Management Server (SMS)
client or collection with a user-defined interval, the status of an
advertisement may be reported as "None." However, the SMS Administrator console
and direct queries against the SMS database may indicate that the status of the
advertisement is either "Success" or "Failure."

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the name of the computer for which you are checking the
status was entered in the database (the Name0 value in System_DISC) in lowercase
letters.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next SMS service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date       Time   Version    Size     File name       Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------- 
  08-May-01  13:18  2.00.1469  528,384  Advertview.exe  Intel
  08-May-01  13:20  2.00.1469  685,568  Advertview.exe  Alpha

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use the SMS Administrator console to view the
advertisement status for computers whose names are displayed in the database
with lowercase letters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
