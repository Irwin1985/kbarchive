The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) 2.0 on Windows NT
4.0 Terminal Server from a Terminal Server client session, the installation is
not completed and you receive the following error message:

  Error 26051: Installation of Common Administration ui elements failed

If you attempt to install SFU locally from the Terminal Server console, when you
run the Services for UNIX Administration tool from a Terminal Server client
session, you receive the following error message:

  An error has occurred in the script on this page.
  Line: 61
  Char: 5
  Error: Server Execution Failed
  Code: 0
  URL: file://c:\sfu\admin\about.htm (This path changes depending on the
  component you are trying to administer

  Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) Class ID
is not being configured as global.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Start Notepad and type the following text in a new Notepad file:

  "REGEDIT4

  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal
  Server\Compatibility\CLSID\{8BC3F05E-D86B-11D0-A075-00C04FB68820}]
  "fSystemGlobalClass"=dword:00000001" (without the quotation marks)

2. Save the file as Sfu-ts.reg, and then quit Notepad.

3. Copy the new file to the computer that is running Windows NT Terminal Server.

4. Right-click the Sfu-ts.reg file, and then click Merge.

After you apply this registry update, you can install SFU successfully from a
Terminal Server client session. This update also enables remote administration
through a Terminal Server client session.

NOTE: Because of a related Windows Management Installation (WMI) issue that
causes Mofcomp to attempt to write to the CD-ROM drive, you may also have to
copy the SFU CD-ROM to a hard disk.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WBEM is a unifying architecture that enables you to access data from a variety
of underlying technologies, including Win32, WMI, Desktop Management Interface
(DMI), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). WBEM is based on the
Common Information Model (CIM) schema, which is an industry standard driven by
the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF).
