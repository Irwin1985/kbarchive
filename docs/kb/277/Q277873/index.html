SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a serious security vulnerability
in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 or Internet Information
Server 4.0. When IIS receives a valid request for an executable file, it passes
the name of the requested file to the underlying operating system for
processing. However, because of an implementation flaw, it is possible to create
a specially malformed file request that contains both a file name and one or
more operating system commands. When it receives such a request, IIS passes the
entire string to the operating system, which first processes the file, and then
executes the commands. The file must reside in a folder to which the user has
execute permissions, but it does not necessarily need to be an executable file.

The ability to execute operating system commands on a Web server can enable a
malicious user to take virtually any action that an interactively logged on user
can take. Although this does not give the malicious user administrative control
over the server, it can nevertheless allow him to cause widespread damage. He
could, for instance, add, delete or change files on the server, run code that
was already on the server, or upload and run the code of his choice.

For more information on this vulnerability, see the following Microsoft Web
site:
