The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you create a document in Creative Writer for the Macintosh, you can easily
open it in Creative Writer for Windows, and vice versa. Similarly, you can open
Fine Artist documents in either Fine Artist for Windows or Fine Artist for the
Macintosh.

Note, however, that you cannot open Fine Artist files in Creative Writer, or
Creative Writer documents in Fine Artist, regardless of the platform they are
created on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps for Converting Files from the Macintosh for Use in Windows
----------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Writer and Fine Artist for Windows can open files from Macintosh
Creative Writer and Fine Artist as long as they have valid MS-DOS file names
(that is, they must have the .MAX filename extension for Creative Writer and the
.MAG filename extension for Fine Artist).

To transfer a document from Creative Writer for the Macintosh to Creative Writer
for Windows, use the following steps:

1. Save the file with a valid MS-DOS filename. The name can be eight characters
  or fewer, followed by the appropriate three-character extension (the .MAX
  filename extension for Creative Writer and the .MAG filename extension for
  Fine Artist).

2. Place this file on an MS-DOS formatted disk. This can be done using a
  translation utility, such as Apple File Exchange, that allows your Macintosh
  to recognize an MS-DOS-formatted disk. The methods for transferring the file
  to the MS-DOS disk vary, depending on which utility you use.

3. Insert this disk into the computer running Windows, and start Creative Writer
  (or Fine Artist).

4. In the Writing Studio, start the Portfolio, select the floppy disk drive
  (usually A), click Ratdog, and type the name of the file. Open the file.

Steps for Converting Files from Windows for Use on the Macintosh
----------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Writer and Fine Artist for the Macintosh recognize files from Creative
Writer and Fine Artist for Windows, respectively. You do not need to use special
file naming conventions to ensure that these files are recognized.

To open a Windows document on the Macintosh, use steps similar to those outlined
above: that is, place the file on an MS-DOS disk, use a file conversion utility,
insert the disk in the Macintosh, run the program, and select the file in the
Portfolio.
