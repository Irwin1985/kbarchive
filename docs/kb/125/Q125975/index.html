SYMPTOMS
========

You can use the SWITCH.INF file (or PAD.INF for X.25 networks) to automate the
log on process to intermediary or remote third-party devices, instead of using
the manual RAS Terminal screen. SWITCH.INF was designed for automated
communication with non-X.25 devices, such as intermediary, third- party security
devices, or in Windows NT RAS 3.5 or later, Internet access providers (which
usually require user identification before access to the Internet is
permitted).

All of the information pertaining to SWITCH.INF scripting also applies to PAD.INF
scripting. However, PAD.INF supports a few more features and has a few more
requirements that are not the subject of this article.

None of the information in this article applies to Windows 95, because it does
not support the script language used in the SWITCH.INF and PAD.INF files.
Therefore, the SWITCH.INF and PAD.INF files do not exist on Windows 95.

To get support for scripting under Windows 95, obtain Windows 95 Service Pack 1
(SP1). In the Admin directory of SP1 you can find the scripting tool Script.exe.
The Admin directory also contains the Script.doc file that describes the
commands and syntax of that script language.

Note: Windows 95 was not tested with X.25 dial-up and therefore is not supported
as an X.25 client, however, it may work.

Note: Windows NT 4.0 supports the script language used in SWITCH.INF and PAD.INF
as well as the Windows 95 script language.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LIMITATIONS
-----------

RAS versions prior to 3.1 do not support SWITCH.INF scripting. However, you may
be able to obtain the same functionality by using the PAD.INF file with RAS
version 1.1x. For more information, refer to the "Using Scripts with Other
Microsoft RAS Clients" section below.

PAD.INF was designed for X.25 connectivity. Although using PAD.INF with non- X.25
networks may work, it has not been tested by, and is not supported by Microsoft.
Before using PAD.INF on non-X.25 networks, study the syntax, structure, and
common command lines in the PAD.INF file that ships with RAS. Also, refer to
your RAS manuals on X.25 connectivity.

All of the information in this article applies to all RAS versions that have
PAD.INF file support. However, the syntax is different for the RAS version 1.1x.
Refer to your RAS version 1.1x PAD.INF, RAS manual, and release notes for more
information.

CREATING SCRIPTS FOR RAS
------------------------

The SWITCH.INF file is like a set of small batch files or scripts, all contained
in one file. A SWITCH.INF script can contain six elements: a section header,
comments, commands, responses, response keywords, and reserved macro keywords.

In addition to dividing the SWITCH.INF file into individual scripts, section
headers start the scripts. Comment lines are used to document the script. Any
other line in a script is either a command or a response. A command is issued
from the local RAS client. A response is received from the remote device or
computer.

To write an automatic script for your RAS client you must know the required
commands and corresponding responses for the intermediary device. The commands
and responses must be in the exact order that the device expects to encounter
them.

Branching statements, such as GOTO or IF command, are not supported by the
SWITCH.INF and PAD.INF script language. The required sequence of commands and
responses from intermediary devices should be in the device documentation. If
you are connecting to a commercial service, the required sequence of commands
and responses should also be available from the service support staff.

The SWITCH.INF file can contain scripts for each intermediary device or online
service that the RAS user calls. The scripts are activated by configuring Remote
Access Phonebook entries as described below in the "Activating SWITCH.INF
Scripts" section.

SECTION HEADERS
---------------

A section header marks the beginning of a script, is enclosed in square brackets,
and cannot exceed 31 characters. For example:

  [Route 66 Login]

Each script requires one section header. The section header appears in the RAS
Phonebook field allowing you to select RAS Terminal or any other SWITCH.INF
script. For more information, see the "Activating SWITCH.INF Scripts" section
below.

COMMENTS
--------

Comment lines are preceded by semicolons (;) in the left most margin (column
one), are optional, and can be placed anywhere in the file. For example:

     ; This script was created by Patrick on September 29, 1995

COMMANDS
--------

A command comes from the local computer. A response comes from the remote device
or computer. The COMMAND= statement, which can be used in three different ways,
is used to send commands to the intermediary device.

NOTE: Use upper case for all SWITCH.INF commands.

COMMAND=
--------

COMMAND= by itself causes an approximate two second delay, depending on CPU speed
and the presence of caching software (for example, SMARTDRV.EXE). If the
intermediary device cannot process all of the characters on a
COMMAND=&lt;CustomString&gt;&lt;cr&gt; line (because they are sent at once), use
multiple COMMAND= statements.

COMMAND=&lt;CUSTOM STRING&gt;
-----------------------

COMMAND=&lt;custom string&gt; sends the custom string and causes a slight delay
of several hundred milliseconds (depending on CPU speed and installed caching
software). The delay gives the intermediary device time to process the custom
string and prepare for the next command.

COMMAND=CUSTOM STRING &lt;cr&gt;
--------------------------

COMMAND=&lt;custom string&gt;&lt;cr&gt; sends the custom string immediately.
Consult the remote device documentation to determine which strings are
required.

RESPONSES
---------

Each command line is followed by one or more response lines. Consult the remote
device documentation to determine which response strings and dialogs are
expected by the remote device. RAS compares responses received with what you put
on the response lines. If it matches, RAS uses the response related keyword and
macro.

RESPONSE KEYWORDS
-----------------

The keyword in a response line specifies what your RAS client does with the
responses it receives from the remote computer.

The response strings your RAS client receives from the remote device or online
service can be used with one of the following keywords in response lines:

OK= remote_device_response &lt;macro&gt;
----------------------------------

The OK keyword indicates that RAS can execute the next script line if the
condition on the right side of the equal sign is met.

LOOP= remote_device_response &lt;macro&gt;
------------------------------------

The LOOP keyword indicates to RAS to wait for a response that matches the
condition to the right of the equal sign and if that condition is met to wait
for the same response again. If a response does not meet the condition on the
right side of the equal sign RAS executes the next line.

CONNECT= remote_device_response &lt;macro&gt;
---------------------------------------

This keyword is used near the end of the script to indicate the end of the
script.

ERROR_NO_CARRIER= remote_device_response &lt;macro&gt;
------------------------------------------------

This keyword is used to test for the presence of a carrier. Intermediary devices
report their presence in different ways.

ERROR_DIAGNOSTICS= remote_device_response &lt;macro&gt;
-------------------------------------------------

This keyword can be used in conjunction with the &lt;Diagnostics&gt; macro to
allow RAS to display a message box containing a problem cause and diagnostic
information.

These response related keywords are usually clustered, but do not have to be.
CONNECT= is usually the last line, unless it is followed by an ERROR_ line. For
example:

  CONNECT=&lt;match&gt;" CONNECT"
  ERROR_NO_CARRIER=&lt;match&gt;"NO CARRIER"
  ERROR_DIAGNOSTICS=&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&lt;Diagnostics&gt;
  ERROR_DIAGNOSTICS=&lt;lf&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&lt;Diagnostics&gt;

NORESPONSE
----------

The RAS client always expects a response from the remote device. The client waits
until a response is received unless a NoResponse statement follows the COMMAND=
line. If there is no statement for a response following a COMMAND= line, the
COMMAND= line still executes, but the script does not execute any further.

RESERVED MACRO KEYWORDS
-----------------------

The following table explains the function of each reserved macro keyword:

  Macro           Function
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  &lt;cr&gt;            Inserts a carriage return.

  &lt;lf&gt;            Inserts a line feed.

  &lt;match&gt;         Reports a match if the string enclosed in quotation
                  marks is found in the device response. For example,
                  &lt;match&gt;"Smith" matches Jane Smith and John Smith III.

  &lt;?&gt;             Inserts a wildcard character. For example, CO&lt;?&gt;&lt;?&gt;2
                  matches COOL2 or COAT2, but not COOL3.

  &lt;hXX&gt;           Allows any hexadecimal character to appear in a string
                  including the zero byte, &lt;h00&gt;.
                  NOTE: XX represents hexadecimal digits.

  &lt;ignore&gt;        Ignores the rest of a response from the macro. For
                  example, &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;CONNECTV-&lt;ignore&gt; reads the following
                  responses as the same: "crlfCONNECTV-1.1" and
                  "crlfCONNECTV-2.3."

                  If a lot of information is ignored, like a large welcome
                  banner, RAS might time out and move on to the next
                  script line. This usually causes problems. To avoid this
                  problem, use multiple pairs of COMMAND= followed by
                  OK=&lt;ignore&gt; to force RAS to wait longer and ignore
                  additional response stings. For example:

                     COMMAND=
                     OK=&lt;ignore&gt;

                     COMMAND=
                     OK=&lt;ignore&gt;

  &lt;diagnostics&gt;   This macro function can be used in conjunction with the
                  ERROR_DIAGNOSITICS= keyword macro to allow RAS to
                  display a message box containing a problem cause and
                  diagnostic information.

ACTIVATING SWITCH.INF SCRIPTS
-----------------------------

You can configure a RAS entry to run a SWITCH.INF script before dialing, after
dialing, or both. For example, to automate the task of logging onto a remote
host, create the script in the SWITCH.INF file and then configure the RAS entry
to use the created script after dialing.

To activate a script in Windows NT and Windows for Workgroups version 3.11:

1. Run Remote Access and select an entry.

2. Choose the Edit button.

3. If the Security button is not available, choose the Advanced button.

4. Choose the Security button. (In Windows NT 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups
  3.11 the button is labeled Switch).

5. In the After Dialing box, select the name of the script. The section header
  in the SWITCH.INF file is what appears as the name of the script. (In Windows
  NT 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 this box is labeled Post-Connect).

6. Choose the OK button until you return to the main Remote Access Screen.

When you dial this entry, the selected script runs after RAS dials and connects
to the remote host.

Troubleshooting Scripts using DEVICE.LOG and RAS Terminal
---------------------------------------------------------

Before writing scripts to automate the process of logging onto an intermediary
device, use the RAS Terminal feature to familiarize yourself with the logon
sequence of events. For more information on activating the RAS Terminal feature,
refer to the "Configuring Windows RAS to Use RAS Terminal After Dialing" section
below.

To find errors that prevent your scripts from working, log all information passed
between RAS, the modem, and the intermediary device (including errors reported
by the intermediary device) by turning on logging.

After you enable logging, the DEVICE.LOG file is created (when you start RAS) in
the Windows NT %systemroot%\SYSTEM32\RAS subdirectory or the of Windows for
Workgroups \WINDOWS directory.

If an error is encountered during script execution, execution halts. Determine
the problem by looking at any RAS error messages you receive and by looking at
the DEVICE.LOG file. Make necessary corrections to the script and then restart
RAS.

The DEVICE.LOG file appends any communication as long as RAS is not restarted. If
you restart RAS, the DEVICE.LOG file is erased and re- created. Therefore, if
you make changes to SWITCH.INF during your script development that require you
to restart RAS, and you wish to save the current traces contained in the
DEVICE.LOG file, rename the DEVICE.LOG file before starting RAS again.

ENABLING LOGGING AND CREATING A DEVICE.LOG FILE
-----------------------------------------------

To enabling logging and creating a DEVICE.LOG file under Windows NT:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Hang up any connections, and exit from Remote Access.

2. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

3. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parametersm

4. Change the value of the Logging parameter to 1. For example:

  Logging:REG_DWORD:0x1

Logging begins when you restart Remote Access or start the Remote Access Server
service (if your computer is receiving calls). You do not need to shutdown and
restart Windows NT.

To enabling logging and creating a DEVICE.LOG file under Windows for Workgroups:

1. Using a text editor such as Windows Notepad, edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

2. In the [Remote Access] section, add the following line:

  " LOGGING=1. " (without the quotation marks)

3. Save the file.

The DEVICE.LOG text file is created in the Windows directory when you restart
Windows and RAS.

CONFIGURING WINDOWS RAS TO USE RAS TERMINAL AFTER DIALING
---------------------------------------------------------

To configure a Windows NT RAS 3.5 or later entry to use Terminal after dialing:

1. In Remote Access, select an entry.

2. Choose the Edit button.

3. If the Security button is not available, choose the Advanced button.

4. Choose the Security button. (In Windows NT 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups
  3.11 this button is labeled Switch).

5. In the After Dialing field, select Terminal. (In Windows NT 3.1 and Windows
  for Workgroups 3.11 this is labeled Post-Connect).

6. Choose the OK button until you return to the main Remote Access Screen.

CREATING ONE SCRIPT FOR MULTIPLE SITUATIONS
-------------------------------------------

A company with employees working at different locations may need to provide
employees with the ability to log on to an X.25 service from various locations.
The RAS script language does not provide any IF/ENDIF, IF/ELSE/ENDIF, or GOTO
statements. Therefore, you cannot test for logical responses or errors received
from intermediary devices (such as X.25 providers or third party security hosts)
and then branch off to a different execution path. However, the script language
does allow you to catch errors and display them on the screen using:

  ERROR_DIAGNOSTICS=&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lt&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&lt;lt&gt;&lt;Diagnostics&gt;

To provide a variety of RAS clients with an X.25 or other script you need to
write several scripts to manage all local logon dialog variations. For example:

  If you have a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client or Microsoft RAS 1.1
  client, set an environment variable to a value representing the local X.25
  carrier. Then run a batch file that copies the correct script to the file
  name PAD.INF or SWITCH.INF (depending on the value of the environment
  variable) and then start Windows.

  If you have a Windows NT RAS client, create an icon that runs a similar batch
  file that tests the environment variable and then calls RAS. All scripts can
  be provided on one disk and all the user has to do is copy the files to a
  directory on their hard drive and set the environment variable. This can be
  automated as well to minimize user interaction.

USING SCRIPTS WITH OTHER MICROSOFT RAS CLIENTS
----------------------------------------------

Microsoft RAS version 1.0 does not have the capability to invoke RAS Terminal or
use scripts in .INF files. Upgrades to RAS 1.1a are free. Microsoft RAS version
1.1 and 1.1a support only PAD.INF files. The syntax used in the PAD.INF file
differs slightly from subsequent versions of Microsoft RAS. Microsoft RAS for
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, Windows NT version 3.1, and Windows NT
version 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0 support RAS Terminal and scripts in SWITCH.INF and
PAD.INF files. Windows NT 4.0 supports a new script language in addition to the
old one. The new language is more sophisticated and supports subroutines and If,
While, and Goto statements, and more.
