The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft WinG API, used with:
   - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
   - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

BitBlt(), WinGBitBlt(), StretchBlt(), and WinGStretchBlt(), can all be used to
move bits in an image from one DC to another. However, there are different
restrictions on what the source and destination DC can be for each of the
functions. In addition, the platform that the application is running on also
affects what the source and destination DCs can be.

Possible Source and Destination DC Combinations
-----------------------------------------------

The following two tables list some of the possible source and destination DC
combinations for each function:

The following two tables apply to:

- 16-bit Windows-based application running under Windows version 3.1.

  -or-

- 32-bit Windows-based application running under Windows version 3.1 with
  Win32s.

  BitBlt(), StretchBlt()

     From                 To: WinGDC    To: Screen/Memory DC
     -------------------------------------------------------
     WinGDC               Yes           *No
     Screen/Memory DC     *No           Yes

    *On a memory DC, the blt's return value will indicate success
     but the function will not perform as expected.

  WinGBitBlt(), WinGStretchBlt()

     From                 To: WinGDC    To: Screen/Memory DC
     -------------------------------------------------------
     WinGDC               No            Yes (screen only)
     Screen/Memory DC     No            No

The following two tables apply to:

- 16-bit or 32-bit Windows-based application running under Windows NT or
  Windows 95:

  BitBlt(), StretchBlt()

     From                 To: WinGDC    To: Screen/Memory DC
     -------------------------------------------------------
     WinGDC               Yes           Yes
     Screen/Memory DC     Yes           Yes

  WinGBitBlt(), WinGStretchBlt()

     From                 To: WinGDC    To: Screen/Memory DC
     ----------------------------------------------------
     WinGDC               Yes           Yes
     Screen/Memory DC     Yes           Yes

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mixing GDI and WinG
-------------------

There are two ways to use GDI and WinG together. You can mix GDI and custom
drawing operations into WinGBitmaps, and you can mix GDI operations and WinG
blts to the screen. Both have their caveats.

Drawing into WinGBitmaps
------------------------

WinG allows drawing onto the DIB surface of a WinGDC with GDI, but there are some
anomalies to keep in mind.

- Most importantly, GDI does NOT regard WinGDCs as palette devices. WinGDCs are
  actually 256-color RGB devices. You can modify the device color table using
  the WinGSetDIBColorTable API.

- Drawing with GDI on a WinGDC surface does not always produce a pixel-perfect
  duplicate of the image you would see using GDI on a display device. The
  images will be acceptably similar, but some stray pixels will remain if you
  XOR the two images together.

- Brushes realized in a WinGDC will be aligned to the upper-left corner of the
  WinGDC whereas brushes used in screen DCs are aligned to the upper-left
  corner of the screen. This means that when you blt a WinGDC that has been
  filled with a pattern into a screen DC that has been filled with the same
  pattern, the patterns will not necessarily align correctly.

  If you have this problem, you can either change the brush origins and
  re-realize the brushes in either DC (see the section "1.6.8 Brush Alignment"
  in the Windows SDK Programmer's Reference Volume 1, also available on the
  Microsoft Developer Network CD) or you can make off-screen brushes align
  correctly with on-screen brushes by blting the WinGDC to a brush-aligned
  position on the screen. For example, an 8x8 brush pattern can be correctly
  aligned to the screen by blting the WinGDC to an x, y position when x and y
  are both multiples of 8.

- BitBlt does not blt between DCs owned by different devices. You can't blt
  from a Printer DC to a Display DC, for example. A WinGDC is a new type of
  device context, and just as with other DCs, you can't use BitBlt to blt
  between a WinGDC and any other type of DC (such as a WinGDC to a Display DC
  or a Memory DC to a WinGDC). To blt from a WinGDC to a DisplayDC, use
  WinGBitBlt or WinGStretchBlt. Again, you can't use BitBlt to blt from a
  Display DC to a WinGDC on Windows version 3.x or Win32s, and you can only use
  WinGBitBlt or WinGStretchBlt to blt from a WinGDC to the screen.

  To blt from the screen into a WinGDC on Windows version 3.x, you will need to
  create a compatible bitmap, BitBlt the screen rectangle into this bitmap, and
  then GetDIBits from the bitmap into the WinGDC's DIB surface. On Windows 95
  and Windows NT version 3.5, BitBlt into a WinGDC will work properly.

  Win32-based applications that use GDI and custom drawing routines to draw on
  the surface of a WinGBitmap should call GDIFlush after calling GDI functions
  and before calling custom functions. Win32 GDI batches drawing commands,
  including WinGBitBlt and WinGStretchBlt. This guarantees that all GDI drawing
  is completed before custom drawing begins. Without this call, drawing may be
  done in an incorrect order.

Drawing to the Screen
---------------------

Win32-based applications should call GDIFlush after blting to the screen from a
WinGDC.
