SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to rebuild a Microsoft Mail Postoffice Address List
(POL). This may be necessary when the Postoffice Address List is corrupt and
cannot be repaired by other means.

This article requires the Microsoft Mail Database Maintenance Utilities document,
which contains utilities used to repair and maintain the database for Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks. The procedures described in the document apply to versions
2.1 and later of Microsoft Mail, except where noted.

To obtain the document containing the Database Maintenance Utilites, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q99419 PC DB: Database Maintenance Utilities [Complete]

To obtain this document directly, you can download it at the following location:

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The resetting of group files can be automated. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q129500 Automating the Resetting of Group Files using GIMPORT

Following are the steps to rebuild the Post Office List. The steps assume that
all of the programs are run from the same directory(except ACCTONME.EXE, which
must be run from the root of the Post Office). Also, the steps assume that the
M:\ drive is mapped to the affected Post Office.

1. Backup your complete Mail postoffice. You do not need to backup the MMF
  directory.

  It is recommended that the following steps be done when there are no users
  logged in or instances of the EXTERNAL.EXE program working against your
  production postoffice, and no changes are made to the production postoffice
  via the ADMIN.EXE program.

  The following steps make use of two programs: GIMPORT.EXE and ACCTONME.EXE.
  These programs are part of the Database Maintenance Utilities Application
  Note. Please read the documentation for both of these utilities before
  proceeding. The documentation is part of the Application Note. Also, if
  GIMPORT.EXE is run from a directory, which contains GROUPS.TXT or
  GRPUSERS.DAT, remove those files.

2. GIMPORT ADMIN -Ppassword -Ddrive -FGROUPS.TXT -I -X -Q -LGIMPORT.LOG

  This extracts group information to two files (Groups.txt and Grpusers.dat) to
  the current directory.

  NOTE: Verify that there is valid information in these files before proceeding.
  If not, or if Admin.nme is empty, restore from backup first, repeat step 2,
  and then finish the process if information appears in the text files that
  were created. If group information never appears, you have to read the groups
  manually.

3. GIMPORT ADMIN -Ppassword -Ddrive -R

  This will reset the ADMIN.GRP and ADMINSHD.GRP to 8 bytes and GROUP.GLB and
  GRPMEM.GLB to 4 byte files.

4. REN M:\NME\ADMIN.NME M:\NME\ADMIN.BAK

  This will backup the Post Office List.

5. TYPE "NUL &gt; M:\NME\ADMIN.NME" (without the quotation marks)

  This will create an empty Post Office List.

6. ACCTONME.EXE

  Run this from the root of the PO, so that it sees all 19 Post Office
  subdirectories. This will create a new version of the Post Office List based
  on information in the local mail accounts files(ACCESS*.GLB).

7. COPY M:\NME\ADMIN.NME M:\NME\ADMINSHD.NME

  This will copy the Post Office List to its shadow file.

8. IMPORT ADMIN -Ddrive -Ppassword -FGRPUSERS.DAT -A

  This will add the extracted external user information from the file
  GRPUSERS.DAT, which was created in the second step, back into the Post Office
  List.

9. GIMPORT ADMIN -Ddrive -Ppassword -FGROUPS.TXT -LGIMPORT.LOG -V

  This will add the extracted group information from the file GROUPS.TXT, which
  was created in the second step, back into the Post Office List.

10. Groups on the affected PO must be modified to participate in dirsync,
  regardless of former participation. This can be done by running the Mail
  Administrator program, selecting the Local Admin - Groups - Modify command
  and selecting Enter through each prompt until asked, "Include in group in
  Directory Synchronization?". Select "Yes". In order for the Global Address
  List to reflect changes made to the Post Office List, REBUILD.EXE -F -Ddrive
  must be run. In order for remote users to see updated address lists, run
  ADMIN.EXE and select the Remote - Regenerate command. Remote users must then
  update their address lists.
