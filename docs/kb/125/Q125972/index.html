MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

How to Install Practice Files to Hard Disk Drives Other Than Drive C
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation for "Windows 3.1 Step by Step" is not designed to look for
drives or directories other than C:\WINDOWS.

Comments:

To change the destination drive or directory, perform the following steps:

1. To exit Windows, switch to Program Manager, and from the File menu, choose
  Exit.

2. Insert the original practice disk in your floppy disk drive.

3. At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

  " edit &lt;drive&gt;:\install.ini " (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the original practice
  disk.

  The MS-DOS Editor appears. Normally, 3 lines of text will be displayed.

4. Move the cursor to the first line of text.

5. Change the first line to alter the default installation destination.

  For example, to make the practice files install to a WINDOWS directory located
  on the D drive, modify the first line as follows:

  " D:\WINDOWS " (without the quotation marks)

6. After you make your changes, choose Exit from the File menu and then choose
  Yes to save changes.

  This will return you to the MS-DOS prompt.

7. Type "WIN" (without the quotation marks) to return to Windows, and follow the
  instructions in the book to install the practice files.

Step by Step Disk Doesn't Provide Icon or Executable Program
------------------------------------------------------------

The instructions for installing the practice disk are clear. However, after the
disk is installed, you return to Windows Program Manager, where you are given no
further messages or directions as to what to do next.

Correction:

In the last paragraph on page xii, the following sentence should be inserted
between the third and final sentences:

  These practice files will be used and referred to in many of the later
  lessons (beginning with Lesson 8). You will need only Microsoft Windows for
  the first lessons, so don't be concerned that there are no additional icons
  in Windows for this book.

Comments:

The installation program copies the practice files to your hard disk. To access
these files, you need to start the appropriate Microsoft Windows applications
and use the appropriate commands to open a file. The lessons in this book will
provide the exact steps necessary to open these files.

The intent of the practice files disk is for you to use the files as you work
through the lessons in the book. Lessons 1 through 7 teach the fundamentals of
using Windows and its many features. These first lessons do not require practice
files. Beginning with Lesson 8, you will need to use the practice files.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. Later printings may already contain most or all of the
above corrections.
