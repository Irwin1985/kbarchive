-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run DEINSTAL.BAT on a Windows for Workgroups SMS client machine and
Logon at Startup is not selected, the following message appears:

  Your machine has successfully been prepared for deinstallation. Microsoft SMS
  will be deinstalled the next time you start Windows. Phase 1 of Client
  de-install complete. If this is a Windows machine, you must start or restart
  Windows now for the deinstallation to complete.

The next time you start Windows for Workgroups, SMS is not removed.

However, the next time you start Windows for Workgroups, choose the Log On/Off
icon in the Network group, and log on, a similar message appears. Neither the
SMS nor program groups are removed. In addition, the applications specified on
the SMSRUN16.INI autostart line are not run.

CAUSE
=====

SMS does not display a dialog box asking the user to logon when it detects that
the Windows for Workgroups machine is not logged on.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Networks icons.

2. Choose Startup.

3. Select Log On at Startup.

4. Choose OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run DEINSTAL.BAT or UPGRADE.BAT, Client Setup flags the SMS.INI file to
indicate that SMS needs to do one or more of the following:

- Install a new client component.

- Remove a client component.

- Complete client upgrade.

- Remove the client.

When Windows is restarted, SMSRUN16/32 checks the SMS.INI file. If SMS determines
in needs to perform one of the previously mentioned tasks, it connects to the
logon server and launches SMSSRV16/32. SMSRUN16/32 then calls Client Setup to do
the actual installation or removal of files. When Client Setup is done,
SMSSRV16/32 processes the SMSRUN*.INI file and loads the applications to be
automatically started.

SMS uses this sequence because SMSRUN16/32 has to ensure that none of the SMS
client components, including itself, are running while Client Setup tries to
delete or overwrite their files.

Additional query words: sms prodsms section SMS.INI SetupPhase=deinstall [WorkstationStatus] (CLI_DOS, CLI_NT) deinstall autostarted deinstalled
