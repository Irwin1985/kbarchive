- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes and explains the differences in behavior between the
three Runtime Evaluation tools provided by the FoxPro language: "&amp;" (macro
substitution), "()" (name expression), and the "EVALUATE()" function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Language Reference" guide specifies that EVALUATE() and name expressions
should be used instead of macro substitution because they run faster. However,
it does not explain why this is so.

Macro Substitution
------------------

Macro substitution is just what it is called. A run-time "macro" is built into
the tokenized code to evaluate the expression at runtime. The compiler inserts
some compiling-linking code into the application, and when the code is run,
on-the-fly compilation and linking takes place to tokenize the expression before
executing it. This is highly inefficient for two reasons:

- It increases the size of applications because the mini-compiler code has to
  be built for each expression to evaluate.

- It decreases execution speed because of the overhead incurred by the
  on-the-fly compilation.

Macro substitution is still supported for backwards compatibility purposes, and
because it is still popular with many xBase developers. The only situation where
macro substitution is still required is when the expression to evaluate contains
the command to be executed, in whole or in part, as in the following code
examples:

  cClauses=" * FROM CUSTOMER WHERE cno='A'"
     SELECT &amp;cClauses

  -or-

  cResetMenu="SET SYSMENU TO DEFAULT"
     &amp;cResetMenu

Name Expression
---------------

This is the preferred method for referencing FoxPro components that can be named,
like windows, menus, popups, and files (including screens, menus, and reports)
in the commands that run them, as in the following examples:

  cWindowName="test"
     DEFINE WINDOW (cWindowName) FROM 1,1 TO 20,50 SYSTEM

  cScreen="Myscreen.spr"
     DO (cScreen)

  cReport="Myreport.frx"
     REPORT FORM (cReport) PREVIEW ENVIRONMENT

Name expression compilation is optimized and does not require the creation of any
"lookup" code, which makes it much more efficient than macro substitution.
However, the limited scope of name expressions (they can only be used to
evaluate variables used to name FoxPro components) required that another tool be
used for evaluation of variables under other circumstances.

EVALUATE()
----------

This function is, like every FoxPro function and command, built into the language
library and therefore more efficient than macro substitutions because there is
no need for on-the-fly compilation. EVALUATE() can be used to return the values
of expressions anywhere in the code, except when name expressions are required
(see above). Typically, this function is used to retrieve sorting, filtering, or
querying information from the user at runtime, as the following example
illustrates:

     cCondition="CNO='A'"
     @ 2,2 SAY "Type filter condition for appending records or hit &lt;ENTER&gt;:";
        GET cCondition VALID CHECK()
     READ
     USE customer
     APPEND FROM customer FOR EVALUATE(cCondition)

     FUNCTION CHECK
     * Validation code for expressions typed
     RETURN .t. &amp;&amp; or .f.

Special Considerations
----------------------

EVALUATE() VS. MACRO SUBSTITUTION IN LOOPING CONDITION:

Consider the following syntax:

     USE customer
     cCondition = "CNO='A'"
     SCAN FOR &lt;condition&gt;
        * Processing code here&gt;
     ENDSCAN

In the above example, if &amp;cCondition is used as the condition, the loop will
process one record only, because the condition is evaluated only when the
mini-compiler executes on-the-fly. Instead, the condition should be
"EVALUATE(cCondition)" (without the quotation marks), because EVALUATE() can be
called repeatedly because it is a native FoxPro function.

CODE OPTIMIZATION:

To speed up run-time execution, developers usually reduce the number of lines in
their code, thinking that if the size in memory is reduced, the application will
execute faster. For example, the following would be a valid optimization:

     * Original code
     ...
     IF CHECK() == .t.
        WAIT WINDOW "This is the customer we're looking for"
     ENDIF

     FUNCTION CHECK
     PRIVATE lRetVal

     IF cno == 'A1592'
        lRetval = .t.
     ELSE
        lRetVal = .f.
     ENDIF

     RETURN lRetVal

     * Optimized code
     IF CHECK()
        WAIT WINDOW "This is the customer we're looking for"
     ENDIF

     FUNCTION CHECK
     RETURN (cno=='A1592')

While it is true that reducing the size of the code in memory generally helps
speed up the code at runtime, it is not always true that reducing the number of
lines reduces the size of the application in memory, especially when using macro
substitution, because of the extra code that is built in by the compiler. Also,
even if the application size in memory is reduced, the overhead incurred during
macro evaluation slows the execution down anyway. The following example
illustrates this:

     * Original code
     * Parameter is numeric, determines which order to use
     FUNCTION CustSort
     PARAMETERS nSortType

     DO CASE
     CASE nSortType == 1
        SELECT * FROM customer ORDER BY cno
     CASE nSortType == 2
        SELECT * FROM customer ORDER BY contact
     CASE nSortType == 3
        SELECT * FROM customer ORDER BY company
     OTHERWISE
        SELECT * FROM customer
     END CASE

     RETURN .t.

     * Optimized code (but it will most likely not run faster)
     * Parameter is character string, contains 'order by' clause
     FUNCTION CustSort
     PARAMETERS cOrderBy

     IF !EMPTY(cOrderBy)
        SELECT * FROM customer &amp;cOrderBy
     ELSE
        SELECT * FROM customer
     ENDIF

     RETURN .t.

Note that these optimization concepts are fairly irrelevant with simplistic
examples like these. In a real-world application, the speed difference will be
more noticeable. OVERLAPPING OF USAGE: In some instances, EVALUATE() and name
expressions can be interchanged. In this case, there is no preferred method,
although it would help the developer to use name expressions whenever possible
for consistency's sake. Here is a situation where either method is acceptable:

     cProc="Myproc.prg"
     DO (cProc)   &amp;&amp; or DO EVALUATE("cProc")

Although macro substitution could also be used here, its use is not demonstrated
because of the reasons explained previously: speed, efficiency, and consistency.
