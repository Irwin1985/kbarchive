The information in this article applies to:

- MSPRESS Microsoft Works 3 for Windows Step by Step ISBN 1-55615-645-6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press Book "Microsoft Works 3 for Windows Step by
Step."

The following topics are covered:

- Page 6: Boxes and Other Garbage Characters in Practice Document

- Step by Step Disk Doesn't Provide Icon or Executable Program

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the error or comment, there are sometimes
additional sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comment" section contains
specific information for working around problems.

Page 6: Boxes and Other Garbage Characters in Practice Document
---------------------------------------------------------------

When you open a practice document, the file that appears has lots of box
characters, Greek and symbol characters, and other nonsense.

Correction:

On page 6, step 4 after the graphic, add the following text:

  " Note: Please refer to Using the Practice Files on page 267 of this book if
  the file displays many square boxes and other garbage characters. " (without
  the quotation marks)

On page 267, under the heading "Using the Practice Files," add the following
paragraph before the existing text:

  " The practice files require Microsoft Works 3 or later to display properly.
  To check your version of Works, start Works (as shown on page xvii) and
  select About Microsoft Works from the Help menu. The resulting dialog box
  will show the program name and version number. Works version 2 or earlier
  needs to be upgraded to the latest version. Contact your local software store
  for information on upgrading Microsoft Works. " (without the quotation marks)

Comments:

This problem is caused by opening the Works 3.0 practice file with a previous
version of Microsoft Works.

  NOTE: Similar file problems will occur if Works for MS-DOS is used instead of
  Works for Windows.

To verify which version of Microsoft Works you are using, do the following:

1. Start Microsoft Works (as described on page xvii) if it is not already
  running.

2. From the Help menu, choose About Microsoft Works.

  The Dialog box that appears will contain the program name AND version number.
  Check to make sure it is version 3.0 or later. If the version is 2.x or
  earlier, you will need to upgrade your version of Works in order to properly
  use this book and the practice files.

Contact a software retail store or call the Microsoft Sales Information Center
for more information about upgrading.

Step by Step Disk Doesn't Provide Icon or Executable Program
------------------------------------------------------------

The instructions for installing the practice disk are clear; however, after you
install the disk, the system returns to Windows without any messages or
directions on what to do next.

Comments:

The installation program copies the practice files to the hard drive. To access
these files, you need to start Microsoft Works and use the appropriate commands
to open a file. This book will provide the exact steps necessary to open these
files in many of the lessons.

The intent is for you to continue reading and to open the files when instructed
by the book lessons. As the book implies, you will need Microsoft Works 3.0 in
order to properly use the lessons and practice files.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed in this article are ready for inclusion in
future printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
