- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of Nature for Windows, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of People for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Explorapedia, you may not be able to hear Tad's narration, although you can
hear other sounds, such as those associated with transitions and hot spots.

CAUSE
=====

8-Bit Compressed Sounds
-----------------------

This problem occurs because most of the sounds in Explorapedia are 8-bit
uncompressed sounds. Tad's voice, however, consists of 8-bit compressed sound.
Compressed sound requires specific sound driver software to decompress it prior
to playback. See the "8-Bit Compressed Sounds Solution" section below for a
resolution.

"S" Missing on Win.ini MCI Extensions
-------------------------------------

Sometimes Tad's voice is not heard because there is no "s" on MCI Extension(s) in
the Win.ini file. AutoDesk Animations, a third-party program, deletes the "s" on
MCI Extension(s) in Win.ini, so Explorapedia does not recognize the MCI section
in the Win.ini file. See the "Missing 'S' Solution" section below for a
resolution.

RESOLUTION
==========

Missing "S" Solution
--------------------

If the "s" is missing on the MCI Extensions section of Win.ini, replace it using
a text editor such as Notepad to edit your Win.ini file. For more information
about editing your Win.ini file, see you Windows online Help.

8-Bit Compressed Sounds Solution
--------------------------------

Check to see if Tad's voice has been turned off. Tad's voice can be turned on and
off by clicking on Settings in the Spaceship, then click Sounds, then click
Tad's Voice.

If Tad's voice is set to On in Settings, and you still can't hear his voice, use
the following steps to resolve the problem:

1. Verify that the [MCI] Sound driver is installed in the Drivers Control Panel.
  If it is not there, install it.

  For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your
  Windows printed documentation or online Help.

2. If Step 1 does not resolve the problem, please see the following article in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q121132 MSACM 2.0: Compressed Audio Will Not Play

3. If Step 1 or 2 does not resolve the problem, please see the following article
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q106549 Compressed Audio Doesn't Play on Sound Blaster Card

After following the above instructions, you should be able to run Explorapedia
and hear Tad's narration.
