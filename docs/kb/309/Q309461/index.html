-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines a cumulative list of Microsoft software that either
requires or may use Internet Information Services (IIS). This list will help you
to identify an IIS server that needs to be patched in order to be protected from
security vulnerabilities and possible worm viruses, such as Code Red or the
Nimda virus.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article is for general purposes and is not intended for detailed
information regarding how these applications work with IIS. This article also
specifies whether IIS is required or optional for each listed product.

Windows 2000:
-------------

- Microsoft Proxy Server (Required): This product requires that IIS already be
  installed because key components of Proxy Server install into the IIS
  metabase. This includes Proxy Server 2.0.

- Microsoft Exchange Server 2000 (Required): Exchange 2000 requires that not
  only IIS, but also specific services such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
  (SMTP) and Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) be installed. If these
  services are not installed, Exchange 2000 fails to install.

- Microsoft Site Server 3.0, Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition (Required): This
  application uses the basic Web publishing functionality that is provided by
  IIS. If IIS is not installed, neither the legacy Site Server 3.0 nor the new
  Commerce Server 2000 install.

- Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server 2000 (Required): The purpose of SharePoint
  is to provide Web collaboration and management of documents. The underlying
  component that drives SharePoint is IIS.

- SharePoint Team Services from Microsoft (Required): Also known as the Office
  Web Server, this product requires that IIS already be installed.

- Microsoft Small Business Server (Required): This product requires IIS because
  its management interface is an application within IIS.

- Microsoft Passport Software Development Kit (SDK) (Required): This product
  requires that IIS already be installed.

- Microsoft Application Center 2000 (Required): This application uses
  load-balancing technology and Web publishing features that were first
  introduced into the Site Server line of products. It copies metabase and COM+
  components to multiple cluster nodes. This product requires IIS already be
  installed.

- Microsoft BizTalk Server 2000 (Required): BizTalk uses Web Distributed
  Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) and also creates a virtual directory within
  IIS. This application allows heterogeneous systems to interface with a common
  language.

- Microsoft Commercial Internet Server (MCIS) 2.0 and later (Required): This
  product provides integral integration for Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

- Microsoft Mobile Information Server 2000 (Required): IIS is the backbone of
  this product.

- Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) 2000 (Required): This product is a
  centralized manager for all Microsoft products that are running within an
  enterprise.

- Microsoft Content Management Server 2001 (Required): This product extends IIS
  functionality and requires the use of IIS and Microsoft SQL Server in order
  to install properly.

- Microsoft Certificate Server versions 1.0 and 2.0 (Optional): It is possible
  to create and issue digital certificates without having IIS installed.
  However, some installations of Certificate Services may accidentally install
  IIS as well. For example, Certificate Services 1.0 is installed from the NT
  Option Pack and thus may install IIS 4.0. In Certificate Services 2.0, the
  installation is separate from IIS, but its underlying function is to produce
  certificates for use with IIS or Exchange.

- Microsoft Project Central (Optional): If you are using the Web component
  piece of Project Central, IIS must be installed. However, this involves
  special setup requirements and does not run on every client computer.

- Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (Optional): IIS is not required with a standard
  installation, but IIS is required if the optional SQL Extensible Markup
  Language (XML) Support in IIS is installed.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

1. Microsoft Commercial Internet Server (MCIS) 2.0 and later (Required): This
  product provides integral integration for ISPs.

2. Microsoft Passport SDK (Required): This product requires that IIS already be
  installed.

3. Microsoft Proxy Server (Required): This product requires that IIS already be
  installed, because key components of Proxy Server install into the IIS
  metabase. This includes Proxy Server 2.0.

4. Microsoft Site Server 3.0, Site Server Commerce Edition (Required): This
  legacy product requires that IIS already be installed.

5. Microsoft Proxy 2.0 (Required): This product requires that IIS already be
  installed because key components of Proxy Server install into the IIS
  metabase. This includes Proxy Server 2.0.

6. Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS) 4.5 (or NTOP applied to SBS 4.0)
  (Required): The management interface for this product is Web-based and
  requires that IIS be installed.

7. Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise Edition (Optional): If you are
  designing Web applications using the tools that are included in Visual
  Studio, IIS may be installed on the computer on which Visual Studio is
  installed.

8. FrontPage Server Extensions from Microsoft (Optional): When Web publishing is
  required, such as when you are using FrontPage or Visual InterDev publishing
  feature, IIS must first be installed and working.

9. Microsoft Exchange 5.5 (Optional): Exchange 5.5 does not require IIS unless
  you are using Exchange's Outlook Web Access (OWA). If OWA is needed or
  Exchange is installed on a server on which IIS is already installed, Exchange
  interacts with IIS.
