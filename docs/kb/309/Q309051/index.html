   - How to Troubleshoot ASP in IIS 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes the troubleshooting steps to take if ASP
(Active Server Pages) stops responding on an Internet Information Services (IIS)
5.0 Web server. The platform may be any version of Windows 2000.

How to Troubleshoot ASP in IIS 5.0
----------------------------------

NOTE: Before you begin, ensure that .html or .htm files open on the Web server in
question. If these files do not open, this is not an ASP issue.

1. If a Global.asa file exists in the root of your Web site, rename it as
  Global.old, stop and restart the Web services, and then create a test ASP
  page in Notepad with the following code:

  &lt;%
  Response.Write "This is a test ASP page."
  %&gt;

Save this file as Test.asp in the root of your Web site, and try to open the file
on the Web server.

If ASP pages load in your Web browser after you have performed this step, the
problem is with the Global.asa file. If ASP pages still do not load, proceed to
step 2.

For additional information on troubleshooting the Global.asa file, click the
article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288245 PRB: Global.asa Does Not Fire from Personal Web Server on Windows 98

  Q265275 FP2000: Global.asa Does Not Run in FrontPage Web

  Q173742 FIX: Global.asa Is Not Executed If Restricting Web Access

2. Set the application protection for the Web site to Low and stop and restart
  the IISAdmin service. If ASP pages load in your Web browser after you have
  performed this step, the issue is with the IWAM account, and you can proceed
  to step 3. If ASP pages still do not load, check Component Services in
  Administrative Tools to ensure that you can view the IIS packages. This
  ensures that Component Services is not failing. Make sure the following users
  exist in the local Users group:

   - NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users

   - NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE

For more information on troubleshooting the Component Services snap-in, see the
following Knowledge Base article:

  Q301919 PRB: Cannot Expand 'My Computer' in Component Services MMC Snap-In

3. If ASP pages load in your Web browser after you have performed step 2, set
  the site back to Medium or High application protection, and add the IWAM
  account to the local Administrators group. If ASP pages load in your Web
  browser after you have performed this step, a permissions issue involving the
  IWAM account exists, and you can proceed to step 4. If ASP pages still do not
  load, run the Synciwam.vbs utility from a command line. To do this, open a
  command prompt and type " C:\Inetpub\adminscripts&gt;cscript synciwam.vbs"
  (without the quotation marks).

For additional information on situations in which the IWAM user account causes
ASP to fail, see the following Knowledge Base articles:

  Q308622 HOW TO: Perform Administration Tasks in IIS from a Command Prompt

  Q297989 PRB: Configured Identity Is Incorrect for IWAM Account

  Q255770 PRB: Logon Failure: Unknown User Name or Bad Password When You Run
  Out-of-Process Webs

  Q236007 Domain Controller Demotion Causes Out-of-Process Applications to Fail

4. To resolve permissions issues with the IWAM account, use the Regmon and
  Filemon third-party products for Windows 2000. To download these these
  utilities, see the following Web site:

  http://www.sysinternals.com

  Run these utilities while you make a request for an ASP page, then search for
  "ACCDENIED" in Regmon and "FAILURE" in Filemon for the Dllhost.exe process.

  NOTE: Do not be alarmed if you see "access denied" for the Iexplore.exe
  (Microsoft Internet Explorer) process. This is common behavior.

  For more information on the minimum permissions that are required for IIS to
  function properly, see the following Knowledge Base article:

  Q271071 Minimum NTFS Permissions Required for IIS 5.0 to Work

  After you have identified "access denied" error messages for the Dllhost.exe
  process, use Regedt32 to make any necessary modifications to NTFS permissions
  in the registry.

5. In the system event log, look for the following events:

  Source: DCOM Event ID: 10010 User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Description: The
  server {3D14228D-FBE1-11D0-995D-00C04FD919C1} did not register with DCOM
  within the required timeout.

This error message is followed in the event log by a warning message like the
following:

  Source: W3SVC Event ID: 36 User: N/A Description: The server failed to load
  application 'AppPath'. The error was 'Server execution failed'.

You may also see entries like the following in your %SystemRoot%\Iis5.log file:

  OC_ABOUT_TO_COMMIT_QUEUE:Unreg iis_core:FindModules: FindProcessByNameW
  failed!

If you receive these error messages, the NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users or NT
AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE entry has been removed from the Users group. To resolve
the problem, make sure that Authenticated Users and INTERACTIVE are members of
the Users Group for that computer.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q327153 PRB: ASP Pages Do Not Process and DCOM Event 10010 Appears in System
  Log

6. As a last resort, you can re-create the IIS packages. To do this, follow
  these steps:

  a. Browse to Component Services and delete the following packages:

      - IIS In-Process Applications

      - IIS Out-of-Process Pooled Applications

      - IIS Utilities

  b. Open a command prompt and switch to the following folder:

  %windir%\system32\inetsrv rundll32 wamreg.dll, CreateIISPackage

NOTE: CreateIISPackage must be typed exactly; it is case-sensitive.

  c. Close and reopen Component Services. You should see all three IIS COM+
     applications that have been recreated.

  d. Run IISRESET from a command line and test any ASP page that previously did
     not load correctly.
