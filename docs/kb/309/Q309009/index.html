MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 26: Change ISO to OSI
--------------------------

Change the first sentence on page 26 from:
"Your TCP/IP network protocol design focuses on the transport and network layers
of the International Standards Organization (ISO) model."

To:
"Your TCP/IP network protocol design focuses on the transport and network layers
of the Open-systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model."


Page 30: Change "Internet Domain" to "Interdomain"
--------------------------------------------------

On page 30, in the 5th bulleted item, change the text from:
"Determine the influence of Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) on
networking services designs"

To:
"Determine the influence of Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) on networking
services designs"


Page 40: Incorrect Subnet ID In Figure 2.11
-------------------------------------------

On page40, in Figure 2.11, in "Subnet Mask", change the third octet from "255" to
"240".


Page 46: Bits Should Be Bytes
-----------------------------

On page 46, in the first bulleted item,

Change:
"... rather than the first three bits of the IP address..."

To:
"... rather than the first three bytes of the IP address..."


Page 46: 25-bit Should Be 24-bit
--------------------------------

On page 46, in the first bulleted paragraph, change:

"25-bit"

To:
"24-bit"


Page 177: Routers Should Be Segments
------------------------------------

On page 177, in the third bullet,

Change:
"between Routers A, B, and C"

To:
"between Segments A, B, and C"


Page 441: Incorrect Text in Diagram 9.6
---------------------------------------

The right side of figure 9.6 on page 440 has the incorrect namespace in the
domain parent's box. The box currently reads "contoso.msft."

This should be changed to read "contoso-i.msft." to reflect the text and caption
comments for this diagram.


Page 572: Incorrect Heading
---------------------------

On page 572, change the 2nd heading on the page from:
"Determining the Placement of Remote Access Servers"

To:
"Determining the Number of Remote Access Servers"


Page 573: Incorrect Number Of Simultaneous Remote Users
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 573, in the second bulleted item, change:
"Up to 750 remote users..."

To:
"Up to 700 remote users..."


Page 578: Missing Word "information"
------------------------------------

On page 578, in the last line of the 4th text block, change:
"the remote access clients can receive all IP configuration provided by DHCP."

To:
"the remote access clients can receive all IP configuration information provided
by DHCP."


Page 824: Missing Answer To Question 4
--------------------------------------

On page 824, the answer to review question 4 on page 87 is missing. The missing
answer is:

"To ensure that the representatives can access the data, you can:

Add additional routers to provide redundant route paths in the event of a router
failure

Add additional connections between critical segments to provide redundant route
paths if a network segment becomes unavailable

Distribute the network traffic between the additional routers and connections, to
improve the response time of the Web-based applications."
