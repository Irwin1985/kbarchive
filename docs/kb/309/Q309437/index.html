-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client components may not be installed or
may not start on Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition,
Service Pack 4 (SP4), Service Pack 5 (SP5), or Service Pack 6 (SP6). The SMS
Control Panel tool lists most of the SMS components with a status of "Repair
pending" if the SMS client was already installed when Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition, SP4 or later was applied. If the SMS client was
installed after Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, SP4 or later was
installed, most of the components are missing from the Components tab.

The following log entries are likely to be recorded.

In the Apasetup.log file:

  The file \ISMIF32.dll could not be copied. Make sure that the disk is not
  full and the user has rights to the directory.

In the Ccim32.log file:

  Waiting for Process "i386\apasetup.exe /s" to finish... Process
  "i386\apasetup.exe /s" finished; exit code = 1. ** Base Component
  Installation Thread is finished ** Base install DLL finished. Base setup
  status value not set to installed

The Smsapm32.exe and Smsmon32.exe processes may also not be running.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, SP4 changed the way in which the
Windows folder is detected. SMS was not updated to handle this change.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next SMS service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this fix for SMS Service Pack 3 (SP3) sites
should have the following file attributes or later:

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based computers.

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the update file (Q309437.exe) and platform folders to the new folder.
  The folder structure must be such that the update file is located one folder
  "above" the platform folders.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console if it is running.

5. Run Q309437.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard.

Manual Installation:

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfix files to the new folder.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
