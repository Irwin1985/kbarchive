- You are using a non-standard pointer scheme.

- The video driver for your video adapter requires updating.

- The mouse drivers are outdated or corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order that they are
presented.

NOTE: The following steps are lengthy, so you may wish to print them before you
begin.

Method 1: Check the Minimum Video, Processor, and RAM Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that your computer exceeds the minimum video, processor, and RAM
requirements that you need to play Bicycle Card games. For additional
information about the minimum system requirements for Bicycle Card games, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q309698 Bicycle Games: Minimum System Requirements

If your computer meets the game requirements, reduce your computer's hardware
acceleration settings.

Method 2: Disable Pointer Trails
--------------------------------

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Mouse.

3. On the "Motion or Pointer Options" tab, click to clear the "Show pointer
  trails" or "Display pointer trails" check box, and then click OK.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 3: Change Pointer Scheme to Windows Standard or Default
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Mouse.

3. Click the Pointer Options tab.

4. In the Scheme box, click Windows Standard or Windows Default, and then click
  OK.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 4: Set Hardware Acceleration to Basic

Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Millennium:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

  NOTE: The Hardware Acceleration slider has four settings. From left to right,
  they are: None, Basic, Most, and Full.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of

Method 5: Install an Updated Video Driver
-----------------------------------------

A driver is software that your operating system uses to communicate with a piece
of hardware that is installed in your computer. Most video adapter manufacturers
release updated versions of their video drivers on a regular basis.

An updated driver for your video adapter can increase the performance,
efficiency, and stability of the features of your video adapter.

To identify the manufacturer and the model of your video adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. If you are using a Microsoft Windows 95- or a Microsoft Windows 98-based
  computer, click the Device Manager tab.

  If you are using a Microsoft Windows 2000- or a Microsoft Windows XP-based
  computer, click the Hardware tab, and then click Device Manager.

4. Expand "Display adapters".

5. Under the "Display adapters" branch, note the manufacturer and the model of
  your video adapter, and then click OK.

6. Close all of the open windows on the desktop.
