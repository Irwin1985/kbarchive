The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MAILDRV.EXE file that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the MAILDRV.EXE file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your MAILDRV.EXE file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains MAILDRV.EXE, a replacement for the MAILDRV.EXE file that is
included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows. This update
includes the following modification:

- When Microsoft Mail Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) loads a driver after EFAX has been
  activated, the driver does not become EFAX aware. Therefore, when EFAX is
  activated, the provider section for the EFAX driver is removed from the
  MSMAIL.INI file in the Windows directory. This updated version of the Mail
  Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) makes all the drivers EFAX aware. This ensures that
  when the driver is installed, the EFAX driver is not removed.

  NOTE: Because MAILDRV.EXE looks at the EFAX software, this version of
  MAILDRV.EXE should be installed ONLY on machines running version 3.11 of
  Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.

To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MDRVUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "mdrvupd"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  MAILDRV.EXE (23,952 bytes, dated 10-20-93, 3:58 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your MAILDRV.EXE file
-------------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\maildrv.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
MDRVUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
MAILDRV.EXE file currently resides. For example, if you ran the self-extracting
file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your MAILDRV.EXE file is located in
the MSMAIL directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\maildrv.exe c:\msmail " (without the quotation marks)3.20 wga
