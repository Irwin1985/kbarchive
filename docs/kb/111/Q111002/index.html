-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Shiva is incorporating support for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
in its upcoming Shiva Remote 3.1 client software. Shiva Remote 3.1 works in
Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Shiva Remote 3.1 will be released
as the standard client software shipped with all Shiva products.

Dial-Out Support Included in Shiva Remote 3.1
---------------------------------------------

Shiva supports shared dial-out from within Windows for Workgroups, using either
IPX or TCP/IP. To connect to a shared communications port across the LAN, Shiva
provides a special communications driver that replaces the Microsoft
communications driver. This driver redirects one of the user's serial ports to a
shared serial port available on the network. These shared serial ports, on
either the Shiva NetModem/E or LanRover, can be pooled to allow the user to
connect to the first available port.

Availability
------------

Shiva Remote 3.1 will be released on March 31, 1994. By the end of April 1994, it
will be incorporated into all Shiva products, including LanRover/E, LanRover/T,
and NetModem/E. It will also be available upon release on the Shiva bulletin
board service (BBS) and as a nominally priced upgrade for Shiva customers. Beta
versions of Shiva Remote will be available in February 1994. To apply to be on
the beta list, send electronic mail to mikef@shiva.com, or send a fax to Mike
Feinstein at (617) 270-8599.

NOTE: The original Shiva Remote 1.0 still supports Windows for Workgroups 3.1 but
does not support Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Shiva Remote 1.0 will only be
available on the Shiva BBS in order to support the current installed base. The
Shiva 3.0 MS-DOS client supports remote file sharing using the Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 MS-DOS client software.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
