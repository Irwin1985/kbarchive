-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the Srvmain.exe file that is included with
versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the Srvmain.exe file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your Srvmain.exe file

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: When you update to Srvmain.exe version 3.2.14, you need to update
Admin.exe to version 3.2.13 or later (update included in Admupd.exe on the MSL)
and Listds.exe version 3.2.1 (included with this update). You MUST also run
Sconfix.exe (included with this update) once. This is required for all users
updating to Srvmain.exe version 3.2.14.

This replacement file includes the following modifications for version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks:

- The Import utility no longer stops responding (hangs) when it processes
  RESYNC.GLB after doing heavy processing. This problem occurred because the
  heap became corrupted when it was under a heavy load.

  NOTE: To resolve this problem, two .exe files must be updated: the Srvmain.exe
  file (included in this update) and the Import.exe file (update included in
  Impupd.exe on the MSL).

- The SRVMAIN utility no longer does one-byte reads of the template files.

- A Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 PROXYNET\PROXYPO postoffice address list is
  now propagated to a downstream requestor postoffice when the gateway
  postoffice is also the directory server postoffice. The Import utility now
  copies FFAPI postoffice address lists from the directory server to the
  GLB\Resync.glb file to perform a directory synchronization manual import
  procedure.

  NOTE: To resolve this problem, two .exe files must be updated: the Srvmain.exe
  file (included with this update) and the Import.exe file (update included in
  Impupd.exe on the MSL).

This replacement file also includes the following modifications for version
3.2a:

- The directory synchronization (Dir-Sync) server now continues to process
  updates when Srvmain.exe encounters duplicate entries in the system mailbag.
  Previously, under these conditions SRVMAIN.EXE would quit without processing
  any additional updates in the system mailbag, and the following entries would
  be added to the DIRSYNC.LOG file:

  Error [115] Failure to read mail from NULL

  Warning [8] Error deleting file: &lt;Network&gt;/&lt;Postoffice&gt;/$SYSTEM.


- Dir-Sync will no longer give error

  Error 156 Invalid Dirsync password from PCM:Network/Postoffice

  during the T2 cycle. Previously, even if the password for the Requestor
  postoffice was correct, the password of a requestor postoffice would be
  incorrectly compared against other requestor postoffices listed in the
  SRVCONF.GLB. Specifically, this occurred when postoffices were registered in
  a particular order, and the postoffice names were similar to or part of other
  requestor postoffice names.


- If the Dsserver.log on a requestor postoffice is corrupt for some reason, the
  SRVMAIN -r process during Dir-Sync will no longer cause a Trap D.


- When the Admin account mailbox is greater than eight characters in length,
  the Keep Updates number will no longer change when you change the
  Administrator's name in Config, DirSync, Server, Options.

  IMPORTANT: This fix is specifically for users who have an Administrator's
  mailbox name greater than eight characters, and who want to receive Dir-Sync
  status messages.

  To add the new Administrator's name, you need ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.13 or
  later. Run Admin, DirSync, Server, Options. Type in the desired mailbox name.
  If necessary, re-enter the Keep Updates field. This modified SRVMAIN requires
  a new LISTDS.EXE version 3.2.1 or later for checking the SRVCONF.GLB file.


- If X.400 addresses are included in the very first Dir-Sync cycle, Dir-Sync
  will no longer fail with a protection violation during the T2 cycle of the
  SRVMAIN process.


To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Srvupd.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/pcmail/Update/22/WIN/EN-US/Srvupd.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download Srvupd.exe to a clean directory, run it (by typing "srvupd"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt) to extract the
contents of the file. You should receive the following files:

  SRVMAIN.EXE (163,941 bytes, dated 02-07-95, 11:33 A.M.)
  SCONFIX.EXE (  6,887 bytes, dated 01-13-95,  2:48 P.M.)
  LISTDS.EXE  ( 22,495 bytes, dated 01-23-95,  4:35 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To Replace Your Srvmain.exe File
--------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER after each
  line

  " copy &lt;path&gt;\srvmain.exe &lt;destination&gt;

  copy &lt;path&gt;\listds.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting Srvupd.exe file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your Srvmain.exe and Listds.exe files currently reside. For example, if
  you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
  Srvmain.exe and Listds.exe files are located in the MAILEXE directory on
  drive C, type the following commands:

  " copy d:\test\srvmain.exe c:\mailexe

  copy d:\test\listds.exe c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

  Notes:

   - The Srvmain.exe file typically resides on the postoffice server in the
     Mail executables directory as well as on the machine running the Dispatch
     program and the directory synchronization agents. Make sure you update all
     copies of the Srvmain.exe file.

   - Once you update to version 3.2.13 or later of SRVMAIN and ADMIN, use this
     LISTDS for viewing the Srvconf.glb.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;\sconfix.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting SRVUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your Mail executable files currently reside. For example, if you ran
  the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your Mail
  executable files are located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the
  following command:

  " copy d:\test\sconfix.exe c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

3. Run the SCONFIX utility from the Mail executables directory by running

  " sconfix -d&lt;drive&gt; " (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive mapped to the Dir-Sync server postoffice
  database.

The SRVMAIN.EXE and LISTDS.EXE utilities are included in the "Directory
Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" document. For more information about how to obtain
this document, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
