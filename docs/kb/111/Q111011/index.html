SUMMARY
=======

The style of Viewer's main window can be changed using the Windows
SetWindowLong() function. The prototype for SetWindowLong() is

     LONG SetWindowLong(HWND hwnd, int nOffset, LONG nVal)

where hwnd is the handle of the window, nOffset is the offset of the value to
change, and nVal is the new value for the offset. Further documentation for the
SetWindowLong() function can be found in the documentation for the Windows 3.1
Software Development Kit (SDK). To change the window style, the value -16 (which
is the value of the Windows constant GWL_STYLE) should be specified for nOffset.
The possible values for nVal are combinations of:

  WS_CLIPSIBLINGS:     0x04000000
  WS_CLIPCHILDREN:     0x02000000
  WS_VISIBLE:          0x10000000
  WS_DISABLED:         0x08000000
  WS_MINIMIZE:         0x20000000
  WS_MAXIMIZE:         0x01000000
  WS_CAPTION:          0x00C00000
  WS_BORDER:           0x00800000
  WS_DLGFRAME:         0x00400000
  WS_VSCROLL:          0x00200000
  WS_HSCROLL:          0x00100000
  WS_SYSMENU:          0x00080000
  WS_THICKFRAME:       0x00040000
  WS_MINIMIZEBOX:      0x00020000
  WS_MAXIMIZEBOX:      0x00010000

These values would be combined simply by or'ing them together. Each call to
SetWindowLong() completely replaces the previous styles for the window with the
new styles specified in the nVal parameter. By default, the main Viewer window
has the styles WS_VISIBLE, WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, WS_CLIPCHILDREN, WS_CAPTION,
WS_SYSMENU, WS_THICKFRAME, WS_MINIMIZEBOX, and WS_MAXIMIZEBOX (that is,
nVal=0x16CF0000).

To use SetWindowLong() from Viewer, it must be registered in the [CONFIG] section
of the .MVP file as follows:

     RegisterRoutine(`user',`SetWindowLong',`UiU')

SetWindowLong() can then be called from anywhere within the title with hwndApp as
the first parameter, -16 as the second parameter, and the appropriate new style
value in the third parameter. Microsoft recommends always including the
WS_VISIBLE, WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, and WS_CLIPCHILDREN styles in the new value. That
means the value of nVal would always be at least 0x16000000.

Note that SetWindowLong() is registered with the first parameter as an unsigned
long (U) even though the SetWindowLong() function properly takes an HWND, which
is an unsigned short int (u) in Windows 3.1, as the first parameter.
SetWindowLong() must be registered this way if the internal hwndApp variable,
which is an unsigned long, is to be passed to it. Because of the way arguments
are passed, SetWindowLong() will still work correctly; the high word of hwndApp,
which is zero-filled, will be ignored. However, if an unsigned short value will
be passed to SetWindowLong(), then RegisterRoutine() must specify "u" for the
first parameter. A Viewer title could obtain an unsigned short window handle by
calling one of the Windows functions such as GetParent().

To remove the maximize box from the main Viewer window, the SetWindowLong() call
would look as follows:

     SetWindowLong(hwndApp,-16,0x16CE0000)

To cause the main window frame to be redrawn immediately after the change to its
style, you may need to call the Windows function SetWindowPos(). It can be
registered as follows

     RegisterRoutine(`user',`SetWindowPos',`Uuiiiiu')

and then it can be called from anywhere within the title as follows:

     SetWindowPos(hwndApp,0,0,0,0,0,39)

The SetWindowPos() call above is equivalent to calling
SetWindowPos(hwndApp,0,0,0,0,0,SWP_DRAWFRAME | SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE |
SWP_NOZORDER) using the Windows constants defined in the WINDOWS.H include file
from the Windows SDK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following list describes the styles mentioned above:

WS_BORDER - Creates a window that has a border.

WS_CAPTION - Creates a window that has a title bar (implies the WS_BORDER style).
This style cannot be used with the WS_DLGFRAME style.

WS_CLIPCHILDREN - Excludes the area occupied by child windows when drawing within
the parent window. Used when creating the parent window.

WS_CLIPSIBLINGS - Clips child windows relative to each other; that is, when a
particular child window receives a paint message, the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style
clips all other overlapped child windows out of the region of the child window
to be updated. (If WS_CLIPSIBLINGS is not specified and child windows overlap,
it is possible, when drawing within the client area of a child window, to draw
within the client area of a neighboring child window.) For use with the WS_CHILD
style only.

WS_DISABLED - Creates a window that is initially disabled.

WS_DLGFRAME - Creates a window with a double border but no title.

WS_HSCROLL - Creates a window that has a horizontal scroll bar.

WS_MAXIMIZE - Creates a window of maximum size.

WS_MAXIMIZEBOX - Creates a window that has a Maximize button.

WS_MINIMIZE - Creates a window that is initially minimized. For use with the
WS_OVERLAPPED style only.

WS_MINIMIZEBOX - Creates a window that has a Minimize button.

WS_SYSMENU - Creates a window that has a System-menu box in its title bar. Used
only for windows with title bars.

WS_THICKFRAME - Creates a window with a thick frame that can be used to size the
window.

WS_VISIBLE - Creates a window that is initially visible. This applies to
overlapped, child, and pop-up windows. For overlapped windows, the y parameter
is used as a ShowWindow function parameter.

WS_VSCROLL - Creates a window that has a vertical scroll bar.

Note that one can determine the current styles of the main Viewer window using
the Spy utility shipped with the Windows SDK. Choose Window\Window from Spy's
menu. Then position the cursor over the main Viewer window. Spy will display the
style of the window in the last line of the "Spy Window" dialog box.
