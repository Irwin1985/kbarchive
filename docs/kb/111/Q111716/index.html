THE TEXT OF GC1039
------------------

Microsoft(R) MS-DOS(R), Windows(R), Windows NT(R), (R) Windows 95, OS/2,
and Apple Macintosh Applications

Versions:  3.0

Subject:   Software Development Kit (SDK) for       Application Note
         External Text File Converters

Contents:  2 Pages, 1 Disk                          4/97  GC1039

The files included with this Application Note comprise the software
development kit (SDK) for 16-bit and 32-bit external text file converters.
This SDK provides the technical information you need in order to develop
external file converters that can import and export formatted text between
Microsoft Word for Windows and foreign binary files.

  Important: Microsoft does not offer this kit as part of our product
  line. Microsoft will not provide technical or any other type of support
  for this kit.

The kit contains the following components:

- Microsoft License Agreement (Sdklics.doc) IMPORTANT-- READ CAREFULLY
  BEFORE USING SOFTWARE PACKET(S). By using the software in this kit, you
  indicate your acceptance of the Microsoft License Agreement included
  with it.

- Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification (GC0165.doc) The RTF Specification
  document is the core material you need to write external file
  converters. This document describes RTF syntax, the semantics of an RTF
  reader, and the contents of an RTF file, including definitions of RTF
  keywords.

- Software Development Kit for External Text File Converters and Win32(R)
  Software Development Kit for External Text File Converters documents
  (Sdk.doc and Sdk32.doc) These documents provide specifications and
  examples of how an external text file converter works with Word and
  Windows. Sdk.doc details the creation of a 16-bit converter, and
  Sdk32.doc details the creation of a 32-bit converter. Header files
  (Codepage.h, Convapi.h, Converr.h, Lang.h, Rtfdefs.h) These header files
  define all the structures, types, and function entry points documented
  in the SDK documents. Any converter or converter client should include
  the Convapi.h header, which itself includes Converr.h. The other files
  (Codepage.h, Lang.h, and Rtfdefs.h) contain definitions from the RTF
  specification. You can use the definitions found in these files to
  interpret the arguments for RTF keywords.

- Sample converter sources (See the Sampcnv and Rtfread subdirectories)
  Refer to these sources to see an example of a simple text converter. The
  sample converter sources are intended for use with Microsoft C version
  8.0. The Makefile file contains instructions for building the sample
  converter. The sample converter reads and writes simple text files, is
  auto-installed into Word, and contains the minimal code needed to write
  a fully functional converter. It implements the InitConverter,
  IsFormatCorrect, ForeignToRtf, RtfToForeign, and GetIniEntry application
  program interface (API) functions. The Rtfread directory contains source
  code for a skeleton RTF reader. The Readme.txt file in each directory
  elaborates on how to build the samples on 16-bit and 32-bit Windows.
