The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the Import Mail program file that is
included with versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the Import Mail program
file, see the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your IMPORT.EXE file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the Import Mail program (IMPORT.EXE), a replacement for the
Import Mail program file that is included with versions 3.2 and 3.2a of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This update resolves the following problems:

- The Import utility (with the -A option) no longer adds invalid DGN names to
  the Postoffice Address List (POL) when those names do not appear in the
  normal .USR files.

- The Import utility no longer corrupts the MCI.NME file when importing MCI
  user names. This problem caused the Mail Administrator program to incorrectly
  display the MCI address information.

- The Import utility no longer stops responding (hangs) when it processes
  RESYNC.GLB after doing heavy processing.

  NOTE: To resolve this problem, two .EXE files must be updated: the IMPORT.EXE
  file (update included in IMPORT.EXE version 3.2.9) and the SRVMAIN.EXE file
  (update included in SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2.10).

- The Import utility now updates FLAG.GLB when it runs, causing the External
  Mail program to update its address lists on the next cycle interval.

- The Import utility no longer does 1-byte reads of the template files.

- When it is importing modified SNADS template information, the Import utility
  no longer incorrectly sequences the information.

- When you use the Import utility to modify a user's configuration (any option
  set with an "&amp;") and that user has remote access, the user's remote
  access ability is no longer removed.

- When you use the Modify transaction type to update a user in the POL but you
  do not make any changes to the user's alias, the user's record is no longer
  deleted.

- When you use the -A command-line option to modify template information, the
  Import utility no longer increases the size of the associated .INF file on
  each pass. The Import utility now creates a new .INF file that incorporates
  the changes rather than appending the changes to the existing .INF file.

- When you use the Import utility to change a user's mailbox name, Error
  34--"Could not access log information file"--no longer occurs when you start
  the MS-DOS client.

- Deleting a local user with Import no longer leaves the user's folder files
  (.IDX and .FLD) orphaned in the FOLDERS\LOC\0000???? subdirectory of the Mail
  database.

- A Microsoft Mail Connection 3.2 PROXYNET\PROXYPO postoffice address list is
  now propagated to a downstream requestor postoffice when the gateway
  postoffice is also the directory server postoffice. The Import utility now
  copies FFAPI postoffice address lists from the directory server to the
  GLB\RESYNC.GLB file to perform a directory synchronization manual import
  procedure.

  NOTE: To resolve this problem, two .EXE files must be updated: the IMPORT.EXE
  file (included in this update) and the SRVMAIN.EXE file (update included in
  SRVMAIN.EXE version 3.2.10).

- Local postoffice users added with the Import utility will no longer be
  assigned an invalid identification number if the TID.GLB file is locked open.
  Also, batch creation of local postoffice users with the Import utility while
  the TID.GLB file is locked open no longer results in the same invalid
  identification number being assigned to multiple users.

- Trap D errors or "An OS/2 program caused a protection violation" error no
  longer occurs under OS/2 or under the OS/2 subsystem of Windows NT when you
  use the Import utility with the -ST command- line option.

- The Import utility now creates unique mailbag numbers when you add local
  postoffice users, even if the CONTROL.GLB file has been reset to zero.

- When you use Import to add a new local user, the Import utility now adds that
  user's template information to the REQTRANS.GLB. Previously, even if the
  template information was included in the IMPORT.TXT file, it was not written
  to the REQTRANS.GLB.


- When you use Import to create a new template for an external postoffice, the
  Macintosh client can now read the template information after the first user.
  Previously, the last field was not visible for any user, and the template
  information for the second and subsequent users would display incorrectly.


- When you use Import version 3.2.14 or 3.2.16, and you add users via an Import
  batch file, these users can have their TID values reset. This will create
  problems sending mail, adding to groups, and deleting users.


To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Impupd.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/pcmail/Update/3/DOS/EN-US/Impupd.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download IMPUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "impupd"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt) to extract the
contents of the file. You should receive the following files:

  IMPORT.EXE (204,675 bytes, dated 5-3-95, 6:02 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your IMPORT.EXE file
------------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\import.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
IMPUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
IMPORT.EXE file currently resides. For example, if you ran the self-extracting
file from the TEST directory on drive D, and the IMPORT.EXE file is located in
the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\import.exe c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: The IMPORT.EXE file typically resides on the postoffice server in the Mail
executables directory as well as on the machine importing addresses into the
database. Make sure you update all copies of the IMPORT.EXE file.
