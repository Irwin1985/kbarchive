-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a list of bugs confirmed in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. This is not a comprehensive list; this list is current
as of January 1, 1994.

For more information on the bug listed, query in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base on the article ID or the bug number.

BUG LISTING FOR VERSION 3.2
---------------------------

- Keyboard Problems in Select Headers Dialog Box

- Null Modem Script Displays Phone Number

- Unsendable Messages Counted Wrong

- Setup May Fail If Program Manager Not Running

- Incorrect Sorting by Subject

- MAPI Ignores Scheduled Connections

- Err Msg: Mail Remote Driver Not Compatible...

- Cannot Create New .MMF If Old Location Unavailable

- Problems with Extended Characters

Keyboard Problems in Select Headers Dialog Box
----------------------------------------------

  Q97071

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, interacting with the
headers dialog box without a mouse can be awkward. For remote users, this
can occur frequently.

Null Modem Script Displays Phone Number
---------------------------------------

  Q97897


When using version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows and connecting
with a null Modem script, the Connection dialog shows Dialing and then
displays a phone number.

This is confusing and misleading, because no phone number is dialed while
using a null modem connection.

Unsendable Messages Counted Wrong
---------------------------------

  Q98013

If there are unsendable messages waiting in the Outbox for version
3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, when you choose Connect
Now from the View menu, the messages are counted as messages waiting to
be sent, even though they are not waiting to be sent.

Setup May Fail If Program Manager Not Running
---------------------------------------------

  Q98044

If the Microsoft Windows Program Manager is not running when you start
the Setup program for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows,
the Setup program attempts to build the Program Manager group but cannot.
The following error message is generated:

  Cannot establish DDE link to Program Manager - Retry/Cancel.


After you select Cancel, a message appears stating that Mail is not
installed correctly and will not function. After you select Exit
Install, a sharing violation occurs.

Mail Remote for Windows does run correctly after installation.

Incorrect Sorting by Subject
----------------------------

  Q99116

When sorting messages by Subject (using the View menu) in version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, the RE: and FW: header prefixes are not
ignored, as they are by Microsoft Mail for Windows. This causes all replies
and forwards to be sorted together.

The sort should ignore the RE: and FW: prefixes so that messages are truly
sorted by subject.

MAPI Ignores Scheduled Connections
----------------------------------

  Q100458

When a message is sent from an application that uses Simple MAPI (such
as Microsoft Word version 2.0 for Windows), and you have version 3.2
of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows installed but not running, the
message is always sent immediately, despite the Mail Remote for Windows
connection-scheduling feature that tells Mail to wait until the scheduled
time.

Err Msg: Mail Remote Driver Not Compatible...
---------------------------------------------

  Q101367

In version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, with the option
"Connect on Exit of Mail" selected, the following incorrect error message
may appear if you do not have mail to send in your Outbox when exiting:

  This Microsoft Mail Remote driver is not compatible with your messaging
  system.


This message is incorrect and misleading.

If you have mail waiting in your Outbox, this error message does not
appear.

This problem is also documented in the README.TXT file under section
2J. The README.TXT file is located on Disk 1.

Cannot Create New .MMF If Old Location Unavailable
--------------------------------------------------

  Q103905

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows may return the following
error message

  Your message file could not be found

  followed by:

  Open Message File


After the error message, even if you change to a different directory,
Windows Remote Mail ignores the change to the directory and creates a
new Mail message file (.MMF) in the directory listed on the
OfflineMessages line of the MSMAIL.INI file.

Problems with Extended Characters
---------------------------------

  Q105931

With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, if you include
extended characters in a message and you save the message as a text
file, the extended characters are translated to incorrect byte values.
