BUG# ODBCDBASE: 1915 (1.01.1928)

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain multi-user situations, applications using the Microsoft ODBC
Access driver versions 1.01.1928 and 1.01.2115 may encounter the following two
problems:

1. Read locks are retained longer than necessary. As a result of this, when an
  application that executes a SELECT statement on a table such that the WHERE
  clause contains a column with a unique index on it, other applications will
  not be able to insert, delete, or update that table. Attempts to do so will
  cause the following error:

  Commit Lock failed due to outstanding read lock

  Locks will not be released until the application that did the SELECT calls
  SQLDisconnect.

2. Applications may be unable to "see" updates (row insertions, deletions, and
  updates) made by other applications. This occurs under the following
  circumstances:

  Application A executes a SELECT statement on a table and fetches all the rows;
  then, application B updates (insert, delete or update) the same table. Now if
  A re-executes the same SELECT statement and fetches all the rows, it will see
  the exact same rows that it saw before; it does not see the updates made by
  B. For A to be able to see the updates, it needs to call SQLDisconnect on the
  hdbc on which the original SELECT was performed.

  The ODBC Access driver is based on a sub component of the Access database
  engine. This Access database engine implements a performance enhancing
  caching scheme, as rows are retrieved from the database or updated by an
  application they are cached. In most cases, this permits rows to be
  re-retrieved without having to re-read from the actual database file,
  thereby, enhancing performance.

  Locks held on the actual rows of the database from which they were retrieved
  are not released until the corresponding cached rows are flushed from the
  cache. Since locked rows are not updated due to reasons of integrity, it
  follows that updates are not initiated until the cache is flushed. The
  database engine caching scheme relies on the application that is using the
  engine to initiate the process of flushing the cache. This permits the
  application to "time" the flushing of the cache to correspond with the
  operations the application is performing at the time.

  For example, the Access product initiates the flushing process during user
  "think time" to maximize the responsiveness of the user interface. In the
  Access ODBC driver, the driver itself initiates the flushing process, since
  relying on the application to do this would reduce the interoperability of
  applications. If the driver relied on the application to initiate this
  process, it would require applications to write special code to use the
  Access ODBC driver. This is contrary to the goal of ODBC.

In Access ODBC driver versions 1.01.1928 and 1.01.2115, this flushing process was
initiated when SQLDisconnect was called by the application. This proved to be
inadequate for some multi-user scenarios and caused the problems described
above. A recent "hotfix" version of the driver (version 1.02.1403) initiates the
flushing process at the following times:

1. SQLFreeStmt with the SQL_DROP option

2. SQLFreeStmt with the SQL_CLOSE option

3. SQLDisconnect

This causes cached rows to be flushed more often. It also means that the database
file will be read more frequently, with the possibility of some performance
degradation. However, it solves the problem of locks being held for longer than
is necessary. It also solves the problem of visibility of updates in many
multi-user scenarios.

In a few scenarios, it is possible that locking conflicts will still be
encountered and updates will not be visible across applications, unless it is
dropped and re-establish the connection. In particular, an application that
executes a SELECT statement on a table such that the WHERE clause contains a
column with a unique index on it, will not be able to see updates made to the
table by other applications, until it drops and re-establishes the connection.

For the hotfix to work properly, the following entries should be inserted in the
[Red ISAM] section of ODBCISAM.INI file:

  IdleFrequency=1
  PageTimeout=1
  LockedPageTimeout=1

This minimizes the chance of encountering the "updates-not-visible" problem. The
ODBCISAM.INI file is usually located in the \WINDOWS directory.

You will also note that the Access product does not, in general, exhibit this
same behavior. The reason is the mechanism used to flush cached rows is somewhat
different in the Access product which includes the complete Access database
engine, than in the Access ODBC driver which uses a sub component of that
engine. The complete Access database engine, enables an application to detect
when it has successfully flushed all rows from the cache. Therefore, to ensure
concurrency and the visibility of updates, Access flushes the cache until all
rows have been forced out. The Access ODBC driver, using the sub component of
the Access engine, can flush rows from the cache, but is unable to tell when all
rows have been forced out. Therefore, it cannot guarantee that locking conflicts
and the visibility of updates is resolved for every scenario.

Version 2.0 of the ODBC Driver Pack will be based on the complete Access database
engine and will exhibit the same capability in this area as the Access product.
Driver Pack version 2.0 is currently scheduled for release 2H 1994.

It should also be noted that even in the Access product, applications written in
Access BASIC, can encounter substantially the same lock conflict scenario as
outlined above. The way that locking conflicts are dealt with in this case, for
example in Access BASIC applications, is for the application to retry the
retrieval when such a conflict is encountered. Applications written to the ODBC
Access driver can employ the same strategy to resolve such conflicts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Access Driver versions
1.01.1928 and 1.01.2115. This problem has been fixed in Access driver version
1.02.1403. For more information, please contact your primary support provider.
