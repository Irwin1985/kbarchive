-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MSRMT.DLL that is included with version
3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the MSRMT.DLL file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your MSRMT.DLL file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains MSRMT.DLL, a replacement for the MSRMT.DLL file that is
included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows. This replacement
file provides additional enhancements to the original MSRMT.DLL file, correcting
the following problems:

- External postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and nodes for PROFS and OfficeVision are
  not displayed in alphabetic order because Remote Mail for Windows reads them
  in one at a time and adds them to the address list hierarchy. With the
  updated version of MSRMT.DLL, Remote Mail for Windows reads in the external
  postoffices, SNADS DGNs, and PROFS nodes all at once, sorts them, and then
  adds them to the address list hierarchy.

- The Windows Remote client may receive general-protection (GP) faults when it
  reads in a new message whose header within the .MAI file is greater than a
  certain length. The message is successfully downloaded from the postoffice to
  the Inbox .MBG file; however, it fails when it is read into the Mail message
  file (MMF). This problem has been fixed with version 3.2.4010 of MSRMT.DLL.


- A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote address
  book was updated without uploading messages. The client will now check for
  the outbound messages prior to updating the address book. To ensure this fix
  works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded in conjunction with this
  DLL:

     MSRMTCN.DLL  version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTSU.DLL  version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTTR.DLL  version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTUI.DLL  version 3.2.4013

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MSRMT.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "msrmt"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  MSRMT.DLL (234,544 bytes, dated 6-15-95, 6:21 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your MSRMT.DLL file
-----------------------------

1. Verify that the Microsoft Mail Remote driver (MSRMT.DLL) is the current
  driver in the Mail System Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) by running the Mail System
  Selector from the Windows Program Manager, selecting Microsoft Mail Remote,
  then choosing Set As Current Mail Driver.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\msrmt.dll &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting MSRMT.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your MSRMT.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you ran the
  self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your MSRMT.DLL
  file is located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory on drive C, type the
  following command:

  " copy d:\test\msrmt.dll c:\windows\system " (without the quotation marks)
