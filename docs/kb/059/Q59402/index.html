This article discusses the /Es (share expanded memory) option for
QBX.EXE and BC.EXE in Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System
(PDS) Versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.

The BC /Es Option
-----------------

The /Es option for BC.EXE needs to be added to the list of BC options
on Page 559 of the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's Guide" for
versions 7.00 and 7.10.

The BC /Es option is correctly described on Page 608 of the "Microsoft
BASIC 7.0: Language Reference" (Appendix C: "Command-Line Tools Quick
Reference") for 7.00 and 7.10. The BC /Es option is also correctly
documented as follows in the Microsoft Advisor online Help system in
QBX.EXE, found by choosing Contents from the Help menu, then selecting
"BC Command Line":

   "HELP: BC Command Line"
   /Es       Allows you to share expanded memory between BASIC and
             mixed-language routine(s) that make use of expanded memory.
             Specify /Es when you are going to use a mixed-language
             routine that makes use of expanded memory.

Note: The only way an .EXE program compiled with BC.EXE can use
expanded memory is with ISAM file buffers, or when linked to use
overlays, as described in a separate article found with the following
query:

   how and LINK and overlays and BASIC and 7.00

The QBX /Es Option
------------------

QBX.EXE, the programming environment included with Microsoft BASIC
Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00, can use expanded
memory for procedures smaller than 16K.

Note that the QBX /Es option cannot be used together with the /Ea
option. (The QBX /Ea option lets each non-variable-length string array
smaller than 16K use one 16K page of expanded memory.)

By invoking QBX with the /Es switch, QBX can share expanded memory
with mixed-language routines (in Quick libraries) that make DOS
interrupts to access expanded memory.

The QBX /Es switch is correctly documented on Page 626 of the
"Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Language Reference," and in the Microsoft
Advisor online Help system in QBX.EXE, found by choosing Contents from
the Help menu, then selecting "QBX Command Line":

   "HELP: QBX Command Line"
   /Es      Allows you to share expanded memory between QBX and
            Quick libraries or mixed-language routines that make use
            of expanded memory. Specify /Es when you are using a
            Quick library or mixed-language routine that makes use
            of expanded memory. Do not use /Es with the /Ea option.
