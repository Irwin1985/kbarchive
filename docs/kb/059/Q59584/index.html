SUMMARY
=======

OS/2 Days Developer's Conference DCA/Microsoft Communication Server

Questions and Answers Follow-Up Responses
-----------------------------------------

1. Why is user security data stored in the COM.SEC file? This makes it possible
  to compromise security by taking the file to another machine. According to
  the customer, this scheme matches the implementation under IBM EE
  Communication Manager.

  Answer

  The ability to compromise APPC conversation security requires an APPC
  Transaction Program (TP) to know the user ID and password when issuing an
  [MC_]ALLOCATE request to initiate a conversation. Ultimately, the Comm Server
  administrator must prevent unauthorized access to this file through either of
  the following:

   - Physical security (limiting physical access to the server machine).

   - Using the LAN Manager 2.00 Local Security feature to limit unauthorized
     local access to server-based files. This also prevents access to the file
     when booting the server from a floppy disk.

2. How does Comm Server perform load balancing with LU pools that span multiple
  connections? Does load balancing only relate to session balancing, or does
  network traffic play any part in the balancing scheme?

  Answer

  Comm Server allows an administrator to define a pool of 3270 LUs that may span
  multiple host connections. In this case, one or more Comm Server machines
  (residing on the same LAN) are supporting more than one link to one or more
  IBM host machines. If a Comm Server client is configured to have access to
  the LU pool and a user activates a 3270 session associated with the pool, the
  Comm Server client machine will randomly select a connection to use.

  While this random selection method for 3270 LU load balancing is very
  rudimentary under Comm Server 1.00, this will be modified under future
  versions of the Comm Server to provide more reliable LU load balancing.
  Factors that are being considered to improve the load balancing algorithms
  include: link traffic volume, server utilization, server CPU type and clock
  rate, server LAN I/O performance, and host adapter type.

3. Why isn't Comm Server set up as a LAN Manager service like SQL server?

  Answer

  The LAN Manager Service facility does not currently provide the amount of
  detailed control required to fully implement Comm Server as a LAN Manager
  service. Note that SQL Server is implemented as a single LAN Manager service,
  not as multiple distributed services that require specialized managing
  facilities that Comm Server supports. This idea was considered in the early
  design phases of the product, and is still under consideration for future
  versions of LAN Manager.

  Through the "COMM" command, an effort has been made to manage Comm Server
  services similar to the way the NET command works under LAN Manager. For
  example:

      Command                Description
      -------                -----------

      comm start &lt;service&gt;   Starts a Comm Server service on the
                             local machine, where &lt;service&gt; is the
                             name of a Comm Server node or link
                             service. This includes the Comm Server
                             network access program (NAP), which is
                             referred to as the Comm Server
                             Workstation service (for clients) and
                             the Server service (for servers).

      comm stop &lt;service&gt;    Stops a Comm Server service on the local
                             machine.

      comm view              Displays all active Comm Server services
                             on the LAN (on all Comm Server server
                             machines).

      comm manage            Start the Comm Server MANAGE interface.

      comm config            Start the Comm Server CONFIGURATION
                             interface.

      comm browse            Start the Comm Server BROWSE interface.

4. Will Comm Server include any tools to monitor overall throughput performance
  and session load? The intention here is to provide tools to help an
  administrator fine-tune performance, or identify potential bottlenecks so
  that software and/or hardware reconfiguration could lead to increased
  performance.

  Answer

  The Comm Workstation/Server already supports a full range of Link Tracing,
  Error and Audit logging messages, and client session monitoring/control
  facilities provided by the MANAGE utility. While statistical data for
  throughput analysis is not available in version 1.00, this information can be
  retrieved at the IBM host using Netview. Microsoft welcomes any comments you
  have regarding additional tools that that you would like to be included in
  the Comm Workstation/Server products.

5. How much memory will be left over for DOS applications, once the necessary
  Comm Server client software is loaded?

  Answer

  This subject is fairly complicated, since the Comm Server DOS client software
  includes different modules that allow a customer to optimize memory usage
  depending on the desired functionality at the workstation. For example, there
  are three versions of the 3270 Emulator (DOS3270S, DOS3270M, DOS3270L) and
  two versions of the Comm Server Network Access Program (MINNAP, COMXNAP). The
  following is a brief description of these different modules:

      Module       Description
      ------       -----------

      DOS3270S     Supports up to five display sessions. Doesn't
                   support API interface. Only requires MINNAP to
                   interface to Comm Server. Doesn't support file
                   transfer options.

      DOS3270M     Supports up to five display sessions, including
                   API support. Requires COMXNAP. Supports file
                   transfer, but this requires extra memory.

      DOS3270L     Supports up to five display and printer sessions,
                   including API support. Requires COMXNAP. Supports
                   file transfer, but this requires extra memory.

      MINNAP       Limited-function Comm Server Network Access
                   Program for the DOS client. Only supports
                   DOS3270S. Doesn't support the DOS client APIs.

      COMXNAP      Full-function Comm Server Network Access Program
                   for the DOS client. Includes support for APIs and
                   3270 emulators.

  The following are PRELIMINARY memory usage estimates for different scenarios.
  Note that these estimates do not include potential memory savings by using
  64K of expanded memory. DOS LAN Manager 2.00 numbers reflect debug version
  memory use, which will decrease when the final version is shipped. Also,
  these estimates assume that the DOS client is only attached to one LAN, and
  is using Microsoft's NETBEUI protocol over Token Ring.

  Estimated Base Memory Requirements
  ----------------------------------

       DOS Operating System  ....................  50K  (Minimum DOS 3.30)
       Enhanced DOS LAN Manager 2.00 ............  60K *

                                                  ----
             Estimated Base Memory Requirements = 146K

        * Preliminary version, using minimum settings and without use
          of high memory.

                                                    ----
                                            Total = 493K

  d. APPC API support, with no 3270 functionality:

         Estimated Base Memory Requirements ....... 146K
         COMXNAP (full-function NAP) ..............  40K
                                                    ----
                                            Total = 186K

6. Comm Server 1.10: Will future LU0 support include support for a DOS client?

  Answer

11. What releases of OS/2, LAN Manager, and SQL Server are compatible with each
  other?

  Answer

  Please note the product compatibility matrix below. This matrix identifies
  different releases of OS/2, LAN Manager, SQL, and Comm Server version
  compatibilities. Additional information is provided below for certain
  product versions. With the exception of the "NDK" and "SDK" programs (which
  have been discontinued by Microsoft), these products are only available
  through OEM vendors.

                      1.00,         1.00
                      SDK 1.07,

   OS/2 1.10          1.00,         1.00         -             -
                      SDK 1.07

   OS/2 1.10 SA *     1.01, 1.01+   1.00         -             -

   IBM OS/2 1.20 SE   (1)            -           -             -

   OS/2 1.20 (2)      2.00 (3)      (4)         1.00 (5)      1.00 (6)

  * Standard releases of OS/2 1.00 and 1.10 did not support the anticipated
  capacity requirements of the LAN Manager server and SQL database software
  products at the server. To overcome some of these limitations, the LAN
  Manager/SQL releases include a special version of the OS/2 kernel referred
  to as "OS/2 Server Adaptation" (SA) for OS/2 versions 1.00 and 1.10. The
  "Server Adaptation" releases were discontinued after the LAN Manager 1.01
  release, since OS/2 file system capacity has been significantly enhanced in
  OS/2 versions 1.20 and later.

  LAN Manager/SQL Releases
  ------------------------

      Release      Description
      -------      -----------

      SQL NDK      Microsoft's Network Development Kit (NDK) release
                   for SQL Server. This release included OS/2 1.00
                   Server Adaptation, LAN Manager 1.00, and an SQL
                   Server Beta release. The NDK program has been
                   discontinued by Microsoft.

      SDK 1.07     Microsoft's Software Development Kit release for
                   LAN Manager. This release included OS/2 1.00
                   Server Adaptation and LAN Manager 1.00. The SDK
                   program has been discontinued by Microsoft.

      SQL 1.00     The official SQL Server 1.00 retail version was
                   released by Ashton-Tate, which was newer than the
                   SQL Beta version distributed by Microsoft with the
                   SQL NDK.

      LM 1.00      Microsoft LAN Manager 1.00 release to OEM
                   customers only. This version was also included in
                   Microsoft's SDK 1.07 package for software
                   developers.

      LM 1.01      Microsoft LAN Manager 1.01 release to OEM
                   customers only. This release included OS/2 1.10
                   Server Adaptation and LAN Manager 1.01.

      LM 1.01+     Microsoft LAN Manager 1.01 update release to OEM
                   customers only. This release included some bug
                   fixes to the LM 1.01 release.

  a. IBM OS/2 1.2 Standard Edition does not provide the necessary support for
     any version of LAN Manager. Since OS/2 1.2 includes support for
     installable file systems (IFS), LAN Manager 1.0x versions will not operate
     on this version. An upcoming version of LAN Manager (version 2.00), which
     is implemented as an IFS, is designed to run on an upcoming version OS/2
     1.2, but not earlier versions.

  b. Microsoft has not completed certification of this product (as of March 14,
     1990), so it is not available through OEM vendors. OS/2 1.2 Standard
     Edition is available from IBM, corresponding to the most recent Corrective
     Service Distribution (CSD) release.

  c. Microsoft has not released LAN Manager 2.00 to OEM customers (as of March
     14, 1990). LAN Manager 2.00 will require the version of OS/2 1.2 referred
     to in Item 2 above.

  d. This new version of SQL Server, which will be available through
     Ashton-Tate, has not been released yet (as of March 14, 1990). This
     release will require the version of OS/2 1.2 referred to in Item 2 above
     and LAN Manager 2.00 referred to in Item 3 above.

  e. Microsoft and DCA have not completed certification of this product (as of
     March 14, 1990), so it is not available through DCA or OEM vendors. Comm
     Server 1.00 requires LAN Manager version 2.00.

  f. Microsoft and DCA have not completed certification of this product (as of
     March 14, 1990) so it is not available through DCA or OEM vendors. Comm
     Workstation 1.00 requires OS/2 1.20, but not LAN Manager.
