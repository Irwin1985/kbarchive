When opening or saving a file in the QuickBASIC (QB) or QuickBASIC
Extended (QBX) editor, the name of the file can be entered in an edit
field titled "File Name :". If the filename is entered without an
extension, the editor assumes that the extension is ".BAS". However,
if the name entered is also the name of a subdirectory within the
current directory, the editor (depending on the version) may change to
that directory and no file will be opened or saved. In such a
situation, you must enter the extension to tell the editor you are
referring to the file, not the directory.

This information applies to QB.EXE in Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions
2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS and to QBX.EXE in
Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for
MS-DOS.

What the QB.EXE or QBX.EXE editor will do in the above situation
depends on which version you use.

The following table describes the behavior of different versions of
the QB.EXE and QBX.EXE editors in this situation. There is also a
difference that depends on whether a file is being opened (or loaded)
or saved. In the table below, the "Open" column lists the behavior of
the editor when a file is being opened, while the "Save" column lists
the editor's behavior when a file is being saved.

   Editor     Open                       Save
   ------     ----                       ----

   QB 2.00    Treats the name entered    "Invalid file specification"
   QB 2.01    as a directory and         error, then it changes to that
   QB 3.00    changes to it.             directory.

              Treats the name entered    Treats the name entered as a
   QB 4.00    as a directory and         file.
   QB 4.00b   changes to it.

   QBX 7.00   as a directory and         directory and changes to it.
