When using versions of the Microsoft Library Manager (LIB.EXE) earlier
than Version 3.14 to try to build large libraries with many symbols
and modules, the LIB program may fail due to capacity limits.

If you encounter various failures or random errors when trying to
build a large library (for example, the Greenleaf Libraries), you
should contact Microsoft Product Support at (206) 637-7096 to obtain a
more recent version of LIB.EXE.

LIB.EXE is shipped with all Microsoft language products for building
and maintaining run-time libraries. Earlier versions of LIB run into
problems when the library size approaches 200K or larger, but the
point at which LIB may fail varies widely. LIB capacity is
unpredictable because it is affected by such items as the number of
symbols, the number of modules, and the length of symbol names.

Sometimes, just changing the order in which modules are added to a
large library will resolve the problem (or at least alter the point of
failure or the particular errors generated). Some of the errors
reported from capacity failures are U1174, U1188, and U1189.

Errors such as U1174 and U1189 are documented only as being problems
for which you should contact Microsoft Product Support. In general,
these errors indicate major LIB capacity overflow problems and the
best workaround is to update to a newer version of LIB.EXE.
