SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Mail Gateway Installer is shipped with the Gateway Software
Development Kit (SDK), as well as the AppleLink gateway and other gateways that
must be installed on a Microsoft Mail server. Many of the menu commands are more
beneficial to gateway developers than to the normal Network Manager. Below is a
list of the menu items and a description of what each one does for the Gateway
Installer version 2.0 and 3.0.

Note: Please note that Microsoft Mail version 3.00 includes the Gateway Installer
version 3.00 on the Extras disk. Gateway developers may or may not be shipping
the Gateway Installer for Mail 3.00 with their gateway.

Gateway Menu
------------

1. Install Gateway -- Installs a gateway on the Mail server selected in the
  Chooser.

2. Update Gateway -- Updates an already installed gateway to a newer version of
  the gateway without having to reenter account, configuration, setup, and
  recipient information. Updates the gateway server highlighted in the Gateways
  Installed On This Server list in the Gateway Installer window.

3. Preview Gateway -- Mimics the Install Gateway command, without actually
  installing the gateway. Status information is printed to the Trace window.
  This menu item is active only when the Trace window is open.

4. Copy Accounts And Recipients -- Copies gateway account and gateway recipient
  information to a file. Copies account and recipient information from the
  gateway server highlighted in the Gateways Installed On This Server list in
  the Gateway Installer window.

5. Install Accounts And Recipients -- Installs gateway account and gateway
  recipient information from a file previously created by the Copy Accounts and
  Recipients command. Installs account and recipient information on the gateway
  server highlighted in the Gateways Installed On This Server list in the
  Gateway Installer window.

6. Extract Access Gateway -- Extracts gateway-access server resources from the
  gateway server highlighted in the Gateways Installed On This Server list in
  the Gateway Installer window.

7. Remove Gateway -- Removes the gateway resources from the gateway server
  highlighted in the Gateways Installed On This Server list in the Gateway
  Installer window.

Access Menu
-----------

1. Install Access Gateway -- Installs a gateway-access server on the Mail server
  selected in the Chooser. The gateway-access file must have previously been
  created by step 6 above.

2. Update Access Gateway -- Updates an already installed gateway-access server
  to a newer version. Updates the access server highlighted in the Gateways
  Installed On This Server list in the Gateway Installer window. The
  gateway-access file must have previously been created by step 6 above.

3. Remove Access Gateway -- Removes the gateway-access server resources from the
  access server highlighted in the Gateways Installed On This Server list in
  the Gateway Installer window.
