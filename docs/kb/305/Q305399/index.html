-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoint mapper allows RPC clients to determine
the port number currently assigned to a particular RPC service. Because the
endpoint mapper runs within the RPC service itself, exploiting this
vulnerability would cause the RPC service itself to fail, with the attendant
loss of any RPC-based services the server offers, as well as potential loss of
some COM functions. Normal service could be restored by rebooting the system.

Standard security recommendations call for port 135 (the port on which the RPC
endmapper operates) to be blocked at the firewall. If this were done, the chief
threat posed by this vulnerability would be from internal attacks.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability results because the Windows NT 4.0 Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) service will fail if the endpoint mapper is sent a request that contains a
particular type of malformed data.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems that are determined to be at risk of attack. Please evaluate your
computer's physical accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other
factors to determine the degree of risk to your computer. Please see the
associated Microsoft Security Bulletin
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms01-048.asp) to help make
this determination. This fix may receive additional testing at a later time, to
further ensure product quality. If your computer is sufficiently at risk,
Microsoft recommends that you apply this fix now.

To resolve this problem immediately, download the fix as instructed below or
