<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q305638
Product(s): Microsoft Windows NT
Version(s): 4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): 
Last Modified: 12-AUG-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a Move Group or Failover process in a Windows NT 4.0-based cluster, the
following error message may be recorded in the Cluster log:

  Physical Disk "&lt;Driveletter&gt;:" DiskspCheckPath: FindFirstFile for
  "DRIVELETTER:" failed, error 3.

This error message typically occurs when the second cluster of a two-node cluster
is brought online if the "Failback for a cluster group(s)" option is set to fail
back to that node.

Additionally, when you perform a Move Group process, the following error message
may be recorded in the Cluster log:

  Physical Disk "&lt;Driveletter&gt;:" SCSI, error reserving disk, error 21.

CAUSE
=====

The first error message is the result of a regression fix from Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a (SP6a).

Under certain conditions, the cluster disk driver (Clusdisk.sys) tries to attach
to devices but cannot read the partition table (assuming that they are cluster
disks that are reserved by the other node).


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and

later:

  Date       Time   Version    Size       File name

  12-Nov-01  21:17  1.0.224.6  169,744    Clusres.dll
  12-Nov-01  21:17  1.0.224.6   29,968    Resutils.dll

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this hotfix requires Windows NT 4.0 SP6a

NOTE: If this hotfix is installed, you may not be able to install Microsoft Data
Access Components (MDAC). When you try to install MDAC, you may receive the
following error message:

  olemainthreadwndname:dasetup.exe unable to locate ... dynamic link library
  mtsevents.dll

This error message may occur if Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) is not
installed. To work around this error message, use either of the following
methods:

- Rename the Mtxex.dll file to Mtxex.bak before you install MDAC, and then name
  the file back to Mtxex.dll after you install MDAC.

- Install MTS before you install MDAC.

Note that the Dtcsetup.exe program is included only in case you must reinstall
Microsoft Transaction Coordinator. Use the Dtcsetup.exe program that is included
with this hotfix, and follow the instructions that are listed in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
