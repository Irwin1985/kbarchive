-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the post Systems Management Server 2.0 (SMS) Service Pack 3
(SP3) hotfix for Q266712 or SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later on your SMS
2.0 primary site, users of the SMS Administrator console may be unable to
enumerate SMS objects such as collections. Prior to the application of the
hotfix, users were able to inherit permissions that were assigned to domain
local groups.

CAUSE
=====

The fix that is included with Q266712 contains a change in how a user's groups
are enumerated by the SMS provider. Because of this change, using domain local
groups to assign permissions is no longer possible on member servers. Note that
domain local groups still work when the SMS provider resides on a domain
controller (DC).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use any of the following methods individually:

- Use domain global groups to grant access and assign permissions to SMS object
  classes and instances.

- Use machine local groups to grant access and assign permissions to SMS object
  classes and instances.

- Use individual user accounts to grant access and assign permissions to SMS
  object classes and instances.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To experience the issue that is described in this article, the SMS provider
(either on the SMS site server or SQL server) must be installed on a member
server.
