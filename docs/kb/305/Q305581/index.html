-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Links 2001 
- Microsoft Crimson Skies 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Links 2001, the running speed of the golfer animations
may be far too fast. Other game elements, such as the swing gauge, sounds, and
so on, run at normal speed and otherwise behave normally.

When you play Microsoft Crimson Skies, the fighters appear to surge forward,
pause, and then surge forward again. Videos may run at a faster-than-normal rate
or appear choppy.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your computer has been running continuously for
approximately 24 days or more. When the games mentioned above are started, the
game's internal timing is based on how long Microsoft Windows has been running
(uptime). A system that has been running without a restart for a long period of
time can experience this behavior in which animations run too fast.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this issue, download and install the Links 2001 1.21 update from
Microsoft's web site at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/links2001/downloads.asp

To work around this issue:

Run your computer for two hours or more, after a cold startup and before you
start the game, the computer's system clock will automatically countdown to zero
uptime (0:00). The game will then behave normally.

MORE INFORMATION
================


In rare cases, some computer systems report that they have been running
continuously for 24 or more days, even if they have just been restarted. In
these rare instances, Links 2001 is not able to display animations properly
under any circumstances.

Some newer Dell computer systems, manufactured after approximately May of 2001,
do not report the system uptime properly, even after a complete shutdown and
restart. If you suspect that your system is incorrectly reporting uptime, there
are several freeware and shareware utilities that allow you to verify this
behavior.
