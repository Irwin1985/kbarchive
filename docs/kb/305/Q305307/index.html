SYMPTOMS
========

You attempt to add a new user in MSN Explorer, and you receive an error message
stating that you have reached the published account size limit--nine accounts.
You may or may not have nine accounts set up on your computer; any child
accounts you may have set up and later deleted with MSN Explorer 6.0 are still
associated with the primary MSN Internet Access account on our server records.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue and the product team are working to resolve it.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the child account from the computer that has your primary account set as
the Account Manager.

Note: This procedure only works with MSN Explorer 6.1. Deleting child accounts
from MSN Explorer 6.0 does not de-associate them from the primary account. After
you have de-associated one or more of the existing child-accounts in MSN
Explorer 6.1, you will be able to add new users.

To upgrade from MSN Explorer 6.0 to MSN Explorer 6.1

Do one of the following:

- Go to http://explorer.msn.com and then click the Install It's FREE button.

- Sign in to MSN Explorer, click More Choices, click About MSN Explorer, click
  More Info, and then click the Update Now link.

Next, make sure that the primary MSN account is set as the account manager in MSN
Explorer 6.1.

To set the primary MSN account as the account manager in MSN Explorer 6.1

- On the Welcome screen, click the Add New User link to see if MSN Explorer
  asks for the password of your MSN Internet Access account.

If no account is set as the account manager, but the user tile for the account is
present, you can set your account to be the account manager by temporarily
changing the your connection settings.

To set your account to be the account manager by temporarily changing the your
connection settings

1. On the Welcome screen, click Connection Settings.

2. Click Change how to connect to the Internet, and then click Continue.

3. Click MSN dial-up Internet Access, and then click Continue.

4. Check that your dialing options are set correctly, and then click Continue.

5. Follow the instructions for configuring an MSN dial-up connection.

6. When asked which account you would like to upgrade, choose your MSN Internet
  Access account.
  After this process is complete, if you would like to go back to using another
  method to connect to the Internet, follow the steps above to change the
  connection settings, choosing Existing Internet Service Provider instead of
  MSN dial-up Internet Access.

If no account manager is set on your MSN Explorer, simply add the user tile for
the account manager account. MSN Explorer 6.1 will detect a paid MSN Internet
Access account, and will set this account as the account manager.

If another account is already set as the account manager, do one of the
following:

- Remove the tile for the other account

- Contact Technical Support to clear the account manager settings

Next, you must de-associate child accounts.

To de-associate child accounts

1. Add a user tile for any child accounts that you want to de-associate.
  Note: If you are not sure of all the associated child accounts you may have
  had, please contact Technical Support.

2. Sign in to MSN Explorer 6.1 with the user tile of the account manager
  account.

3. Click Help and Settings, click Accounts, and then click Remove Users.

4. Click the Remove link beside any child account that you want to
  de-associate.
  You receive a prompt stating "Are you sure you want to remove this account?"

5. Click OK.
  A prompt appears stating that the account has been deleted.

6. Click OK.
  You will now be returned to the Remove Users window.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 above to delete and de-associate any other child accounts
  you may have.
  Once the sub-accounts have been deleted and de-associated, you will be able to
  add new users.
