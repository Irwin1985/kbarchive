The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Visual FoxPro (VFP) 7.0 introduces the IMPLEMENTS and EVENTHANDLER
keywords. These additions to the language allow you to handle events that are
raised in a Component Object Model (COM) object's interface. This article
demonstrates some of the events that the Microsoft Agent version 2.0 control can
raise, and how VFP can work with them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Agent is preinstalled on Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows Me, and
Microsoft Windows XP. To download Agent for other platforms, and to obtain
additional characters (such as the Genie that is referenced in the code below),
see the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/products/msagent/
  (http://www.microsoft.com/products/msagent/)

The new Object Browser in VFP 7.0 allows you to view the properties, events, and
methods of COM objects, as well as constants and enumerations, classes, and
interfaces. IMPLEMENTS works with the interfaces that the Object Browser
displays.

The following steps create a class that you can use with EVENTHANDLER. At the end
is the end result of these steps, plus modifications in the Show, Hide,
RequestStart, RequestComplete, IdleStart, IdleComplete, Move, BalloonShow, and
BalloonHide methods. You will need to paste this code in your class.

1. On the Tools menu, click Object Browser.

2. Click the Open Type Library button in the upper left corner of the user
  interface.

3. If this is the first time you are running the Object Browser, wait for the
  list of COM libraries to be built.

4. Select Microsoft Agent Control 2.0 and click OK.

5. Expand AgentObjects, then expand Interfaces.

6. In the command window, type "MODIFY COMMAND impAgent" (without the quotation
  marks).

7. In the Object Browser, drag _AgentEvents to the impAgent window.

8. Review the following code, and make the specified changes to the methods in
  the class definition that you just created.

  DEFINE CLASS myClass AS SESSION OLEPUBLIC

9. Create a form to fire the events.

NOTE: Make sure that the Genie character has been installed on your computer
before you attempt to run this form.

  PUBLIC oFrmAgent

  oFrmAgent = NEWOBJECT("frmAgent")
  oFrmAgent.Show()
  RETURN

  DEFINE CLASS frmAgent AS FORM

     Height = 134
     Width = 276
     AutoCenter = .T.
     Caption = "Agent Control Form"
     Name = "frmAgent"
     oEvents1 = .NULL.
     oRequest1 = .NULL.
     oRequest2 = .NULL.

     ADD OBJECT cmdSpeak AS commandbutton WITH ;
        Top = 24, ;
        Left = 96, ;
        Height = 27, ;
        Width = 84, ;
        Caption = "Speak", ;
        Name = "cmdSpeak"

     ADD OBJECT cmdMove AS commandbutton WITH ;
        Top = 72, ;
        Left = 96, ;
        Height = 27, ;
        Width = 84, ;
        Caption = "Move", ;
        Name = "cmdMove"

     PROCEDURE INIT
        CLEAR

        WITH ThisForm
           *!* Add the Agent control to the form.
           .AddObject("oleAgent1", "OleControl", "Agent.Control")

           *!* Create the implementing class, and assign it to a form variable.
           .oEvents1 = NEWOBJECT("myClass", "impAgent.prg")

           *!* Associate the Agent control with the implementing class.
           EVENTHANDLER(.oleAgent1.Object, .oEvents1)

           *!* Load and display the characters.
           WITH .oleAgent1.Object
              .Characters.Load("Merlin", "Merlin.acs")
              .Characters("Merlin").MoveTo(10, 10)

              .Characters.Load("Genie", "Genie.acs")
              .Characters("Genie").MoveTo(100, 100)

              .Characters("Merlin").Show()
              .Characters("Genie").Show()
           ENDWITH
        ENDWITH
     ENDPROC

     PROCEDURE QueryUnload
        WITH ThisForm.oleAgent1.Object
           ThisForm.oRequest1 = .Characters("Merlin").Hide()
           ThisForm.oRequest2 = .Characters("Genie").Hide()
           DO WHILE ThisForm.oRequest1.Status != 0 AND ;
                 ThisForm.oRequest2.Status != 0
              DOEVENTS
           ENDDO

           *!* The following line is required to keep the variables in
           *!* scope until the event handler finishes. After this method
           *!* completes, the form closes, and the oRequest variables
           *!* disappear.
           WAIT WINDOW "" TIMEOUT 1  

           .Characters.Unload("Merlin")
           .Characters.Unload("Genie")
        ENDWITH
     ENDPROC

     PROCEDURE cmdSpeak.Click
        *!* The request object must remain in scope for the Agent events
        *!* to fire.
        WITH ThisForm
           .oRequest1 = .oleAgent1.Characters("Merlin").Speak("To be, " + ;
              "or not to be: that is the question.")
        ENDwith
     ENDPROC

     PROCEDURE cmdMove.Click
        ThisForm.oleAgent1.Characters("Merlin").MoveTo(300, 300)
     ENDPROC
  ENDDEFINE

After you run this form, try working with the agents by clicking both the agents
and the form buttons. You can also try getting an object reference from the
command line (oFrmAgent.oleAgent.Object) and controlling the characters
directly, and putting code in impAgent to handle the other events that occur.
