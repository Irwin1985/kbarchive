SYMPTOMS
========

You completed the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) or Digital Subscriber Line
(DSL) modem Setup for MSN Broadband DSL installation. User received the
following error:

"Our servers are very busy right now and having trouble processing your account.
Would you like to try again?"

No further options are available and you cannot proceed.

CAUSE
=====

The CPE has not yet been assigned an external Internet Protocol (IP) address on
the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network. Because you do not have an IP
address, you cannot connect to the MSN Setup Servers which are located behind
the ATM Network. If two minutes has passed, MSN Explorer will not be able to
detect the IP, even if the IP has been assigned. This can also be cause by
issues with the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MSN Broadband DSL setup application has been modified to allow up to 2
minutes for the CPE to acquire an external IP address. However, this time
allotment may not be sufficient for the CPE to acquire an IP lease.

To resolve this issue

1. Quit the MSN Explorer Setup Wizard, restart your CPE and PC, and then
  double-click on the MSN Explorer icon on your desktop.
  Note: Allow up to 2 minutes for CPE to acquire an IP lease. Watch for LNK LED
  to turn amber in color. This indicates a complete connection with the DSLAM.
  After double-clicking the MSN Explorer icon, your will receive this message:
  "Currently, there are no users specified. Click Add a New User."

2. Click Add a New User, and then entering your member ID and password.
