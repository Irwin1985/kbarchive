SUMMARY
=======

Type Director by Hewlett-Packard (HP) is a typeface and font management package.
Like other font packages, you select the typefaces and the sizes desired (in any
point size from 4 to 200 in half-point increments, depending on your application
and available system memory), and then the application builds the fonts for
you.

This package is different from others because it can create fonts for several
applications (Windows versions 2.03, 2.10, 2.11, and 3.0; Microsoft Word 4.0 and
5.0; Aldus PageMaker 1.0a and 3.0; and Ventura Publisher). Type Director creates
both printer and screen fonts for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, there are two versions of Type Director packages. The first version
does not have a version number; let's call it version 1.0 in this article. Type
Director 2.0 is the second version.

The major differences between Type Director 2.0 and Type Director 1.0 are the
following:

- Type Director 2.0 is compatible with more software packages and printers than
  the original version.

- Type Director 2.0 incorporates outline fonts for the LaserJet III instead of
  bitmaps. This increases speed and print quality.

When you install fonts for Windows, Type Director 1.0 and 2.0 adds the fonts to
your WIN.INI automatically. There is no need to use the Soft Font Installer. You
must be careful to choose Windows as the application for which you are creating
the fonts and use the Windows character set. You can create a specific typeface
and size for a specific group of characters to conserve on memory.

Type Director 1.0 and 2.0 can create reduced symbol sets also. However, if you
create a reduced symbol set that contains any symbol that is not available to
your Windows application, you won't be able to print from that application
properly.

Fonts created for another specific application cannot be used for Windows or vice
versa. You must create fonts specifically for all of your applications supported
by Type Director 2.0.

Type Director 2.0 has a utility that downloads the soft fonts that you created to
your LaserJet. This utility is not necessary when you use the Type Director
fonts with Windows. The HPPCL.DRV driver downloads the fonts for you
automatically, whether you have them installed permanently or temporarily.
