SUMMARY
=======

Borland Paradox version 3.5 does not operate in protected mode when EMM386.EXE
installed with the NOEMS switch. Paradox 3.5 can operate in protected mode with
EMM386.EXE installed if the RAM switch is used and at least 384K of expanded
memory is allocated, as follows:

  device=EMM386.EXE 384 RAM

MORE INFORMATION
================

Paradox 3.5 by Borland is an MS-DOS application which can operate either in Real
mode or in Protected mode. When operating in Protected mode, Paradox can use
Extended memory (using Int15 BIOS calls), or XMS memory (through an XMS memory
manager such as HIMEM.SYS). In addition, Paradox complies with the Virtual
Control Program Interface (VCPI), which allows a protected-mode application (a
VCPI client) to allocate memory being managed by a virtual-86 mode (80386)
expanded-memory emulator (a VCPI host), such as EMM386.EXE. If EMM386.EXE (or
any VCPI host) is installed, Paradox does not use Extended or XMS memory
directly, but instead allocates the memory from the VCPI host (EMM386.EXE). In
order for EMM386.EXE to provide this memory to Paradox (or any VCPI-compliant
application), EMM386.EXE must be managing that memory.

Loading EMM386.EXE with the RAM switch specifies a pool of memory that EMM386.EXE
is to manage, using it to emulate Expanded memory. It is this memory that
Paradox (the VCPI client) requests from EMM386.EXE (the VCPI host) for its
protected-mode operations. The size of this memory pool must be at least 384 KB
for Paradox to operate in protected mode.

NOTE: The README.TXT file from Paradox 3.5 contains the following information on
using Paradox 3.5 with 386 expanded memory managers (emulators):

  Some EMS emulators can run without allocating an EMS page frame. This lets
  you use their many extra features, particularly the ability to relocate
  drivers above 640K, even if you don't want to use EMS. QEMM's FRAME=NONE
  option has this effect, as does 386Max's NOFRAME option. If you use your EMS
  emulator this way, you must run Paradox in real mode (this is the mode it
  will run in by default). Attempting to force Paradox into protected mode in
  this situation might hang your machine.
