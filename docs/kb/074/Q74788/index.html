SUMMARY
=======

In an application designed for the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, many
C run-time functions do not work with memory allocated by the GlobalAlloc()
function when the application is developed in the small or medium memory model.

MS-DOS (non-Windows) applications written in the small or medium memory model
assume the presence of only one data segment (DS). Therefore, the C Run-time
functions assume that DS will not change.

However, an application can store data in a block of memory allocated with the
GlobalAlloc() function and locked with the GlobalLock() function. The segment
returned from GlobalLock() will be different from the application's data
segment. Specifying the alternate data segment in a C run-time function that
assumes a near pointer results in the following C compiler warning:

  WARNING: Segment Lost in Conversion

For example, the following code passes far pointers to a Run-time function
incorrectly:

     hMem = GlobalAlloc (...);
     lpMem = GlobalLock (hMem);

     strcpy (szBuffer, lpMem);

     GlobalUnlock (hMem);

This section of incorrect code produces one of two results.

1. If the offset of lpMem extends past the end of application's data segment
  (DS), the application experiences an unrecoverable application error (UAE).

2. The function copies information from some random portion of the application's
  DS into the buffer.

If the following line of code is used, the function overwrites data in the
application's data segment, which causes the application to crash or run
incorrectly:

     strcpy (lpMem, szBuffer);

Four ways to work around this situation are:

1. For the most common C run-time functions, Windows provides equivalent
  functions that use far pointers. These functions include:

     lstrcat()
     lstrcmp()
     lstrcmpi()
     lstrcpy()
     lstrlen()

2. Use the far pointer versions of these functions (_fstrcat(), _fstrcmp(), and
  so on) provided by the Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler versions 6.0 and
  later.

3. For the less common C Run-time functions, write a far-pointer version as part
  of the application code. Most of the Microsoft C Run-time library source code
  is available from Microsoft.

4. Use the large memory model.

  NOTE: Using the large memory model in Windows 3.0 had many disadvantages and
  doing so was not encouraged. These problems were corrected in Windows 3.1 and
  Microsoft C/C++ compiler. Hence, using the large memory model is not a
  problem.
