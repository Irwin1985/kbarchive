SUMMARY
=======


The following is an expanded version of the documentation of the BANDINFO escape
in earlier manuals. Refer to the index or table of contents section to determine
where the BANDINFO information is located in the current versions of the
documentation.

     short Escape(hDC, BANDINFO, nCount, lpInData, lpOutData)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Purpose
-------

Provides better communication between a banding driver and the application.

Parameters
----------

  Parameter     Definition
  ---------     ----------
  hDC           A handle to the printer display context

  nCount        Not used and can be set to NULL

  lpInData      A long pointer to a data structure that has the
                following structure:
                   typedef struct {
                       BOOL    GraphicsFlag;
                       BOOL    TextFlag;
                       RECT    GraphicsRect;
                       } BANDINFOSTRUCT;

                This data structure provides the primary
                communication between the driver and the
                application as to what (graphics and/or text)
                is actually on the page. The notes below
                describe its use.

  lpOutData     A long pointer to a data structure having the same
                items as lpInData, a BANDINFOSTRUCT

Return Value
------------

  Return Value  Result
  ------------  ------
  nResult       1 if the function is successful

                0 if the function is not successful or if the escape
                is not implemented

Notes
-----

This escape is only implemented for devices that use banding to output to the
printer. The escape is called immediately after the NEXTBAND escape, every time
the NEXTBAND escape is called.

The BANDINFO data structure is used to communicate between the driver and the
application as follows:

  Data structure  Used as lpInData            Used as lpOutData
  field           (application communicates   (driver communicates
                  to the driver)              back to the application)

  GraphicsFlag    TRUE if there are graphics  TRUE if the driver is
                  on the page                 expecting graphics in
                                              this band

  TextFlag        TRUE if there is text on    TRUE if the driver is
                  the page                    expecting text in this
                                              band

  GraphicsRect    The bounding rectangle for  No valid return data
                  all graphics on the page

This escape is always executed immediately after a NEXTBAND escape and is in
reference to the band the driver returned to that escape. Listed below are
examples of how the BANDINFO escape can be used to communicate between driver
and application.

1. On the first band, the driver gives the application a full-page band and asks
  for text only (GraphicsFlag == FALSE, TextFlag == TRUE). The application
  sends only text to the driver.

2. If in the first band the application said it had graphics (GraphicsFlag ==
  TRUE), or if the driver encountered any vector fonts, the driver will have to
  band the rest of the page. If there are no graphics or vector fonts, the next
  NEXTBAND escape returns an empty rectangle, indicating that the application
  should move on to the next page.

3. If there are graphics and no vector fonts, (that is, the application set
  GraphicsFlag == TRUE), the driver only has to band into the rectangle the
  application passed via NEXTBAND, which bounds all graphics on the page. If
  there are vector fonts, the driver bands the entire width and depth of the
  page with the TextFlag == TRUE.

The driver assumes that an application using BANDINFO sends only text in the
first full-page text band because that is all the driver asked for. Therefore,
if the driver sees a vector font or any graphics in the band, it assumes they
were generated by a text primitive and sets the TextFlag == TRUE for all of the
subsequent graphics bands to ensure that they can be output as graphics. If the
application does not meet this assumption, the image will still be generated
properly; however, some time will be wasted by sending spurious text primitives
to graphics bands.

Code Outline
------------

The general outline of a routine using BANDINFO to output a page should be as
follows:

     do {

     if (BandingDevice) {
         NEXTBAND
         BANDINFO
         }
     else {

         /* It is not a banding device. */ 

         /* Set the band to the entire page. */ 
         BandRect.left   = 0;
         BandRect.top    = 0;
         BandRect.right  = dxPrinter;
         BandRect.bottom = dyPrinter;

         /* Output everything. */ 
         BandInfoOut.GraphicsFlag = TRUE;
         BandInfoOut.TextFlag     = TRUE;
         }

         if (TextFlag) {
             Do any text.
             }
         if (GraphicsFlag) {
             Do any graphics.
             }

     } while (BandingDevice &amp;&amp;
                  more bands to do);

     /* NEWFRAME and NEXTBAND are exclusive; however, at least one must
        be used. Hence we need to do a NEWFRAME if we are not banding. */ 
     if (!BandingDevice) {

     /* Put out the page. */ 
     if ((SpoolerError = Escape(hDC, NEWFRAME, 0, 0L, 0L)) &lt;= 0) {
         Result = ConvertSpoolerError(SpoolerError);
         Escape(hDC, ABORTDOC, 0, 0L, 0L);
         goto ErrorExit3;
         }
     }
