The information in this article applies to:

- The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
   - Microsoft C for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0ax 
   - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This articles describes the naming conventions used by the C Run-time libraries
included with the products listed above.

The standard 16-bit CRT libraries are named using the following convention:
xLIBCy?.LIB, where:

  "x" represents the memory model option. The different memory model options
  are "S" for the small memory model (the default), "M" for the medium memory
  model, "C" for the compact memory model, and "L" for the large memory model.

  "y" represents the math library option. The different math library options are
  "E" for the emulator model (the default), "7" for the coprocessor model, and
  "A" for the alternate model.

  "?" represents an operating mode. The operating modes are "R" for real mode,
  "P" for protected mode, and "W" for Microsoft Windows mode. When this
  position is empty, the library is a default mode library.

The 32-bit CRT libraries are LIBC.LIB, LIBCMT.LIB, and MSVCRT.LIB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

16-bit Library Specifics
------------------------

The 16-bit Microsoft CRT libraries support 4 memory models:

- Small. There is one data segment and one code segment. This is the default
  memory model.

- Medium. There is one data segment and multiple code segments.

- Compact. There are multiple data segments and one code segment.

- Large. There are multiple data segments and multiple code segments.

The memory model is specified with the compiler options /AS, /AM, /AC, and /AL,
respectively.

The 16-bit Microsoft CRT libraries support 3 floating point options:

- Floating point emulation. This library uses an Intel math coprocessor if one
  is present in the system and emulates a coprocessor otherwise. This is the
  default.

- Coprocessor math. An Intel math coprocessor must be present in the system.
  This model has a speed advantage over the emulation model because the code is
  not required to test for the presence of a coprocessor chip. The disadvantage
  of the model is that the coprocessor chip is required.

- Alternate math. This library performs an alternate math coprocessor
  emulation. This library does not use a math coprocessor chip, even if one is
  available in the system.

The floating point option is specified with the compiler options /FPi, /FPi87,
and /FPa, respectively.

Library Search Records
----------------------

In an effort to ease the linking process for the user, the compiler puts a search
record into the object (.OBJ) file that tells the linker what libraries are
required to link the application. The search record lists only the standard
libraries. Other libraries, like GRAPHICS.LIB, are not included.

When the search record is present, the user is not required to explicitly list
libraries on the linker command line unless additional libraries are required or
if the /NOD switch is specified on the linker command line. (/NOD instructs the
linker to ignore the search record in the .OBJ file.) You can prevent the
compiler from placing a search record into the .OBJ file by specifying the /Zl
compiler option switch.

By default, SLIBCE.LIB is used. This is because small memory model, emulator
math, and no specified operating mode are the defaults.

The compiler option switches /Lr, /Lp, /Ld, and /Lw direct the compiler to
generate other library names in the library search record. For example the
compiler command line:

  cl /Lr test.c

generates a library search record for SLIBCER.LIB in the object file.

C versions 6.x
--------------

The CRT libraries provided are:

  xLIBCy?.LIB  - Standard CRT libraries. Described under Summary.

  API.LIB      - FAPI (Family Application Programming Interface)
                 routines. Applications that use only FAPI functions
                 can run with either MS-DOS or OS/2.

  CDLLOBJS.LIB - OS/2 dynamic-link library (DLL) run-time library
                 objects

  CDLLSUPP.LIB - OS/2 DLL support

  CRTCOM.LIB   - Tiny memory model library (Used to generate COM
                 files)

  EXTSUP.LIB   - Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) library (Used to build
                 applications that extend PWB)

  GRAPHICS.LIB - MS-DOS text mode graphics support

  GRTEXTP.LIB  - OS/2 text mode graphics support

  LLIBCDLL.LIB - OS/2 DLL support

  LLIBCMT.LIB  - OS/2 multi-threaded DLL support

  OS2.LIB      - OS/2 system calls library

  PGCHART.LIB  - Presentation graphics support

C/C++ versions 7.0 and 7.0a
---------------------------

The C/C++ version 7.0 CRT adds support for the Microsoft Windows operating system
and removes support for OS/2. The CRT libraries provided are:

  xLIBCy?.LIB  - Standard CRT libraries. Described under Summary.

  CRTCOM.LIB   - Tiny memory model library (Used to generate COM
                 files)

  GRAPHICS.LIB - MS-DOS text mode graphics support

  MOVETR.LIB   - Microsoft Overlaid Virtual Environment (MOVE)
                 library with TRACE.EXE support

  PGCHART.LIB  - Presentation graphics support

  xDLLCyW.LIB  - DLL library for Windows environment

  xLIBCyWQ.LIB - QuickWin application library

  xNOCRTDW.LIB - DLL initialization code library

  xNOCRTW.LIB  - Application initialization code for the Windows
                 environment

Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5x
---------------------------------------------

The CRT libraries in Visual C++ for Windows are identical to the libraries
included in C/C++ version 7.0.

Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0
--------------------------------------

The CRT libraries provided are:

  LIBC.LIB     - Single-threaded C run-time library support

  LIBCMT.LIB   - Multi-threaded C run-time library support

  MSVCRT.LIB   - Import library for the multi-threaded CRT in a DLL.
                 To run code linked with this library, the DLL
                 MSVCRT10.DLL must be available at run time.

Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.x and 4.0
-----------------------------------------------

The CRT libraries provided are identical to those provided in Visual C++ 32- bit
Edition 1.0. However, the import library MSVCRT.LIB now refers to the DLL
MSVCRT20.DLL for Visual C++ 2.x and either MSVRCT40.DLL or MSVCR40D.DLL for
Visual C++ 4.0. MSVCR40D.DLL is a debug version of the DLL for Windows NT and
Windows 95 (Win32). In addition, with Visual C++ 2.1 and above, there are two
versions of MSVCRTx0.DLL: one that targets Win32 and the other that targets
Win32s.
