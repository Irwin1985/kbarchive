SUMMARY
=======

This article clarifies some of the more commonly raised issues regarding the
APPEND command supplied with MS-DOS versions 3.x, and later.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The APPEND command is meant to trick MS-DOS-based applications, telling them
that files are not where they actually are. This is useful if you have an
application that expects a file to be in the current directory and it is
actually in some other subdirectory or drive. Programs like this usually use
FCBs internally to manipulate files (which do not relate to subdirectories), or
they have overlay or data files that are associated with the executable file and
have no mechanism for letting you specify where these files are located
(environment variables, command-line options, initialization files, installation
programs that modify the executable, etc.). The most commonly used example of
this is WordStar. Its WS.COM file looks for the file WS.OVL in the current
directory. If you have WS.COM in your \BIN directory, WS.OVL stored in your \WS
directory, and \BIN in your PATH, WordStar will not be able to find its overlay
unless you are in the subdirectory \WS when you invoke WS.COM. Other programs
can benefit from APPEND in similar ways.

APPEND tricks these programs by intercepting the following MS-DOS services:

  interrupt 21H service 0FH: FcbOpen
  interrupt 21H service 3DH: HandleOpen
  interrupt 21H service 23H: FcbGetFileSize

If you specify the /X option when you invoke APPEND, it will also intercept the
following services:

  interrupt 21H service 4BH: Exec
  interrupt 21H service 11H: FcbFindFirst
  interrupt 21H service 4EH: HandleFindFirst

When a program issues one of the calls that APPEND is trapping by trying to open
or find a file and the file does not exist, APPEND will look in its path
(specified by you when you invoke APPEND, optionally stored in the environment
table), and if it finds this file in any of the APPENDed locations, it will
return a successful open/find, tricking the application into thinking that the
file is in the current directory.

This works in our example, where WS.COM is looking for WS.OVL. However, APPEND
does distort the system. APPEND is very useful if you have it pointing to a
directory that contains only overlay and supplementary (read- only) files and
template and skeleton documents, which you intend to use as a form for new
files.

For example, you have the file MAKEFILE in many directories on your system, and
you try to create this file in your current directory with your favorite editor
(let's assume that you have APPEND pointing to one or more of the directories in
which the file MAKEFILE already exists). When your editor invokes the MS-DOS
system service HandleOpen for the file MAKEFILE in the current directory, it
will not find it. However, then APPEND starts to work and distorts the view of
the system and finds this file in another location, one of the directories in
the APPEND path.

Your editor assumes this file exists in your current directory (let's also assume
that you don't realize that this file shouldn't have existed in your current
directory). When you edit the file and then save this file, it will be saved in
the current directory, not in the directory that APPEND really got it from. Now,
depending on what you're editing, this may or may not seem beneficial. In this
case, it might have been useful to have a skeleton MAKEFILE to base your new one
on. But let's say that instead of a MAKEFILE, you were editing your list of
things to do, TODO.DOC. If you edit this file from many different places on your
system (being in different subdirectories when you edit it each time), you will
have many copies of this file, each one being different, which is most likely
what you did NOT intend to do.

Application programmers who would like to know what is going on "underneath"
APPEND have a few options. If the application is robust enough that it does not
need APPEND's talents, you could recommend that APPEND not be used with the
application. This is a good idea in most cases, since APPEND does distort the
application's view of files, and you can run into problems.

Unfortunately, there is no MS-DOS system service designed to return the FULL file
specification that APPEND returns, so if you use any of the MS- DOS services
that are intercepted by APPEND, you have to gamble that these are in the current
directory.

Many system-level programmers would like access to this. One method of gaining
more insight into what the system is doing is to determine if APPEND is
installed. This can be accomplished by using MS- DOS interrupt 2FH. The
following is a code fragment written in C that demonstrates its usage:


      /* get install status of APPEND */ 

      int GetAppendStatus()
      {

          union REGS regs;  /* input/output registers */ 

          regs.h.al = 0x00;  /* get install status */ 
          regs.h.ah = 0xB7;  /* talking to the APPEND */ 
          int86(0x2F, &amp;regs, &amp;regs);  /* invoke interrupt 2FH */ 
          return (regs.h.al);  /* return status code */ 

      } /* GetAppendStatus */ 


This MS-DOS service has the following usage:

  AL = 00H
  AH = B7H
  invoke INT 2FH
  examine AL return code

The valid return codes for this service are as follows:

  AL = 00H: Not installed, OK to install
  AL = 01H: Not installed, NOT OK to install
  AL = FFH: Installed

Once you have determined if APPEND is installed, you can then obtain the APPEND
path by looking for the MS-DOS environment variable APPEND. Unfortunately, if
APPEND is invoked without the /E option, this data will not be stored in the
MS-DOS environment. In this case, the only recourse for an application that
requires this information would be to terminate, telling you that if APPEND is
to be used, the /E option is required (this is not unreasonable, since this is
the only method for an application to access the APPEND path). Then, once you
have the value of this environment variable, you can look into the possible ways
that APPEND is altering your view of the system.

In summary, APPEND is a very useful tool if you have programs that can't find
their supplementary files. It is an annoyance to other programs, the degree of
which depends on how much is pointed to by the APPEND path. Programs that are
very critical can avoid possible problems that are raised by APPEND by checking
for its existence and warning you of possible problems that may occur due to
APPEND's system distortion.
