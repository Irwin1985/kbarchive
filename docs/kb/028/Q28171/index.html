The software interrupt routines, CALL INTERRUPT and CALL INT86old,
provide access to the DOS system services. These statements let you
make calls to the Microsoft Mouse through interrupt 51 (i.e., 33 hex).
Mouse function calls are useful for detecting the position of the
mouse, detecting the status of the mouse buttons, changing the mouse
cursor shape, changing the video page for the cursor, and other
functions.

Calling the mouse through interrupts as shown below is more flexible
than calling the MOUSE routine from the MOUSE.LIB library on the
Microsoft Mouse disk because you don't need to worry about MOUSE.LIB
changing from version to version.

This information applies to QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50 and
the Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS
OS/2 (real mode). The second example below can be used in QuickBASIC
Version 2.00, 2.01, or 3.00 if you change the statement INT86old to
INT86. INT86old is provided in QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50,
and in the BASIC compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for compatibility
with earlier QuickBASIC programs that use INT86.

CALL INTERRUPT and CALL INT86old can be used to access the ROM BIOS
and DOS-system service routines. These routines provide a range of
mouse, keyboard, video, and DOS services.

The examples below let you draw in high-resolution graphics mode
with the Microsoft Mouse. The mouse driver (MOUSE.COM) must be
installed before running these programs. MOUSE.COM is provided with
QuickBASIC.

The INTERRUPT and INT86old routines are considered external
subroutines by the compiler. The routines are located in the files
QB.LIB and QB.QLB. Programs that execute a CALL INTERRUPT or CALL
INT86old statement when compiled in the QB.EXE editor require the
presence of the QB.QLB quick library. This means that QB.EXE must be
invoked with the /L option. EXE programs that execute these statements
must be linked with the file QB.LIB. More information on the use of
CALL INTERRUPT and CALL INT86old can be found under the CALL statement
in the "Microsoft BASIC Language Reference."

Access to the software interrupts adds tremendous flexibility to BASIC
programs. However, care should be taken because BASIC does no error
checking for interrupt calls.

The interrupt 51 for Microsoft Mouse Version 6.00 (and later) is
documented in the following book:

"Advanced MS-DOS Programming," Second Edition, by Ray Duncan
(published by Microsoft Press, 1988). Pages 593-611. (The first
edition, published in 1986, does not document the mouse interrupt.)

More information regarding making mouse calls from BASIC can be found
in the "Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide," which can be ordered from
Microsoft Customer Service by calling (206) 882-8088.

Note that you can invoke mouse interrupt 51 with function 29 (1D hex),
"Select pointer page", to change the video display page for the mouse
cursor. The valid page numbers depend on the current SCREEN mode. To
change the video page of the mouse cursor in the examples below, CALL
the MOUS subprogram as follows:

   pagenum%=0   ' Change to appropriate video page for current SCREEN.
   CALL mous (29, pagenum%, 0, 0)

The following are two code examples:

1. The following code example uses the CALL INTERRUPT statement to
   call the Microsoft Mouse in QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50
   or in the Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 or 6.00b for MS-DOS
   or MS OS/2 real mode:

DECLARE SUB MOUS (m0%, m1%, m2%, m3%)
DEFINT A-Z
TYPE regtype
    ax AS INTEGER
    bx AS INTEGER
    cx AS INTEGER
    dx AS INTEGER
    BP AS INTEGER
    SI AS INTEGER
    DI AS INTEGER
    FLAGS AS INTEGER
    DS AS INTEGER
    ES AS INTEGER
END TYPE

SCREEN 2
m0 = 0: m1 = 0: m2 = 0: m3 = 0: oldx = 0: oldy = 0
CALL MOUS(m0, m1, m2, m3)             'initialize mouse
m0 = 1
INPUT "press any key to turn on mouse cursor:", x
CALL MOUS(m0, m1, m2, m3)             'turn on mouse cursor
END
SUB MOUS (m0, m1, m2, m3) STATIC
  DIM inary AS regtype
  DIM outary AS regtype
  inary.ax = m0: inary.bx = m1: inary.cx = m2: inary.dx = m3
  CALL interrupt(51, inary, outary)
  m0 = outary.ax: m1 = outary.bx: m2 = outary.cx: m3 = outary.dx
END SUB

2. The following code example uses the CALL INT86old statement to call
   the Microsoft Mouse. (Note that the INT86old found in QuickBASIC
   Versions 4.00 and 4.00b is compatible with QuickBASIC Versions
   2.00, 2.01, and 3.00 programs that use INT86. You can run this
   program in QuickBASIC Versions 2.x and 3.00 by changing INT86old to
   INT86 and removing the DECLARE statement. (Conversely, you can run
   QuickBASIC Version 2.x or 3.00 programs in Version 4.00, 4.00b, or
   4.50 by changing INT86 to INT86old.)

DECLARE SUB MOUS (m0%, m1%, m2%, m3%)
DEFINT A-Z
SCREEN 2
m0 = 0: m1 = 0: m2 = 0: m3 = 0: oldx = 0: oldy = 0
CALL MOUS(m0, m1, m2, m3)                   'initialize mouse
m0 = 1
INPUT "Press ENTER key to turn on mouse cursor:", x
CALL MOUS(m0, m1, m2, m3)                   'turn on mouse cursor
END
SUB MOUS (m0, m1, m2, m3) STATIC
  DIM regs(7)
  regs(0) = m0: regs(1) = m1: regs(2) = m2: regs(3) = m3
  CALL int86old(51, regs(), regs())
  m0 = regs(0): m1 = regs(1): m2 = regs(2): m3 = regs(3)
END SUB
