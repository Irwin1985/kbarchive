-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Mail that is sent with attachments may be sent back to the sender, and a
non-delivery report (NDR) may be generated. In some cases, the recipients still
receive the mail. The following events may be logged in the Application event
log:

  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Event Category: X.400 Service
  Event ID: 290
  Description:
  A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and diagnostic code Omit
  any diagnostic code) is being generated for message C=US;A=
  ;P=ORG;L=ServerName-#########Z-#####. It was originally destined for
  DN:/o=ORG/ou=CORP/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=USER&lt;A7&gt; (recipient number 1), and was to be
  redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 18 136] (12)

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Event Category: X.400 Service
  Event ID: 270
  Description:
  A permanent error has occurred with Entity
  /O=ORG/OU=CORP/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=ServerName/CN=MICROSOFT PRIVATE
  MDB. Entity is a Message Object is a Normal Priority Message. Object:
  #######. Message ID: C=US;A= ;P=ORG;L=ServerName-########z-##### Content
  length:####, .....

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Event Category: Transport Delivering
  Event ID: 2025
  Description:
  The delivery of a message failed due to error 0000050A. A non-delivery report
  is being sent to the message's originator.


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because of the virus scanning application programming
interface (API) mode scanner for the information store. When a message with an
attachment is sent to multiple users on the same server, the message transfer
agent (MTA) submits the message multiple times. The store "sees" these
submissions as the same message because of single instance storage; if the
message has not been scanned yet, the message issues an error back to the MTA,
which interprets the error as a communications error. The MTA then issues the
NDR.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2654.61 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this fix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the antivirus software from virus scanning
API mode to Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) mode.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

For additional information about this fix, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q282533 XADM: Exchange Server 5.5 Post-SP4 Information Store Fixes

After applying this fix. The information store will release the attachment and
pass it to MTA to deliver outgoing mail. In some cases the attachments are not
scanned completely by the Virus scan before they are released to the MTA. This
may results in infected attachment being sent via the outgoing mail. This is by
design. The Exchange AV API version 1.0 guarantees virus cleanup for incoming
mail but only commercially reasonable efforts for outgoing mail. Customers who
apply this fix should make sure that they have the Antivirus product on all of
the Messaging servers.
