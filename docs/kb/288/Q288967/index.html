-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Lotus Notes users can send messages that contain document links (DocLinks),
which are pointers to source documents that can be located on any Domino server,
to other mail users. When messages that contain DocLinks traverse across the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes to an Exchange Server environment,
the connector converts the source documents to Rich Text Format (RTF) documents
by default.

If a Notes user sends a message that contains a DocLink to an Exchange Server
user, and the DocLink points to a document that is homed on a Domino server that
is running on a UNIX operating system (such as AIX, Solaris, or Linux), the
DocLink may not be converted to RTF successfully. DocLinks that Notes users send
to other Notes users in same Domino environment are interpreted without
problems.

When the Exchange Server client receives the message from Notes, an RTF file that
contains the following text is attached to the message:

  Notes Link Description:
  Database_Name
  Notes Server:
  CN=Name_of_UNIX_Domino_Server/O=Notes_Domain_Name
  Notes Document Link was not accessible at processing time. Contact sender or
  message source to obtain document link information.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Exchange Notes Connector

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Lsntshc.dll | 5.5.2654.89 | 
+---------------------------+





WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a database replica on a Domino server that
is running on Microsoft Windows NT. If the Exchange Notes Connector cannot
access the source document on the UNIX Domino server, the Exchange Notes
Connector then searches other Windows NT-based Domino servers for replica
databases that contain the same source documents.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
