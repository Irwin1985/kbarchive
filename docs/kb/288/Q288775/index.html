-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
- Extended Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), version 1.0 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
- Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), version 1.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use MAPI or CDO to log on to an Exchange server, a dialog box prompts
you for credentials. This dialog box has the caption "Enter Password" and fields
for "User Name", "Domain Name", and "Password".

CAUSE
=====

The account that the code is running under is in a domain that is not trusted by
the Exchange Server's domain, or is not logged on to a domain at all.

RESOLUTION
==========

MAPI and CDO rely on the Exchange Message Store (EMS) provider to communicate
with Exchange. The EMS provider uses the credentials of the user that is
currently logged on to establish a remote procedure call (RPC) connection with
the Exchange server. If these credentials are insufficient to establish the RPC
connection, the provider prompts the user for additional credentials. There is
no way to pass credentials to the provider programmatically.

There are three ways to avoid this dialog box:

- Join the domain in which the Exchange server is operating. In other words,
  run the code under an account that is in the Exchange server's domain.

- Establish a trust relationship between the domain that your computer is
  running in and the domain of the other computer. If the two domains trust
  each other, they can exchange authentication information.

- Use the SendKeys method or a similar method to fill in the blanks on the
  credentials dialog box. Note that this method is not recommended, because a
  subtle change in the layout of the dialog box may break it.

The last option is the equivalent of manually filling out the credentials dialog
box. Note that because no authentication has yet taken place, there is no way to
encrypt this information; therefore, it is transmitted as plain text to the
Exchange Server.
