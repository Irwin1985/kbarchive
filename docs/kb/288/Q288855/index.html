The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 and Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) 4.0, if a user wants to log onto an FTP server by using
a domain user account, rather than a local one, they are required to precede it
with the name of the domain. However, if the user precedes an account name with
a particular set of characters, a flaw causes the FTP service to search the
domain and all trusted domains for the user account. If the user enters the
correct password for the account, they are logged into it.

Mitigating Factors:

- This vulnerability can only be exploited if the FTP server is a domain
  member. However, this is usually not appropriate for Internet-connected FTP
  servers.

- This vulnerability can only be exploited if the Guest account on the local
  computer has been disabled, and the Guest account on a trusted domain is
  enabled. By default, the Guest account is disabled in Windows NT Server 4.0
  and Windows 2000.

CAUSE
=====

If a user ID is specified in a particular way when a user logs onto an affected
FTP server, the system automatically searches all trusted domains for a user ID
that matches it. If the user ID is found and the correct password is provided,
the system will allow the user to log into it normally.
