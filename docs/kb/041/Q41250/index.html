The following information explains how to manually set up Microsoft
QuickC Version 2.00 for a hard disk. It will show you how to set up in
the same way as the SETUP.EXE program.

This information demonstrates how to set up QuickC Version 2.00 under
the directory "QC2" on Drive C. You may change the name of any
directory or the drive.

1. Create the following directories:

   C:\QC2\BIN
   C:\QC2\LIB
   C:\QC2\TMP
   C:\QC2\SAMPLES
   C:\QC2\INCLUDE
   C:\QC2\INCLUDE\SYS

2. Add the following to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   SET LIB=C:\QC2\LIB
   SET INCLUDE=C:\QC2\INCLUDE
   SET TMP=C:\QC2\TMP
   SET PATH=C:\QC2\BIN

   (You may place this in a separate batch file if you prefer.)
   Note: It is important that you do NOT add spaces in or after these
   variables. For example, "SET LIB = C:\QC2\LIB" does not work
   correctly; neither does "SET LIB=C:\QC2\LIB  " because it has
   trailing spaces at the end.

3. Add the following to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   FILES=20
   BUFFERS=20

   (You must reboot after this step for these changes to take effect.)

4. Copy the following files into C:\QC2\BIN:

                              Distribution Disk Title
   File                  5.25-Inch Disk      3.5-Inch Disk

   HELPMAKE.EXE          Setup               Setup/Learning QC
   README.DOC            Setup               Setup/Learning QC
   MSHERC.COM            Setup               Setup/Learning QC
   FIXSHIFT.COM          Setup               Setup/Learning QC

   CL.ERR                Command Line Comp   Command Line Comp/Lib 1

5. Copy the following files into C:\QC2\INCLUDE:

   *.H       (All files with the .H extension except the following:
             TYPES.H, LOCKING.H, STAT.H, TIMEB.H, UTIME.H)

   These are located on the 5.25-inch disk labeled Integrated
   Development Environment 2 and the 3.5-Inch disk labeled Integrated
   Development Environment.

6. Copy the following files into C:\QC2\INCLUDE\SYS:

   STAT.H
   UTIME.H
   TIMEB.H
   TYPES.H
   LOCKING.H

   (You will find these five files on the same disk as the other
   include files in a subdirectory called SYS.)

7. Copy the following files into C:\QC2\SAMPLES:
   (Note: This step is optional. Copy these files only if you want the
   sample programs on your hard disk.)

   CFLOW.DOC
   *.FON     (All files with the .FON extension. These are on the
             3.5-inch disk labeled Libraries 3/Fonts and the 5.25-inch
             disk labeled Fonts.)

   *.C       (All files with the .C extension. This is optional. Copy
             these files only if you want the sample programs. These
             are on the 5.25-inch disk labeled Setup and the 3.5-inch
             disk labeled Setup/Learning the MS QC Environment.

   Now you must build the combined libraries that you want to use.
   QuickC Version 2.00 supports all memory models within the
   environment.

8. Copy the following files to C:\QC2\LIB from the disk labeled
   Libraries (1, 2, 3):

   xLIBC.LIB           ("x" can be S, M, C, or L)
   xLIBFP.LIB          ("x" can be S, M, C, or L)
   EM.LIB
   LIBH.LIB
   GRAPHICS.LIB
   *.OBJ               (Any file with the .OBJ extension)

   Note: For example, if you were to build the Medium Library,
   MLIBCE.LIB, you would substitute xLIBC.LIB with MLIBC.LIB and
   xLIBFP.LIB with MLIBFP.LIB. If you wanted to build the Small
   Library, SLIBCE.LIB, you would substitute xLIBC.LIB with SLIBC.LIB
   and xLIBFP.LIB with SLIBFP.LIB. QuickC defaults to small-memory
   model, but supports Small, Medium, Compact, and Large if so
   specified. At least one library must be built.

   Assuming that you are building the Medium Library, MLIBCE.LIB, you
   would now combine these copied files using the Library Manager,
   LIB.EXE, as follows in the next step.

9. Change the directory so that you are in C:\QC2\LIB. Type the
   following at the DOS prompt:

   LIB  MLIBCE.LIB  &lt;press ENTER&gt;
   [Operations]:  +MLIBC.LIB +MLIBFP.LIB +EM.LIB&amp;  &lt;press ENTER&gt;
   [Operations]:  +LIBH.LIB +GRAPHICS.LIB +PGCHART.LIB &lt;press ENTER&gt;
   [List file]:   &lt;press ENTER&gt;

Note: The "[Operations]:" and "[List file]:" are prompts from the
Library Manager so they are not something you type in. The "&amp;" is a
continuation mark that can be used if your line grows too long.

Including the Graphics Library, PGCHART.LIB and GRAPHICS.LIB
in the combined library is optional. If you choose not to include
these libraries here, you will need to create Program Lists when
you are in the QuickC environment.

If you run into any errors using LIB.EXE, make sure you are using the
correct version. The version of the Library Manager that was shipped
with QuickC Version 2.00 is Version 3.14.

If you are having problems, try step 9 again with one change: instead
of "LIB MLIBCE.LIB", type "C:\QC2\BIN\LIB MLIBCE.LIB" and then press
ENTER.

The Library Manager, LIB.EXE, now builds the Medium library,
MLIBCE.LIB. You can delete MLIBC.LIB, MLIBFP.LIB, EM.LIB, and LIBH.LIB
from C:\QC2\LIB because they are no longer necessary. Do NOT delete
them from your distribution disks.

You now are finished setting up QuickC Version 2.00 on your hard disk.
If you would like to build other combined libraries in the future,
then you can either use the SETUP.EXE program with the /L options

   setup /L

or follow the recipe listed above for manually building them with
the Library Manager.
