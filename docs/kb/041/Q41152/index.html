Records written to disk may be lost when the same random file is
opened with more than one file handle at once.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC Versions
3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 and Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00
and 6.00b for MS-DOS and OS/2 (buglist6.00, buglist6.00b). We are
researching this problem and will post new information as it becomes
available.

There are four possible workarounds for this problem, as follows:

1. Install the MS-DOS SHARE.EXE utility prior to running the BASIC
   program.

2. Use a user-defined TYPE variable to define the buffer for writing
   instead of using a FIELD statement. The user-defined TYPE variable
   must be written to the file as the third argument of the PUT
   statement.

3. QuickBASIC Version 3.00 (or earlier) does not have the user-defined
   TYPE option or the third argument of the PUT statement; therefore,
   it cannot use workaround 2 above. An alternative is to OPEN the
   file under just one file number, write the LAST record, CLOSE the
   file, and then reOPEN it with the multiple handles.

4. Open a given file under only one file number at once. Few, if any,
   programs actually need different file numbers opened at once for
   the same file. Note that you can use multiple FIELD statements for
   the same file number as long as the FIELDed variable names are
   distinct. The following is an example:

      FIELD#1, 5 AS X$, 5 AS Y$
      FIELD#1, 10 AS Z$

The problem occurs when you have the same random file open several
times at once under different file numbers and you use the FIELD
statement to define the file buffers.

Some or all of the records written to all but the last file handle may
be lost, depending on the following criteria (where the "last" file
handle is defined as being the file handle that is opened last in
the program and is used to write a record):

1. If the file does not exist when it is opened, only records written
   using the last file handle are saved.

2. If the file already has records when it is opened, records written
   using all but the last file handle will be lost if they are written
   beyond the existing records. However, any records written over
   existing records will be saved.

3. If the file already has records when it is opened, and a record is
   written beyond the last existing record using the last file handle,
   this record becomes the effective end of file. Any records written
   up to this effective end of file will be saved. The effective end
   of file can be created at any point during program execution and
   any records written to the file previously in the program or after
   will be saved.

For example, a program opens the file "test.dat" as file handles #1,
#2, and #3 in that order. There is only one record in the file when it
initially opened. Records 1-40 are written using file handle #2, then
records 41-75 are written using file handle #1. If record number 76 is
then written out using file handle #3, all the records written (1-76)
will be saved. If record number 20 is written out by file handle #3,
only records 1-20 will be saved. Because file handle #3 was the last
one opened, it controls the effective end of file.

The following is an example program that opens the file "test.dat"
using four different file handles. It writes out 150 records using
file handle 1, and the next 150 records using file handle 2. It then
writes out record number 7 using file handle 3 and closes the file. It
then reopens the file, reads a record, then uses the DOS TYPE command
to print the contents of the file. It only prints out seven records.
Although file handle 4 is opened last, it has no effect on which
records are saved to disk because no record is written using this
handle.

The following is a source code:

CLS
SHELL "del test2.dat"
OPEN "test2.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = 52
FIELD #1, 25 AS lastname1$
LSET lastname1$ = "test record"
PUT #1, 1
CLOSE

OPEN "test2.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = 52
OPEN "test2.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #2 LEN = 52
OPEN "test2.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #3 LEN = 52
OPEN "test2.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #4 LEN = 52

FIELD #1, 25 AS lastname1$, 15 AS firstname1$, 12 AS ssn1$
FIELD #2, 25 AS lastname2$, 15 AS firstname2$, 12 AS ssn2$
FIELD #3, 25 AS lastname3$, 15 AS firstname3$, 12 AS ssn3$
FIELD #4, 25 AS lastname4$, 15 AS firstname4$, 12 AS ssn4$

LSET lastname1$ = "Doe1"
LSET firstname1$ = "John"
LSET ssn1$ = "111-22-3333"
LSET lastname2$ = "Doe2"
LSET firstname2$ = "John"
LSET ssn2$ = "111-22-3333"
LSET lastname3$ = "Doe3"
LSET firstname3$ = "John"
LSET ssn3$ = "111-22-3333"

FOR i = 1 TO 150
  PUT #1, i
NEXT i
FOR i = 151 TO 300
  PUT #2, i
NEXT i

PUT #3, 7

CLOSE
OPEN "test2.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = 52
FIELD #1, 25 AS lastname$
GET #1, 30
PRINT lastname$
CLOSE
SHELL "type test2.dat"

In the program example shown below, the correct information is written
to records 2 and 4, but not to records 1 and 3. The results are as if
the FIELD #1 statement had no effect.

The following is the source code:

CLS
KILL "test.dat"
OPEN "test.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = 10
' Add following code as work around (such as for QuickBASIC 3.00),
' where you would set n equal to the largest file to be written:
'   FIELD #1, 10 as a$
'   LSET a$=""
'   n=10
'   PUT #1,n
CLOSE #1

OPEN "test.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = 10
OPEN "test.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #2 LEN = 10
FIELD #1, 10 AS a$
FIELD #2, 10 AS b$

LSET a$ = "firstpart"
PUT #1, 1
LSET b$ = "second"
PUT #2, 2
LSET a$ = "third"
PUT #1, 3
LSET b$ = "fourth"
PUT #2, 4
CLOSE

OPEN "test.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1 LEN = 10
FIELD #1, 10 AS a$
GET #1, 1
PRINT a$
GET #1, 2
PRINT a$
GET #1, 3
PRINT a$
GET #1, 4
PRINT a$
