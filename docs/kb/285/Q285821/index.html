SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, a browser may appear to stop responding (hang) when
you attempt to connect to an IIS Web server over an SSL connection. However,
other browsers may be able to connect successfully from a different location
(for example, a different physical connection than the failing browser). No
error messages or events occur, and IIS works as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the client is on a network that does not allow TCP
packets above a certain payload (for example, 1,400 bytes) and the Web server is
trying to send TCP packets that are over this limit (for example, 1,460 bytes).
This can be caused by a middle-tier device, such as a Load Balancer, when it is
unable to forward ICMP packets that are destined for the Web server where it
needs to fragment a packet (or set the packet size smaller) in order to
successfully transmit it. This causes the Web server to continually send TCP
Acknowledgements to the client as retransmits; however, these packets never get
back to the client. This is known as a "black hole" router.

RESOLUTION
==========

Under usual circumstances, this should be addressed at the router or middle-tier
device; however, in some cases, this cannot be done and will need to be
addressed at the Web server itself.

To verify that this is indeed the problem, Microsoft recommends that you issue
the following ping command to the client that is failing from the Web server:

  "ping 'client IP' -f -l 'payload size'" (without the quotation marks)

It is best to test this with the largest packet size possible (for example, 1,490
bytes), and then work down to find the largest size that will pass through
without fragmentation. For additional information, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q159211 Diagnoses and Treatment of Black Hole Routers

If you need to make a modification for TCP payload, it may be necessary to set
the Max Transfer Unit (MTU) to a lower value by adding the following registry
entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\Adapter
  GUID
  Value = MTU
  Date = dword: 00000578 (1400 decimal)

In addition, it may be beneficial to implement the following registry parameters
in place of the one above, so that the payload is modified if TCP
Acknowledgements go unanswered:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SYSTEM \CurrentControlSet \Services \Tcpip \Parameters\

EnablePMTUBHDetect

  Key: Tcpip\Parameters
  Value Type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
  Valid Range: 0,1 (False, True)
  Default: 0 (False)

EnablePMTUDiscovery

  Key: Tcpip\Parameters
  Value Type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
  Valid Range: 0,1 (False, True)
  Default: 1 (True)

  NT

MORE INFORMATION
================

These same symptoms may occur with non-SSL connections. However, it is much less
likely because SSL tends to have a larger payload. If you suspect you are having
this problem with non-SSL connections, use the same procedures described in the
"Resolution" section of this article, as well as the information in this
section.

By obtaining a Network trace, you can determine if there is a pattern as to why
this condition is occurring. To install and run Network Monitor, see:

  Q148942 How to Capture Network Traffic with Network Monitor

By reviewing a Network trace between the Web server and the middleware device
(Load Balancer), you may be able to determine if there is anything that could
cause the condition at the client. This is an SSL enabled connection. Therefore,
all data will be encrypted, but will not be a total loss. The first thing to
look for is the presence of any TCP retransmits. These are identical packets
that are sent repeatedly due to no response from the remote connection (client).
These packets will look similar to the following example:

  

  TCP: .A...., len: 1460, seq:3614110526-3614111986, ack:2344064903, win:17031, src:  443  dst: 1354

There may be four or five (maybe more) of these exact packets that are sent to
the client without any acknowledgement. This indicates that a TCP retransmit is
occurring. The next thing to look for is the length of the payload denoted by
len: &lt;value&gt; (1,460 bytes in the example above). Because all of the other
data is passing through at much smaller amounts and the only thing retransmitted
are these larger packets, it indicates that these packets are being dropped,
most likely at a router or a middle-tier device. This can also be confirmed with
a trace on the client side to determine if these packets indeed are arriving
there. If not, a drop condition is occurring somewhere between the client and
server. By following the steps outlined in the "Resolution" section, you may be
able to determine the proper size that will pass through successfully.
