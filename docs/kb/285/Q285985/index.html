SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in
Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 and Internet Information Services (IIS)
5.0. Under very unusual conditions, this vulnerability can allow an attacker to
read fragments of files from a Web server.

This vulnerability involves a new variant of the "File Fragment Reading via .HTR"
vulnerability, which is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS00-044)
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-044.asp). Like the
other variants, this one may allow an attacker to request a file in a way that
causes it to be processed by the .htr ISAPI extension. The result of this is
that fragments of server-side files such as .asp files may potentially be sent
to the attacker. There is no capability through this vulnerability to add,
change, or delete files on the server, or to access a file without permissions.

There are a number of significant restrictions on this vulnerability:

- During normal .htr processing, the effect is to strip out the very data that
  would be the most likely to contain sensitive information.

- There must be zeros fortuitously located in the server memory in order for
  the file fragments to be sent.

- If best practices have been followed regarding the need to avoid ever storing
  sensitive information in .asp and other server-side files, there should be no
  sensitive information in the files to begin with.

Customers who have previously disabled the .htr functionality are not affected by
this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that all customers disable .htr
functionality, unless there is a business-critical reason for keeping it. For
the latter group of customers, a patch is available that eliminates this
vulnerability.
