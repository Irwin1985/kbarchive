SYMPTOMS
========

When you play one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, you
may receive any of the following error messages:

   - EXCEPTION: Access violation in PopupMsg::ONMBDOWN()

   - STOP: Cannot create Resource\pilots\&lt;username&gt;\games\&lt;Mission
  name&gt;.mw4

   - STOP: File not found Resource\props.mw4

   - The game could not be saved. Free some disk space and try again.

   - This feature will not work in the trial version.

   - Could not load keymap file default.map. Default keymap will be used instead.

   - Dlgalert.bmp Cannot Be Loaded.

   - Can't find file agencyfb20.d3f

   - Cannot find the file assets\graphics\agencyfb14.d3f.

Or, for Age of Empires 2, you may receive the following error message:

  The scenario could not be loaded.

NOTE: This happens with the second campaign, once you've beaten the first one.

Or, when you finish a race, the game may stop responding (hang) or your mouse
pointer may disappear.

Or, when joining a CFS1 or CFS2 multiplayer session you may receive an error
stating that some planes are unavailable or locked even though those planes are
unlocked in the Multiplayer settings on the Host computer.

Or, you may lose keyboard functions within the game. And, upon going to the
options menu to reassign keyboard assignments, you may find that the keyboard
assignments are cleared out and non-configurable.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Wsock32.dll file on your computer is infected
with the W95.Hybris worm virus.

NOTE: This can also occur if the wsock32.dll is corrupted.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, run anti-virus software that contains the latest virus
signature file, and perform a thorough scan of your computer.

Support for this particular virus is available from many anti-virus programs.

After you detect and remove the virus, extract a new copy of the Wsock32.dll
file. Use the steps below for your version of Windows operating system.

Microsoft Windows Millennium (Me)
---------------------------------

The Windows Me system files are protected. To extract protected files, follow the
steps given in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q265371 How to Extract and Replace a Protected File in Windows Me

In Microsoft Windows 98
-----------------------

1. Click Start, click Run, type "sfc" (without the quotation marks) in the Open
  box, and then click OK.

2. Click "Extract one file from the installation disk".

3. Type "c:\windows\system\wsock32.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Start.

4. In the "Restore from" box, type "c:\windows\options\cabs" (without the
  quotation marks) or browse to the Win98 folder on your Windows 98 CD-ROM.

5. Click OK, and then click Skip to skip the back up of the file. (If you click
  OK, you might back up the virus.)

6. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation, and then
  restart the computer.

The Wsock32.dll file is located in the Precopy1.cab cabinet file on the Windows
98 CD-ROM.

In Microsoft Windows 95
-----------------------

The Wsock32.dll file can be found in the following CAB files:

- Win95_11.cab on the Windows 95 CD-ROM

- Win95_18.cab on the Windows 95 OSR2 CD-ROM

- Win95_12.cab on the Windows 95 DMF disks

- Win95_19.cab on the Windows 95 non-DMF disks

To extract the Wsock32.dll file, from the Windows 95 CD-ROM:

1. Click Start, click "Shut down", and then click "Restart in MS-DOS mode".

2. Either type

  extract /a c:\windows\options\cabs\win95_11.cab wsock32.dll /l
  c:\windows\system

or

Insert your Windows 95 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive, and then type

  extract /a &lt;d&gt;:\win95\win95_11.cab wsock32.dll /l c:\windows\system

where &lt;d&gt; is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

In Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
---------------------------

1. Rename the Wsock32.dll file in the Windows\System32 folder to Wsock32.old.

For information about how to rename a file, click Start, click Help, click the
Index tab, type "renaming" (without the quotation marks), and then double-click
the "Renaming files" topic.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Command Prompt

3. Type "cd\" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

4. Insert the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, and then close the
  Windows NT Setup screen if it is displayed.

5. Type the following line at the command prompt, and then press ENTER:

  expand &lt;drive&gt;:\i386\wsock32.dl_
  c:\&lt;windows&gt;\system32\wsock32.dll

where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter assigned to your CD-ROM drive, and where
&lt;windows&gt; is the name of the folder in which Windows NT 4.0 is installed.

6. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER to return to
  windows.
