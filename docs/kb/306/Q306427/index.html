The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 (DB2OLEDB) that is
included with Host Integration Server 2000 to do an INSERT into a DB2 table from
a SQL linked server and you are doing this by SELECTing data from a Microsoft
SQL Server table by using either a four-part naming convention or OPENQUERY, an
access violation (AV) occurs.

This problem can occur when the INSERT contains more than 145 columns.

SQL Server may generate a stack dump and write out information to the ERRORLOG
file and a symptom dump file when the access violation occurs. The beginning of
the stack dump in the ERRORLOG file may appear similar to the following:

  Stack Dump being sent to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL
  Server\MSSQL\log\SQL00097.dmp
  2001-07-18 13:35:24.59 spid54 Error: 0, Severity: 19, State: 0
  2001-07-18 13:35:24.59 spid54 SqlDumpExceptionHandler: Process 54 generated
  fatal exception c0000005 EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION.
  SQL Server is terminating this process..

  Short Stack Dump
  752150B1 Module(MSEIDRDA+000150B1)
  (std::deque&lt;Xo2Db2Token,std::allocator&lt;Xo2Db2Token&gt;
  &gt;::erase+00000321) 11E04010 Module(UNKNOWN+00000000)

NOTE: The INSERT into the DB2 table actually completes successfully even though
the access violation occurs.

CAUSE
=====

If the INSERT has more than 145 columns, a pointer is being overwritten when the
OLE DB Provider's SQL parser is trying to clean up its queue after the INSERT
has been processed. The overwriting of the pointer results in the access
violation. Because this occurs after the INSERT is processed, the DB2 table is
successfully updated by the INSERT command.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+-------------------------------------+
| File name    | Date       | Time    | 
+-------------------------------------+
| Db2oledb.dll | 08/10/2001 | 09:10AM | 
+-------------------------------------+
| Mseidrda.dll | 08/10/2001 | 09:10AM | 
+-------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
