SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Network Security Hotfix Checker (Hfnetchk.exe) tool determines a
computer's patch status by evaluating the presence of specific registry keys,
file versions, and file checksums that are associated with a given hotfix. There
are some instances where Hfnetchk.exe is not able to determine the patch
installation status because the detailed file and registry key information is
not available for the specified security bulletin or patch. A NOTE message that
is similar to the following NOTE message is generated in instances where the XML
data file does not contain this information:

  NOTE MS01-022 Q296441
  Please read KB article 306460

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE messages do not indicate that the computer that is being scanned is
insecure, they indicate that Hfnetchk.exe is technically not able to determine
if the appropriate patch or workaround has been applied. Remediation of these
issues usually involves a configuration change or workaround rather than a
patch. You may ignore NOTE messages once you have applied the patch or evaluated
your system and made any needed configuration changes. NOTE messages are
returned for the following security bulletins:

Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0 Computers
-----------------------------------------

MS01-022 (Q296441): This patch updates the Msdaipp.dll file to version
8.103.4004. In a typical patch situation, the Mssecure.xml file would contain
this file name, file version and checksum. If the system that is being scanned
contained this file, but didn't match the exact file version and checksum, the
patch would be considered to be not found. However, with respect to this
particular patch, these details cannot be stored in the XML file without
generating false positives during the scan. Specifically, several Microsoft
Office programs include non-vulnerable versions of this file that are versioned
greater than 8.103.4004. Hfnetchk.exe would interpret this higher version number
as a fileversion and checksum mismatch and would report a WARNING message that
states that the fileversion was greater than expected. To reduce the number of
false positive WARNING messages that are generated by this tool, the file
details were not entered into the XML database. To verify that you are not
vulnerable to this issue, you should verify that you are running a version of
this file that is 8.103.4004 or greater. If this is the case, you may ignore
this NOTE message.

Windows NT 4.0 Computers
------------------------

MS98-001 (Q169556): This security bulletin describes a tool you can run to
provide increased security over Windows NT 4.0 local groups. The use of this
tool does not modify any files on the computer, and it does not create any
registry keys. Because of this, Hfnetchk.exe is not able to determine if this
tool has been run. You are encouraged to read the security bulletin to determine
if you should run this tool. After you make this determination and take the
appropriate actions, you may disregard this NOTE.

MS99-036 (Q155197): This security bulletin describes a potential vulnerability on
Windows NT 4.0 computers that were installed by using unattended installation
mechanisms. Specifically, sensitive information may have been written to one of
two files (%windir%\system32\$nt4pre$.inf or %windir%\system32\$winnt$.inf).
There is no patch for this issue and nothing that Hfnetchk.exe can validate
during its checks. Instead, you are encouraged to review these files (if they
exist) and delete any references to sensitive information (such as user names
and passwords). If neither of these files exist, or they do not contain
sensitive information, you may ignore this NOTE.

MS99-041 (Q242294): This security bulletin describes a vulnerability in the
RASMAN service on Windows NT 4.0 computers. A patch was not issued for this
bulletin, instead, a tool was released. This tool modifies a security descriptor
for the RASMAN service, but does not modify any system files or create any
registry keys. Hfnetchk.exe does not examine security descriptors that are
related to services and is not able to determine if the tool has been run. You
are encouraged to review the security bulletin and run the tool as appropriate.
You may ignore this NOTE message once you have executed the tool or determined
that this is not necessary for your system.

IIS 4.0 Computers
-----------------

MS99-025 (Q184375): This security bulletin describes a vulnerability in the MDAC
components on an IIS 4.0 Web server. As the bulletin states, the solution to
this issue involved a configuration change rather than a specific patch. Several
different workarounds are available for this vulnerability. As this is not
rectified by a standard patch, Hfnetchk.exe is not able to determine if this
vulnerability has been addressed, or if the suggested workarounds have been
applied. You are urged to read the security bulletin and follow the suggestions
in it. Once you have taken the appropriate measures on this computer, you may
disregard this NOTE.

MS00-025 (Q259799): This security bulletin describes a vulnerability in the
Dvwssr.dll file. A patch was not issued to correct this issue, however, the
bulletin describes a workaround you can follow to correct this issue.
Specifically, the bulletin suggests that you delete this file if it is not
needed on your computer. You are encouraged to read the security bulletin for
more information about this issue and take the necessary steps to resolve the
issue. Once you review the bulletin and take the appropriate steps, you may
ignore this NOTE.

MS00-028 (Q260267): This security bulletin is similar to the preceding MS99-025
security bulletin. Once you have followed the actions for either MS00-028 or
MS99-025, you may disregard this NOTE message.

Internet Explorer and SQL Server Computers
------------------------------------------

NOTE messages may appear for specific Internet Explorer or SQL bulletins. The
file and registry key details for some of these bulletins have not yet been
entered into the XML file. These details will be populated in future versions of
the XML file. Missing data for Internet Explorer bulletins relate primarily to
Internet Explorer 4.x and Internet Explorer 5.0 patches. Internet Explorer 5.01
and Internet Explorer 5.5 patches should contain full patch details.

How to Suppress NOTE Messages
-----------------------------

Once you have reviewed each of the security bulletins that are associated with
NOTE messages and have taken the appropriate steps to rectify the issues, you
may choose to suppress NOTE messages from Hfnetchk.exe output. To suppress these
messages, use the "-S 1" (without the quotation marks) switch as with the
"hfnetchk -v -s 1" (without the quotation marks) command.
