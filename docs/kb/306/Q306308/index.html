-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are limiting logons to the information store (which is described in
article Q146764, which is referenced in the "More Information" section of this
article) without adding the distinguished name (DN) for the Internet Mail
Service (IMS), the IMS does not start and you may receive an error similar to
the following:

  Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service service on
  \\servername
  Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

In addition, the following events are logged in the Event Viewer Application
log:

  Event ID: 1023
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Failure Audit
  Category: Logons
  Description:
  DOMSTW\exchservice was validated as
  /o=MicrosoftCE/ou=northitaly/cn=Configuration/cn=Connections/cn=Internet Mail
  Connector (NTSTEFANWI1) but was unable to log on to
  /o=MicrosoftCE/ou=northitaly/cn=Configuration/cn=Connections/cn=Internet Mail
  Connector (NTSTEFANWI1)

  Event ID: 4018
  Type: Error
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Description:
  Unable to start the Internet Mail Connector service because MAPI could not be
  initialized.

  Event ID: 4116
  Type: Error
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Description:
  An error was returned from the messaging software, the Internet Mail Service
  uses, to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is possible
  that the piece of mail being processed at the time will not be delivered. The
  message that was being processed has been moved to the "BAD" folder. Use the
  appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to
  view and manipulate these messages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Exchange Server Service Account does not have
permission to log on to the information store.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, add the DN for the IMS to the registry:

1. Stop the information store service on the Exchange Server computer.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

4. Select the following registry value:

  Value Name: Logon Only As
  Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ

5. Add the distinguished name of the IMS.

  For example:

  /o=your_organization_name/ou=your_site_name/cn=Configuration/cn=Connections/cn=Internet
  Mail Connector (IMS_Server_Name)

6. Click OK.

7. Quit Registry Editor.

8. Restart the information store service and the IMS.
