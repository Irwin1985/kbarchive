-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 site stores a large number of status
messages that meet the "delete aged status message" criteria, the act of
deleting those status messages may leave orphaned status message insertion
strings and attributes in the SMS database.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS database monitor is the process that is responsible for the deletion of
aged status messages from the database. During the deletion process, if more
than 1,000 status messages meet the deletion criteria (see the "Additional
Information" section in this article for more information about this), the first
1,000 status messages are deleted, but may orphan related insertion strings and
attributes that are related to the status messages. These are located in two
Microsoft SQL Server database tables that can eventually consume a lot of
database space.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The Delete Aged Status Messages task (available by opening Site Settings, opening
Database Maintenance, and then clicking Tasks) is enabled by default to delete
aged status messages daily (between 12:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M.). When it is run by
the SMS database monitor, the routine to delete aged status messages deletes up
to 1,000 aged status messages if their expiration time is met. If more than
1,000 aged status messages exist, only the first 1,000 are deleted in that
batch. This is an effort by the SMS database monitor not to delete all expired
status messages in one operation because doing so could result in an attempt to
delete tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of status messages at one time in
large hierarchies. That would have a negative impact on SQL Server performance
and transaction log usage during this time.

The default age for SMS status messages to be stored in the database is
determined by Status filter rules. The following two default Status filter rules
are applied by default:

- Write audit messages to the site database and keep them for 180 days

- Write all other messages to the site database and keep them for 30 days

To determine if an SMS primary site is exhibiting the symptoms that are described
in this article, run the following SQL queries against the SMS database by using
ISQL/W:

- If the following query returns a non-zero value, there are orphaned records
  in the StatusMessageInsStrs table:

  Select Count(*) From StatusMessageInsStrs Where RecordID Not In (Select
  RecordID From StatusMessages)

- If the following query returns a non zero-value, there are orphaned records
  in the StatusMessageAttributes table:

  Select Count(*) From StatusMessageAttributes Where RecordID Not In (Select
  RecordID from StatusMessages)
