SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to establish a connection from a Windows 2000-based computer
to a Windows 98-based computer, or vice versa, by using the Direct Cable
Connection feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, following these troubleshooting steps for the Direct
Cable Connection feature:

1. Make sure that both the Client for Microsoft Networks protocol and the File
  and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks protocol are installed on both
  computers:

   - For Windows 2000

     a. Right-click My Network Places, and then click Properties.

     b. Double-click Make New Connection, and then specify "Connect directly to
        another computer" as the connection type.

     c. Make sure that the user name that is checked is name of the user who
        will establish the connection if the Windows 2000-based computer is to
        be used as host. By default, the two relevant protocols will be
        installed if they are not already installed.

   - For Windows 98

     a. Right-click Network Neighborhood, and then click Properties.

     b. Make sure that Dial-Up Adapter is installed.

     c. Make sure that the two relevant protocols appear in the list of
        installed network components.

2. Verify that the cable that you are using is compatible with direct cable
  connections.

3. Reverse the roles of Host and Guest on the two computers.

4. Check for conflicts with the ports. In Device Manager, verify that the ports
  are not already in use.

5. If the parallel port direct cable connection becomes disconnected after a
  short time, apply Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 or later.
