The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You restore an Exchange Server 5.5 directory from offline backup and you want to
try to play the log files forward. When you try to start the Exchange 5.5 Server
directory service, the service does not start, and the following event ID
messages are logged in the Application event log:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: ESE97
  Event Category: (7)
  Event ID: 0
  Description:
  MSExchangeDS (256) Unexpected Win32 error: 0x6

  -and-

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeDS
  Event Category: (9)
  Event ID: 1002
  Description:
  The Microsoft Exchange Server database (EDB) could not be initialized and
  returned error -1022. Unrecoverable error, the directory can't continue.

After these event ID messages are logged, you can start the Exchange directory
service and you do not receive any errors.

You stop the Exchange directory service again, restore the same offline backup a
second time, and then try to play the log files forward a second time. When you
try to start the Exchange directory service, the service does not start, and the
following event ID messages are logged in the Application event log:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: ESE97
  Event Category: (1)
  Event ID: 145
  Description:
  MSExchangeDS (294) The database engine could not access the file called
  E:\exchsrvr\DSADATA\dir.edb.

  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: ESE97
  Event Category: (3)
  Event ID: 132
  Description:
  MSExchangeDS (294) Unable to read header of database
  E:\exchsrvr\DSADATA\dir.edb. Error -1032. Database may have been moved.
  Recovery will continue with the database in the new location.

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeDS
  Event Category: (9)
  Event ID: 1002
  Description:
  The Microsoft Exchange Server database (EDB) could not be initialized and
  returned error -1032. Unrecoverable error, the directory can't continue.

After these error occur, the Exchange directory service no longer starts unless
you revert to a previous backup.

NOTE: Error -1022 is Jet_errDiskIO and Error -1032 is Jet_errAccessDenied. For a
full list of ESE error codes, click the article number below to view the article

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the recovery process tries to attach to the
database two times. When the recovery process tries to attach the second time,
it does not respond and you receive the -1032 error because the recovery process
is already attached to the database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, perform online backups, in addition to offline or
snapshot backups of the Exchange Directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The -1032 errors indicated in the event ID messages only occur if the following
conditions are true and occur in the following sequence:

1. Before you restore the Exchange directory files, you stop the directory
  service cleanly by using Service Control Manager, or the equivalent command.

2. After you restore the Exchange directory files from offline backup, you
  remove the checkpoint file (Edb.chk) and leave sequential logs in place so
  that you can play forward.

3. When you start the directory service at this point, the directory service
  stops responding and you receive the -1022 error. However, you can start the
  directory service after this error.

4. You stop the directory service cleanly, or the service stops responding and
  have not created a new offline or online backup.

5. You restore the same offline backup or another copy of the offline backup of
  the directory a second time, remove the checkpoint file (Edb.chk), and you
  maintain the sequential logs so that you can play forward.

6. When you start the directory service, the directory service does not respond
  and you receive the -1032 error.

These event ID messages and errors do not occur when you restore the Exchange
Server 5.5 information store from offline or snapshot backups. This behavior
only occurs when you restore the Exchange directory from an offline backup.
