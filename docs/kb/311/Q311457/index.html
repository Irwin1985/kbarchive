SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to upgrade to Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
Service Pack 4 (SP4).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you upgrade SMS 2.0 with SP4, the steps to upgrade may vary depending on
the status of your current SMS 2.0 installation. Please read these instructions
completely before you download SP4 for SMS 2.0.

NOTE: SMS 2.0 SP4 and all future SMS service packs require that SMS 2.0 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) be installed before you upgrade. Microsoft recommends that you
install the SMS 2.0 SP2 Full Installation compact disc (CD). Information about
how to obtain this CD is available later in this article.

SMS 2.0 SP4 supports the following installation methods:

- You perform a new secondary site installation by using the SMS SP4 CD source.

- You perform an SMS Administrator console installation by using the SP4 CD
  source.

- You perform a primary site upgrade from an existing SMS 2.0 SP2 or Service
  Pack 3 (SP3) site.

- You perform a secondary site upgrade from an existing SMS 2.0 SP2 or SP3
  secondary site.

- You perform an SMS Administrator console upgrade from an existing SMS 2.0 SP2
  or SP3 console.

- You remove an SMS 2.0 SP4 site.

- You modify or reset an SMS 2.0 SP4 site.

SMS 2.0 SP4 does not support the following methods:

- You try to upgrade a primary site installation that does not have an existing
  SMS 2.0 SP2 or SP3 site. Note that SP4 can only upgrade a primary site.

- You try to upgrade an installation that uses an SP4 installation image to add
  optional components to an SP2 or SP3 site.

SMS 2.0 SP4 requires either SP2 or SP3 for installation. If you are upgrading an
SMS 2.0 primary site, secondary site, or Administrator console that has not
already been upgraded to SP2, you must first upgrade the site or console to SP2,
and then upgrade it to SP4.

For additional information about how to determine if the SMS-based server has SP2
installed, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q266130 SMS: Component Versions in Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0

You can obtain SMS 2.0 SP2 by using any of the following methods:

- If you are a member of a volume program such as Open or Select, you can order
  the SP2 Full Installation CD by calling 1-800-248-0655.

- If you are a retail customer, you can order the SP2 Full Installation CD as
  replacements for existing Service Pack 1 (SP1) or no service pack (noSP)
  media by calling Microsoft Sales at 1-800-426-9400.

- The SP2 Full Installation CD is included with all new SMS 2.0 Server
  Licenses.

- The SP2 Full Installation CD is located in the August 2000 issue of Microsoft
  Select.

- The SP2 Full Installation CD is included with all SMS products that are
  shipped after July 2000.

- Visit the following Microsoft Web site to download the SP2 Upgrade image:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/servicepacks/sms20sp2/default.asp

  NOTE: The SP2 Upgrade CD can be also be ordered from this Web site.

- The SP2 Upgrade CD is located in the August 2000 issue of TechNet.

If your SMS 2.0 installation already has SP2 or SP3 installed, visit the
following Microsoft Web site to download SP4:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/servicepacks/sms20sp4/default.asp

SP4 (like SP3) does not use the CD Patch tool that is used in the SP1 and SP2
downloads.

NOTE: Several fixes (QFEs) have been issued for SP3 that are not included in SP4.
If you have installed any of these SP3 fixes and apply SMS 2.0 SP4, your
installation will revert back to its original functionality and you will need to
apply an update to your installation of SP4 (when the update becomes available).
