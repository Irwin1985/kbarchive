The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client to a Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 backup domain controller, the following symptoms may occur:

- The Microsoft Windows 2000 primary domain controller emulator for that domain
  may experience high CPU utilization in the Lsass.exe process.

- Replication may be delayed.

CAUSE
=====

During the installation of the SMS client to domain controllers, several
accounts are created, including SMS#_&lt;computer name&gt; and
SMS&amp;_&lt;computer name&gt;. These accounts are added to the
SMSInternalCliGrp domain global group. The SMSInternalCliGrp domain global group
is set as their primary group, and the accounts are then removed from domain
users. If a large numbers of users exist in domain users, removal of an account
from this group causes too much replication work for the Windows 2000 primary
domain controller emulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains these files may also contain additional files.



To install the hotfix, use either of the following methods.

Using the Hotfix Installer
--------------------------

NOTE: This method only works on Intel-based platforms.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. The Q311127.exe
  file is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on
  your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative rights.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Start Q311127.exe, and then follow the directions in the wizard. You can run
  the program in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Manual Installation
-------------------

1. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative rights.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console, and then stop all SMS services.

3. Replace the following files in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt;
  folder with the versions that you obtained from the hotfix:

   - Ccm.dll

   - Ccim32.dll

   - Clibase.dll

   - Cliex32.dll

   - Clisvc95.exe

   - Clisvcl.exe

   - Bindclin.dll

   - Cqmgr32.dll

   - Launch32.exe

   - Mslmclin.dll

   - Ndsclin.dll

   - Odpsys32.exe

   - Odpusr32.exe

   - Odpwin9x.exe

   - Smsapm32.exe

4. Replace the following files in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\inboxes\clicomp.src\BASE\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  versions that you obtained from the hotfix:

   - Ccmcore.exe

   - Clicore.exe

5. Replace the Compver.ini file in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base
  folder with the version of the Compverbase.ini file that you obtained from
  the hotfix. Note that you must rename Compverbase.ini to Compver.ini.

6. Replace the Apasetup.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with
  the version that you obtained from the hotfix.

7. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder with the version of the
  Compversmsapm32.ini file that you obtained from the hotfix. Note that you
  must rename Compversmsapm32.ini to Compver.ini.

8. Replace the SWDist32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version obtained from the hotfix.

9. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist folder with the version of the
  Compverswdist.ini file that you obtained from the hotfix. Note that you must
  rename Compverswdist.ini to Compver.ini.

10. An NT_Logon_Server_Manager (LSM) polling cycle must occur to cause the
  hotfixed files to be propagated to all of the logon points so that new
  clients will be installed by using the hotfixed files. In SMS 2.0 Service
  Pack 2 (SP2) and later, LSM was changed so that it does not perform a
  polling cycle when the SMS Executive service is stopped and restarted. To
  force LSM to perform a polling cycle when the LSM thread or SMS Executive
  service is stopped and restarted, set the following registry value to 0
  (zero), and then restart all of the SMS services:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER\Last
  Update Cycle

At the end of the polling cycle, the Last Update Cycle value is reset. All logon
points must be updated before you try to install new clients.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the files that
are in this hotfix to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process,
you can stop and then restart the SMS Client Service on each client. You can
also create a software distribution by using the Setevnt.exe or the Cliutils.exe
Resource Kit tools. You must include the appropriate parameters to start a CCIM
work cycle. For information about the proper syntax for these tools, see the
Resource Kit documentation.

Additional Settings
-------------------

To relieve the primary domain controller emulator from excessive replication work
and reduce replication traffic, this hotfix provides a method to configure SMS
to leave automatically-created client bootstrap and service accounts in the
domain users global group.

You must configure a value on the primary domain controller emulator in Windows
2000 Active Directory because the client installation reads the value directly
from the primary domain controller's registry. You must insert the registry
value only on the primary domain controller emulator. To determine which
computer is the primary domain controller emulator:

1. Start Active Directory Users and Computers.

2. Right-click the domain, and then click Operations Master.

3. The primary domain controller emulator is listed on the PDC tab under
  Operations Master.

To configure the appropriate value:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) only on the primary domain controller
  emulator.

2. Locate and then click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Domain
  Controller

3. Add the following value:

  Value name: Enable Domain User Group Membership
  Data type: DWORD
  Value: 1, or any non-zero value

If this value exists, SMS does not try to remove the accounts it creates for
client installations on domain controllers from the Domain Users group. This
satisfies the specific goal of reducing replication activity in the domain, and
this reduces the load on the primary domain controller emulator.

Additionally, if the account already exists, the password is still reset to
improve security, and the following checks occur:

- If the account is already a member of the SMSCliInternalGrp, it is not
  re-added, and this reduces replication activity.

- If the account already has the SMSCliInternalGrp as its primary group, it is
  not changed, and this reduces replication activity.

- If the account is not a member of the Domain Users group, no attempt is made
  to remove it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
