The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SUMMARY
=======

The SNA Server Host Account Synchronization Integration process has several
services that must be installed and operational for password synchronization
and/or single sign on to work properly. The Windows NT Password Synchronization
service, the Host Account Cache, and the Host Account Synchronization service
all must run under a single user account, therefore what account and what domain
the account is to reside is important in multi-domain environments. Note that
all SNA Servers that require access to these services should run under this
account as well. In all cases Host Account Synchronization service will be
installed on the same machine as SNA Server via the SNA setup process. The
Windows NT Password Synchronization service and Host Account Cache service have
a separate install from that of the Host Account Synchronization service. The
separate setup process is necessary because depending on the domain and SNA
Server environment these services may not necessary be running on the SNA Server
machine. This article outlines where these services should be installed within a
single domain and multi-domain environment.

NOTE: For additional information and an explanation of how these services inter
operate please reference the SNA Server online help "How Does SNA Server Host
Security Integration Work?" and Q175063 Host Security Integration Setup and
Architectural Overview.

Single Domain Model
-------------------

In a single domain model the Windows NT Password Synchronization service and the
Host Account Cache should be installed on the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) of
the domain. During installation the Windows NT Password Synchronization service
setup will ask for a Host Security domain name. This should be the same as the
domain in which the service is being installed.

NOTE: All services should use a single account within this domain.

Multiple Trust Domain Model
---------------------------

In a domain model in which one domain trusts another the Windows NT Password
Synchronization service must be installed on the PDC that contains the user
accounts (trusted domain)that are to utilize SNA Server's Host Security
Integration. The Host Account Cache will be installed on the PDC of the trusted
domain.

Assume Domain A (trusted domain) is trusted by Domain B (trusting domain) where
Domain A contains the user accounts of the users that will access the SNA
Server(s) that reside in Domain B. The Windows NT Password Synchronization
service will be installed on the PDC of Domain A. During installation the
Windows NT Password Synchronization service setup will ask for a Host Security
domain name. This should be the name of Domain B. The Host Account Cache will be
installed on the PDC of Domain B.

NOTE: Given the example above, all services should use a single account in Domain
A.

Master Domain Model
-------------------

In a domain model in which one domain acts as an accounts domain and one or more
resource domains trust this domain, the Windows NT Password Synchronization
service must be installed on the PDC of the accounts domain. The Host Account
Cache service will be installed on each PDC within a resource domain that
contain SNA Servers that are to utilize Host Security Integration. During
installation the Windows NT Password Synchronization service setup will ask for
a Host Security domain name. This should be the names of all resource domains in
which the Host Account Cache is to be installed.

NOTE: For more information about adding Host Security Domains after the Windows
NT Password Synchronization service has been installed, please refer to: Q194633
How to Add Additional Host Security Domains.

Assume an accounts domain (trusted domain), Domain A , trusts the resource
Domains (trusting domains), Domain B and Domain C, where Domain A contains the
user accounts of the users that will access the SNA Server(s) that reside in
Domain B and Domain C. The Windows NT Password Synchronization service will be
installed on the PDC of Domain A. During installation the Windows NT Password
Synchronization service setup will ask for Host Security domain names. These
should be the names of Domain B and Domain C. The Host Account Cache will be
installed on the PDC of Domain B and Domain C.

NOTE: Given the example above, all services should use a single account in Domain
A.
