-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5 Build 2.573.2927 
- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Oracle, version 2.0 
- Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Both the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle, version 2.573.2927, and the Microsoft
OLE DB Provider for Oracle, version 2.0.3002.15, shipping with the Microsoft
Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.0 have handle leaks, which lead to
memory leaks. MDAC version 2.0 components are included both in the Data Access
2.0 Software Development Kit (SDK) as well as Visual Studio version 6.0.



CAUSE
=====

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.


RESOLUTION
==========

The Oracle ODBC Driver, version 2.573.2927, and the Oracle OLE DB Provider,
version 2.0.3002.15, were both fixed with the release of the MDAC version 2.1
components. Please install MDAC version 2.1 if you are experiencing the handle
leak. If you cannot upgrade to MDAC version 2.1 you can still install the ODBC
Driver fix mentioned in this article. You must upgrade to MDAC version 2.1 if
you are using the OLE DB Provider for Oracle.

The fix contains a patched version of the Microsoft Oracle ODBC Driver. At this
time, it does not contain a patched version of the Oracle OLE DB Provider.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

  Date        Time        Version        Size    File name    Platform
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  09-25-1998 12:41:42 PM  2.573.3002.24  138,512 msorcl32.dll Windows

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Extract the files into a new directory.

2. Locate the Msorcl32.dll file on your computer.

3. Copy the new .dll files (created by unzipping the files) to the Windows
  system directory.

4. Register the .dll files using Regsvr32.exe (provided with the patch) using
  the following syntax:

  regsvr32 &lt;dll name.dll&gt;

  You also need to register the Msorcl32.dll file.
