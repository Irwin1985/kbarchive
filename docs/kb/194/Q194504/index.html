SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may return a non-
delivery report (NDR) similar to the following when a message has been sent to a
distribution list (DL) after a member's mailbox had been deleted, and the
membership thus removed implicitly from the DL:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject: Test Message
     Sent: 10/1/98 4:38 PM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

     /o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=DELETED_USER on 10/1/98 4:38 PM
        A required directory operation was unsuccessful
        MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:SITE:SERVER

RESOLUTION
==========

Exchange Server 5.0
-------------------

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These NDRs will continue indefinitely when sending e-mail to this DL until the
MTA has been cycled. This behavior is due to the fact that the directory does
not update the DL's "when-changed" attribute when a DL member's mailbox has been
removed by deleting the mailbox itself, thus, implicitly removing it from the
DL. The MTA was designed to periodically check the "when-changed" attribute on
the DL to see if its DL cache needs to be updated. However, this wasn't
accomplishing the desired results since the directory wasn't designed to update
the DL's "when-changed" attribute when mailboxes were deleted.

After you apply the fix, the NDR will still occur if someone sends a message to
the DL within 10 minutes of the mailbox being deleted, but after the ten minute
period, the NDRs will not occur anymore for the deleted mailbox.
