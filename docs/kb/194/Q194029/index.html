-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

When you perform an unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0 and install the
Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), you have no means of specifying the
number of PPTP ports in the Unattend.txt file. This article will provide a
detailed explanation of how you can set the number of PPTP ports during an
unattended installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set the number of PPTP ports during an unattended installation, follow these
steps:

1. Copy all the Windows NT system files needed, usually the I386 directory and
  all its subdirectories, from the compact disc to the distribution server,
  which is a network share devoted to network client setup. The directory name
  of this network share is usually also I386.

2. Create the Unattend.txt file with any parameters that you feel are necessary
  including RASPPTP and RAS. In your Unattend.txt file, make sure Oempreinstall
  is set to "Yes".

  For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q155197 Unattended Setup Parameters for Unattend.txt File

  Q166149 RAS Reserves DHCP Addresses for Dial-Out Only Clients

3. Create a directory named $oem$ under the I386 directory (the directory of the
  network share on the distribution server).

4. In the $oem$ directory, create a text file named Cmdlines.txt that contains
  the following two lines:

        [Commands]
        ".\regedit /s pptp.reg"

5. Also in the $oem$ directory, create a text file named Pptp.reg that contains
  the following four lines:

        REGEDIT4

        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RASPPTPE
         \Parameters\Configuration]
        "NumberLineDevices"=dword:00000007

  NOTE: The second line is blank, but it must be present; line 3 above wraps to
  the next line for readability, but it should be all on one line in the
  Pptp.reg file, with no spaces between RASPPTPE and \Parameters (that is,
  ...\RASPPTPE\Parameters\Configuration]). Also please note, the value
  "00000007" is the number of ports you want to install. Please change this
  value to your preferred number of PPTP ports.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
  require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee
  that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
  solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
  Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
  Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
  Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
  If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair
  Disk (ERD).

6. Place a copy of the Regedit.exe file (from the I386 directory) in the $oem$
  directory. At this point, there should be three files in the $oem$ directory:
  Cmdlines.txt, Pptp.reg, and Regedit.exe.

7. On your distribution share, expand the Oemnxppp.in_ file by typing the
  following at the command prompt:

  Expand Oemnxppp.in_ Oemnxppp.inf

8. Rename the compressed Oemnxppp.in_ file to Oemnxppp.sav.

  This step is required because this not only offers a backup copy of the file
  but the setup program will always use the compressed version of the file if
  both are present.

9. Use any text editor to modify the following section of the .inf file:

   - Before modifications are made:

           Set NumberOfLineDevices = *($(Result), 1)
           FreeLibrary $(RASPPTPDLGHANDLE)
           ifstr(i) $(NumberOfLineDevices) == "EXITSETUP"

   - After modification are made:

           Set NumberOfLineDevices = *($(Result), 1)
           ;**************Modifications begin here**************
           Ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == YES
               Set NumberOfLineDevices = 7
           endif
           ;**************Modifications end here****************
           FreeLibrary $(RASPPTPDLGHANDLE)
           ifstr(i) $(NumberOfLineDevices) == "EXITSETUP"

  NOTE: The value "NumberOfLineDevices = 7" is the number of ports you wish to
  install. Please change this to your desired value. This should match the
  setting above.

10. Save the file and begin your unattended setup.

  NOTE: The steps above will allow you to specify the number of PPTP ports to
  add to Windows NT 4.0. However, this does not allow you to add these ports
  as RAS-capable devices during unattended setup. Currently, the only way to
  perform that action is to manually add the PPTP ports after the unattended
  installation has completed.
