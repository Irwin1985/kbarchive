-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Systems Management Server Administrator program to view the
machine records of a Systems Management Server site, certain records that were
previously present in the database may appear to have "disappeared" from the
site. Upon closer inspection, you will see that missing data has been combined
into another inventory record. By selecting the Previous History Record for the
inventory record's Identification property, you may observe values relating to a
"missing" machine record.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft SQL Server is configured to use character set 850 Multilingual and
either sort order Scandinavian dictionary order, case-insensitive, uppercase
preference (id 58), or sort order Scandinavian dictionary order,
case-insensitive (id 60). By definition, these configurations do not
differentiate between the characters "V" and "W".

Because the unique identifier for Systems Management Server clients (that is, the
SMSID) takes advantage of each of the alphanumeric characters, a conflict arises
whenever a site has two clients differentiated only by the single character V or
W (for example, "SIT0100V" and "SIT0100W").

In this example, assuming that SIT0100V is written to the database first, when
Inventory Data Loader attempts to add SIT0100W, the current record for SIT0100V
will be added as a history record of SIT0100W. Therefore, the existing inventory
record appears to have disappeared from the site database, until an inventory
delta-MIF for SIT0100V is produced.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set SQL Server to use a sort order that
differentiates between these characters. To do this, perform complete the
following steps, which apply specifically to SQL Server 6.5:

1. Make a complete backup of your system, according to the steps outlined in
  Chapter 15 of the Systems Management Server Administrator's Guide.

2. Stop all SMS services running on your Systems Management Server site
  server(s). You can use either the SMS Service Manager or Control Panel
  Services to stop these services.

3. Install a separate SQL Server running on another server and configure it for
  another sort order (that is, a sort order other than Scandinavian dictionary
  order, case-insensitive with or without uppercase preference).

  NOTE: Because the Nordic sort orders available for the ISO character set are
  not affected by this problem, you may also want to change the character set
  you are using, in addition to changing the sort order.

4. Start SQL Enterprise Manager and register the remote server you installed
  during Step 3 of this procedure.

5. Prepare the target server with proper device files to hold the database and
  the transaction log. Create the target database spanning the entire space of
  these two devices. The size of these devices should be at least as large as
  your SMS database on your current server.

6. In SQL Enterprise Manager, click Tools menu, click "Database/Object
  Transfer", and then click to select the server that is currently holding your
  SMS database as the source server and click to select the SMS database as the
  source database.

7. Make sure the destination SQL Server is selected as the destination server,
  select the proper target database that you created during Step 5 of this
  procedure, and then click "Start Transfer".

8. During the transfer process, you may receive errors and warnings during
  transfer of some objects. For a resolution to these warnings, consult the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

9. Start Systems Management Server Setup. Click Operations, click "SMS
  Database", type a new SQL Server name (and possibly SQL Server login ID and
  password), and then click OK.

10. Systems Management Server Setup will now reset the system according to the
  selected changes. When it is done, click Close and then click Exit. The
  system will now use the new SQL Server and database instead.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to maintain the old SQL Server to store the SMS database, you can
rebuild Master.dat (to do this, use the Rebuild Master Database option in SQL
Setup on the original SQL Server, selecting a new sort order that does
differentiate between the letters V and W). However, before doing so, you should
determine whether this SQL Server is in use for other databases as well, because
this step will purge all existing databases from Master.dat. If it is being used
for other databases, you should carefully evaluate what kind of impact this
configuration change may have for these databases. If you come to the conclusion
that these databases can be successfully transferred to another temporary SQL
Server running on a different sort order, you can pursue rebuilding Master.dat
in order to change the running sort order. After completing this step, go
through the procedure described in the WORKAROUND section of this article to
move the SMS database back to the original server again. Also transfer all other
databases you temporarily moved over to another server back to the original SQL
server.

NOTE: It is highly recommended that you go through these steps before you upgrade
to Systems Management Server 2.0.
