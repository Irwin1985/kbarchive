SUMMARY
=======

Multimon.exe is a sample project that shows how to detect and handle multiple
monitors on Windows 98 and Windows Me.

The sample project includes a reusable class that makes adding multiple monitor
support to applications easier.

Windows 98 and Windows Me have a new feature that allows up to nine monitors to
be used at the same time. The use of multiple video cards and multiple monitors
creates a virtual desktop that increases the display area for the user.

Applications can be displayed on any monitor, dragged seamlessly from one monitor
to another, or span the virtual desktop so the application can be seen on more
than one monitor. Each monitor can be set at any resolution or color depth
independent of other monitors. There is also the ability to use the additional
monitors to display the same information as the primary monitor.

The Virtual Desktop
-------------------

The desktop of a single monitor system is only the size of the monitor's
resolution. The virtual desktop that is created when multiple monitors are
utilized is somewhat different. The primary monitor will always have compatible
coordinates of 0,0 for the upper-left, and the x and y resolution of the display
for the lower-right corner. This provides backward compatibility for legacy
applications. Other monitors connected to the system will have coordinates
relative to the primary monitor and the monitor's screen size.

For example, if the primary monitor is set to 1024x768, it will have coordinates
of 0,0 to 1024,768. The second monitor is attached and set to 640x480 and the
settings specify that this second monitor is to the right of the primary monitor
and that the tops aligned. The second monitor's coordinates would be 1025,0 for
the upper-left corner and 1664,480 for the lower-right corner.

If the second monitor was specified as being to the left or above the primary
monitor, the coordinates would include negative values.

Uses of Multiple Monitors
-------------------------

Like the primary monitor, the use of the display area is limited only by the
imagination of the programmer. However, several new uses of the addition screen
real estate might include using the second monitor for a preview window, a
debugging window, or displaying Help.

Multiple Monitors and the Programmer
------------------------------------

In previous systems, negative screen coordinates were often assumed to be off the
screen. On a multiple monitor system, the negative screen coordinates might be
right in the middle of another visible screen (monitor). Other things that are
impacted with multiple monitors are the centering of forms, the size of forms,
color depth of the screen(s) and the saving of form locations.

The programmer can no longer reliably use the following code to center a form:

     Me.Move (Screen.Width - Width) \ 2, (Screen.Height - Height) \ 2

The form will still be centered, but on the primary monitor, which may not
necessarily be the same monitor that the application is running on. If the user
does not see the form on the primary monitor and the form is modal, the
application may appear to be non-responsive.

Programmers may also have code that limits a form resize to the size of the
screen. Such code would make it impossible for a user to size the form so that
it spanned multiple monitors. (This is really handy when displaying spreadsheet
data.)

Programmers may have code that determines the color depth of the screen and
display a splash screen with a bitmap of that color depth. The problem here is
that the primary display may have 256 colors, but the second display may only
have 16.

Another example is when the programmer saves the form position for the next
application session. After this is done, the user might disable multiple
monitors. The next time the application is run it might display entirely off the
screen, resulting in an "invisible" application.

The New APIs
------------

There are new APIs for handling multiple monitors in Windows 98. The APIs used in
the monitors class sample are GetMonitorInfo, MonitorFromWindow and
MonitorFromRect.

The GetSystemMetrics API has some new constants (see below) that can be used to
determine the metrics of a multiple monitor system. The GetSystemMetrics API
returns information about the Windows environment. This API can be used to
determine how many monitors are on the system, whether they are set at the same
display format, and the size of the virtual desktop.

     'Virtual Desktop sizes
     Const SM_XVIRTUALSCREEN = 76    'Virtual Left
     Const SM_YVIRTUALSCREEN = 77    'Virtual Top
     Const SM_CXVIRTUALSCREEN = 78   'Virtual Width
     Const SM_CYVIRTUALSCREEN = 79   'Virtual Height

     Const SM_CMONITORS = 80         'Get number of monitors
     Const SM_SAMEDISPLAYFORMAT = 81

Known Issues
------------

In Visual Basic 5.0:

- Pop-up menus and ToolTips appear on the primary monitor.

- IDE dialogs always appear on the primary monitor.

- IDE parameter Info and Statement Completion pop-ups always display on primary
  monitor.

The Multimon.exe Sample
-----------------------

The multimon.exe sample project shows how to use the clsMonitors class. The
sample class includes the following items:

Collections:

  Monitors

Properties:

  DeskTopLeft
  DeskTopTop
  DeskTopWidth
  DeskTopHeight

Methods:

  GetMonitorFromWindow
  CenterFormOnMonitor
  GetMonitorFromXYPoint
  Refresh
  ShowMonitorDialog

The code provided in the sample project is extensively commented. Following these
comments through the code should give the programmer a full understanding of how
the class works.

NOTE: The sample is saved as a Visual Basic 4.0 project. If the project is opened
in Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0, you will be prompted to save it in an updated
format.
