-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 6.0, setting the Output settings of a query to a graph results
in the graph being saved to a .scx file instead of being saved to a General
field in a table (.dbf file). In earlier versions of FoxPro, the graph was saved
to a General field in a table by default. Visual FoxPro 6.0 stores the graph in
the form as an Olecontrol object that is linked to a Microsoft Graph Chart.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no direct way to save the results of a query to a graph and get the
graph stored in a General field. However, saving the results of the query to a
cursor or table and then running the Graph Wizard on that cursor or table allows
the graph to be saved to a General field in a table.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. From the File menu, select New. In the New dialog box, choose Query and then
  select the New File button.

2. Add a table that has a character field and numeric field.

3. In the Fields tab of the Query Designer, move the character field and numeric
  field from the Available Fields list box to the Selected Fields list box.

4. From the Query menu, select Query Destination to open the Query Destination
  dialog box.

5. Select the Graph button in the Query Destination dialog box. If it is dimmed,
  go to the Command window and issue the following command and then repeat Step
  4 to select the Graph button:

        _GENGRAPH = HOME() + "\WIZARDS\WZGRAPH.APP"

6. Click the OK button to close the Query Destination dialog box and then run
  the query.

7. In Step 2 of the Graph Wizard, drag the character field to the Axis text box,
  and the numeric field to the Data Series list box.

8. Click Finish. You now have the option to assign a title to your graph. Note
  that there is no option to save your graph to a table or a form. Click the
  Finish button again to see that Visual FoxPro saves the graph as a .scx file
  only. Select the Save button to save the graph.

9. To save the graph to a General field in a table, go back to the Query
  Designer, repeat Step 4, and then select the Table button in the Query
  Destination dialog box. Give the table a name in the Table Name text box and
  select OK to close the window.

10. Run the query and note that a table is created instead of a graph.

11. From the Tools menu, point to Wizards and then select All. In the Wizard
  Selection dialog box, choose the Graph Wizard.

12. After you click the OK button, the Graph Wizard appears. In "Step 1 [ASCII
  150] Select Fields" of the Graph Wizard, select the Databases and Tables
  drop-down list box and choose Free Tables. Highlight the name of your table
  in the list box, and move the character and numeric fields to the Selected
  Fields list box.

13. Select the Next button and repeat Step 7, and then select the Finish button.
  Note that you have option buttons that allow you to save the graph to a form
  or a table. Select the "Save Graph to a Table" option button, click the
  Finish button and note that the graph is saved to a table.
