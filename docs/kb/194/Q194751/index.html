What is VB6Cli.exe?
-------------------

VB6Cli.exe is a utility that is designed to fix design-time license problems with
ActiveX Controls that ship with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. The utility does not
fix third-party controls or controls that are not normally installed by
Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, nor does it enable the use of Remote Data Object
(RDO) objects in Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Edition. If you try to use RDO in
Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Edition, you may also encounter symptoms II and IV
below. The only way to enable RDO is to install Visual Basic 6.0 Enterprise
Edition.

VB6Cli.exe will help correct problems with the following symptoms:

Symptom I:

When trying to site a control within a project, Microsoft Visual Basic raises the
following error dialog:

  License Information For This Component Not Found. You Do Not Have An
  Appropriate License To Use This Functionality In The Design Environment.

Symptom II:

When trying to compile a project, Microsoft Visual Basic raises the following
error dialog:

  Compile Error : Permission Denied

Symptom III:

When using the Application Wizard, Microsoft Visual Basic raises an error dialog
similar to:

  60: Method ~ of Object ~ failed

Symptom IV:

When trying to run a project, Microsoft Visual Basic raises the following error
dialog:

  Runtime Error '429' : ActiveX Component Can't Create Object

How do I use VB6Cli.exe?
------------------------

VB6Cli.exe requires that an edition of Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 be installed on
the system where the utility is going to be used.

Before running the VB6Cli.exe utility, make sure there are no other applications
running.

Simply double-click on VB6Cli.exe through the Windows Explorer. The utility
detects Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, and installs the required design-time
licenses for the edition detected.

If successful, you will see a dialog box similar to the following:

  "Enterprise Design Licenses Have Been Installed Successfully"

VB6Cli.exe also offers a silent mode. Running the VB6Cli.exe from a command
prompt with a "/q" will run the utility without any user interface. Result codes
can be captured and used by other applications to test if the licenses were
installed.

Result Codes And Error Messages
-------------------------------

Exit Code 0   : Licenses for that Edition were installed
Exit Code 1   : Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 was not detected on this system
Exit Code 2   : Could Not Load A Support Utility Library
Exit Code 3,4 : At Least 1 Design License Was Not Properly Installed
Exit Code 5   : Unable To Install Any Design Licenses
Exit Code 6   : There Was An Unspecified Error With The VBC6 Utility
