The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Memory that is freed multiple times may cause an Application Error (AE).

NOTE: This is true whether you use malloc and multiple free or new and multiple
delete.

CAUSE
=====

Heap control structures are modified after the first call to free() and no
longer in a state where subsequent calls to free() will work.

RESOLUTION
==========

Avoid calling multiple free or multiple delete on the same pointer. One way to
prevent this is by assigning the pointer to null after calling free or delete.
The delete and free functions return without doing anything if a null pointer is
passed as the argument. This doesn't work in cases where free or delete is
called on multiple pointers pointing to the same memory location.

To help customers experiencing this problem in their third-party applications,
Microsoft has released a new C-Run-time Library DLL, Msvcrt.dll, which
implements two heap managers, the Visual C++ 5 compatible heap manager and the
Visual C++ 6 compatible heap manager. It detects with which Visual C++ version
your application is built and uses the appropriate heap manager for that
application. If this version is 6.0 or greater, the Visual C++ 6 compatible heap
manager is used and if it is earlier than version 6.0,the Visual C++ 5
compatible heap is used.

Visual Studio 6.0 users can get this new msvcrt.dll by installing the latest
Microsoft Visual Studio Service Pack. Non-Visual Studio users should install the
Microsoft Libraries Update.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Freeing memory multiple times produces undefined behavior.

Release builds of the sample code below cause an application error when built
with Visual C++ 6.0; the code does not cause an application error when built
with Visual C++ 5.0.

Debug builds with either Visual C++ 6.0 or Visual C++ 5.0 issue an ASSERT:

     Debug Assertion Failed!

It is important to note that the state of the Small Block Heap (SBH) is
constantly in flux. Because of this, there are situations where it's possible
that no assertion will be issued in the debug build, but an application error
will occur in the release build.

Release builds in Visual C++ 6.0 are more sensitive to freeing memory multiple
times than in Visual C++ 5.0. If built with Visual C++ 5.0, the case below is
one where the incorrect call to free is innocuous. If the call to free() were
made more distant from the original, it is possible to cause an application
error. There is a high probability that memory will be corrupted.

Sample code
-----------

     // Compile options for Release builds /c
     // Compile options for Debug builds /c /Zi
     #include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
     int main(int argc, char* argv[])
     {
        char *pChar1 = (char *)malloc(10*sizeof(char));
        char *pChar2 = (char *)malloc(10*sizeof(char));
        free(pChar1);
        free(pChar1);
        return 0;
     }
