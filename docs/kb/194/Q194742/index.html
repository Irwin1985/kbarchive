- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

In Exchange Server versions 4.0 and 5.0, it is not possible to send messages to
a user by using the following format:

  user@[IP Address]

However, in accordance with for Request for Comments (RFC) 821 and 821bis, this
is a valid addressing format.

Microsoft recognizes the need for compliance to this RFC specification. Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5 allows for this addressing method and therefore
allows messages to be sent by using this format. The feature involves a
modification to the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service to understand IPv4
literals. The Internet Mail Service is now capable of accepting mail inbound,
delivering outbound, and rerouting mail addressed in the format "user@[IP
Address]," also known as IPv4 literal.

NOTE: The admin does not allow you to create a proxy of the form 'user@[IP
Address]' (it strips the brackets).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Per RFC 821 page 31:

  Hosts are generally known by names, which are translated to addresses in each
  host. Note that the name elements of domains are the official names -- no use
  of nicknames or aliases is allowed. Sometimes, a host is not known to the
  translation function and communication is blocked. To bypass this barrier,
  two numeric forms are also allowed for host "names". One form is a decimal
  integer prefixed by a pound sign, "#", which indicates the number is the
  address of the host. Another form is four small decimal integers separated by
  dots and enclosed by brackets, for example, "[123.255.37.2]", which indicates
  a 32-bit ARPA Internet Address in four 8-bit fields.

NOTE: The other message format that is noted in this section of RFC 821 is the
following

  user@#xxxxxxxxx

where xxxxxxxx is a decimal number that corresponds to the host address of the
computer. The Internet Mail Service on all versions of Exchange Server including
Exchange 2000 Server does not support this type of addressing.
