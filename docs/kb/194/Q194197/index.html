-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install an application on a computer running Windows 95, the
application setup terminates with the following messages:

  MSDADC.DLL was unable to register itself in the system registry.

-and-

  Setup was not completed successfully.

This error message is incomplete and does not describe the real cause of the
problem.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs due to an incompatibility between the version of the
Msdadc.dll file installed by Setup and the existing version of the Ole32.dll
file on the target computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this issue by installing Distributed Component Object Model
(DCOM) for Windows 95 or Internet Explorer version 4.0 or later.

You can install DCOM for Windows 95 (DCOM95) from the following Web address:

http://www.microsoft.com/COM/resources/downloads.asp

You can install Internet Explorer 4.0 or later from the following Web address:

http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/windows.htm

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in the updated version of the
Setup Wizard Vfp6swiz.exe dated 10/08/1998. This bug was corrected in Visual
Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The bug that Visual Studio Service Pack 3 fixes concerns the error
message. Service pack 3 does not install an updated version of DCOM. You must
still install DCOM from the locations listed in the RESOLUTION section above.

In service pack 3, the error message now reads:

  The ODBC drivers need DCOM95, which does not appear to be installed. DCOM 95
  is available from the Microsoft Web site. We highly recommend you click Yes
  to exit now, install DCOM95, and run this setup again. Terminate setup?

Two buttons titled Yes and No appear below the message. If you select Yes, the
setup terminates.

If you choose No, the setup continues to run. At the end of the setup routine,
you see the following message:

  MSDADC.DLL was unable to register itself in the system registry.

The setup program then terminates.

The Msdadc.dll file supports Visual FoxPro's ODBC functions and is installed in
the Windows\System directory, by the Setup Application. The Msdadc.dll file has
dependencies in the Ole32.dll file, and registration of the Msdadc.dll file
fails if it is not supported by the existing version of the Ole32.dll file.
Installation of either DCOM for Windows 95 or Internet Explorer 4.0 updates the
version of the Ole32.dll file on the target computer.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project and add a program file containing the following code:

  WAIT WINDOW "This Application is Running"

2. Build the project into an executable.

3. Run the Setup Wizard and select ODBC Drivers in step 2.

4. Install the .exe file on a Windows 95 computer that has Ole32.dll version
  2.1.

  RESULTS: Setup proceeds normally until registry updates occur. Then, the
  following message appears:

  MSDADC.DLL was unable to register itself in the system registry.

Setup then terminates with the following message:

  Setup was not completed successfully.
