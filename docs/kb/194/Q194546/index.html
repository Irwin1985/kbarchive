-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message through the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, and either of
the following conditions are met, the time on the message may be incorrect when
you view the message in an e-mail client:

- The message is sent from Microsoft Exchange Server to Microsoft Mail for PC
  Networks, or vice versa, and the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 computer is
  configured for a time zone other than Greenwich mean time. The problem occurs
  regardless of the time zone for which the Exchange Server computer is set.

-or-

- The message is sent from Microsoft Mail (PC) to Microsoft Mail (PC) through
  two Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 computers, and the computers are not
  configured for the same time zone.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 does not properly modify the time on messages to
adjust for differences in time zones. This causes the time on the message to be
displayed incorrectly when either of the conditions described above are met.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  File Name      Version
  ----------------------
  X400gate.exe   3.2.23

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as X400gy2k.exe:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/gateways-public/All-Y2K/


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
version 3.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you send a message to or from an Exchange Server or Microsoft Mail (PC)
computer, the computer may adjust the time on the message for differences in
time zones. This adjustment is intended to ensure that the time on the message
is accurate when the message is viewed in an e-mail client, regardless of the
time zones in which the Exchange Server or Microsoft Mail (PC) computers are
located.

When a message is sent from an Exchange Server computer that is configured for a
time zone other than Greenwich mean time, the server adds or subtracts the
appropriate number of hours so that the time on the message appears in Greenwich
mean time. Similarly, when a message is sent to an Exchange Server computer that
is configured for a time zone other than Greenwich mean time, the server adds or
subtracts the appropriate number of hours so that the time on the message
appears in the time zone in which the server is located. Adjusting the time to
Greenwich mean time on outbound messages allows the server that receives the
message to easily adjust the time to the appropriate time zone. This ensures
that the time on the message is accurate when the message is viewed in an e-mail
client.

Microsoft Mail (PC) computers adjust the time on outbound and inbound messages in
a similar manner. However, if the message is sent through the Microsoft Mail
Gateway to X.400, the time on the message may be not be adjusted properly. If
the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 computer is configured for Greenwich mean
time, the computer does not attempt to adjust the time on the message.
Therefore, the problem described in this article does not occur.

In addition, if the message is sent from Microsoft Mail (PC) to Microsoft Mail
(PC) through two Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 computers that are configured
for a time zone other than Greenwich mean time, and both computers are
configured for the same time zone, the incorrect adjustments made by the two
computers offset each other, and the problem does not occur.

In all other scenarios, the problem described in this article occurs because the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 does not properly adjust the time on the
message.

As indicated above, this problem occurs when a message is sent from Microsoft
Mail (PC) to Microsoft Mail (PC) through two Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
computers that are not configured for the same time zone. Specifically, this
problem occurs when either of the following conditions are met:

- Both of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 computers are configured for a
  time zone other than Greenwich mean time, but the computers are not
  configured for the same time zone.

-or-

- One of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 computers is configured for
  Greenwich mean time, but the other is not.
