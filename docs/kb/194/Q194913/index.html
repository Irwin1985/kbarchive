SYMPTOMS
========

If you build a Component Object Model (COM) component in C/C++ that takes or
returns an IUnknown** data type and uses an Interface Definition Language (IDL)
file and the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) compiler to generate
the type library, you find that neither Visual Basic nor Visual Basic for
Applications (VBA) display the type correctly in the Visual Basic Object
Browser, and indicate that the type is UNKNOWN.

When you call the C/C++ component from Visual Basic, you may see the following
run-time error:

  Run-time error: 458
  Variable uses a type not supported in Visual Basic

This error message can occur during cross-apartment calls to the interface. At
other times, the method call succeeds even though Visual Basic is unsure of the
data type.

In addition, if you use the Implements keyword to implement the C/C++ interface
in a Visual Basic class, you receive the following compile-time error message:

  Bad interface for Implements: method uses type that is not supported by
  Visual Basic.

You cannot implement an interface with an UNKNOWN type.

However, a similarly written Visual Basic component that uses the hidden IUnknown
data type (which equates to an IUnknown** in C/C++) displays correctly in the
Object Browser and can be called by another Visual Basic class or used by Visual
Basic Implements without error.

CAUSE
=====

MIDL-generated type libraries represent an IUnknown** parameter as a VT_UNKNOWN
in the TYPEDESC for the ELEMDESC struct that describes the parameter. Although
Visual Basic can work with VARIANTs of type VT_UNKNOWN, it does not expect this
type for a parameter description in a type library. Consequently, it treats the
parameter as UNKNOWN, and displays one of the error messages in the "Symptoms"
section of this article.

Visual Basic and VBA both use the CreateTypeLib2 API function (not MIDL) to
generate the type library when they build their own COM components, and they can
define a parameter as being the type IUnknown** by using a reference to an
external type library (stdole2.tlb) and a ITypeInfo to describe the data type.
The reference points to the actual description of IUnknown instead of relying on
the VT_UNKNOWN VARTYPE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because programmers are not allowed to use an IUnknown** data type natively in
Visual Basic and VBA, components that are designed to work in these programming
environments should avoid using this type when possible. Two common reasons why
you might have chosen to use IUnknown in your component description (but you
don't actually need to) are:

1. When you want to implement a polymorphic property or method that can take any
  object. Because Visual Basic cannot use an IUnknown pointer natively, it is
  better to use IDispatch and return only dual (or dispinterface) objects.
  These objects appear as Object in Visual Basic and can be treated
  polymorphically, which accomplishes the same effect in a more Visual
  Basic-oriented fashion.

  If you need to pass a custom interface that is not dual, a common, shared
  interface type can be defined and inherited by this interface (and all other
  objects that are passed) and define the method or property as taking this
  shared base interface (rather than IUnknown). As long as the new base
  interface is described in the type library, Visual Basic and VBA can use it
  without a problem.

2. When you want to pass a generic collection item; for example, the Visual
  Basic-style _NewEnum property that returns an IUnknown**, or a standard OLE
  interface that is not dual. In this case, you should use the actual interface
  type that is being passed rather than the more generic IUnknown. For example,
  the _NewEnum property should return an IEnumVARIANT*, because this is, in
  fact, the interface that Visual Basic needs and expects. When it is compiled
  with MIDL, this interface type is cross-referenced to its definition in
  stdole2.tlb, and you do not receive an error message.

If you are not faced with either of the previous situations, or if you must have
an IUnknown** declaration, Visual Basic can accept this type, but it must be
fully qualified with the stdole library (that is, stdole.IUnknown**). This
cannot be done in IDL and compiled with MIDL.

While you can qualify data types in MIDL, the MIDL compiler automatically
converts any qualified reference to IUnknown back to a VT_UNKNOWN VARTYPE in the
type library description. This simplifies the library for remote procedure calls
(RPC) and DCOM, but it prevents you from using MIDL to generate libraries that
use a Visual Basic- or Visual Basic for Applications-compatible IUnknown** type.
Instead, you need to use MkTypLib and an ODL file to build the type library, or
create the library programmatically with the CreateTypeLib2 API. See the "More
Information" section for details.

STATUS
======

This problem is a compatibility issue between Microsoft Visual Basic and the
Microsoft MIDL compiler.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Visual C++ and, on the File menu, click New. On the Projects tab, select
  Win32 Dynamic-Link Library, and name the project MyUnknown. Keep the defaults
  in any dialog boxes that may appear.

2. On the File menu, click New, and then select Text File on the Files tab. Name
  the file MyUnknown.odl, and then click OK.

3. Add the following code to MyUnknown.odl:

  [
     uuid(1A4C3A6A-50AE-11D1-BB71-00C04FAD8B08),
     version(1.1)
  ]
  library MyUnknown
  {
     importlib("StdOle2.tlb");

     [
        odl,
        uuid(1A4C3A68-50AE-11D1-BB71-00C04FAD8B08),
        hidden
     ]
     interface _CTUnknown : IUnknown {
        HRESULT GetIUnknown([out, retval] IUnknown** iu);
        HRESULT SetIUnknown([in, out] IUnknown** iu);
     };

     [
        uuid(1A4C3A69-50AE-11D1-BB71-00C04FAD8B08)
     ]
     coclass CTUnknown {
        [default] interface _CTUnknown;
     };

  };

4. Press the CTRL+F7 keys or select Compile MyUnknown.odl from the Build menu to
  build the type library.

5. Open Visual Basic and select a new Standard EXE project. On the Project menu,
  choose References, and then click Browse. Find your compiled type library
  (MyUnknown.tlb) in the debug directory of your Visual C++ project and click
  OK. Make sure that the library is checked in the References dialog box, and
  then click OK to close the References dialog box.

6. Open the Visual Basic Object Browser by pressing F2. Select MyUnknown from
  the drop-down list box on the upper-left portion of the Object Browser. View
  the SetIUnknown and GetIUnknown functions of the MyUnknown.CTUnknown class,
  and note that Visual Basic identifies the IUnknown** parameters as type
  "Unknown," and cannot read them.

7. Close your Visual Basic project. Do not save changes.

8. To correct the problem, return to Visual C++ and modify the MyUnknown.odl
  file by changing the GetIUnknown and SetIUnknown functions to read:

  HRESULT GetIUnknown([out, retval] stdole.IUnknown** iu);
  HRESULT SetIUnknown([in, out] stdole.IUnknown** iu);

9. In the project workspace, click the File View tab. Double-click MyUnknown
  Files to expand the file tree. Right-click the MyUnknown.odl file, and then
  select Settings on the Context menu.

10. On the Project Settings dialog box, choose the General Tab, and then check
  the Always use custom build step option. Choose the Custom Build tab, and
  then add the following to the Build command(s) line:

  mktyplib MyUnknown.odl /tlb "Debug\MyUnknown.tlb"

  Add the following to the Output file(s) line, and then click OK:

  Debug\MyUnknown.tlb

11. Rebuild your type library by pressing CTRL+F7 or selecting Compile
  MyUnknown.odl on the Build menu.

12. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to verify that Visual Basic can now recognize the
  IUnknown** data types.

Problems with the Use of MkTypLib
---------------------------------

Microsoft has standardized on the MIDL compiler for all new COM and COM+
applications, and encourages developers to use MIDL whenever possible.

Developers who do use MkTypLib to work around this issue should be aware that
MkTypLib does not allow you to compile an interface with the qualified
stdole.IUnknown** type if the interface is marked "oleautomation compatible."
You need to remove the oleautomation attribute to compile the type library.
However, if you remove oleautomation, you are not able to use the universal
marshaller (typelib marshalling) to remote the interface across contexts. So, in
addition to using an MkTypLib library for your type information, you need to
build a proxy DLL (or custom marshal with IMarshal) to handle any remoting of
the interface.

Furthermore, MkTypLib offers only a limited set of functionality in defining your
interfaces. If your project requires IDL-specific definitions (such as
wire_marshal, iid_is, asynch, and so forth) or the __int64 data type, you cannot
use MkTypLib. You need to restructure the interface description as outlined in
the "Resolution" section of this article, or build your own library with the
CreateTypeLib2 API.
