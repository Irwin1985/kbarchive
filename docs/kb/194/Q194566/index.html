- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a document that was originally saved as WordPerfect 5.0/5.1 format from
within WordPerfect version 2.0, 2.12, or 3.0 for the Macintosh is opened in
Microsoft Word, the document may appear corrupted or you may receive the
following error message:

  Document appears to be corrupt

The corrupted appearance also occurs with files saved from WordPerfect 3.0 for
the Macintosh as WordPerfect 2.1 for the Macintosh format and opened in Word for
the Macintosh using the WordPerfect 2.0 for the Macintosh converter.

In each case, blocks and other "garbage" (corrupted data) may appear throughout
the converted document.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because WordPerfect versions 2.x and 3.0 for the Macintosh
do not always export a 100-percent standard WordPerfect for MS-DOS document, and
WordPerfect 3.0 for the Macintosh doesn't always export a 100-percent valid
WordPerfect 2.1 for the Macintosh document.

The WordPerfect converters supplied with Word for the Macintosh, Word for
Windows, and Word for MS-DOS are optimized to read a valid WordPerfect document
but cannot work around nonstandard structure if generated by WordPerfect for the
Macintosh.


WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1
--------

If you are using WordPerfect 3.0 for the Macintosh, save your documents as Rich
Text Format (RTF) instead, and open from this format in Word.

Method 2
--------

If you have WordPerfect for the Macintosh documents and you only have access to
WordPerfect for MS-DOS or WordPerfect for Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open the document in WordPerfect for MS-DOS or Windows.

2. Paginate the document (in WordPerfect for MS-DOS, press HOME, HOME, DOWN
  ARROW, followed by HOME, HOME, UP ARROW, and in WordPerfect for Windows
  scroll to the bottom of your document and then back to the top).

3. Resave and attempt to open in Word.

NOTE: This is a workaround that may not resolve the problem in every instance.
