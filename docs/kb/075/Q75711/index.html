The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Windows in 386 enhanced mode on a workstation without a hard disk (a
"diskless" workstation) over a Novell or DEC Pathworks network, Windows may
generate the following error:

  Unable to start Enhanced Mode Windows due to invalid path specification for
  EMM386

CAUSE
=====

Some networks, such as Novell and DEC Pathworks, set up diskless workstations by
using a DOSGEN program that generates a system startup profile for each
workstation. This profile is based upon the system configuration contained on
the workstation's startup (boot) disk. Once generated, the profile is stored on
the network server. However, if Windows is running on a diskless workstation
under such a network, it has difficulty finding the EMM386.EXE and WINA20.386
files and therefore cannot run in 386 enhanced mode.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can alleviate this problem by correcting some settings in the CONFIG.SYS and
SYSTEM.INI files.

To correct the problem, you need to use two features of MS-DOS version 5.0 or 6.0
in the boot disk that is used to generate the startup image for the diskless
workstation, and you need to add an additional line needs to the SYSTEM.INI file
in the Windows directory.

On the boot disk used for generating the startup image, the CONFIG.SYS file must
contain the /Y parameter on the EMM386.EXE line specifying the path to
EMM386.EXE and the switches=/W line, as follows:

     device=emm386.exe /y=u:\emm386.exe noems
     switches=/w

where "u" is the net drive letter.

The path to the network server location of the WINA20.386 file must be specified
in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, as follows:

       device=U:\wina20.386

NOTE: Be sure to verify that the AUTOEXEC.BAT file used to boot the diskless
workstation does not have a path that mentions drive A. If the AUTOEXEC.BAT
points to drive A, the workstation attempts to map to that drive and is unable
to boot. To correct this problem, remove any such portion of a path statement
that points to drive A.

Once these are correctly specified, the diskless workstation startup image can be
generated, and Windows should run in 386 enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell Networks
---------------

On Novell networks only, this error can be alleviated by mapping the original
disk drive letter that the disk image NET$DOS.SYS was created from to a public
directory containing EMM386.EXE. For instance, if the NET$DOS.SYS file was
created from a floppy disk in drive A, remapping drive A to a public directory
containing EMM386.EXE allows Windows to find it.
