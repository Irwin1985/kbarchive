SUMMARY
=======

The Netlogon service is executed to replicate the user accounts subsystem (UAS)
database between a primary domain controller (PDC), a backup domain controller
(BDC), and member servers, and to validate logons to the logical domain that the
servers are in. Changes to the UAS are allowed only from the primary domain
controller once the Netlogon service is started. Any attempt to modify the UAS
on a backup domain controller or member server will result in an error stating
that the UAS has been replicated and cannot be modified.

When Netlogon is started on a BDC or a member server, a request will be made to
do a full update of the UAS from the PDC by making a NetAccountSync() call. This
can be avoided by using the /update:no parameter at Netlogon start-up time to
stop the full update. Other switches include:

  /PULSE      (60 - 3600) Seconds            Defaults : 300
  /RANDOMIZE  (5 - 120) Seconds              Defaults : 30
  /SCRIPTS    path of Netlogon Share

BDCs and member servers look at the /UPDATE and SCRIPTS path, but PDCs ignore an
/UPDATE switch.

There are three types of Netlogon updates:

1. Authentication - Replicated server challenges the PDC

  API Calls: I_NetServerReqChallenge()
             I_NetServerAuthenticate()
             I_NetServerPasswordSet()

2. Steady State Replication - Normal change by changing updating of the UAS.

  API Calls: I_NetWriteChangeLog() &lt;-List of Deltas Maintained
             I_NetAccountDeltas()

3. Synchronization - Replicated server must copy the entire UAS.

  API Calls: I_NetAccountDeltas()
             I_NetAccountSync()

The PDC maintains the list of account deltas in a circular list of 64 entries
(the buffer holding 4096 bytes). These entries are account deltas of three
types:

- User Delta: changes to user accounts

- Group Delta: changes to group accounts

- Delta Mod: changes to security settings in Net Admin

Each entry in this list has a update value corresponding to it. Once the Netlogon
service is running, the following sequence is issued to make updates to the
UAS:

1. The PDC issues a /PULSE onto the network as a second class mailslot message
  (\\*\MAILSLOT\NET\NETLOGON). The /PULSE parameter is ignored unless the
  server is a PDC. This message contains the value of the most recent update
  made to the UAS (known as the Y value), the date and time of the notice, the
  name of the domain, and the values for /PULSE and /RANDOMIZE. A BDC or member
  server may miss this call since its delivery is not guaranteed.

2. When a BDC or member server receives this message from the PDC, it compares
  this Y value to its current updated value (known as X). If X+1 &lt; Y, it
  implies that the BDC's or member's UAS needs to be updated. The BDC or member
  then issues an I_NetAccountDeltas() call and sends an Server Message Block
  (SMB) to the PDC requesting that a null session be established and a UAS
  update commence. BDCs and members use the /RANDOMIZE parameter to determine
  how long they should wait before requesting updates from the PDC. This is to
  prevent the PDC from receiving a flood of requests from all the replicated
  UAS systems. If, however, Y &lt; X, the BDC issues an I_NetAccountSync()
  call, requesting that the entire UAS be replicated since the BDC thinks that
  it has missed a change in the delta list. BDCs and members NEVER poll the PDC
  for updates--they always wait for update notices from the PDC.

  Note: Members and BDCs assume the PDC has crashed if they don't receive a
  pulse from the PDC within one minute of the time they expect a pulse. To
  confirm this failure, the BDC or member attempts an I_NetAccountDeltas()
  call. If the failure is confirmed, a message is posted in the error log
  reporting the PDC crash. After 60 minutes, the service clears the primary
  flag and treats the next pulse as a new failure.

3. The PDC can then grant a null session to the requesting server and start
  transmitting the account deltas to that server until X+1 &lt; Y becomes
  false.
