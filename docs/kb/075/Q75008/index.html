-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, the virtual display device
(VDD), is the virtual device (VxD) responsible for all input and output to the
display adapter. The VDD must maintain a data structure that contains enough I/O
register values to program the display adapter, and it must provide for
emulating I/O when the virtual machine (VM) accessing the I/O port does not own
the physical display. VDD performs these operations by reading and writing the
I/O ports when it switches ownership of the display, and by trapping I/O
operations and saving the data. The routines that enable and disable trapping
and handling the traps are in the VDDTIO.ASM module.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Enabling and Disabling I/O Trapping
-----------------------------------

During initialization, all I/O ports associated with the display should be
trapped. This is accomplished by installing I/O trapping handlers and not
disabling the trapping. When initialization of the VDD and the system VM is
complete, trapping of the ports should be disabled. If the state of the hardware
is not readable, then the Windows display driver must assume and maintain some
standard state of the display. When switching back to the system VM, Windows
will restore that standard state; the display driver is responsible for doing
any additional work required. The VxD and the display driver may be required to
call each other through some callback mechanism. In many cases, the existing
Interrupt 2F Functions 4000h through 4007h mechanism is sufficient. For more
information see pages 18 and 19 of the "Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit:
Device Driver Adaptation Guide" for Windows 3.1 or pages 2-15 and 2-16 of the
"Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit Device Driver Adaptation Guide" for
Windows 3.0.

When Windows creates another VM, the VDD must first initialize the new VM's
virtual state and must place the hardware into that state if the VM is running
full screen. From this point on, the I/O ports should be trapped as infrequently
as possible. Specifically, do not trap the I/O ports when the VM that owns the
display is running. However, it is not a good idea to change the trapping state
each time a VM is scheduled because the program running in the VM may not access
the display at all. A good way to handle this is to turn on trapping and disable
access to memory when the VM that owns the display loses control of one or more
of the registers. Restore the entire state and disable trapping when the VM
touches I/O ports or memory. While the Windows 3.0 VDD for EGA/VGA restores the
registers through a VM event each time the display owner is run, the Windows 3.1
VDD waits for a display access before it restores the state.

Be sure to note that there are three bits in the program information file (PIF)
through which the user can specify that trapping is enabled in a VM. If the code
can successfully perform all of the needed operations without trapping (in other
words, the driver can read the state of the hardware completely), then the
driver can ignore these bits. Otherwise, trapping should remain on continually
when the VM is in any mode that corresponds to a set "enable trapping" bit.

Monochrome Support
------------------

During initialization, the VDD for VGA attempts to determine if a secondary
monochrome adapter is installed and whether the system is configured to support
running the VGA in monochrome modes. If the VDD determines that the VGA display
should support monochrome, it traps the monochrome I/O addresses for the CRTC
and status registers and treats these identically to the color I/O addresses.

Display Adapter Extensions Support
----------------------------------

To support registers that exist at I/O addresses different from the standard
EGA/VGA I/O ports, install the appropriate I/O handlers in the VDD_IO_Init
routine of VDDTIO and enable/disable trapping in the VDD_IO_SetTrap routine of
the same module. If the extensions exist at the same addresses, modify the
existing VIOT_* routines to detect access to the extended registers and take the
appropriate action (see below).

I/O Handler Routines
--------------------

The I/O trap handlers must always accept and receive data as if the application
were accessing the real hardware. In some cases, it is not necessary to handle
specific I/O either because the I/O is only done during machine boot or the
particular feature enabled by the operation is not normally used and is not
supported. The I/O handler has the option to specifically warn the user when an
application attempts to use an unsupported feature.

When the driver handles I/O, the data needed to simulate functionality or to
restore the VM's state to the physical display should be stored in the portion
of the Control Block reserved for the VDD. If the display is owned by the VM,
the driver also performs the physical I/O, with a few exceptions. One example:
The driver simulates the VRTC bit in the status register to allow existing
applications to work properly in the preemptive multitasking environment. If the
VM is running in physical memory but does not own the display, merge its output
with that of the display owner to send to the physical I/O port. If the VM is
running entirely simulated, the routine may need to remap the memory if the I/O
affects the virtual display's memory state. Note that the remapping is best
delayed until the driver makes an actual access to the memory (until then,
disable access to the video memory addresses).

Note that because of register locking and/or translation, some display adapters
require that multiple copies of the registers be kept to restore the state of
the physical display, and some extra logic is required to determine which of
these states is to be returned on input.
