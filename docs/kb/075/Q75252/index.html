-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows 80386 debugger, WDEB386, provided with the Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) is automatically made available by the
installation process; however, additional procedures may be needed to take full
advantage of the features it provides. This article describes the procedures
necessary to fully configure this protected-mode debugger.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Hardware
--------

A terminal connected to a COM port is required to use WDEB386. Unlike Microsoft
CodeView for Windows (CVW), WDEB386 does not support running the debugger on a
secondary monitor. Optionally, attach a second computer to a COM port on the
primary computer. Running the Windows Terminal application on the second machine
allows you to save and print portions of debug traces and memory dumps.

Use the /C:n option (where n is 1 or 2) to specify which COM port to use with
WDEB386. WDEB386 sends all output to the specified COM port. However, if the
debugging version of WIN386.EXE (explained below) is run without running
WDEB386, output is directed by default to COM1.

Related Files
-------------

Because of the similarity of the names of a number of files, there is some
confusion as to what the debugger is and how to install and use it. The
following list describes some files that have similar names, but completely
different functions.

WDEB386.EXE - This file is the actual WDEB386 debugger. The debugger is described
in more detail in Chapter 5 of the "Programming Tools" manual distributed with
the Windows SDK version 3.1 and in Chapter 9 of the "Tools" manual distributed
with the Windows SDK version 3.0.

WIN386.EXE - This executable file comprises the core of the Windows enhanced-mode
operating system layer. It includes the VMM (virtual machine manager), and
various standard VxDs (virtual devices).

WINDEBUG.386 - This VxD may be installed in Windows running in enhanced mode (it
is not included in WIN386.EXE). It provides a number of low-level services for
debuggers, the most well-known being the ability to use the key combination
CTRL+ALT+SYS RQ as a break request. This VxD is not necessary for WDEB386 to
function properly.

By default, the WDEB386.EXE file is installed in the C:\WINDEV directory, which
makes it available in the MS-DOS PATH environment variable. The WINDEBUG.386
file is also installed during the SDK installation process. The file itself is
copied to the Windows system directory (by default, C:\WINDEV\SYSTEM), and the
line "DEVICE=WINDEBUG.386" is added to the [386enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI
file. Therefore, these modules should require no special attention regarding
their installation.

WIN386.EXE
----------

Special care may be required concerning WIN386.EXE. The retail version of this
file is part of Windows, and Windows does not run in enhanced mode without it.
To take advantage of some of the more advanced and extremely useful features of
WDEB386, however, the debugging version of WIN386.EXE must first be installed.
This step is optional, but without it, a significant number of WDEB386 commands
are not available.

Most programmers are aware of the procedure to install "the debugging version of
Windows." This procedure is not sufficient to install the debugging version of
WIN386.EXE. The difference is that the debugging version of Windows consists of
the debugging versions of the kernel, user, and GDI modules, along with their
corresponding symbol files. These files are all available as part of the SDK. In
contrast, the debugging version of WIN386.EXE is available only as part of the
Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) in the 386\TOOLS\DEBUG directory.
(Under Windows 3.0, the file is in the DDK VXD\TOOLS\DEBUG directory.)

Therefore, even after installing the debugging version of Windows, an additional
action is required to install the debugging version of WIN386.EXE. Installing
WIN386.EXE is easy. Copy the retail version of WIN386.EXE to a different
filename and copy the debugging version from the DDK disks into the Windows
system directory. The retail version has a file size of around 500K bytes,
whereas the debugging version is significantly larger.

NOTE: The SYM file for the debugging version of WIN386.EXE is not available.
There is a WIN386.SYM file supplied on the DDK in the same directory as the
debugging version of WIN386.EXE, but this file contains the symbols for the
retail version, and does not contain symbol information that matches the
accompanying EXE file. Attempting to use this SYM file is worse than not using
one at all because it assigns labels to addresses incorrectly.

The Grabber
-----------

Once the debugging version of WIN386.EXE is installed, it may also be necessary
to install the debugging version of the "grabber" file. To determine if the
debugging grabber is required, start the debugging Windows system in enhanced
mode and attempt to start an MS-DOS session. If the attempt fails with the
message "Incorrect System Version," then it is necessary to build and install
the debugging version of the 386 grabber. This should be in the \386\GRABBER
directory in the DDK (under Windows 3.0, this file is in the \VXD\GRABBER
directory). Set the DEBUG flag in the makefile, build the grabber with the MAKE
utility, and copy the grabber to the Windows system directory. You can change
the name of the file, however, the "386grabber=" line in the SYSTEM.INI file
must reflect the correct name. If it is possible to start an MS-DOS session on
the Windows debugging system while running in enhanced mode, then this step has
been completed successfully.

Starting the Debugger
---------------------

During the process of testing the grabber, you should see a number of messages
written to the COM1 terminal by Windows. These messages indicate that the
debugging version of WIN386.EXE has been correctly installed, and that the
system is ready for the debugger. At this point, refer to Chapter 5 of the
"Programming Tools" manual (or Chapter 9 of the "Tools" manual) for instructions
on starting and using the debugger. For some tips on using the WDEB386 debugger,
query on the words:
