-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the future, Microsoft Windows and applications developed for Windows are
likely to run in read-only memory (ROM). The text below lists some things to
consider during the process writing software that may be burned into ROM. Some
things are obvious, some are not, and some are specific to system
implementation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Code Segment (CS) Variables

  Do not use CS variables. Although the discipline of writing code for protected
  mode has eliminated many code segment variables, numerous modules use the
  PrestoChangoSelector function, which causes problems. Never allocate a CS
  alias unless you have a very good reason. Read-only tables in CS are
  acceptable. If each table is referenced only within the segment in which it
  is defined, the code can be patched to correct errors.

  If, for very serious performance reasons, a CS variable is required, the
  program must copy the entire code segment into RAM. Try to make the code
  segment as small as possible.

2. Code Patching

  Do not expect any dynamic code patching to work properly. (If an application
  replaces a device driver, this is acceptable as long as the device driver is
  built into the ROM image, or the ROM image device drivers are "replaceable,"
  which may or may not be the case).

3. Accessing the Executable File

  Do not use the AccessResource function or otherwise open the program's EXE
  file. When a module is placed in ROM, the application cannot access it with
  MS-DOS read or write functions. Always use the FindResource, LoadResource and
  LockResource functions to access resources directly. There is no method to
  work around this limitation; if an application uses AccessResource to access
  a small part of a large resource, break the resources into smaller segments.

4. Module Paths

  Do not load a module with an explicit pathname unless you know it is not in
  ROM. The LoadModule function searches the ROM for a module only if the
  function call does not contain an explicit path.

5. WinFlags

  Import the __WinFlags variable only to check the WF_PMODE bit. In a ROM-based
  Windows implementation, this address must be part of the ROM image,
  therefore, other bits may be incorrect. Use the GetWinFlags function to
  retrieve the run time value of WinFlags.

  In general, do not import a value from a module using an absolute address if
  the value can change at run time. __WinFlags is the only such value in the
  Windows core.
