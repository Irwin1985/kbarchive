Frequently Asked Questions About MSN Messenger
----------------------------------------------

Q1: Why am I having problems downloading the MSN Messenger software?

A1: Save the software to your hard disk. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder in which save the software on your hard drive. Make a note of
  the folder's name so that you can find the software after you download it.

2. See the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://messenger.microsoft.com/download/download.asp

3. Click Download Now, and then click "Save this program to disk" (or click Save
  if you use Microsoft Windows XP).

4. Click OK.

5. In the Save As dialog box, browse to the folder that you created in step 1,
  and then click Save.

6. Open the folder that you created, and then double-click Mmssetup.exe to
  install MSN Messenger.

If you receive a "page not found" error message when you trying to download the
software, either refresh the page or click the "Contact us" link at the bottom
of the page to send e-mail asking for additional help.

Q2: Why am I having problems installing MSN Messenger?

A2: Use the following methods before you try to install MSN Messenger again:

- Quit as many programs as possible before you try to install MSN Messenger. To
  quit programs, right-click the program icons in the taskbar, and then click
  Close or Exit.

- Make sure that your browser files from Microsoft Internet Explorer are not
  corrupted. Other programs can sometimes write over or corrupt these files. To
  install MSN Messenger, you may want to upgrade, reinstall, or fix these
  files. See Help in Internet Explorer for more information, or see the
  Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp

- If you use Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft Windows 2000, or Microsoft
  Windows XP, make sure that you have the proper permissions to install
  programs on your computer. If you are unsure about what permissions you have
  on your computer, contact your system administrator for more information.

- This workaround applies to corporate users. Network administrators can
  prevent MSN Messenger from running in their corporation or organization. If
  you receive an error message when connect to .NET Messenger Service at the
  end of installation, you are not having problems with installing MSN
  Messenger. Proceed to the next question.

Q3: I cannot connect to .NET Messenger Service. Why?

A3: There can be several reasons why you cannot sign in to .NET Messenger
Service:

- If your .NET Passport is not recognized, follow these steps:

  1. See either of the following .NET Passport sites:

http://www.passport.com

http://www.hotmail.com

  2. Sign in.

  3. If you are recognized there but still cannot sign in to .NET Messenger
     Service, the messaging servers may be temporarily down for maintenance or
     may have reached capacity due to heavy Internet traffic (during peak usage
     hours). Wait a short while, and then try again. To check the .NET
     Messenger Service status, see the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://messenger.microsoft.com/support/status.asp

- This workaround applies to corporate users. If you are behind a firewall or
  within a company local area network (LAN), MSN Messenger and other instant
  messaging programs may be blocked by the firewall or your company's security
  restrictions. Please contact your network administrator for assistance. For
  more information about which ports a network administrator should open for
  MSN Messenger to work, please see the "Guide for Network Administrators" in
  Help.

- This workaround applies to corporate users. Make sure the "I use a proxy
  server" check box is cleared (not selected) on the Connection tab. (To find
  this check box, click Options on the Tools menu.) Only certain proxy servers
  require you to select this check box. Unless your network administrator tells
  you to select the "I use a proxy server" check box, do not do so.

Q4: I forgot my password. What do I do?

A4: See the following .NET Passport Member Services Web site:

http://memberservices.passport.com

Click "I forgot my password".

Q5: I cannot send files or start an audio conversation with another contact. What
do I do?

A5: You may be behind a firewall or may be using Internet-sharing software or
hardware, a system that is also known as ICS/NAT. To learn more, see Internet
Connection Sharing using ICS/NAT at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://messenger.microsoft.com/support/knownissues.asp

If you are behind a firewall, contact your network administrator and request that
they consult the MSN Messenger Help topic "Guide for Network Administrators."
The basic functions of MSN Messenger should be unaffected because ICS/NAT issues
affect only certain features.

Also, make sure your contact is not behind a firewall or ICS/NAT. If possible,
try this with more than one contact.
