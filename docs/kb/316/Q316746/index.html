Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a host application sends multiple TN3270E print-job requests that are
delimited by a begin bracket (BB) and end bracket (EB) sequence, the first print
job may print successfully, but the next print job remains in the print queue
with a status of "spooling."

NOTE: This issue affects only TN3270E print sessions, not TN3287 sessions.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the TN3270 service fails to send the PRINT-EOJ data
type to a TN3270E print emulator to signal the end of a print job when it
receives the EB sequence from the host application.


RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

There is no fix for this issue in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) and SP4.


Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

+---------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time  | 
+---------------------------------+
| tn3servr.exe | 02/06/02 | 09:37 | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PRINT-EOJ data type was added to the TN3270E specification in Request for
Comments (RFC) 2355, which replaces RFC 1647. The PRINT-EOJ data type was added
to provide support for an end-of-job indicator for TN3270E print jobs.

For more information about the PRINT-EOJ data type, browse to the following
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Web site to see RFC 2355:

  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2355.txt

TN3287 printing support was added to the TN3270 specification in RFC 1646.

For more information about TN3287, browse to the following IETF Web site to see
RFC 1646:

  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1646.txt
