-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A Transaction Program (TP) that can be invoked (called upon to start a
conversation) by another TP is known as an "Invokable TP". Invokable TPs are
generally server-type applications.

A TP that is automatically started when invoked is known as an
"autostarted invokable TP".

Tpsetup.exe is a utility that is included with Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000
and with the SNA Server 4.0 Software Development Kits (SDK). You can use
Tpsetup.exe to install autostarted invokable TPs. Autostarted invokable TPs can
be either queued or nonqueued.

Queued and nonqueued TPs function differently:

- When a queued TP is invoked multiple times, it loads one time and then queues
  up requests after that to be dealt with one at a time.
- When a nonqueued TP is invoked multiple times, it loads multiple times, one
  time for every time that it is invoked.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that you use the Tpsetup.exe program to install autostarted
invokable TPs. The registry locations that Tpsetup.exe creates under different
running environments are listed as follows.

HIS Administrator Client with SNA Server 4.0 Windows NT Client:

With SNABASE Running as a Service

- With TP running as a service:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;TPNAME&gt;\Parameters

- With TP running as an application:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\TPs\&lt;TPNAME&gt;\Parameters

With SNABASE Running as an Application

- With TP running as a service:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\&lt;TPNAME&gt;\Parameters
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;TPNAME&gt;

- With TP running as an application:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\TPs\&lt;TPNAME&gt;\Parameters

NOTE: The version of Tpsetup.exe that is included with Host Integraton Server
(HIS) includes an extra parameter named &lt;Accessible by All Users&gt;. This
parameter is checked by default with the HIS Administrator Client and cannot be
modified. With the HIS End-User Client, this parameter is unchecked by default.

Under HIS End-User Client:

- With SNABASE running only as an application
  With TP running only as an application (&lt;Accessible by All Users&gt;
  unchecked)

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\TPs\&lt;TPNAME&gt;\Parameters

- With &lt;Accessible by All Users&gt; checked on HIS End-User Client
  SNA Server 4.0 Windows 95, 98, ME Client
  With SNABASE runs only as an application
  With TP running only as an application

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\TPs\&lt;TPNAME&gt;\Parameters
