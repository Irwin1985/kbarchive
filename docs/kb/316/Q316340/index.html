SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to back up files and folders on a
Windows NT Server 4.0-based or Windows NT Workstation 4.0-based computer. After
you have backed up your data, you can restore it from tape.

Requirements
------------

- A computer (that meets the requirements that are listed on the appropriate
  Hardware Compatibility List) on which Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT
  Workstation 4.0 is installed.
- A tape drive (that meets the requirements that are listed on the appropriate
  Hardware Compatibility List) must be installed in the computer, and a tape
  must be inserted in the drive.

Backing Up Files and Folders on a Windows NT 4.0 Computer
---------------------------------------------------------

Tape backup is an important part of a network's fault-tolerance plan. You can use
Windows NT Backup to back up files and folders on a Windows NT 4.0-based
computer, both locally and across the network. If you want to back up remote
files, you must first connect to a shared folder on the server where the remote
files are located.

NOTE: Windows NT Backup can only back up the Registry or event logs on the
Windows NT 4.0-based computer on which the tape drive is installed.

Because Windows NT Backup does not back up files that are locked open by
programs, you should notify users to close files before you start the backup
job. Or, you can start the backup job at a time when users do not have access to
files, such as after business hours.

To back up files and folders, you need to either be a member of the
administrators, backup operators, or server operators groups, or you must have
the "Back up files and directories" user right. To back up files and folders:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools (Common), and
  then click Backup.

2. In the Backup dialog box, click Drives on the Window menu.

3. If you want to back up an entire drive or drives, click to select the check
  boxes next to the drives you want to back up. If you want to back up specific
  files or folders on a drive, double-click the drive to expand it. Then
  continue to expand folders until the files or folders you want to back up are
  displayed. Next, click to select the check box next to each file and folder
  you want to back up. If you then want to select files on another drive, click
  Drives on the Window menu, and then expand the drive and click to select the
  check box next to each file and folder you want to back up. When you have
  finished selecting files and folders to be backed up, click Backup.

4. In the Backup Information dialog box, type a name for the tape in the Tape
  Name box. In the Description box, type a description of the backup. Select
  the backup type you want to use, and then select the backup options you want
  to use for this backup.

  NOTE: If you select the Verify After Backup option, the amount of time that is
  needed for the backup is approximately doubled.

  After you have configured all of the tape and backup options, click OK. If a
  Replace Information dialog box is displayed, click Yes to overwrite the
  existing data on the tape.

5. Windows NT Backup backs up the selected data. When the backup is complete,
  click OK in the Backup Status dialog box. Quit Windows NT Backup to complete
  the process of making a backup on your Windows NT 4.0-based computer.
