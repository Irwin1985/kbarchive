The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "Remove software when no longer advertised" advanced SMS
program property, the following SMS Status messages may not be generated during
software removal by SMSAPM32. Additionally, SMSAPM32 may not remove software
that is no longer advertised in the three documented scenarios for software
deinstallation (see the "More Information" section of this article for a
description of these scenarios).

SMSAPM32 Software Uninstall Status Messages
-------------------------------------------

  10012 - Uninstall started for advertisement "XXXnnnnn" ("&lt;package
  name&gt;" - "&lt;program name&gt;"). Command line: "......." Working
  Directory: "......."

  10013 - The uninstall program for advertisement "XXXnnnnn" failed
  ("&lt;package name&gt;" - "&lt;program name&gt;"). A non-zero exit code of n
  was returned.
  Possible cause: SMS Advertised Program Manager (APM) determines status for
  each program it executes. If APM cannot find or correlate any install status
  Management Information Format (MIF) files for the program, it uses the
  program's exit code to determine status. A non-zero exit code is considered a
  failure.%nSolution: For more information about the exit code, refer to the
  documentation for the program you are distributing.

  10014 - The uninstall program for advertisement "XXXnnnnn" failed
  ("&lt;package name&gt;" - "&lt;program name&gt;"). The failure description
  was ".......".
  Possible cause: The uninstall program generated an install status Management
  Information Format (MIF) file with a status value of Failed.%nSolution: For
  more information about the failure, refer to the documentation for the
  program you are distributing.

  10015 - The uninstall program for advertisement "XXXnnnnn" completed
  successfully ("&lt;package name&gt;" - "&lt;program name&gt;"). An exit code
  of zero was returned.
  SMS Advertised Program Manager (APM) determines status for each program it
  executes. If APM cannot find or correlate any install status Management
  Information Format (MIF) files for the program, it uses the program's exit
  code program to determine status. An exit code of zero is considered
  successful.

  10016 - The uninstall program for advertisement "XXXnnnnn" completed
  successfully ("&lt;package name&gt;" - "&lt;program name&gt;"). The success
  description was "........".
  The program generated an install status Management Information Format (MIF)
  file with a status value of Success. For more information, see the
  documentation for the program you are distributing.

CAUSE
=====

A regression in the software uninstall with SMSAPM32 was introduced in Systems
Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

For additional information about the SMS 2.0 SP4 HRP, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q323206 SMS: List of Bugs Fixed in the Systems Management Server 2.0 SP4 HRP

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMS Administrators online manual describes the scenarios under which
software will be removed when the advertisement is considered to be revoked on a
32-bit client. The scenarios are:

1. The client is not longer a member of the collection that is specified in the
  advertisement.

2. The advertisement is deleted.

3. The advertisement expires.

Without the application of the hotfix that is described in this article, software
uninstall with the "Remove software when it is no longer advertised" option only
occurs consistently when the advertisement has expired and the advertisement
target is a computer-based collection. If the advertisement target is removed
from the collection, or the advertisement is deleted, software uninstall and the
associated status messages will not occur as you expect. If the collection to
which the advertisement is targeted is made up of User or User Group resources,
software uninstall and associated uninstall status messages do not occur.

Application of the hotfix that is described in this article provides software
uninstall under the three previously described scenarios, whether the
advertisement is targeted at a Systems, User, or User Group-based collection.
Advertisement status messages for software uninstall are also correctly
generated.

For more descriptions of the "Remove software when it is no longer advertised"
feature, view the SMS Administrator online help under "Distributing software to
clients", "Using Programs in Packages", "Create a Program" and then click the
Advanced Tab link.

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Apply this fix on all of the sites in the SMS hierarchy. To install the fix, use
one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required; you must
  also download them from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
  folder structure intact. The Q316021.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator rights.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q316021.exe file and follow the instructions in the wizard. The
  Systems Management Server services are stopped and restarted as part of the
  installation process.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. Copy the update program file (Q316021.exe) and platform folders to a new
  folder. The folder structure must be such that the program file is located
  one folder "above" the platform folders.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services in Control
  Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it.

3. Replace the Clicore.exe file that is located in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version that is
  located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

4. Replace the Compver.ini that is located in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base
  folder with the Compverbase.ini file that is located in the hotfix
  &lt;platform&gt; folder. The file must maintain its original name of
  Compver.ini.

5. Replace the Ccmcore.exe file that is located in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version that is
  located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\smsapm32\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version
  that is located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

7. Replace the Compver.ini file that is located in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder with the Compversmsapm32.ini file
  that is located in the &lt;platform&gt; folder. The file must maintain its
  original name of Compver.ini.

8. Replace the Swdist32.exe file that is located in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version that
  is located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

9. Replace the Compver.ini file that is located in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist folder with the Compverswdist.ini file that is
  located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder. The file must maintain its
  original name of Compver.ini.

10. Replace the Bindclin.dll file that is located in the
  SMS\Bin\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version that is located in the
  hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

11. Replace the Ccim32.dll file that is located in the SMS\Bin\&lt;platform&gt;
  folder with the version that is located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt;
  folder.

12. Replace the Clisvcl.exe file that is located in the SMS\Bin\&lt;platform&gt;
  folder with the version that is located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt;
  folder.

13. Replace the Mslmclin.dll file that is located in the
  SMS\Bin\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version that is located in the
  hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

14. Replace the Ndsclin.dll file that is located in the SMS\Bin\&lt;platform&gt;
  folder with the version that is located in the hotfix &lt;platform&gt;
  folder.

15. Replace the Odpsys32.exe file that is located in the
  SMS\Bin\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version that is located in the
  hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

  hotfix &lt;platform&gt; folder.

17. Replace the SMSAPM32.EXE file that is located in the
  SMS\Bin\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version that is located in the
