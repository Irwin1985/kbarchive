-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Collections that have a carriage return or line feed in the comment may not be
replicated to child sites correctly. If you view the collection properties at a
child site, the portion of the comment that is after the carriage return may be
missing, and the collection's update schedule may not be defined. Note that when
you create or edit a collection, you can add a new line to the comment field by
pressing ENTER or CTRL+ENTER.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server (SMS) service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date       Time   Version         Size       File name    Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  01-Mar-01  16:15  2.00.1493.3227  2,431,760  Basesvr.dll  Alpha
  01-Mar-01  16:15  2.00.1493.3227  1,579,936  Basesvr.dll  Intel

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains these files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do not use ENTER or CTRL+ENTER in the comments
field of the collection properties.

Hotfix Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Apply the fix in this article to all sites in the SMS hierarchy. After you
install the fix, update the collections that are affected by the problem at the
site where it was created. To install the fix, use one of the following
methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

  Q316132.exe is an SMS Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to the site server by using an account with administrative rights.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q316132.exe tool, and then follow the directions in the wizard. You
  can run the file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

2. Stop the SMS Site Component Manager, SMS Executive, and SMS SQL Monitor
  services on the site server.

3. Replace the Basesvr.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

4. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager, SMS Executive, Windows Management,
  and SMS SQL Monitor services.
