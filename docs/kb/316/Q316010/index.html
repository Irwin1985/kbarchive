Product(s): Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
Version(s): 6.0
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): kbCompiler
Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can build small Visual Basic projects successfully. However, if you build a
large Visual Basic project, you may receive the following error message:

  Could not execute 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Link.exe'

This problem occurs more often when you build your project under nested folders.

CAUSE
=====

The length of the Link.exe command line exceeds the limitation of the operating
system because of the large number of modules that must be linked in your
project.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date        Time    Version     Size     File name     Platform
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  8-Jan-2002  11:52   6.0.0.9445  1.601 KB VBA6.dll      x86

To install this hotfix, rename the old VBA6.dll file, and then replace it with
the new VBA6.dll file that is included in the fix.



WORKAROUND
==========

If the number of modules in your project is not too large, you can build your
project executable files into a folder with a short path such as C:\.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
