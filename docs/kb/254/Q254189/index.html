SUMMARY
=======

Management Agent (MA) working folders are created when the Management Agent is
created in Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS). When you create an MA, you
choose a descriptive name and the MA type from the predefined MAs included with
MMS. A working folder with an 8-digit name is then created in the
Zoomserver\Data\DS folder (for example Zoomserv\Data\DS\00000001). When you run
the MA for the first time, the working folder is populated with intermediate and
log files. The MA is initialized by using the contents of the
Zoomserv\Data\Dsgate\&lt;X&gt; folder (where &lt;X&gt; is the MA type). Each MA
creates a working folder. The files specified on the Working Folder tab may be
unique based on the MA.

To locate the working folder and MA-specific files:

1. Click the MA.

2. On the Action menu, click Properties.

3. Click the "Intermediate Files and Logs Files" tab.

4. Click the Working Folder tab. This tab lists the working folder and the files
  associated with the MA.

NOTE: The working folder is empty before you run the MA. Depending on the
operational setting that you choose, the task to run depends on which files are
written to the working folder when you run the MA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because every MA is customized slightly for its corresponding connected folder,
this example is based on the Microsoft Windows NT MA. This example demonstrates
how to associate the working folder files with the operational setting for the
MA.

Microsoft Windows NT Management Agent Example
---------------------------------------------

The following MA processes are associated with the MA-specific files located in
the working folder.

  Groups Discovered: Import.ou
  User Discovered: Import
  Lists Discovered: Import.lst
  CD Group Updates: Create
  CD User Updates: Create.ou
  CD List Updates: Create.lst
  Foreign User Updates: Export

Operational Settings for Microsoft Management Agents:

The objects to process operational settings determine which files are created in
the working folder.

Types of Objects to Process:

Process Windows NT Domains
Process Windows NT Accounts
Process Windows NT Groups

MA Working Folders Considerations
---------------------------------

When you are making changes to the MA templates, it is important to understand
the effects of making changes to the MA that is stored in the DSgate folder
instead of the DS folder. The DSgate folder stores the initial copy that is used
when the predefined MA is used to create an MA. Changing the MA in the Dsgate
folder affects every MA created from that predefined MA. To change only one
specific MA, change the MA that is stored in the DS folder.
