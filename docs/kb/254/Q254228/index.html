-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Remote Control tool on a client computer that is
running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 and runs Winsock2 with IP
as the default protocol, Remote Control does not work properly. The client
either experiences a general protection (GP) fault in Idisp16.dll, or the
desktop is not properly drawn.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 Remote Control tool is not compatible
with the Winsock2 update. This version of Winsock is included with Windows 98 by
default, and can exist in Windows 95 if the Winsock2 update has been installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

Note that this hotfix installs either an English or a French client, depending on
the installed version on the target site server.

This fix should have the following file attributes or later.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either NetBIOS or IPX as the default protocol
for the SMS Remote Control tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the SMS site server.

Using the Hotfix Installer
--------------------------

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q254228.exe is
  an SMS Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrator privileges.

3. Run Q254228.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard. You can run the
  file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Note that the status bar in the Hotfix Installer tool may show a percentage that
varies quickly between 30 percent and 40 percent for a few seconds when the
Shutdown.ct1 file is being processed. This is not a problem; the Hotfix
Installer tool waits for the shutdown of the site.

Manual Installation
-------------------

1. Run Q254228.exe.

2. In the first Welcome screen, click Next.

3. Save or print the installation instructions.

4. Cancel the installation, and then follow the manual installation
  instructions.

To update the SMS Administrator consoles, copy the Sightnt.dll file from the
appropriate platform and language folder to the SMS site server or Administrator
Tools computer. Replace the existing copy of the Sightnt.dll file in the
&lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder.

To update the clients, you can run the Upgrade.bat file on each client. For
additional information about other methods for updating clients, click the
