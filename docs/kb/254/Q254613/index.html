SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a Windows 2000 Server-based computer running Internet
Information Services (IIS) 5.0, you may receive the following error message:

  HTTP/1.0 Invalid Application Name

CAUSE
=====

There are several causes for this kind of error message, which include the
following:

- Permission problems or conflicting permissions can cause this problem.
  Administrators sometimes forget to remove or streamline permissions at the
  NTFS level, which can cause the error message to occur. For additional
  information about setting permissions on NTFS drives, click the article
  number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q187506 List of NTFS Permissions Required for IIS Site to Work

  Also, the Anonymous user account can be replaced with specific users (local
  and global) and groups when tighter security is required. Essentially, the
  only accounts that need access to any Web site are Administrators (local
  group), System, and either IUSR or the specific groups and users you want to
  give access to. All other accounts should be removed from the list.

- IUSR missing Read and Execute (RX) permissions on the Global.asa file can
  cause this error message. It is often incorrectly assumed that granting Read
  access to the Global.asa file allows malicious users the ability to read and
  manipulate that file. Actually, for sites that allow Anonymous access, this
  permission is required for the Global.asa file to initiate properly. If you
  are not using the Anonymous account, please see the Knowledge Base article
  referenced previously for information on setting correct permissions.

- The FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE) are not installed correctly. The FPSE
  set up the server for added functionality by using the FrontPage and Visual
  InterDev client tools. If they are incorrectly or incompletely installed,
  this error message can occur.

- It is possible that pages are in a subfolder of the parent application root,
  and that folder has restricted permissions. For example, if the Default Web
  Site is set at C:\Inetpub\Wwwroot, and this is the Application root in
  Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). The Wwwroot folder has given NTFS
  permissions to the Everyone group. However, under the Wwwroot folder,
  permissions have been set on a folder called test that restricts access to
  that folder. If you have set up a Web site so that folders at one level of
  the site have relatively open permissions, and sub-levels have restricted
  permissions, then you may encounter this problem. Please see the Knowledge
  Base article referenced previously to set consistent permissions for the
  entire application.
