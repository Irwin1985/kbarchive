The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes several methods that you can use to connect Windows CE PC
companion devices to Exchange Server. The easiest method uses a browser to
connect to Exchange Server by using a Web interface. To use this method, the
Outlook Web Access (OWA) component of Exchange Server must be installed on
either the Exchange Server computer itself or on another computer. You can also
connect to Exchange Server by using standard Internet protocols, such as Post
Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol, Version
4rev1 (IMAP4).

This article does not describe third-party methods to connect Windows CE PC
companion devices to Microsoft Exchange Server. This article only describes the
"out of the box" solutions to connect these devices to Exchange Server. Also,
this article does not describe how to synchronize your device by using a desktop
personal computer; synchronize your device by using the software that is
included with your device.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Connecting to Exchange Server By Using a Browser
------------------------------------------------


Windows CE version 2.1 (Windows CE Pro) contains a browser that supports frames
and scripting, as well as secure links and 128-bit security. This browser can
connect to a standard OWA server and is the recommended method to connect
devices that are running Windows CE 2.1 to Exchange Server. It requires the
least amount of resources from the device that is running Windows CE. For more
information about how to install OWA, see the Exchange Server 5.5
documentation.

Connecting to Exchange Server By Using POP3 or IMAP4
----------------------------------------------------

Windows CE 2.0 provides an Internet Mail Service (POP3 only) that you can
configure to connect to Exchange Server.

IMPORTANT: This service can only make serial, dial-up, or infrared connections to
the POP3 server. This service is not compatible with Ethernet network
connections.

Windows CE 2.1 (Windows CE Pro) includes a POP3 service and an IMAP4 service.
POP3 allows you to connect to only the Inbox; you cannot open any other folders.
If you use the IMAP4 protocol, you can open folders other than the Inbox. Also,
both of these protocols can use an Ethernet connection as well as serial,
dial-up, or infrared connections.

Serial connections require that you have the Windows CE synchronization software
and a connecting cable installed directly on the Exchange Server computer.
Likewise, an infrared connection requires the Exchange Server computer to be
fitted with a compatible infrared device. Serial and infrared connections also
require the Exchange Server computer to be physically available to the Windows
CE users. Because of these requirements, it is unlikely that a serial or
infrared connection would be made from a Windows CE PC companion device directly
to an Exchange Server computer. For more information about how to configure one
of these types of connections, see the Windows CE help files on how to create
the connection on the device.

A dial-up connection to the Exchange Server computer is the type of connection
most likely to be used for remote connectivity. A compatible dial-up server must
be configured either on the same computer that Exchange Server is installed on,
or on another server that has connectivity to the Exchange Server computer.
Microsoft Windows NT Remote Access Service (RAS) or Routing and Remote Access
Service (RRAS) provide this capability. For additional information, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q174800 Documentation Location for Routing and Remote Access Service

An Ethernet connection is the fastest method available to connect Windows CE PC
companion devices to Exchange Server. If you use a compatible Personal Computer
Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) card or CompactFlash Ethernet
card with a device that is running Windows CE, you can make a direct connection
to a desktop personal computer for synchronization. Handheld PCs that are
running Windows CE Pro can also make POP3 or IMAP4 connections to Exchange
Server computers that are available on the local area network (LAN). For more
information about how to configure one of these types of connections, see the
Windows CE help files about how to create the connection on the device. For
additional information, refer to the FAQ located at the following Web site:

  http://www.cewindows.net/wce/20/ethernet.htm

If you use any of these services with Exchange Server 5.5 you can connect
directly to your server by using POP3 or IMAP4. However, to send mail by using
SMTP, you must ensure that the server that you want to connect to has the
Internet Mail Service configured and running. This can be a separate server, or
the same server that contains your mailbox. For additional information, click
