SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, when you are running Isinteg in Fix mode against an
information store, appointments may become unusable for users. The appointments
either are still there but become unusable because of randomly modified start
and end times or they are deleted from the user's calendar. A typical command
line which may cause this issue is the following one:

  isinteg -pri -fix -detailed -verbose -test message

CAUSE
=====

When you are running Isinteg against an information store in Fix mode, it can
remove MAPI properties from the JET property tag arrays of appointments without
further checking if these properties are still required for proper appointment
access. As a result, the affected appointments become unusable because of
randomly modified start and end times or they can even be deleted from the
user's calendar.

Typically, these remove operations are logged in the Isinteg.pri or Isinteg.pub
file in the following way:

Total number of tests : 1

Total number of fixes : 3
Total time : 0h:1m:20s

In this scenario, the named property, 806A0040, where 806A represents the
property's ID while 0040 represents the property's type (which is PT_SYSTIME
here), is removed from the affected appointments. The ID 806A may differ for
other stores because it's a named property. In terms of MAPI, named properties
may be uniquely referenced either by a name or by an ID. This issue causes
Isinteg to delete every appointment's named property that maps to the ID 33293,
which is the ID that maps to the appointment's start time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 SP2 and 5.5 SP3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To work properly, the Isinteg fix also requires a store fix with a build number
of 5.5.2651.85 or later.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q244976 XADM: Event ID 1197 and 1005 When Starting the Information Store

To go to a previous build of the Store.exe file:

1. Stop the information store.

2. Replace the current build of the Store.exe file with a build prior to
  5.5.2651.32.

3. Restore from an online backup of a database before you install the hotfix on
  server.

4. Restart the services and allow transaction logs to be replayed against the
  older database.
