SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure pcAnywhere to use behind a Proxy Server
for purposes of remote control through Proxy Server 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure pcAnywhere on a client computer behind Proxy Server:

1. Install the Microsoft Winsock Proxy client on the internal client (Microsoft
  Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 95, or Microsoft Windows 98) that will be the
  pcAnywhere 8.0 host (if not already done). You can do this by connecting to
  \\&lt;servername&gt;\Msplnt and running the Setup.exe program from this
  folder.

2. Be sure that the Winsock Proxy client is properly installed by using the
  Chkwsp32 utility from the client computer. You may also want to test the
  Winsock Proxy client by using a Winsock program, such as File Transfer
  Protocol (FTP), from a command prompt to ensure that the Winsock Proxy client
  is configured properly.

3. Create a Wspcfg.ini file and save it in the folder where the Awhost32.exe
  file is installed (by default this is in the Program Files\PcAnywhere
  folder). The contents of this file depend on the client operating system and
  the Proxy Server configuration. If either of the following conditions exist:

   - Windows 98 is the client or host operating system for pcAnywhere

  -or-

   - Microsoft Windows NT is the client or host operating system and Access
     Control is disabled for Winsock Proxy on the Proxy Server

  use the following Wspcfg.ini file to bind pcAnywhere to an IP address on the
  Proxy Server's external interface:

  [awhost32]
  ProxyBindIp=5631:&lt;1st IP address&gt;
  ServerBindTCPPorts=5631
  LocalBindTCPPorts=65301
  KillOldSession=1
  Persistent=1

  If the client or host computer is using Windows NT and Access Control is
  enabled for Winsock Proxy on the Proxy Server, use the following Wspcfg.ini
  file:

  [awhost32]
  ProxyBindIp=5631:&lt;1st IP address&gt;
  ServerBindTCPPorts=5631
  LocalBindTCPPorts=65301
  KillOldSession=1
  Persistent=1
  ForceCredentials=1

  NOTE: Verify that the Wspcfg.ini file is saved without the .txt file name
  extension.

If the client or host computer is using Windows NT and Access Control is enabled
for Winsock Proxy on the Proxy Server, the following additional steps are
required:

1. On the Proxy Server, create two protocol definitions:

Protocol Name: PcAnywhere-UDP
Initial Connection:
 Port=5632
 Type=UDP
 Direction=Inbound
Port Ranges for subsequent connections:
 Port=1025-5000
 Type=TCP
 Direction=Outbound

Protocol Name: PcAnywhere-TCP
Initial Connection:
 Port=5631
 Type=TCP
 Direction=Inbound
Port Ranges for subsequent connections:
 Port=1025-5000
 Type=TCP
 Direction=Outbound

2. Run the Credtool.exe program on the client computer to provide credentials
  for the Awhost32.exe program. From the client computer, open a command prompt
  and change folders to the Program Files\Pcanywhere folder, and then run the
  following command:

  credtool -w -n awhost32 &lt;username&gt;&lt;domain&gt;&lt;password&gt;

3. Configure pcAnywhere so that it does not run as a service. To do this:

  a. Right-click the pcAnywhere icon on the host computer, such as Network or
     Direct, and then click Properties.

  b. On the Settings tab, click to clear the "Run As a Service" check box in
     the "Host Startup" section.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

4. On the host with pcAnywhere versions 8.0 or higher installed, add the
  following entry to the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Symantec\pcAnywhere\CurrentVersion\System

  Create a DWORD entry called TCPIPConnectIfUnknown with the value set to "1".
