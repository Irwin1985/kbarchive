SYMPTOMS
========

Performance Monitor may display some data incorrectly when you use saved chart
settings from the .pmc files to view the data logged in the Perfmon log files.
If you open the Perfmon log file in Performance Monitor and the saved chart
settings are loaded from a .pmc file with the counters from multiple computers
(servers), Performance Monitor may show some of the counters with zero data,
instead of showing the data that was collected in the log file.

Performance Monitor always shows correct data for all the counters from the
computer whose data is first logged in the Perfmon log file. In addition, if you
manually add the counters (rather than from the .pmc file), Performance Monitor
shows the correct data values and works as expected.

In some cases you may receive a Dr. Watson event message when you try to view the
.pmc file. The Dr. Watson Log file may show the following information:

  Application exception occurred:
  App: exe\perfmon.dbg (pid=218) *
  When: 3/19/2002 @ 7:50:50.809 *
  Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

CAUSE
=====

When you use saved chart settings from .pmc files to view data that is logged in
the Perfmon log files, Performance Monitor reads the system name for the
counters saved in the .pmc file and tries to retrieve the data from the log file
for that system counter. Because Performance Monitor always searches for counter
data in the first computer's logged data (rather than the corresponding
computer's logged data in the log file), it does not retrieve correct data for
counters other than the counters for the system whose data is first logged in
the log file.
