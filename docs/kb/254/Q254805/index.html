MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrator program fixes include the following files:

+--------------------------------+
| File name    | Current version | 
+--------------------------------+
| Admin.exe    | 5.5.2652.70     | 
+--------------------------------+
| Dapi.dll     | 5.5.2652.49     | 
+--------------------------------+
| Imcadmin.dll | 5.5.2651.32     | 
+--------------------------------+
| Inproxy.dll  | 5.5.2652.32     | 
+--------------------------------+
| Mad.exe      | 5.5.2652.31     | 
+--------------------------------+
| Mdbsz.dll    | 5.5.2651.67     | 
+--------------------------------+
| Movesrvr.dll | 5.5.2651.9      | 
+--------------------------------+

+--------------------------------+
| X400prox.dll | 5.5.2651.74     | 
+--------------------------------+

NOTES:

- When you apply these fixes, the installation program automatically copies the
  updated Movesrvr.dll file to the Exchsrvr\Bin\Movesrvr folder, if this folder
  exists on your hard disk. If the Move Server Wizard is installed in a
  different folder, to apply the fix, manually copy the updated Movesrvr.dll
  file to the appropriate folder after you run the installation program.

- The fix documented in Q243822, "XCON: Internet Mail Service Message Size
  Restriction Is Not Correctly Displayed," requires an updated Msexcimc.exe
  file in addition to the updated Imcadmin.dll file. This updated Msexcimc.exe
  file is contained in new versions of the Internet Mail Service, not the
  Administrator program. Therefore, to fully resolve the problem documented in
  Q243822, you must obtain a new version of the Internet Mail Service in
  addition to obtaining a new version of the Administrator program.

- The fix documented in Q249111, "XFOR: Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail
  Not Supporting Korean Language," requires an updated Ccmc.exe file in
  addition to the updated Admin.exe file. This updated Ccmc.exe file is
  contained in new versions of the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, not
  the Administrator program. Therefore, to fully resolve the problem documented
  in Q249111, you must obtain a new version of the Exchange Connector for Lotus
  cc:Mail in addition to obtaining a new version of the Administrator program.

- Microsoft recommends that the user apply this Exchange Server Administrator
  fix to at least one Exchange Server computer in each site before you apply it
  to workstations. This ensures that the updated proxy generators are available
  in the site.
