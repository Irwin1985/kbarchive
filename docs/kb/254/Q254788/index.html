  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Every time that you open Schedule+ data, you may be prompted to type a password.
When you try to change the password, the New Password dialog box is displayed
first. If you try to change the password after that, the Change Password dialog
box is displayed. However, every time you start Schedule+, you are still
prompted for your password.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you previously used Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) and you
entered a password for your Schedule+ file. After your mailbox is migrated to
Microsoft Exchange Server, you need to type this password every time that you
start Schedule+ 7.5.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, perform the following steps in Schedule+:

1. On the File menu, point to Export, and then click Schedule+ Interchange.

2. Type the file name, and then click OK to export all Schedule+ data.

3. On the File menu, click "Exit and Log Off" to quit Schedule+.

4. In Windows Explorer, press and hold CTRL+SHIFT while you double-click the
  Schedule+ icon. A dialog box confirms that you want to clear your Schedule+
  data.

5. Click Yes to continue. If you are prompted for the profile, click the
  appropriate profile, and then click OK. Schedule+ starts with a new local and
  server schedule.

6. On the File menu, point to Import, and then click Schedule+ Interchange.

7. Locate the Schedule+ export file that you saved in step 1. Click the file,
  and then click Open.
