SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to retrieve items after your character dies in
Microsoft Asheron's Call.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When your character dies in Asheron's Call, you lose half of your Pyreals and,
depending on your skill level, you may lose one or more of your most valuable
items. The lost items are stored in your character's corpse and eventually will
be available on the ground for a short time after the corpse decomposes.

The higher your skill level, the longer it takes for the corpse to decompose. The
minimum time that it takes for your character's corpse to decompose is 60
minutes. For each skill level that you attain, five minutes are added to the
time it takes for your character's corpse to decompose. To retrieve your items,
you must first find your character's corpse. This can be done by going to the
coordinates of the corpse. The coordinates of your corpse are listed in the
"Chat &amp; Events Log" when you die.

Note: Coordinates do not exist in buildings or a dungeons. If you die within such
a location, no coordinates will be listed when you die. We suggest that you look
at the Map prior to entering such an area and make note of the coordinates to
the entrance and your general location once inside.

If you do not think you can get to your corpse in time you may use the /permit
command in the Chat Box to give another player permission to loot your corpse.
This should be a player that you trust will give the items back to you. For more
information on the /permit command, type in "/help permit" (without the
quotation marks) in the Chat Box.

If you cannot find your character's corpse, the items that are contained in the
corpse become available on the ground for other players to take after the corpse
has completely decomposed.

NOTE: Microsoft cannot manually restore any lost items for you.
