  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server (SMS) client that has been discovered by an SMS
2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) site server resides inside the site boundaries of an
SMS 2.0 Service Pack 1 (build 1380) site, that site's Client Configuration
Manager (CCM) attempts to install the remaining client components and optional
client agents. This can potentially place the client in an unstable condition.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft. This
fix is one of two fixes that are required for SMS 2.0 sites with Service Pack 1
(build 1380) before any site can be upgraded to SMS 2.0 SP2. This fix is
included in the Smsqfe folder on the SP2 CD-ROM. Detailed instructions for
hotfix installation are also included in the Release Notes that accompany the
service pack.

For additional information about the accompanying fix that you must apply to SMS
2.0 sites with Service Pack 1 (build 1380), click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q249077 SMS: SP1: Copylog.tcf File Does Not Reflect Which Site Last Updated
  the Logon Point

For additional information about these fixes and similar fixes that you must
apply to SMS 2.0 sites without Service Pack 1 (build 1239), click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q261931 SMS: Required Hotfixes Before Installing SMS 2.0 SP2

To avoid the condition described in the "Symptoms" section of this article, you
must apply the fix that is described in this article to all SMS 2.0 sites with
Service Pack 1 (build 1380) before any site is upgraded to SMS 2.0 SP2. Click

WARNING: This hotfix may not install on some secondary sites even though the
hotfix installation may appear to run successfully. These hotfixes check for the
existence of the Full Version value in the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup

If you have secondary sites that were either installed or upgraded directly from
the primary site, this key may not be created or properly updated. Before
applying this hotfix, please verify the existence of this key on all secondary
sites. The Qxxxxxx.log file that is generated when you install the hotfix will
state that the version is 000. To correct this, manually create or update the
registry value. To create or update this value on secondary sites, use the
following steps.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Using Regedit or Regedt32, locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup

2. If the Full Version key exists, manually update it using these corresponding
  values:

  Release version (build 1239): 2.00.1239.0000
  SP1 version (build 1380): 2.00.1380.1000

3. If the registry value does not exist, create the value and supply the
  appropriate value from step 2.

Using Regedit:

  a. Right-click the Setup key, and then click New, String Value.

  b. Name this value Full Version.

  c. Double-click the Full Version value and supply the correct version listed
     in step 2.

Using Regedt32:

  a. Click to highlight the Setup key.

  b. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

  c. For the Value Name, type "Full Version" (without the quotation marks).

     NOTE: The Data Type should be REG_SZ.

  d. Click OK.

  e. You are prompted for the string value. Type the appropriate version from
     step 2, and then click OK.

You should now see the Full Version value listed under the Setup key, which
reflects the version you typed. After you finish this process, continue to apply
the hotfix.

The English-language version of the fix should have the following file attributes
or later:
