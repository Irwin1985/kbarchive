The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 5.0, 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform a Move Mailbox operation, the mailbox is displayed in the
"mailbox resources" of both the source and destination servers. On the source
server, the total kilobytes displayed is close to 0. On the destination server,
the total kilobytes displayed is the correct amount of data.

If you attempt to perform another Move Mailbox operation, the following error
message is displayed:

  A duplicate mailbox was found due to problems during a Move Mailbox
  procedure. The duplicate mailbox has been deleted. Try again later. Microsoft
  Exchange Server Information Store ID no: c1040b00

The mailbox data on the destination server is deleted and the mail is lost.

CAUSE
=====

During a Move Mailbox operation the mailbox data is moved to the destination
server, but the directory object is not. This results in the data being homed on
the destination server and the Mailbox Directory Object being stranded on the
source server.

If you attempt to move the mailbox a second time, the user's mailbox information
is removed from the destination server's information store. The source server
also removes the mailbox data because it detects the move as being successful.
At this point, the user's mailbox information is lost.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not attempt a second Move Mailbox operation on the mailbox because you will
lose all data. To work around the behavior, use the following steps.

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Use the appropriate method:

Method 1
--------

  a. On the source server, locate the Recipients container and click the
     mailbox.

  b. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

  c. Change the Home-MDB and Home-MTA attributes to reflect the destination
     server.

     NOTE: These names need to be in the following Distinguished Name (DN)
     format:

  /o=&lt;Organization&gt;/ou=&lt;Site&gt;/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=&lt;ServerName&gt;/cn=Microsoft
  Private MDB
  /o=&lt;Organization&gt;/ou=&lt;Site&gt;/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=&lt;ServerName&gt;/cn=Microsoft
  MTA

Method 2
--------

  a. On the source server, delete the server recipient for the mailbox.

  b. On the destination server, re-create the mailbox that you deleted on the
     source server and use the same Distinguished Name (DN).

The user can now log on to the mailbox with no data loss.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first Move Mailbox operation did not work because during the Move Mailbox
process, the Administrator program first copies the selected user's mailbox to
the selected destination server (the Move Mailbox operation only works between
servers in the same site). After the mailbox is successfully moved, the Move
Mailbox function then issues a DS Sync command. During the synchronization
process, the Administrator program passes the same source and destination server
to the Move Mailbox function. As a result, the user's directory object is not
moved.

Additional query words: Moveuser RPC fail failed fails move user
