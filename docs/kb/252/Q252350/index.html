The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.1 SP1, 2.1 SP2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an optimistic batch update operation, if you try to access the Value property
for a field that is in a record marked for deletion, when you set the
disconnected recordset's Filter property to adFilterPendingRecords the following
run-time error message occurs:

  Run-time error '-2147217885(8004e23)' : A given HROW referred to a hard- or
  soft-deleted row.

CAUSE
=====

When a record is deleted in a disconnected ADO Recordset by using the rs.Delete
method, you cannot access the Value property of its constituent fields in code.

RESOLUTION
==========

To access the values that were stored in the fields of the deleted record, use
the ADO Field object OriginalValue or UnderlyingValue property.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In an optimistic batch update operation, disconnected recordsets are updated
locally on the client computer. Then the disconnected recordsets are associated
with an active connection to post the changes made to the database. The changes
may include the following:

- The addition of new records.
- Modification's to the values stored in the fields of existing records.
- Deletion of records in the disconnected recordset.

It is a good practice to examine the changes made to a disconnected recordset
locally before you connect and apply the changes to the database. The Filter
property of the ADO Recordset can be set to the adFilterPendingRecords ADO
constant value to identify the records in the disconnected recordset that have
changed, which will be applied to the database on the next call to the
UpdateBatch method.

Setting the recordset's Filter property to adFilterPendingRecords enforces a
filter on the recordset object so that the view of its constituent records is
restricted to the records changed in the disconnected recordset that have not
been posted to the database. When you set the filter you can loop through the
records and examine the Status property of each record to determine whether a
record has been added, changed, or deleted. Deleted records have their status
property set to adStatusDeleted.

Although it is possible to access the values in the fields of the newly added and
modified records by using the ADO Field object's Value property, doing the same
for the deleted records results in the run-time error message shown in the
"Symptoms" section of this article. The values that were stored in the fields of
the records marked for deletion can only be accessed through the OriginalValue
or UnderlyingValue properties of the ADO Field object.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Use the following code example to reproduce this problem. This example uses the
Microsoft Access Biblio.mdb database that is installed with Visual Basic 6.0.

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 6.0.

2. Set a project reference to the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.1 (or later)
  Library.

3. Place a Command button on Form1.

4. In the General Declarations section of Form1, insert the following code:

    Dim cn as ADODB.Connection
    Dim rs as ADODB.Recordset

5. Place the following code in the Command button's Click event procedure:

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
    Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
    cn.ConnectionString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=Biblio.mdb"
    cn.Open

    Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
    rs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
    rs.Open "Select * from [Title Author]", cn, adOpenStatic,   adLockBatchOptimistic
    'THE RECORDSET IS DISCONNECTED
    Set rs.ActiveConnection = Nothing

    rs.MoveFirst
    rs.Delete
    rs.Filter = adFilterPendingRecords
    Do While Not rs.EOF
      If rs.Status = adRecDeleted Then                                                           
        MsgBox "ISBN : " &amp; rs.Fields("ISBN") &amp; " has been deleted !" 'Error occurs on this line
      End If
      rs.MoveNext
    Loop
    rs.Filter = adFilterNone

    Set rs.ActiveConnection = cn
    rs.CancelBatch
    rs.Close
  End Sub

Press F5 to run the code. Note that the error message occurs.
6. In the preceding code segment replace the following line:

      MsgBox "ISBN : " &amp; rs.Fields("ISBN") &amp; " has been deleted !"

with this line:

      MsgBox "ISBN : " &amp; rs.Fields("ISBN").OriginalValue &amp; " has been deleted !"

Note that you can see the value of the "ISBN" field in the record marked for
deletion.
7. In the preceding example, the deletion is not posted to the database. The
  call to rs.CancelBatch ensures that the deletion is not reflected in the
  database.
