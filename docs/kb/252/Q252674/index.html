SUMMARY
=======

After Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 is installed and configured,
the local administrator and user who installed SMS have full access to the SMS
database through the SMS Administrator console. SMS is a program that can be
very useful for a help desk. For SMS to have help-desk functionality,
appropriate permissions must be assigned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS creates the SMS Admins local user group on the site server when it is
installed. If the SMS site database and SMS provider are on another computer,
SMS also creates the SMS Admins group on that computer. The SMS Administrator
console runs only on a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer.

To set up an SMS Administrator console for a help-desk administrator, make sure
that you perform all of the following tasks:

- Create a Help Desk Administrator global group with Windows NT User Manager
  for Domains.

- Add help-desk staff to this global group.

- Add the Help Desk Administrator global group to the SMS Admins local group on
  both the site server and on the site database server.

  This allows the SMS Administrator console to connect to the SMS database.
  Windows NT User Manager for Domains is used to add a help-desk administrator
  to the SMS Admins local group. If the Help Desk Administrator global group is
  not added to the SMS Admins local group, the SMS Administrator console
  displays the following message:

  Connection Failed

- Ensure that appropriate security rights to SMS security objects (collection,
  package, advertisement, site, query, and status) are assigned to view data in
  the details pane of the SMS Administrator console. If not, those security
  objects cannot be expanded.

Each security object is divided into two categories, such as Classes and
Instances. Each class consists of many instances. For example, collection is a
class. Microsoft Windows 98 computer collection is an instance. The Security
Rights menu in the SMS Administrator console is used to grant class and instance
rights.

There are 12 different permissions that can apply to classes and instances:

   - Create

- Administrator

- Delete

- Distribute

- Use Remote Tools

- Advertise

- Read Read Resource

- Modify

- Modify Resource

- Delete Resource

- View Collected Files

Create and Administrator apply only to classes. Most permissions apply to both
classes and instances.

By default, the SMS snap-in offers you access to the full range of SMS
functionality. You can create a customized Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to
meet your organization's needs. By combining a customized console with the
security permissions mentioned earlier in this section, appropriate help-desk
security and functionality can be implemented.
