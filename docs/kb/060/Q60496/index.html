When doing mixed-language programming with Microsoft FORTRAN Version
5.00 and C Version 6.00, it is necessary to use the FORTRAN
C-compatible libraries.

Also, when linking, the C 6.00 libraries should be placed first on the
link line followed by the FORTRAN library.

With C 5.10 and FORTRAN 5.00, it is possible to do mixed-language
programming using the full libraries in both C and FORTRAN because the
common routines between the two products are basically the same.
However, this is not the case with C 6.00 and FORTRAN 5.00. The common
routines often differ between the products, and the more recent
versions must be used.

In the FORTRAN 5.00 Setup program, you are given the option to build
C-compatible libraries. Because these libraries do not contain the
common routines, including much of the start-up code mentioned above,
there is no problem linking them with the C 6.00 libraries. However,
it is worth noting that these libraries can no longer be considered
stand-alone FORTRAN libraries. They are only useful in conjunction
with the C libraries. Finally, the C 6.00 libraries should be placed
before the FORTRAN libraries on the linker command line.

This information is also documented in "Advanced Programming
Techniques," Chapter 12.3.2, Page 285.
