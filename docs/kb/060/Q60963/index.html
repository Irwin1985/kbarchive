If the color of a CIRCLE, DRAW, LINE, PCOPY, PSET, or PRESET statement
does not turn out correctly in an EGA or VGA screen mode (except
SCREEN 13), make sure that the lower 4 bits (bits 0 through 3) of the
Mask Map register (&amp;H3C5) are set. If any of these bits are cleared
(not set), an attribute whose number requires those bits set will not
be displayed properly.

To set the lower 4 bits (also called the "low nibble") of the Mask Map
register, execute the following statement:

   OUT &amp;H3C5, INP(&amp;H3C5) OR 15

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 2.00, 2.01,
3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS, Microsoft BASIC Compiler
versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS, and Microsoft BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

Some graphics programming tasks require the manipulation of the mask
map register, the most common of these being the use of BLOAD in an
EGA or VGA screen mode (except SCREEN 13). The lower 4 bits of the
register determine which attributes are used when color is displayed
on the screen. If any of these bits are cleared and the attribute
being used requires that they be set, the color that the attribute
represents will not be displayed. Since the possible attributes for
the affected screen modes range from 0 to 15, only 4 bits are needed
for this purpose.

For example, if all 4 bits are set, the low nibble of the map mask
register has this internal representation:

     3   2   1   0
   +---+---+---+---+
   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   +---+---+---+---+

   2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15

The nibble equals 15, allowing all attributes to be displayed.

If the nibble is set to 13, it will look like the following:

     3   2   1   0
   +---+---+---+---+
   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
   +---+---+---+---+

   2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13

Since bit 1 is cleared in this case, any attribute that requires bit 1
set will not be displayed.

Let's look at how this will affect the display of attribute 14, which
has this internal representation:

     3   2   1   0
   +---+---+---+---+
   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
   +---+---+---+---+

   2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2 + 4 + 8 = 14

Attribute 14 requires that bit 1 be set. Since bit 1 is cleared in the
map mask register, attribute 14 cannot actually be displayed. Any
reference to it in a graphics statement actually yields attribute 12,
(which is just attribute 14 without bit 1 set) as in the following
example:

     3   2   1   0
   +---+---+---+---+
   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
   +---+---+---+---+

   2^2 + 2^3 = 4 + 8 = 12

As mentioned above, the low nibble of the map mask register affects
the color of the CIRCLE, DRAW, LINE, PCOPY, PSET, or PRESET
statements. However, CIRCLE, DRAW, and LINE reset the nibble to 15
upon their completion, so the color of the next graphics statement
executed will turn out properly. Also any PRINT or CLS statement will
reset the nibble. PCOPY, PSET, and PRESET have no effect on the map
mask register.

The following sample program demonstrates the effects of changing the
low nibble of the map mask register. Each of the affected graphics
statements is used to draw an object with 14 (yellow) as the
attribute. Then the low nibble of the map mask register is set to 13,
which clears bit 1. The graphics statement is again executed using
attribute 14, but the attribute actually used to draw the color will
be 12 (light red). The third time the graphics statement is executed,
the attribute used will be 14 for CIRCLE, DRAW, or LINE, and 12 again
for PCOPY, PSET, and PRESET.

The statements DRAW and LINE become special cases if they are used to
draw multiline objects. In this situation, only the first line of the
object will have the wrong color because after it is drawn, the low
nibble of the map mask register will be reset to 15. For example, if
the LINE statement is used to draw a box (using the B parameter), the
bottom line of the box will have the wrong color because it is drawn
first, but the rest of the lines will use the correct attribute. This
is also true with the DRAW statement -- each line drawn within the
string macro constitutes a separate call to the LINE statement.

The following program example contains SLEEP statements in certain
places so you can view the results:
