SUMMARY
=======

The following are questions and answers about security issues that pertain to
OS/2 LAN Manager versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.1a, and 2.2.

1. Q. What security is available for LAN Manager API calls? For example, I am
  able to modify a user's full name through an OS/2 server script issuing a
  NetUserSetInfo() call without being logged on either at the workstation or by
  issuing a NetWkstaSetUID() prior to (or even after) executing
  NetUserSetInfo(). When I tried to do this, however, through the NET USER
  command at the OS/2 prompt, I received a "system access denied" error. If
  this is the case, couldn't someone who knows C and the APIs wreak havoc upon
  the system?

  A. When a remote call is made to change any user account information, remote
  users must have admin privileges to make changes in any account other than
  their own, so user account information is protected from unwarranted access
  by remote users.

  On the (local) server, any user can make a NetUserSetInfo() call and make
  changes to a user account. If you need to secure your server's user account
  system (UAS), you need to use local security (run SECURESH.EXE).
  Alternatively, you can run "NET CONSOLE", which does not let anyone other
  than the administrator change the screen group, thereby securing the user
  account system.

  The Net Admin interface checks the privilege for you before you can change any
  user account system.

2. Q. On an OS/2 server running LAN Manager 2.0, 2.1, 2.1a, or 2.20 with local
  security (SECURESH.EXE), will a background process that modifies the UAS,
  without the process first issuing a NetWkstaSetUID2() in order to log on
  (nobody is currently logged on the workstation), be able to modify the UAS?

  A. When nobody is currently logged on, the user/process has LOCAL security.
  Therefore, if the LOCAL group has been granted RWX privileges (as opposed to
  RX or R only privilege), the program will modify the UAS.

  The only way to stop a person or process from changing the UAS is by not
  granting that person or process the W privilege. To do this, give the USERS
  group (default group when you add a user account) only the RX privilege for
  the LAN Manager tree (for example, C:\LANMAN), and grant the W privilege only
  to limited people for the LAN Manager tree as well.

3. Q. On an OS/2 server running LAN Manager 2.0, 2.1, 2.1a, or 2.20 with no
  local security, but with NET CONSOLE running, will a background process that
  modifies the UAS, without the process first issuing a NetWkstaSetUID2() in
  order to log on (nobody is currently logged on the workstation), be able to
  modify the UAS?

  A. Yes, a background process can change the UAS even when NET CONSOLE is
  running.

4. Q. On an OS/2 server running LAN Manager 2.0, 2.1, 2.1A, or 2.20 with local
  security (SECURESH.EXE), will a background process that modifies items
  outside the scope of the UAS (servers, shared resources, print jobs, and so
  on) without the process first issuing a NetWkstaSetUID2() in order to log on
  (nobody is currently logged on the workstation), be able to modify these
  items?

  A. You must prevent the person from launching a background process. The
  following scenario explains why.

  Suppose ADMIN is logged off. At this time, if a person named TEST wants to log
  on, the RX privilege must be granted to the LOCAL group for the LAN Manager
  and OS/2 tree (to be able to run NET LOGON). After logging on, TEST launches
  a background process that checks to see if it can change the UAS. TEST
  receives error 2199 at this time, as the LOCAL group has only RX privileges
  and no W privilege. Therefore, TEST may (Dos)Sleep() for a while and try
  again later.

  Suppose that in the meantime, ADMIN returns and logs on (NET LOGON). Now the
  background process can change the UAS. The current local user is ADMIN, who
  has all privileges.

  The only way to prevent this from happening is to avoid giving any privileges
  to the LOCAL group so that once ADMIN logs off NOBODY can access or run any
  programs, including NET LOGON. In such a system, PRIVINIT.CMD (which is
  executed when the system is booted) must look like this:

  net start server
  net logoff

  The administrator can put NET ADMIN in this command file as well, but should
  set up the UAS once, and from then on just use the server over the network.
  Should the administrator later decide to change the UAS for accessing the
  server locally or for some other reason, the best method is to change the UAS
  over the network by remote command (NET ADMIN \\&lt;remote computer
  name&gt;).

  Such a server, then, becomes completely secure against any local intrusion.

5. Q. On an OS/2 server running LAN Manager 2.0, 2.1, 2.1a, or 2.20 with no
  local security, but with NET CONSOLE running, will a background process that
  modifies items outside the scope of the UAS (that is, servers, shared
  resources, print jobs, and so on) without the process first issuing a
  NetWkstaSetUID2() in order to log on (nobody is currently logged on the
  workstation), be able to modify these items?

  A. You must look at specific APIs. However, in any case, the background
  process can just wait until someone with ADMIN privilege logs on. At this
  time, the background process can execute any ADMIN level API as well as any
  other API.
