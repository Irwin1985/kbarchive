SUMMARY
=======

The following are questions and answers about LAN Manager source level routing
and OpenAdapter issues:

1. Q. What does it mean when an NDIS driver says it supports source routing?
  Does this mean the NDIS driver keeps a table of routing information for
  subsequent use, or does it mean that the token-ring chipset the NDIS driver
  talks to keeps the routing information? Or, does this signal JETBEUI that the
  data it is receiving from the NDIS driver may have source routing
  information? This would mean that when JETBEUI receives the data, it has to
  know how to determine whether the source routing field exists, and determine
  the length of the source routing field in order to determine where the real
  data in the frame begins.

  A. If IBM source routing is used (bit 9 in MACservice specific
  characteristics), it is the protocol module's responsibility to encode and
  interpret appropriate source routing information. This bit merely implies
  that the device is capable of sending packets with the source routing bit set
  in the source address so that a protocol may recognize such a packet.

2. Q. If a Token-ring NDIS driver says it supports the open adapter, is it
  JETBEUI's responsibility to call OpenAdapter to get onto the ring? Or should
  the NDIS driver open the adapter itself once the NDIS driver has initialized
  the adapter?

  A. If OpenAdapter (bit 11) is set, the protocol driver must ensure that the
  adapter is open. The open status of an adapter can be determined by examining
  bit 4 of the MAC status in the MAC-specific status table. If the adapter is
  not open, the protocol must issue an OpenAdapterRequest (normally during
  bind-time processing).
