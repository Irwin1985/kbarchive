The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user-mode process that creates a named pipe and passes its path name as an out
parameter of the AddJob() call may leak non-paged pool memory when a client
connects to the named pipe and writes the job content resulting in an eventual
disabled server. The leakage is in proportion to the size of the job. The
resource is not reclaimed when the provider is restarted (the computer must be
restarted).

The leak may be observed by using the Performance Monitor utility and tracking
the Memory/Pool nonpaged bytes counter. The size of the leak is proportional to
the job size (the size of the file copied to the Named Pipe), the leak is larger
in the case of the print command than the copy command. This resource leak
eventually disables the server and you may see the following message in the
System Event log:

  Date: 4/2/99
  Time: 7:39:58 PM
  User: N/A
  Event ID: 2019
  Source: Svr
  Type: Error
  Description: The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool
  because the pool was empty.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Server Service was not cleaning up the I/o
Requested Packet after the job was completed. Even though the leak looks like it
is in Named Pipes File System, it is actually caused by the Server Service
(Srv.sys).


RESOLUTION
==========
