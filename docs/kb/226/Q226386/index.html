SUMMARY
=======

When you are using the Outlook Web Access (OWA) component on a server that is
configured with Windows Load Balancing Service (WLBS), you may see a number of
files accumulated in the Webtemp directory on the server that are never
deleted.

The files may have to be deleted manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use OWA to access information on a computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server, files with an .mmp extension are created in your Exchsrvr\Webtemp
directory by default.

The .mmp file is a temporary file used by the OWA component to store certain
profile information during the active session. This file should be deleted after
the user logs off and the session is closed.

These files accumulate in the Webtemp directory if the OWA server is stopped
unexpectedly, or if users close their browsers without logging out of the Web
client first.

With Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2, these files are automatically cleaned up
from the Webtemp directory without manual intervention.

However, in the situation where the WLBS service fails on a server and the
requests for the Web server are directed to the backup WLBS server, the .mmp
files are not cleaned up because of the unexpected stop of the sessions on the
WLBS server. These temporary .mmp files are very small and do not take up much
space, 2 to 4 KB for each .mmp file. If you want to reclaim this hard drive
space after WLBS fails, then you may have to manually delete these .mmp files
when the WLBS and World Wide Web Publishing services are stopped.
For more information on .mmp files, see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
