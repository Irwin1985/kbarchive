SUMMARY
=======

There are many problems that may be related to the VGA card. If you don't know
the brand of your VGA card or if there is no information available for the card,
you can use the following procedures to troubleshoot possible video problems.

The following symptoms may indicate a problem with your VGA card:

- Windows Setup may hang while Disk 2 attempts to change to a graphics screen.

- Windows may not start in one or more modes.

- The screen may be garbled or show incorrect colors in Windows or in MS-DOS
  applications.

- MS-DOS applications may not run properly. This includes the machine locking
  and "System Integrity Violation" errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before Troubleshooting
----------------------

Make sure that Windows version 3.0 or 3.0a was installed using one of the VGA
drivers provided in the Windows package. If not, run Setup, and change to the
standard VGA driver.

NOTE: If the problem occurs only when using a driver supplied by the manufacturer
of the VGA card, contact that manufacturer.

Troubleshooting Procedures
--------------------------

1. Some cards may work better with the VGA driver for "QuadVGA, ATI VIP VGA, and
  82C441 VGAs." Try changing to this driver if the standard VGA driver isn't
  working. If the problem continues, reinstall the standard VGA driver and
  continue troubleshooting.

2. If the VGA card manufacturer has provided a driver that is Windows version
  3.0 compatible, try changing to this driver. If the problem continues,
  reinstall the standard VGA driver and continue troubleshooting.

3. Windows running in 386 enhanced mode may not properly detect the presence of
  the VGA card in memory, and it may try to use the same addresses that the
  cards are using. Most VGA cards make use of the address ranges A000-C7FF. A
  few cards may extend up to CA7F. For testing purposes, try using
  EMMExclude=A000-CBFF in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

4. Determine if the VGA card auto switches. If it does, disable this feature.

5. Check the system for situations that could have led to a corrupted
  installation of Windows (that is, MS-DOS version 4.01 commands, TSR
  [terminate-and-stay-resident] programs, and so on).

6. Some VGA cards may require an updated BIOS to run properly with Windows. If
  the above procedures fail to correct the video problems, refer to the card's
  manufacturer.

If the VGA video driver does not work, try the VGA 3.0 driver included with
Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. If this works correctly, contact
the video card manufacturer. The Windows 3.0 video driver does not have all the
functionality of the standard VGA driver, and should not be considered a final
solution.
