The following technique gives you the setup configuration with the
greatest flexibility of choice for ISAM support (as either a TSR
[terminate-and-stay resident] program or linkable .LIB) in compiled
.EXE programs.

If you chose "ISAM Routines in TSR" (instead of "ISAM Routines in
LIB") when you ran SETUP.EXE, then to make a standalone .EXE program
(that uses ISAM) that does not require the PROISAMD.EXE or PROISAM.EXE
TSR program, you must LINK with the PROISAMD.OBJ and PROISAMD.LIB
component libraries in the linker's object list. This technique
requires that you choose to retain component libraries when you run
SETUP.EXE.

This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 under MS-DOS. This also applies to
version 7.10 under MS OS/2.

With BASIC PDS 7.00, there are four SETUP.EXE options for installing
ISAM support for compiled .EXE programs:

1. ISAM Routines in TSR
2. ISAM Routines in LIB, Support Database Creation and Access
3. ISAM Routines in LIB, Support Database Access Only
4. No ISAM support

Only Option 1 creates PROISAM.EXE and PROISAMD.EXE TSR programs that
can be used with BASIC compiled .EXE programs. The TSR program created
in Option 1 can also be used in QBX.EXE. Option 1 is the default since
it consumes the least disk space.

Options 2 and 3 create PROISAM.EXE and PROISAMD.EXE TSR programs that
CANNOT be used in compiled .EXE programs and that can only be used by
QBX.EXE and the ISAM utilities (ISAMIO.EXE, ISAMCVT.EXE, ISAMREPR.EXE,
and ISAMPACK.EXE). If you choose Option 2 or 3 and you want ISAM
support in your .EXE program, you must link to the ISAM .LIB files
instead of using the TSR support for ISAM.

SETUP Option 4 does not copy any ISAM-related files onto your
computer.

You may want to have the option of creating .EXE programs with full
ISAM support provided either in the TSR program or linked from
libraries. This can be accomplished by choosing Option 1 ("ISAM
Routines in TSR") and LINKing with PROISAMD.OBJ and PROISAMD.LIB in
the object list, as follows:

   LINK /NOE ISAMPROG.OBJ+PROISAMD.OBJ+PROISAMD.LIB;

The following are some important notes about the above LINK command
line:

1. The NOExtended library search option (/NOE) is necessary to prevent
   "Symbol Defined More than Once (L2025)" errors.

2. Both object (PROISAMD.OBJ) and library (PROISAMD.LIB) files are
   required to LINK properly.

3. The PROISAMD.OBJ is normally deleted with component libraries by
   SETUP.EXE. You must choose to retain component libraries when you
   run SETUP.EXE to retain this necessary file.

4. PROISAMD.LIB must be specified in the object list instead of the
   library list on the LINK command line, as shown. (When LINKing a
   library in the object list, all object files contained in that
   library are LINKed into the EXE, as opposed to only the routines
   that are not otherwise resolved.)

5. ISAMPROG.BAS must be compiled with the BC /O (standalone) option.
   If you don't compile with BC /O, then the LINK error L2029
   "Unresolved external" error will occur for 'b$IsamRtmUsed' and
   'B$DOS3CHECK'.

Code Example
------------

The following code example would normally require the PROISAMD.EXE TSR
program (when the "ISAM Routines in TSR" option is chosen during
SETUP), but using the LINK line given below, the TSR program is not
necessary.

Compile and link as follows:

   BC ISAMPROG /O;
   LINK /NOE ISAMPROG.OBJ+PROISAMD.OBJ+PROISAMD.LIB;

' Name this source file as follows: ISAMPROG.BAS
TYPE test
  x AS INTEGER
END TYPE
OPEN "ISAMFILE" FOR ISAM test "table" AS #1
CLOSE #1
END
