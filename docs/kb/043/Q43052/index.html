SUMMARY
=======

Windows and Windows 95 do not support 16-bit Windows-based applications coded
with OS/2 Family API (FAPI) calls.

MORE INFORMATION
================

FAPI works in the following manner:

1. The code contains references to OS/2 FAPI calls (such as DosOpen, DosRead,
  and so on).

2. When the program is loaded into OS/2 protected mode, the system loader
  dynamically links the FAPI calls to the OS/2 system-services DLLs
  (Dynamic-Link Libraries).

3. When the program is loaded into real mode (MS-DOS or OS/2 compatibility box),
  what actually gets loaded is a small program called the "FAPI Loader and
  Linker." It is this program that loads the real code; it dynamically links
  the FAPI calls to a special library of support routines that translate FAPI
  calls into 80x86 code and MS-DOS interrupts (INT 21H Function xx).

This process is also described on Page 251 of Gordon Letwin's book titled "Inside
OS/2" (Microsoft Press, 1988).

FAPI works well for programs that need to run in MS-DOS and OS/2 protected mode.
The problem is that Windows uses the "New EXE Format" for programs, bypassing
the standard MS-DOS entry point. For example, if a Windows program is run
outside of Windows (in MS-DOS), the following message appears, and the program
terminates:

  This program requires Microsoft Windows

MS-DOS is not responsible for this message; the Windows program itself is
responsible. The way the Windows program works is very similar to OS/2: it uses
dual entry points into the .EXE file. In MS-DOS, a short program that prints the
above message runs; however, in Windows, a true Windows-based application runs
using the other entry point in the .EXE file.

Therefore, the problem is narrowed down to the following: if the FAPI Loader and
Linker program is run using the standard MS-DOS .EXE file entry point, and
Windows starts an application using a different entry point, the dynamic linking
of the FAPI routines will not occur.

Therefore, FAPI calls cannot be used in Windows-based applications.

To avoid this problem, do the following:

Instead of using low-level MS-DOS calls (INT 21H Function xx) in a Windows-based
application and OS/2 API calls (DosRead, DosOpen, and so on) in a Presentation
Manager (PM) application, use the C run-time I/O routines for all of these
applications.

This will work because the Microsoft C Compiler and the run-time libraries supply
versions of the libraries that work in both OS/2 and MS-DOS. By moving C code to
PM and to Windows, it will not be necessary to rewrite it, and the appropriate
conversion routines will be supplied at link time.

Be sure not to use high-level (stream) I/O routines in C with Windows; just use
the low-level (handles) versions. This topic is discussed in Charles Petzold's
book titled "Programming Windows" (Microsoft Press, 1988), and in other articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
