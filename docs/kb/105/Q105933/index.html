The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The corrections to the manuals shipped with Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for
MS-DOS are described below. This is an extract of the ADDENDA.TXT file located
in the \F32\README directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Part 1: Corrections to Getting Started
--------------------------------------

There are no corrections to Getting Started.

Part 2: Corrections to Language Guide
-------------------------------------

Page 52
Add the following note to the second bullet describing an iolist: "If I/O is to
or from a formatted device, an iolist may not contain structure variables, but
it may contain structure elements. If I/O is to a binary or unformatted device,
it can contain either a structure element or a structure variable."

Page 85
Add the following comment to the discussion of backslash editing: "The dollar
sign ($) can be used as an alias for the backslash edit descriptor."

Page 129, 131
Delete the table entries for GETCONFIGQQ.

Page 199
Input to intrinsic function ABS can also be any real or integer type.

Page 203
The purpose of intrinsic function AMAX0 should read: "Returns the maximum of a
list of integer values."

Page 203
The purpose of intrinsic function AMAX1 should read: "Returns the maximum of a
list of integer values and performs type conversion."

Page 204
The purpose of intrinsic function AMIN1 should read: "Returns the minimum of a
list of integer values and performs type conversion."

Page 214
The order of the parameters for BEEPQQ is reversed; frequency is the first
parameter. The frequency parameter in should be Hz, not KHz. The duration should
be in milliseconds.

Page 256
One of the examples for the DINT intrinsic function is documented incorrectly.
The examples show:

  DINT(2.6D0)       2.0000 ....
  DINT(2.6D0)      -2.0000 ....

The second line should read: (note the minus sign in the argument)

  DINT(-2.6D0)     -2.0000 ....

Page 314
Change error parameters ENOENT and EINVAL to ERR$NOENT and ERR$INVAL.

Page 319
The first five fontinfo structure variables in graphic function GETFONTINFO
(type, ascent, pixwidth, pixheight and avgwidth) are shown as Integer*2; they
should be Integer*4.

Pages 322-323
The naming convention for run-time error parameters was documented incorrectly.
The following table shows the actual names of these parameters in the FLIB.FD
include file:

  Change        to
  ========      =========
  E2BIG         ERR$2BIG
  EACCES        ERR$ACCES
  EBADF         ERR$BADF
  EINVAL        ERR$INVAL
  EIVAL         ERR$IVAL
  EMFILE        ERR$MFILE
  ENOENT        ERR$NOENT
  ENOEXEC       ERR$NOEXEC
  ENOMEM        ERR$NOMEM
  ERANGE        ERR$RANGE

Page 338
The Remarks section states that error constants are in FGRAPH.FI. Actually they
are in FGRAPH.FD.

Several error constants were omitted from the table:

  $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED     (  4)

  The VESA TSR or BIOS sets a flag that may indicate that text output is not
  supported. (Note: this flag is used inconsistently by different hardware
  vendors and may not be significant.)

  $GRNOBITMAPFILE         (-10)
  $GRFILEREADERROR        (-11)
  $GRIMPROPERBITMAPFORMAT (-12)
  $GRBITMAPTOOLARGE       (-13)
  $GRBITMAPDISPLAYERROR   (-14)
  $GRIMAGEREADERROR       (-15)
  $GRFILEOPENERROR        (-16)
  $GRFILEWRITEERROR       (-17)

The declaration of $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED has been omitted from FGRAPH.FD,
therefore, you will get the following error when you use this constant and
compile with /4Yd:

  warning F4313: $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED: not previously declared

To work around this problem, open FGRAPH.FD, go to line 54, and add:

  + $GRTEXTNOTSUPPORTED

Page 376-377
Run-time subroutines SCWRQQ and SSWRQQ were incorrectly used as functions in the
sample program TCOPO.FOR.

Page 381-382
Graphic Functions LOADIMAGE and LOADIMAGE_W are INTEGER*2 functions. The
coordinate parameters wxcoord and wycoord are DOUBLE PRECISION, not REAL*4.

Page 386
The error parameters for MAKEDIRQQ were documented incorrectly.

  Change      to
  ------      ---------
  EACCES      ERR$ACCES
  ENOENT      ERR$NOENT

Page 439
The error parameters for RENAMEFILEQQ were documented incorrectly.

  Change      to
  ------      ---------
  EACCES      ERR$ACCES
  ENOENT      ERR$NOENT
  EXDEV       ERR$XDEV

Page 444-445
The coordinate parameters (ulwxcoord, ulwycoord, lrwxcoord and lrwycoord) are
Double Precision, not Real*4.

Page 457-458
Run-time subroutines GETCONTROLFPQQ and GETSTATUSFPQQ were incorrectly used as
functions in the sample program TCOP.FOR. The source for TCOP.FOR in the samples
directory and in Help is correct.

Page 462
The error parameters for SETFILETIMEQQ were documented incorrectly.

  Change      to
  ------      ---------
  EACCESS     ERR$ACCES
  EINVAL      ERR$INVAL
  EMFILE      ERR$MFILE
  ENOENT      ERR$NOENT

Page 478
The remarks for Graphics subroutine SETTEXTWINDOW should read:

"Use SETTEXTWINDOW to specify a window in row and column coordinates where text
output written to the screen using the OUTTEXT() subroutine is displayed. (You
must set up the location with SETTEXTPOSITION.) The arguments (r1, c1) specify
the upper-left corner of the text window, and the arguments (r2, c2) specify the
lower-right corner of the text window.

Text is output from the top of the text window down. When the text window is
full, successive lines overwrite the last line."

Page 496
The duration parameter of run-time subroutine SLEEPQQ should be in milliseconds,
not microseconds.

Page 507
The error parameters for SYSTEMQQ were documented incorrectly.

  Change      to
  ------      ---------
  E2BIG       ERR$2BIG
  ENOINT      ERR$NOINT
  ENOEXEC     ERR$NOEXEC
  ENOMEM      ERR$NOMEM

Page 522
Appendix A erroneously states that the following VAX extensions are supported by
FORTRAN PowerStation:

- Inline variable length formatting (e.g.: FORMAT('I&lt;var&gt;'), where var =
  5)

- Call intrinsics (%val, %descr, %ref, %loc)

Part 3: Corrections to User's Guide
-----------------------------------

Page 15, 22
You can also use CTRL+K to find matching braces.

Pages 67-68
The Create Assembly Listing checkbox is documented incorrectly. The compiler
option associated with this option is /FAs, not /Fl. This option produces an
assembly listing with code bytes, not an assembly listing with source.

Page 109
Add the following to the discussion of syntax coloring. "FORTRAN Visual Workbench
displays metacommands in the same color as comments if syntax coloring is
activated."

Pages 144-145
A new set of options has been added for producing assembly listings. The syntax
is /FA[sc]. Use /FAs to add FORTRAN source lines to the assembly listing, and
/FAc to add code bytes to the assembly listing. /FAsc will produce an assembly
listing with both FORTRAN source lines and code bytes.

Page 170
Add this to the end of Section 11.2.3 Using Command Files:

The following example demonstrates the use of command files (also known as
response files) to provide input to LINK32. Example:

  LINK32 -LIB @MYRESP.RSP

A typical response file might contain:

  -OUT:MYLIB.LIB
  OBJECT1.OBJ
  OBJECT2.OBJ
  (and so forth)

Page 258
Page 294
Page 297
The default floating-point exception behavior is slightly different from that
described in the text. By default, run-time errors occur for the INVALID,
ZERODIVIDE, and OVERFLOW exceptions. By default, run-time errors occur for the
math exceptions except for when you use the compiler option /Ox. See the
README.TXT file for a summary of the complete floating-point exception behavior
and details on how to customize that behavior to be strictly the IEEE behavior
as described in the text.

Page 284
Replace the text:

"Some older 80386 systems have 287 coprocessors instead of 387s; the 287 math
coprocessor does not perform floating-point operations on these systems."

with the text:

"Some older 80386 systems have 287 coprocessors instead of 387s; some
floating-point operations will not work correctly in these cases. To fix this,
you must force use of the floating-point emulator by setting the TNT environment
variable as follows. At the MS-DOS (or Windows MS-DOS session) command line,
enter "SET TNT=-FPEM" before running your compiled program. To cancel the forced
emulation you can enter "SET TNT=-NOFPEM"."
