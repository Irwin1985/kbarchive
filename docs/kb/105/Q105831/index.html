-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


This article provides a functional overview of the features included in MS-DOS
6.22 and describes why you should consider upgrading.

- If you currently have MS-DOS 6.0 installed, refer to the "Why Step Up to
  MS-DOS 6.22?" section of this article. This section describes only those
  features and enhancements added since MS-DOS 6.0.

- If you currently have a version of MS-DOS earlier than 6.0, or if you are
  using another operating system, refer to "Why Upgrade to MS-DOS 6.22?" later
  in this article. This section describes all features and enhancements added
  since MS-DOS 5.0.

WHY STEP UP TO MS-DOS 6.22?
---------------------------

MS-DOS 6.22 improves on the safety and ease of use provided by MS-DOS 6.0. This
section describes features new to MS-DOS 6.22 and is designed for those already
running MS-DOS 6.

Safety Features and Enhancements:

- MS-DOS 6.22 includes ScanDisk, a new utility that detects, diagnoses, and
  repairs disk errors on uncompressed drives and DriveSpace-compressed drives.
  ScanDisk can repair file system errors (such as cross-linked files and lost
  clusters) and physical disk errors. ScanDisk keeps a log of its repairs and
  allows you to undo any changes it makes. DriveSpace runs ScanDisk to check
  the reliability of your disk before it begins compression. You can also run
  ScanDisk by typing "scandisk" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS
  command prompt.

- DriveSpace includes DoubleGuard safety checking, which protects your data by
  verifying data integrity before writing to disk. If DoubleGuard detects that
  the memory DriveSpace is using has been written to by another program, it
  notifies you and shuts down your computer immediately to minimize damage to
  your data.

- The MS-DOS extended-memory manager, HIMEM, automatically tests your system's
  memory when you start your computer. This test can identify memory chips that
  are no longer reliable.

- Setup installs SMARTDrive as a read-only cache by default. Even if
  write-caching is enabled, MS-DOS does not display the MS-DOS command prompt
  until SMARTDrive has written its cache to your disk.

- The MOVE, COPY, and XCOPY commands ask you for confirmation before copying a
  file over another file that has the same name. (To maintain compatibility
  with the large base of MS-DOS batch files, these commands do not prompt for
  confirmation if they are issued from a batch file.)

Ease-of-Use Features and Other Enhancements:

- SMARTDrive caches CD-ROM drives.

- DriveSpace automatically mounts compressed floppy disks and other compressed
  removable media, even when Microsoft Windows is running.

- MS-DOS 6.22 allows you to easily uncompress a DriveSpace drive or completely
  uninstall DriveSpace from memory.

- Interactive Start (F8) allows you to bypass or carry out individual commands
  in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. (In MS-DOS 6.0, this capability was limited to
  your CONFIG.SYS file.) This feature makes it easier to troubleshoot your
  system configuration.

- The DISKCOPY command uses your hard disk as an interim storage area, which
  allows you to copy from one floppy disk to another without repeatedly
  swapping disks.

- Microsoft Defragmenter makes better use of your computer's extended memory,
  so it can defragment larger disks and disks containing more files and
  directories.

- The output of the DIR, MEM, CHKDSK, and FORMAT commands is easier to read
  because it includes thousands separators when displaying numbers greater than
  999. For example, "1000000 bytes free" displays as "1,000,000 bytes free."

WHY SHOULD I UPGRADE TO MS-DOS 6.22?
------------------------------------

This section describes features added to MS-DOS since version 5.0. If you already
have MS-DOS 6.0, refer to "Why Should I Step Up to MS-DOS 6.22?" above.

The MS-DOS 6.22 Upgrade includes the following new or enhanced features:

- Microsoft DriveSpace, with DoubleGuard

- Microsoft MemMaker

- Microsoft Backup

- Microsoft Anti-Virus

- Microsoft Undelete

- ScanDisk

- MultiConfig

- Interactive Start

- Microsoft Defragmenter

- MS-DOS Help

- Enhanced SMARTDrive

- Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD)

- Interlnk

- Enhanced Commands

The following paragraphs briefly describe these enhancements and their benefits.

Microsoft DriveSpace with DoubleGuard:

Microsoft DriveSpace increases your available disk space by integrating
compression into the operating system. You can use DriveSpace to increase
available space on both hard disks and floppy disks. DriveSpace includes
DoubleGuard safety checking, which protects your data by verifying data
integrity before writing to the disk.

Microsoft MemMaker:

Microsoft MemMaker is a memory-optimization program that makes it easy to free
conventional memory by moving device drivers and memory- resident programs from
conventional memory into the upper memory area (UMA). If your computer has an
80386 or higher processor, you can use MemMaker to increase available
conventional memory so that programs run faster and more efficiently.

Microsoft Backup:

Microsoft Backup is a utility for backing up your hard disk drive. MS-DOS 6.22
includes both Backup for MS-DOS, a program you can start from the MS-DOS command
prompt, and Backup for Windows, a program you can use with Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Anti-Virus:

Microsoft Anti-Virus can identify and remove more than 1000 different computer
viruses. MS-DOS 6.22 includes both Anti-Virus for MS-DOS, a program you can
start from the MS-DOS command prompt, and Anti-Virus for Windows, a program you
can use with Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Undelete:

Microsoft Undelete enables you to choose one of three levels of protection in
case you accidentally delete a file. MS-DOS 6.22 includes Undelete for MS-DOS, a
program you can run from the MS-DOS command prompt, and Undelete for Windows, a
program you can use with Microsoft Windows. For more information about Undelete,
see the chapter "Managing Your System" in the Microsoft MS-DOS "User's Guide"
for version 6.0.

ScanDisk:

ScanDisk detects, diagnoses, and repairs disk errors on uncompressed drives and
DriveSpace-compressed drives. ScanDisk can repair file system errors (such as
cross-linked files and lost clusters) and physical disk errors. ScanDisk keeps a
log of its repairs and allows you to undo any of the changes it makes.
DriveSpace runs ScanDisk to check the reliability of your disk before it begins
compression. You can also run ScanDisk yourself by typing "scandisk" (without
the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

MultiConfig:

MultiConfig allows you to define more than one configuration in your CONFIG.SYS
file. If your CONFIG.SYS file defines multiple configurations, MS-DOS displays a
menu that enables you to choose the configuration you want to use each time you
start your computer.

Interactive Start:

Interactive Start gives you the ability to bypass startup commands when you turn
on your computer. This allows you to choose which CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
commands MS-DOS should carry out. By controlling the commands your computer uses
to start up, you can locate problems more easily.

Microsoft Defragmenter:

Microsoft Defragmenter reorganizes files on your hard disk to minimize the time
it takes your computer to access them.

MS-DOS Help:

MS-DOS Help is a complete online reference to MS-DOS commands. The reference
includes information about how to type commands and their parameters and
switches, notes about commands, and examples of how to use commands.

Enhanced SMARTDrive:

The SMARTDrive program included with MS-DOS 6.22 speeds up your computer by using
a disk cache, which stores information being read from your hard disk or CD-ROM
drive. SMARTDrive can also be set to cache information being written to your
hard disk.

Microsoft Diagnostics:

Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) gathers and displays technical information about your
computer.

Interlnk:

Interlnk enables you to easily transfer files between computers. With Interlnk
and a cable, you can access information on another computer without using floppy
disks to copy data from one computer to another.

Enhanced Commands:

The following commands have been added or enhanced for MS-DOS 6.22:

- The MOVE command moves one or more files from one directory or drive to
  another. You can also use the MOVE command to rename directories.

- The CHOICE command allows you to prompt a user for input when running a batch
  program. The CHOICE command allows you to display a specified prompt, pause
  for user input, and return an error-level parameter to the batch program.

- The DELTREE command deletes a directory and all of its files and
  subdirectories.

- The DISKCOPY command uses your hard disk as an interim storage area, allowing
  you to copy from one floppy disk to another without repeatedly disk swapping
  disks.

- The output of the DIR, MEM, CHKDSK, and FORMAT commands is easier to read,
  because it includes thousands separators when displaying numbers greater than
  999. For example, "1000000 bytes free" displays as "1,000,000 bytes free."
