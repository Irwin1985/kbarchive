Notes for MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up Users
----------------------------------

The MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up includes all the files you need to update your system from
MS-DOS 6 to MS-DOS 6.2.

  IMPORTANT: To use the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up, you must be running the released
  version of MS-DOS 6. If you are running an older version of MS-DOS, a beta
  version of MS-DOS 6, or any version of MS-DOS that was modified by a hardware
  vendor, you cannot use the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up. To install MS-DOS 6.2 on such
  a system, obtain the full MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade product.

This file contains information specific to the Step-Up installation process. If
you don't find the information you need in this file, see the README.TXT file,
which is located in the directory that contains your MS-DOS files or on Setup
Disk 1 of your MS-DOS 6.0 disks.

This file contains the following topics:

1. What MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up includes

2. Installing MS-DOS 6.2

  2.1 Running Setup
  2.2 Running Setup if your MS-DOS 6 files are not located on drive C
  2.3 If Setup cannot update a file
  2.4 If Setup cannot find the correct IO.SYS file

3. Updating Microsoft Backup, Undelete and Antivirus

  3.1 If you have not yet installed MS-DOS 6.2
  3.2 If you have already installed MS-DOS 6.2

4. Reading the README.TXT file on Setup Disk 1

1. What MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up Includes
-----------------------------------

The MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up includes all changes that were made to the MS-DOS files
since MS-DOS 6. Most of the files on the Step-Up disk(s) simply specify changes
for MS-DOS 6.2 and are not complete programs. When you run Setup, it modifies
the MS-DOS files on your hard disk to incorporate the changes for MS-DOS 6.2. To
do this, Setup must be able to find and update each of your MS-DOS 6 files.

2. Installing MS-DOS 6.2
------------------------

This section explains how to update your system to MS-DOS 6.2.

  Note: If you did not install the MS-DOS 6 optional programs
  (Backup, AntiVirus and Undelete), then MS-DOS 6.2 Setup
  cannot update those programs to version 6.2. If you want the
  MS-DOS 6.2 versions of these programs, carry out the procedure
  in Section 3 of this file before installing MS-DOS 6.2.

2.1  Running Setup:

To update your system to MS-DOS 6.2, your computer must already be running MS-DOS
6. For Setup to work properly, your MS-DOS 6 files must be located on drive C;
if your MS-DOS 6 files are on a drive other than drive C, follow the procedure
in section 2.2.

To install MS-DOS 6.2, follow these steps:

1. If Windows is running, quit Windows.

2. At the command prompt, type "VER" (without the quotation marks) to ensure
  that you are running the release version of MS-DOS 6.0.

3. Insert MS-DOS 6.2 Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B.

4. Type "A:SETUP" (without the quotation marks) or "B:SETUP" (without the
  quotation marks).

2.2  Running Setup if your MS-DOS 6 files are not located on drive C:

The MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up is designed to update MS-DOS 6 files that are located on
drive C. If your MS-DOS 6 files are located on a drive other than C, follow
these steps:

1. Create a new directory on drive C (for example, C:\DOS).

2. Copy your MS-DOS 6 files to that directory. For example, if your MS-DOS 6
  files are located in the D:\DOS directory and you want to copy them to the
  C:\DOS directory, you would type:

  " COPY D:\DOS\*.* C:\DOS" (without the quotation marks)

3. Insert MS-DOS 6.2 Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B, and then type A:SETUP
  or B:SETUP. When Setup displays the directory that contains your MS-DOS 6
  files, type the pathname of the directory you just created on drive C (for
  example, C:\DOS).

4. When Setup is complete, MS-DOS 6.2 will be installed on drive C. Setup
  updates the pathnames in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files so that they
  refer to the directory on drive C that contains your MS-DOS 6.2 files.

  If you want to move MS-DOS 6.2 back to the other drive, copy all the MS-DOS
  6.2 files to a directory on the other drive. You will also need to correct
  the pathnames in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to refer to the
  correct drive and directory.

2.3  If Setup cannot update a file:

If Setup cannot update one of your MS-DOS files, it displays a message with the
title "Cannot Update File." If you continued Setup, your MS-DOS 6.2 installation
is incomplete because the specified file was not updated to version 6.2. If the
file is one you know you don't need, don't worry about it. However, if you are
not sure, update the file using the following procedure.

1. Insert MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B, and then use MS-DOS
  Editor (EDIT) to view the contents of the PACKING.LST file. This file tells
  you where each file is located on your MS-DOS 6 disks. Determine which MS-DOS
  6 disk contains the file you need.

2. Insert the appropriate MS-DOS 6 disk in drive A or drive B, and then use the
  EXPAND command to expand the file. For example, to expand the file
  DBLSPACE.HL_ from the disk in drive A to the directory C:\DOS, you would type
  the following command:

  " EXPAND A:\DBLSPACE.HL_ C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.HLP" (without the quotation marks)

  For more information, see the comments at the beginning of the PACKING.LST
  file, or see the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.

3. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup again. This time, Setup should be able to update the
  file.

If you follow this procedure and Setup still cannot update the file, there may be
a problem with your MS-DOS 6.2 disks. You may be able to correct the problem by
running SCANDISK or CHKDSK /F on the MS-DOS 6.2 disk that was in the drive when
the error occurred.

2.4  If Setup cannot find the correct IO.SYS file:

If Setup cannot find the correct IO.SYS file, one of the following may be the
cause of the problem:

- You are not running a released version of MS-DOS 6 or 6.2.

  To use the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up, you must be running the released version of
  MS-DOS 6 or 6.2. The Step-Up will not work on other versions of MS-DOS, on
  other manufacturers' operating systems, or on beta versions of MS-DOS.

- Your IO.SYS file has been damaged or modified.

  Setup cannot update an IO.SYS file that has been corrupted (for example, by a
  virus or a hard disk error) or an IO.SYS file that has been modified by
  another program (such as an MS-DOS extender). If you suspect this is the
  problem, use the SYS command to copy the system files from Setup Disk 1 of
  your MS-DOS 6 disks.

- You are running a version of MS-DOS 6 in a language that is different from
  the version of MS-DOS 6.2 you are trying to install. If this is the problem,
  obtain the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up for the same language as your current version
  of MS-DOS 6.

  Note: The IO.SYS file is a file with the hidden, read-only and system
  attributes. It is normally located in the root directory of your startup
  drive.

3. Updating Microsoft Backup, Undelete and Antivirus
----------------------------------------------------

MS-DOS 6.2 Setup automatically updates the Backup, Undelete and Antivirus
programs only if the MS-DOS 6 versions of these programs are already on your
computer when you run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup. If you want the MS-DOS 6.2 versions of
these programs, but the MS-DOS 6 versions are not currently installed on your
system, carry the procedure in section 3.1 or 3.2 (depending on whether you have
installed MS-DOS 6.2 yet).

3.1 If you have not yet installed MS-DOS 6.2:

The easiest way to install the MS-DOS 6.2 versions of Backup, Undelete and
Antivirus is to install the MS-DOS 6 versions of those programs before you run
MS-DOS 6.2 Setup. Follow these steps:

1. Insert MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B.

2. Type "A:SETUP /E" (without the quotation marks) or "B:SETUP /E" (without the
  quotation marks) at the command prompt, and then follow the instructions on
  your screen.

3. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup as described in Section 2 of this file.

3.2  If you have already installed MS-DOS 6.2:

If Backup, Undelete, or Antivirus were not on your system when you installed
MS-DOS 6.2, but you later decided that you want the MS-DOS 6.2 versions of those
programs, carry out one of the following procedures (depending on whether your
MS-DOS 6 disks fit in drive A).

Procedure 1: Updating the optional programs if your MS-DOS 6 disks fit in drive
A

If your MS-DOS 6 disks fit in drive A, follow these steps:

1. Insert MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 in drive A, and restart your computer. (If your
  MS-DOS 6 disks do not fit in drive A, carry out procedure 2 instead.)

2. The Welcome screen for MS-DOS 6 Setup appears. Press the F3 key twice to
  exit.

3. Use the PATH command to ensure that your current search path includes the
  directory that contains your MS-DOS 6.2 files. For example, if your MS-DOS
  6.2 files are in C:\DOS, you would type

  " PATH C:\DOS" (without the quotation marks)

  Note: Be sure to specify the drive letter in uppercase.

4. Change to the drive that contains MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1, and then run MS-DOS
  6 Setup by typing the following:

  " SETUP /E" (without the quotation marks)

  Select the optional programs you want. When MS-DOS Setup is complete, remove
  MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 and restart your computer.

5. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup as described in Section 2 of this file.

Procedure 2: Updating the optional programs if your MS-DOS 6 disks don't fit in
drive A

If your MS-DOS 6 disks don't fit in drive A, follow these steps:

1. Create an MS-DOS 6 startup floppy disk by inserting your MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk
  1 in drive B and typing the following:

  " B:SETUP /F" (without the quotation marks)

2. When Setup displays the settings it will use, the "Install on Drive:" setting
  will specify drive B. Change this setting to drive A.

  Setup then creates a startup floppy disk. To complete Setup, follow the
  instructions on your screen.

3. Restart your computer from the MS-DOS 6 startup floppy disk you just created
  (leave the disk in drive A, and press CTRL+ALT+DEL).

4. Use the PATH command to ensure that your current search path includes the
  directory that contains your MS-DOS 6.2 files. For example, if your MS-DOS
  6.2 files are in C:\DOS, you would type

  " PATH C:\DOS" (without the quotation marks)

  Note: Be sure to specify the drive letter in uppercase.

5. Change to the drive that contains MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1, and then type the
  following to install the optional MS-DOS 6 programs:

  " SETUP /E" (without the quotation marks)

  Select the optional programs you want. When MS-DOS Setup is complete, remove
  MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 and restart your computer.

6. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup as described in Section 2 of this file.

4. Reading the README.TXT file on Setup Disk 1
----------------------------------------------

After you install MS-DOS 6.2, a copy of the README.TXT file will be located in
the directory that contains your MS-DOS 6.2 files. To read this file, change to
that directory, and then type the following at the command prompt:

  " EDIT README.TXT" (without the quotation marks)

If you need to, you can read the copy of README.TXT located on Setup Disk 1. To
do this:

1. Insert Setup Disk 1 in a floppy disk drive, and then make that drive your
  current drive. For example, if the disk is in drive A, type A: at the command
  prompt.

2. At the command prompt, type the following command:

  " EXPAND README.TX_ C:\README.TXT" (without the quotation marks)

You should then be able to use the EDIT command to view the C:\README.TXT file.
