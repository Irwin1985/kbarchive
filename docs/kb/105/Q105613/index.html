The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the MS-DOS 6.2 README.TXT file.

NOTE: The MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade and MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up (both downloadable and disk
versions) include the same README.TXT file.

NOTES ON MS-DOS 6.2
-------------------

1.10 Setup displays the "Your computer uses password protection"
    screen.
----------------------------------------------------------------
See section 1.12.

1.11 Setup displays the "Your computer is using an incompatible
    delete-protection program" screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------
See section 1.12.

1.12 Setup detects that your computer uses DR DOS.
--------------------------------------------------
If you have DR DOS installed on your computer, take the following
precautions before restarting Setup:

o If your system has any security features, including password
 protection, disable them. For more information, see "Setup displays
 the 'Your computer uses password protection' screen" in the chapter
 "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S
 GUIDE.

 If you have protected any files or directories with a password,
 remove the password protection, particularly if you have protected
 your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files, or your DR DOS directory.

o If you have DELWATCH installed on your computer, carry out
 the procedure "Setup displays the 'Your computer is using an
 incompatible delete-protection program' screen" in the chapter
 "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS
 6 USER'S GUIDE.

o If your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files use any conditional commands--
 such as the "?" or GOTO commands--remove them and adjust the order of
 commands in your startup files accordingly.

o If your CONFIG.SYS file uses the CHAIN command, remove it and
 adjust the order of commands in the file accordingly.

o If your computer uses disk compression, but drive C is not compressed,
 run Setup as described in the chapter "Getting Started" in the
 MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE. When Setup displays the "Your
 CONFIG.SYS file contains commands that are not valid MS-DOS commands"
 message, choose the "Modify original files" option.

 If drive C is compressed, carry out the following procedure:

 1. Determine which drive is your original uncompressed drive. For more
    information, see your DR DOS documentation.

 2. Make backup copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on your
    compressed drive, and the DCONFIG.SYS file on your uncompressed
    drive.

 3. Combine the two configuration files. For example, if drive D is your
    uncompressed drive, type the following at the command prompt:

    COPY D:\DCONFIG.SYS+C:\CONFIG.SYS D:\CONFIG.SYS

 4. Copy the combined CONFIG.SYS file to drive C. For example, if drive
    D is your uncompressed drive, type the following at the command
    prompt:

    COPY D:\CONFIG.SYS C:\CONFIG.SYS

 5. Copy your AUTOEXEC.BAT to your uncompressed drive. For example, if
    drive D is your uncompressed drive, type the following at the
    command prompt:

    COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT D:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

 6. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup.

 7. When Setup displays the "Your CONFIG.SYS file contains commands
    that are not valid MS-DOS commands" message, choose the "Modify
    original files" option.

    When Setup displays the "Because you are currently using the
    DR DOS operating system" message, choose Continue.

 8. After Setup is complete, MS-DOS displays an "Unrecognized command"
    message on your screen for each command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
    CONFIG.SYS files that is not a valid MS-DOS command. Remove these
    commands from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

 9. Add the DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS command to the beginning of your
    CONFIG.SYS file, and the restart your computer.

1.13 Installing MS-DOS on a Drive Other Than C
----------------------------------------------
As described in the following procedure, you can install MS-DOS
on a drive other than C by using the /M switch to copy the system
files to your startup drive and then using the /Q switch to copy your
MS-DOS files to a different drive.

NOTE  This procedure is designed for advanced users. If your computer
uses disk-compression software, modify the procedure as appropriate.

NOTE  If your computer uses disk-partitioning software, such as Disk
Manager, SpeedStor, Priam, or Everex, do not carry out the procedure
until you have carried out steps 1 through 3 of "You need to install MS-
DOS manually" in the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the
MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE. If your software uses a driver to
enable the drive on which you want to install MS-DOS, make sure you
create a startup disk with the driver in a CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. After you have carried out these steps, skip to step 3 of the
following procedure.

1. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and
  typing A:SETUP /M or B:SETUP /M at the command prompt.

  NOTE  Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files were saved as CONFIG.NEW
  and AUTOEXEC.NEW.

2. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and typing
  A:SETUP /Q or B:SETUP /Q at the command prompt. Follow the
  instructions on your screen.

3. When Setup displays the system settings screen, choose the MS-DOS
  Path option. Type the drive and directory where you want
  to install MS-DOS, and press ENTER. Continue Setup.

4. After Setup is complete, open your CONFIG.NEW and AUTOEXEC.NEW files
  and ensure that their commands specify the correct path. Save the
  files as CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. Then restart your computer.

1.14 Bypassing the Uninstall Disk and Using Default Setup Options
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To keep Setup from creating an Uninstall Disk, use the /G switch
with the Setup command.

To bypass the Uninstall disk and use default Setup options
instead of choosing them yourself, use both the /H and /G switches
with the Setup command.

WARNING  The primary purpose of the Uninstall disk is to safeguard
your files during and after Setup. If Setup doesn't create
an Uninstall disk, you will not be able to restore your previous
version of DOS. If Setup should render your hard disk inaccessible,
you will not be able to use the Uninstall disk to make it accessible
again.

NOTE  If you have a version of MS-DOS earlier than 5.0, and you use
the /G switch or the /H and /G switches together, Setup will not
prompt you if you need to update your network files.

1.15 Installing MS-DOS 6.2 on a System with a CorelSCSI UNI_ASP.SYS
    Driver
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If your system uses the CorelSCSI UNI_ASP.SYS device driver for optical
drives, and Setup stops running when you try to install MS-DOS 6,
delete the DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS that loads the Corel
UNI_ASP.SYS driver. Then run Setup again. After Setup is complete,
reinstall the Corel UNI_ASP.SYS driver as you originally installed it.
If you continue to have problems, contact Corel Customer Service.

1.16  Installing MS-DOS 6.2 if you have DrivePro or EZ-Drive
------------------------------------------------------------
If your hard disk was set up using Micro House DrivePro(TM) or
EZ-Drive(TM), you must carry out one of the following procedures
before you can install MS-DOS 6.2.

o If your DrivePro or EZ-Drive floppy disks include the DOS6INST.EXE
  file, run the DOS6INST program and follow the instructions on the
  screen. (This program is also available on the Micro House BBS at
  (303) 443-9957.)

o If you don't have the DOS6INST program, run the MHDRIVE program (if
  you have DrivePro) or the EZ-RESET program (if you have EZ-Drive).
  Press ENTER to accept the default answers until the program prompts
  you to insert MS-DOS Setup Disk 1. Insert the disk and then press
  ENTER. At the second Setup screen, choose "Continue Setup and
  replace your current version of DOS." (Note that this procedure
  will replace your current CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files with
  basic versions of these files.)

For additional information, or if you encounter problems, contact
Micro House Technical Support.

1.17  Additional Keyboard and Codepage Support
----------------------------------------------
MS-DOS 6.2 includes the KEYBRD2.SYS and EGA2.CPI files, which
offer additional keyboards and codepages. You use these files just
as you would the KEYBOARD.SYS and EGA.CPI files. MS-DOS also
includes new country settings in COUNTRY.SYS.

The KEYBRD2.SYS file is essentially similar to KEYBOARD.SYS.
The differences between KEYBOARD.SYS and KEYBRD2.SYS are:

o  KEYBRD2.SYS contains support for the following keyboards, which
   are not supported by KEYBOARD.SYS:

   Country/Language             Keyboard layout   Keyboard ID
   ----------------             ---------------   -----------
   Canada (standard CAN/CSA-Z keyboard)   cf      243.200-92
   Brazil (secondary standard keyboard)   br      274, 275
   Greece                                 gk      319
   Iceland                                is      161
   Romania                                ro      333
   Turkish                                tr      440, 179

o  The KEYBRD2.SYS file does not include support for the following
   keyboards supported by KEYBOARD.SYS:

      Switzerland (German)
      Switzerland (French)
      Japan

o  The KEYBRD2.SYS file provides access to a few keyboards by keyboard
   layout (two-letter code) only. KEYBOARD.SYS provides access to these
   keyboards by either keyboard layout or keyboard ID. The affected
   keyboards are:

      Poland
      Czechoslovakia (Czech)
      Czechoslovakia (Slovak)
      Yugoslavia
      Hungary

o  KEYBRD2.SYS contains changes to the German keyboard that are
   not in KEYBOARD.SYS. In the German keyboard, the SHIFT lock
   behavior of the top row of the keyboard now remains unaffected,
   and is now functionally the same as the US keyboard (that is,
   "typewriter mode" has been removed).

The EGA2.CPI file is similar to the EGA.CPI file, except that the two
files contain different code pages. EGA2.CPI contains the following:

   850 - Multilingual (in both EGA2.CPI and EGA.CPI)
   852 - Eastern European (in both EGA2.CPI and EGA.CPI)
   857 - Turkish
   861 - Icelandic
   869, 737 - Greek

MS-DOS 6.2 includes new country settings in COUNTRY.SYS that use the
new keyboards and code pages. COUNTRY.SYS contains the following
countries with their supported code pages:

   Country or language    Country       Character sets
                          code
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Greece                 030           869, 737
   Iceland                354           861, 850
   Romania                040           852, 850
   Turkish                090           857, 850

You use the KEYBRD2.SYS and EGA2.CPI files just as you would
KEYBOARD.SYS and EGA.CPI. These files can be used in any combination.

For example, to use the new Icelandic settings, carry out the following
steps:

1. Add the following commands to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  REM ICELAND SETTINGS
  MODE CON CP PREPARE=((861) C:\DOS\EGA2.CPI)
  MODE CON CP SELECT=861
  KEYB IS,,C:\DOS\KEYBRD2.SYS

2. If you also need support for codepage 850 (Multilingual), add
  the following commands to your CONFIG.SYS file:

  REM ICELAND SETTINGS
  COUNTRY=354,861,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS
  DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(,,2)

  Add the following commands to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  REM ICELAND SETTINGS
  NLSFUNC
  MODE CON CP PREPARE=((861,850) C:\DOS\EGA2.CPI)
  MODE CON CP SELECT=861
  KEYB IS,,C:\DOS\KEYBRD2.SYS

3. Restart your computer.

1.18  Switching Between Modes on Dual-Mode Keyboards
----------------------------------------------------
MS-DOS 6.2 includes dual-mode keyboard support for Greek and French
Canadian keyboards. These keyboards allow you to easily switch between
two different keyboard modes. When your computer starts with the
Greek or French Canadian keyboard, the primary mode is active.
To switch modes, press the appropriate key combination (listed below).

The key combinations for the Greek keyboard are as follows:

                   Mode description    Key combination
                   ----------------    ---------------
 Primary mode      Latin               ALT+RIGHT SHIFT
 Secondary mode    Greek               ALT+LEFT SHIFT

The key combinations for the French Canadian keyboard are as follows:

                   Mode description    Key combination
                   ----------------    ---------------
 Primary mode      Latin               CTRL+RIGHT SHIFT
 Secondary mode    Latin II            CTRL+LEFT SHIFT

2. MEMMAKER AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=================================

2.1 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS)
------------------------------------------
If you use Intel's EMM.SYS driver with Aboveboard, use EMM.SYS
version 4.0 revision E if you an ISA system, or EMM.SYS version 4.0
revision D if you have an MCA or other system. Contact Intel for a&lt;7F&gt;
free upgrade.

2.2 Running MemMaker on a Computer with PC-NFS
----------------------------------------------
If you use PC-NFS network software, carry out the following procedure
before you run MemMaker:

1. Open your MEMMAKER.INF file by using any text editor. This file is
  in the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

2. Add the following line to the file:

  *NET

3. Save the file, and then run MemMaker.

2.3 You have a Super VGA display and want to conserve memory.
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you use Microsoft Windows on an 80386 computer with extended
memory and a Super VGA display, you can use the MONOUMB.386 file, in
conjunction with MemMaker, to conserve conventional memory for
running programs.

To conserve memory if you have a Super VGA display:

1. Open your Windows SYSTEM.INI file, and find the [386Enh] section.

2. Add a DEVICE command for the MONOUMB.386 file, which is located
  in your MS-DOS directory. For example, if your MS-DOS files are in
  C:\DOS, add the following line to this section:

  DEVICE=C:\DOS\MONOUMB.386

3. Save the file, and restart your computer.

4. After your computer starts, run MemMaker by typing MEMMAKER at the
  command prompt.

5. Choose Custom Setup. On the Advanced Options screen, answer Yes to
  the question "Use monochrome region (B000-B7FF) for running programs?"

  Follow the instructions on your screen.

2.4 Using MemMaker with IBM LAN
-------------------------------
Before you run MemMaker, you might need to make adjustments to the
parameters specified for your IBM LAN support driver, DXMC0MOD.SYS. In
your CONFIG.SYS file, make sure that the DEVICE command that loads
DXMC0MOD.SYS includes one of the following before you run MemMaker:

o The first three parameters, as in the following example:

 DEVICE=C:\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001,D800,1

o No parameters, as in the following example:

 DEVICE=C:\DXMC0MOD.SYS

o Some parameters and enough commas to fill in the first three
 parameters, as in the following example:

 DEVICE=C:\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001,,

2.5 MemMaker and Adaptec SCSI devices
-------------------------------------
MemMaker is compatible with Adaptec SCSI devices. However, if you use
the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver to support your SCSI device, MemMaker by default
will exclude this driver from the optimization process. If you don't
use the SCSI device as your startup or boot drive, you can include the
ASPI4DOS.SYS driver in the optimization process. To do so, remove the
^ASPI4DOS entry in the MEMMAKER.INF file, and then run MemMaker.

2.6 Using MemMaker on a computer with PC Tools or PC-DOS RAMBoost
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You can use MemMaker or RAMBoost with MS-DOS, but not both at the
same time. MemMaker will prevent RAMBoost from loading, but not
remove its DEVICE= command from your CONFIG.SYS.

2.7 EMM386 detects an error in an application
---------------------------------------------
If EMM386 displays a message such as "EMM386 has detected error
#12 in an application," this indicates that the processor&lt;7F&gt;
has reported an exception error to EMM386. An exception error
typically occurs when an application gives the processor an
instruction under invalid or unexpected conditions. In most cases,
these errors are related to a specific program. If you are receiving
an error that does not occur with any particular application, the
error might be caused by a device driver or a memory-resident
(terminate-and-stay-resident) program.

To avoid these errors:

 o  Try to identify the program involved. One way to do this is
    to see if the error occurs when the program is not running.
    If you suspect a memory-resident program or device driver,
    try bypassing it when your computer starts.

 o  Try disabling EMM386. If a particular application is to blame,
    disabling EMM386 might allow that application to generate an
    error message. Disabling EMM386 might also change
    your memory configuration so that the error no longer occurs.

 o  Try changing the order in which you load device drivers and
    memory-resident programs. This might help because some
    errors occur only under specific memory conditions.

 o  If error 12 is occurring, this indicates that a stack is being used
    incorrectly. Try adding the following command to your CONFIG.SYS
    file:

    STACKS=18,512

 o  If error 13 is occurring, the program may be trying to use protected
    mode without cooperating with EMM386. You may need to obtain a
    VCPI-compliant version of the program, or not load EMM386 when
    using this application.

2.8  MemMaker no longer aggressively scans upper memory by default
------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, the MS-DOS 6.2 version of MemMaker does not scan upper
memory aggressively. Instead, the MemMaker option "Scan the upper
memory area aggressively?" is set to No, and MemMaker limits its search
for available UMBs to memory addresses C600 through EFFF. In contrast,
the MS-DOS 6 version of MemMaker did scan upper memory aggressively
by default: in addition to scanning memory in the C600-EFFF range,
it also scanned addresses in the range F000 through F7FF.

To make more memory available for running programs, run MemMaker in
Custom mode and change the "Scan the upper memory area aggressively?"
option to Yes. (Note that, on some computers, putting UMBs in this
range prevents the computer from starting properly.)

Note: If you last ran MemMaker with the "Scan the upper memory
     area aggressively" option set to Yes, then the next time
     you run MemMaker, it leaves that option set to Yes.
