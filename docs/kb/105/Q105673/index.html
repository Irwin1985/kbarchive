-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Media Player for Windows 95 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to play an audio CD from Media Player under Windows 3.1, you may
receive the following error message:

  There is an undetectable problem loading the specified device driver.

This error message been reported to occur with the Magnavox CDD-461 CD-ROM drive,
and may occur with other CD-ROM drives as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot this problem, try the following suggestions:

1. Does the CD-ROM drive support audio?

2. Can you play CDs using the MusicBox or Jukebox utilities for Windows?

  NOTE: MusicBox is a Windows utility shipped with Magnavox MPC upgrade kits.
  Jukebox is a Windows utility shipped with Sound Blaster MPC upgrade kits.
  These utilities are on the sound card installation disks with which the kits
  ship.

3. What is the CDAudio entry in the MPLAYER.INI file set to?

  The CDAudio line should be set to 17. If this line is set to 0 (zero), Media
  Player does not recognize the CD Audio device as being available. You can use
  Notepad to edit the MPLAYER.INI file and set this line to 17 instead of 0.
  However, you should also try to determine why it was set to 0 in the first
  place.

  Media Player updates the MPLAYER.INI file in the following two situations:

   - A change has been made to the SYSTEM.INI file

  -or-

   - You have installed a new waveform, MIDI, or AUX driver using the Drivers
     section of the Windows Control Panel.

If, while Media Player is updating the MPLAYER.INI file, Windows is unable to
detect the presence of the CD-ROM player, Media Player sets the CDAudio line to
0.

NOTE: Windows may have trouble detecting the CD-ROM player if there is a problem
with the CD-ROM drivers (MSCDEX) while Windows is loading.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The key sections of the MPLAYER.INI file are explained below:

[Options]

SysIni=22797        This number indicates the date on which the
                   SYSTEM.INI file was last changed. If the
                   SYSTEM.INI file has been changed since the last
                   time you started Media Player, Media Player will
                   check all the devices listed in the [MCI] section
                   of the SYSTEM.INI file to make sure they are
                   still available.

Scale=1             This line keeps track of the last chosen
                   selection in the Scale menu.

[Devices]           This section lists the devices from the [MCI]
                   section of the SYSTEM.INI file. The number
                   following the equals sign on each line indicates
                   type and status of the device:

                      17 = simple device
                      22 = compound device
                       0 = device not present

                   A simple device does not require a filename to play
                   a sound. A compound device requires a filename (for
                   example, the name of a waveform [.WAV] file). A "0"
                   (zero) indicates that the device is not present or
                   has not been detected. The text at the end of each
                   entry is what is displayed in the Media Player
                   Device menu.

WaveAudio=22, Sound
Sequencer=22, MIDI Sequencer
AVIVideo=22, AVI Video
CDAudio=17, CD Audio
