SUMMARY
=======

The architecture of the Apple Computer AppleTalk operating system is designed
for "plug and play." This article shows how AppleTalk architectural components
correspond to the OSI Model.

PHYSICAL/DATA LINK LEVELS
-------------------------

The greatest difference at OSI levels 1 and 2 is that AppleTalk developed two
phases for the data link layer. Phase I and Phase 2 run different protocols and
although they do exactly the same thing, the information in the frame fields
changes. The Link Access Protocol, which uses this information, differs for each
phase to accommodate this change.

A more significant change is that Phase I supported a limited number of
physical/logical networks and zones, and did not support token ring networks.
Phase 2 increases the number of addressable nodes allowable per network and
includes token ring support.

NETWORK LAYER
-------------

The network layer is implemented using the datagram delivery protocol (DDP),
which provides communication between sockets--the addressable entities within a
node. Another protocol, the AppleTalk address resolution protocol (AARP),
provides address translations between the hardware (data link layer) and the DDP
(network layer).

TRANSPORT LAYER
---------------

The transport layer includes four protocols. The routing table maintenance
protocol (RTMP) updates the Internet routers with current information about the
network. The AppleTalk echo protocol (AEP) is used for maintenance and delay
measurements and allows one node to send a datagram to another and have that
node echo to the source. The name binding protocol (NBP) provides translations
between character names and the corresponding Internet socket addresses on a
distributed basis, and without a central database. Finally, the AppleTalk
transaction protocol (ATP) provides reliable, sequential, socket-to-socket
transmissions, plus "exactly once" transmissions.

SESSION LAYER
-------------

Four protocols are also available at the session layer. The AppleTalk session
protocol (ASP) opens, maintains, and closes sessions between sockets. The
AppleTalk data stream protocol (ADSP) provides reliable, byte-streamed service
between two sockets. The zone information protocol (ZIP) maintains an
Internet-wide map of the zones within the network, and maps zone names to
specific network numbers. Finally, the printer access protocol (PAP) is used for
transactions between network devices and Apple LaserWriter printers.

PRESENTATION/APPLICATION LAYERS
-------------------------------

Two protocols are defined at the presentation and application layers. The first
is the AppleTalk filing protocol (AFP), which handles remote file access. The
second is PostScript, a language used by LaserWriter printers for desktop
publishing.
