The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is an extract of the Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation
QUESTION.TXT file located in the \F32\README directory. It contains the answers
to nine common questions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Question 1
----------

The FORTRAN 5.1 development system ran under MS-DOS and built applications for
MS-DOS and Windows, and DLLs for Windows. Why does FORTRAN PowerStation run in
Windows and build applications for MS-DOS?

Answer:
FORTRAN 5.1 is a 16-bit compiler. There are inherent capacity limitations
associated with the 16-bit architecture. In order to let users overcome the DOS
640K barrier, we created FORTRAN 5.1 that could generate QuickWin applications,
essentially 16-bit applications that use extended memory as managed by Microsoft
Windows. FORTRAN PowerStation is a 32-bit targeted compiler. Since Windows for
DOS is a 16-bit operating system, it would be a potential source of performance
constraints for 32-bit applications. 32-bit DOS-extended applications,
therefore, was the route of choice. When Windows NT is released, Microsoft will
release a 32-bit Windows NT (Win32) targeted compiler.

Question 2
----------

Why is a program sometimes faster when compiled with F5.1?

Answer:
In some cases, code compiled with optimization disabled (-Od) may be faster with
FORTRAN 5.1. We chose to provide a fast compile (-Od, default) and a fast
execute (-Ox) option. FORTRAN 5.1 did some optimization even with -Od. Also
there is no optimization default with FORTRAN Powerstation, but -Ox is the
default with version 5.1. Since the default optimization is different between
these versions, it is important to be careful and compare using the same level
of optimization.

Question 3
----------

How can I get the editor in the Visual Workbench to do column selections or use
macros?

Answer:
These are not currently features that are available in the FORTRAN Visual
Workbench editor. If you have a DOS editor that has these capabilities, it is
often convenient to add the DOS editor to the Tools menu in FORTRAN Visual
Workbench. You can do this by going to the Options.Tools menu item and clicking
on the Add button. When you find the DOS editor executable file, select it and
click OK. In the resulting dialog box in the Arguments text entry line, type

  " $file" (without the quotation marks)

and click on the OK button. You will now have an entry under your Tools menu that
when selected will bring up your DOS editor with the file that is currently in
the active window in FORTRAN Visual Workbench. You can then edit your file, and
when you exit from the DOS editor you will return to FORTRAN Visual Workbench.
The FORTRAN Visual Workbench will then allow you to reload the edited file using
a dialog box.

Question 4
----------

If I have created a project how do I delete it and its associated files?

Answer:
If you have created a project named TEST and want to delete it and all of its
associated files you need to delete

  TEST.FMK   This is the project makefile.
  TEST.FPW   This is the project status file.
  TEST.WSP   This is the project workspace file.

The easiest way to maintain projects is to have a single project in a directory.
After saving your source code, you can delete the entire directory to delete the
project.

Question 5
----------

When I compile with the /Zi option from the command line I get the following
error:

  Usage: cvpack [-p] [-help] exefile
  LINK32() : warning LNK4527: CVPACK error

Answer:
Check your path and make sure that F32\BIN is the first thing in the path. If you
have other language products in your path before F32\BIN, the version of
CVPACK.EXE that is used by LINK32.EXE may be incorrect. If you type CVPACK at
the DOS command line and press ENTER, you should see the following message:

  Microsoft (R) Debugging Information Compactor Version 4.21
  Copyright (c) Microsoft Corp 1987-1993. All rights reserved.

If you see a version number earlier that the one above, you need to correct the
order of directories in your path so that F32\BIN is first.

Question 6
----------

I compiled and linked my program and it runs fine on the machine where FORTRAN
Powerstation is installed but when I take it to another machine it won't run.
How can I make this application run on another machine?

Answer:
There are two additional files that need to be installed on the machine where you
are going to run the FORTRAN application: DOSXMSF.EXE and DOSXNT.386.
DOSXMSF.EXE is the actual DOS extender that allows your 32-bit program to run
under MS-DOS. DOXSNT.386 is a DPMI device driver that allows your program to run
as a 32-bit DOS-extended program under Windows.

You need to install DOSXMSF.EXE either in the same directory as the FORTRAN
program or in a directory that is in your DOS PATH environment variable.
DOSXNT.386 is a Windows device driver that is necessary if you want to run the
FORTRAN application in an MS-DOS session under Windows. To install DOSXNT.386,
you need the following entry in the SYSTEM.INI file under the [386Enh] section:

  device=C:\F32\BIN\dosxnt.386

Question 7
----------

I have a number of assembly code modules that I would like to use with FORTRAN
PowerStation. How can I do this?

Answer:
16-bit assembly code must be modified to work with 32-bit applications. The
assembly code will need to be converted to use a 32-bit flat memory model and,
in some cases, will have to adjust for the fact that the application is running
in 32-bit protected-mode and not in real-mode. Object modules produced by
assemblers will probably be OMF-type files. They will need to be converted to
COFF-type object modules. It is recommended that MASM 6.1 be used for 32-bit
programmming. Please consult your MASM manual and Chapter 18 of the FORTRAN
PowerStation User's Guide.

An extended example of 32-bit MASM programming is provided with the GRDEMO sample
project in the ..F32\SAMPLES\DEMO directory. The file MOUSE.ASM is a MASM
routine used in the sample. The comments in this file include tips on assembly
language programming.

Question 8
----------

I see various components of the package with Windows NT in the name. Do I need
Windows NT to run this product?

Answer:
Microsoft has committed to producing a Windows NT compiler. Certain elements of
the FORTRAN PowerStation have been designed to facilitate the process of
supporting the Windows NT operating system in future products. But this product
is targeted at 32-bit DOS, and Windows NT is not a supported or required element
of this package.

Question 9
----------

I used to do mixed-language programming with high-level languages and FORTRAN.
Can I do this with FORTRAN Powerstation?

Answer:
The object modules produced with 16-bit versions of C will not link correctly
with FORTRAN Powerstation object modules. You can use one of the 32-bit C
compilers available from Microsoft and other vendors to produce object modules
that can be linked with FORTRAN Powerstation object modules.
