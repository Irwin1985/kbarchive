1. SETUP
--------

1.1 SpeedStor
-------------

If Setup referred you to this section and your computer has an OS/2 partition
created by using the FDISKPM utility in OS/2 2.1, run MS-DOS Setup by typing
"SETUP /U" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt.

If Setup referred you to this section and you have neither OS/2 nor a SpeedStor
partition on your computer, see the section "Setup displays the Incompatible
Hard Disk or Device Driver screen" in the "Diagnosing and Solving Problems"
chapter of the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.

If you do have a SpeedStor partition on your computer, Setup probably referred
you to this section for one of the following reasons:

- Setup could not find in your CONFIG.SYS file a command for the device driver
  that supports your SpeedStor partition. If this is the case, add the command
  line to your CONFIG.SYS file, restart your computer, and run Setup. For more
  information about adding the command line to your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
  SpeedStor documentation.

- Your CONFIG.SYS file has a DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS line in it. If this is the
  case, carry out the following procedure:

  1. Use the EXPAND command to expand and copy the SSTOR.SYS file to your hard
     disk. Make sure you copy the SSTOR.SYS file to the same path as the
     HARDRIVE.SYS file.

     See the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1 for the location of the SSTOR.SYS
     file on the Setup disks and for instructions on how to expand and copy it
     to your hard disk.&lt;7F&gt;

  2. Replace the DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS command with a DEVICE=SSTOR.SYS command.
     For example, if the command that loaded the HARDRIVE.SYS file was
     DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\HARDRIVE.SYS, you would replace it with
     DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\SSTOR.SYS.

  3. Restart your computer.

  4. Make sure you can access your hard disk.

  5. Run Setup.

1.2 Incompatible Hard Disk or Device Driver
-------------------------------------------

If Setup referred you to this section, and no other section in this file is
relevant to your system, you have a partition that is incompatible with MS-DOS
6.2. You must delete the partition from your hard disk. See "Using Fdisk to
Configure Your Hard Disk" in the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in
the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE.

1.3 AT&amp;T 6300 Computer
----------------------

If you use an AT&amp;T 6300 computer and your ROM BIOS is version 1.21, contact
your vendor for a ROM BIOS upgrade. The ROM BIOS version number is displayed
when you start your computer.

1.4 Toshiba with a Hard RAM Disk
--------------------------------

These instructions apply to Toshiba models T1200, T1600, T1200XE and T1000LE.

To use the hard RAM disk, carry out the following procedure before you install
MS-DOS 6.2:

1. Back up your hard RAM disk.

2. Using the Toshiba Setup program, delete the hard RAM disk by allocating zero
  kilobytes (KB) to it. All data on the hard RAM disk will be lost.

3. Restart your computer

4. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup.

5. After Setup is complete, run the Toshiba Setup program to reinstall the hard
  RAM disk.

6. Run FDISK, change to drive 2, and create a primary DOS partition. Quit FDISK.

7. Use the FORMAT command to format drive D.

1.5 Tandy with ROM DOS
----------------------

Contact your hardware manufacturer for information about upgrading a Tandy
computer with ROM DOS to MS-DOS 6.2. This applies to the following models:
1000EX, 1000HX, 1000SL, 1000SL2, 1000TL, 1000TL2, 1000TL3, 1000RL, 1000RLX,
1000RL-HD, 1000RLX-HD, 1100FD, 2500XL, 2500XL2.

1.6 Setup displays the "Your computer uses a disk-compression program that is
incompatible with Setup" message.

If Setup indicated that your computer has an incompatible disk-compression
program, you must remove it manually before you can install MS-DOS 6.2. Carry
out the following procedure.

NOTE This procedure will replace your current disk-compression software with
DoubleSpace. As an alternative, contact your disk- compression vendor for an
updated version of your software. In most cases, current versions of
disk-compression software are compatible with MS-DOS 6.2.

1. Back up all the files on your compressed drive. In step 3, you will format
  your uncompressed drive, which destroys all the files on your compressed and
  uncompressed drives.

2. If your Setup disks are compatible with drive A, insert Setup Disk 1 in drive
  A, and restart your computer. After Setup displays the first screen, quit
  Setup by pressing F3 twice.

  If your Setup disks are not compatible with drive A, create a startup floppy
  disk for drive A. To do this, insert Setup Disk 1 in drive B, and a blank
  floppy disk in drive A. Then type "B:SETUP /F" (without the quotation marks)
  at the command prompt.

  When prompted, choose to install MS-DOS on the floppy disk in drive A. After
  Setup is finished, leave the disk in drive A, and restart your computer.

3. At the command prompt, type "FORMAT C: /S" (without the quotation marks) to
  reformat your startup drive and transfer MS-DOS 6.2 system files to it.

4. Remove the disk from drive A, and restart your computer.

5. Insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and type "A:SETUP" (without the
  quotation marks) or "B:SETUP" (without the quotation marks) at the command
  prompt.

6. After Setup is complete, type "DBLSPACE" (without the quotation marks) at the
  command prompt, and follow the instructions on your screen.

  For more information about DoubleSpace, see the chapter "Freeing Disk Space"
  in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE.

7. After you have installed DoubleSpace, restore the files you backed up. Do not
  restore older versions of MS-DOS files.

1.7 You deleted files from the directory that Setup needs to install the optional
Windows programs.

If you typed "BUSETUP /E" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt,
the "Setup did not find the files it needs in the directory specified" message
appeared, and you think you deleted the files from your hard disk, insert Setup
Disk 1 in drive A or B, and start Setup by typing "A:SETUP /E" (without the
quotation marks) or "B:SETUP /E" (without the quotation marks) at the command
prompt.

1.8 Running Setup if Your Computer Uses Windows NT
--------------------------------------------------

If your computer has Windows NT installed, but does not have MS-DOS installed on
it, carry out Procedure 1. If your computer has Windows NT and MS-DOS installed
on it, carry out Procedure 2.

Procedure 1

1. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A and restarting your computer.
  Complete Setup by following the instructions on the screen. When Setup is
  complete, Windows NT will be disabled.

  If Windows NT was installed on a FAT partition, complete steps 2 and 3 of this
  procedure to reenable Windows NT so that you can use both the Windows NT and
  MS-DOS operating systems.

  If Windows NT was installed on a non-FAT partition, see section 1.9.

2. Insert your Windows NT Setup disk in drive A or drive B, and then restart
  your computer.

3. When the Windows NT Setup screen appears, choose Repair, and then insert your
  Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk (which you created when you installed
  Windows NT) to repair the Windows NT system files.

Procedure 2

1. When you start your computer, choose MS-DOS as your operating system.&lt;7F&gt;

2. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and typing "A:SETUP"
  (without the quotation marks) or "B:SETUP" (without the quotation marks) at
  the command prompt.

1.9 Setup detects that your computer has a non-MS-DOS partition or non-MS-DOS
files, and your computer uses Windows NT

The procedure you use depends on whether you want to preserve the partition and
its files. Find the section below that describes the configuration you want.

You Don't Want to Preserve the Partition or its Files
-----------------------------------------------------

If you don't want to preserve the partition or its files, choose to remove the
partition or files if Setup prompts you to do so. If Setup doesn't offer you
that choice, remove the partition manually after Setup is complete. For
instructions on removing a non-MS-DOS partition manually, see "Using Fdisk to
Configure Your Hard Disk" in the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in
the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE.

You Don't Want to Preserve the Partition but Want to Save its Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to save the data files, but don't want to preserve the partition,
back up the files, run Setup again, and then choose to remove the partition or
files if Setup prompts you to do so. If Setup doesn't offer you this choice,
remove the partition manually after Setup is complete. For instructions on
removing the partition manually, see "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk"
in the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6
USER'S GUIDE.

You Want to Preserve the Partition and Its Files
------------------------------------------------

Carry out the following procedure.

NOTE If the non-MS-DOS partition takes up all the space on your hard disk, you
must reconfigure your hard disk. You can either let Setup do it for you, as
described in the preceding section, or reconfigure it yourself manually. For
instructions on reconfiguring your hard disk manually, see your Windows NT
documentation.

To install MS-DOS 6.2 and preserve your partition or files:

1. Run MS-DOS Setup.

2. When prompted, choose to continue Setup without removing the partition or
  files.

3. After Setup is complete, insert your Windows NT Setup disk in drive A or
  drive B, and then restart your computer.

4. When the Windows NT Setup screen appears, choose Repair, and then insert your
  Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk (which you created when you installed
  Windows NT) to repair the Windows NT system files.
