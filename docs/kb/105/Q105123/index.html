The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0 
- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

PowerPoint clip art can consist of two types of objects: shapes and freeform
objects. Shapes such as circles and rectangles can be recolored and resized;
however, their basic outline cannot be changed arbitrarily. Freeform objects are
drawn with the freeform tool. Their outline is defined by the placement of
vector points which are visible as black squares connected by lines, when the
freeform is being edited. You modify freeform objects by moving, adding, and
deleting vector points.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify PowerPoint clip art:

1. In PowerPoint version 3.0, choose Open Clipart from the File menu. Open a
  clip art presentation. Copy a clip art object and paste it into your own
  PowerPoint presentation.

  In PowerPoint version 4.0 or 7.0, choose ClipArt from the Insert menu. Select
  the desired image from the ClipArt Gallery and click OK to return to your
  presentation.

2. Convert the object into PowerPoint objects by choosing the Ungroup command.
  You will receive the following alert:

  This is an imported object, not a group. Converting to PowerPoint objects
  will permanently discard andy embedded data or linking information it may
  contain. Convert to PowerPoint objects?

  Choose OK.

  The object ungroups to form one ore more objects, each with a selection border
  around it.

3. Click on the Selection tool (arrow) to deselect everything and then Select
  the single object you want to modify.

4. If the Ungroup command is available, choose it.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the Ungroup command is no longer available
  (dimmed) which indicates that you have reduced the selection to its most
  basic PowerPoint object components.

6. If the selected object is a freeform object you will see the following
  command appear in the Edit menu:

     Command                     PowerPoint Version
     ------------------------    ---------------------------
     Edit Freeform               PowerPoint version 3.x
     Edit Freeform Object        PowerPoint version 4.x, 7.0

  Choose the Edit Freeform or Edit Freeform Object command in order to modify
  the object by moving, adding or removing vector points.

The methods and interfaces are slightly different depending on the version of
PowerPoint so check the manual or on-line help for specific instructions on
editing freeforms for the version of PowerPoint that you are using.

NOTE: This same method (Steps 2 through 6) can be used to edit any vector-based
graphic that has been imported into PowerPoint, such a Windows Metafiles (.WMF)
and Computer Graphics Metafiles (.CGM).
