The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Information Server contains four registry keys. They are FTP,
Gopher, WWW (World Wide Web), and the Internet Information Server (IIS).

The Internet Information Server registry key provides registry parameters and
values that are global for the InetInfo process and the server. The registry
keys for FTP, Gopher, and WWW use few similar parameters and values, but are
used independent of each other.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Internet Information servers share a common portion of registry in the
following location for InetInfo process. These parameters and their values are
used for global control of the Internet Information Server.

The parameter location is under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the
following subkeys:

  \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters

BandwidthLevel                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:0xFFFFFFFF
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This specifies the amount of bandwidth on the network the IIS can use. The server
comes with an automatic bandwidth throttler which makes intelligent decisions to
meet user requirements. This helps reduce overloading the network too much of
Gibraltar server activities. For administrators of small corporate servers,
where a single server is used for multiple sites, this will help reduce network
usage for IIS. It is recommended that this parameter be set from the Internet
Server Admin Manager. Otherwise the server should be stopped and restarted for
this value to take effect. A special value of 0xFFFFFFFF means no throttling
should be done.

MemoryCacheSize                                 REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:3072000 (3MB)
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

IIS server caches system handles, directory listings, and several blobs (Binary
Large Objects) of frequently used data to improve performance of the system.
This parameter specifies the amount of memory in bytes to allocate for such a
cache. This cannot be configured using Admin Manager. When changed, the server
must be stopped and restarted for this to take effect. A special value of 0
means do not do any caching. The performance may be low when caching is shut
out. Certain sites experiencing high file traffic can increase this size if
there is sufficient RAM on the system.

ObjectCacheTTL                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0x7FFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF              Default:10*60(10Minutes)
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

Objects in the Memory Cache will be phased out of the cache if there have been no
references to an object after this period. If system memory is limited, a lower
TTL may be useful to prevent non-paged memory being used for cached file
handles. A value of 0xFFFFFFFF disables the object cache scavenger. Units are in
seconds.

UserTokenTTL                                    REG_DWORD Range:  0 -
0x7FFFFFFF                                      Default: 15*60 (10Minutes)
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

When a request is made to the server, the security credentials for the request
(or the configured anonymous user) are used to create a user token on the server
which the server impersonates when accessing files or other system resources.
The token is cached so the NT logon only takes place the first time the user
accesses the system or after the user's token has fallen out of the cache. NTLM
authentication tokens are not cached. Units are in seconds.

LogFileBatchSize                                REG_DWORD
Range:          0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                  Default:64*1024 (64KB)
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

This specifies the batch size for writing log file. The server caches the last
LogFileBatchSize bytes of data in memory buffers before it dumps the current
buffer and moves onto the next buffer. Such batch processing reduces the amount
of disk traffic created by log files. However, if a site is interested in
getting the current-up-to-date log records flushed to disk the batch size can be
reduced.

MaxPoolThreads                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:10
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

MaxPoolThreads specifies the number of pool threads to create per processor. Each
pool thread watches for the network request and processes the same. Generally it
is not good to create more than 20 threads per processor.

MaxConcurrency                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:0
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

MaxConcurrency specifies the amount of concurrency that a system should provide.
We use completion ports for handling IO. In general it is not good to have more
than one thread running and conflicting on shared memory or locks. This
parameter specifies how many threads per processor should be allowed to run
simultaneously if there is a pending IO operation. The specific value of 0
allows system to make intelligent choice of the number of threads to use. Any
non-zero value specifies that the system should allow that many threads per
processor to run simultaneously.

ThreadTimeout                                   REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:24*60*60 (24 hours)
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

ThreadTimeout specifies the amount of time an IO processing thread should be
maintained even if there is no IO on the system. In general when there is no IO
activity and no requests outstanding, the server is idle and does not consume
memory. But if that situation prolongs and exceeds the ThreadTimeout interval,
then the thread is killed. Unit is in seconds.

UseAcceptEx                                     REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default:1
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

Starting with NT 3.51 SP2 we have a new facility to listen and establish
connections at the server side. AcceptEx() provides a cheap way to accept and
receive an initial chunk of data on a new incoming connection. By default the
server uses this method to accept new connections. If, for experimental purposes
one decides to turn off using this fast IO path, then this value can be set to
0. However, setting to 0 may cause potential performance degradation.

AcceptExOutstanding                             REG_DWORD
Range:  0-1000                                  Default:40
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

When using AcceptEx(), certain number of sockets should be maintained to receive
and process new connections. This parameter specifies the number of such
outstanding connections to maintain. Whenever the number of outstanding sockets
fall below this range, the server adds additional sockets to bring it back to
this level.

AcceptExTimeout                                 REG_DWORD
Range:  0-0xFFFFFFFF                            Default:120
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

AcceptExTimeout specifies the time an accept ex socket is allowed to be waiting
for a receive to complete, before the server blows away the long- waiting
connection. This helps to reduce the number of outstanding sockets and hence
conserve the system memory usage. Units is in seconds.

MimeMap                                         Key
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

This is a subkey that contains all the virtual roots for a service.

DebugFlags                                      REG_DWORD
Range:  0 - 0xFFFFFFFF                          Default:0
Description:                                    INTERNAL ANALYSIS

DebugFlags specifies the bit mask for selectively enabling different checks in a
debug binary of the server common dll (INFOCOMM.DLL). This bit mask applies to
the common dll only.

  #define DEBUG_ERROR                                     0x00000008L
  #define DEBUG_ODBC                                      0x00000010L

  #define DEBUG_GATEWAY                                   0x00010000L
  #define DEBUG_INETLOG                                   0x00020000L
  #define DEBUG_ATQ                                       0x00040000L
  #define DEBUG_DLL_EVENT_LOG                             0x00100000L
  #define DEBUG_DLL_SERVICE_INFO                          0x00200000L
  #define DEBUG_DLL_SECURITY                              0x00400000L
  #define DEBUG_DLL_CONNECTION                            0x00800000L
  #define DEBUG_DLL_SOCKETS                               0x01000000L
  #define DEBUG_HEAP_FILL                                 0x02000000L
  #define DEBUG_HEAP_MSG                                  0x04000000L

  #define DEBUG_DLL_VIRTUAL_ROOTS                         0x20000000L

Per Service Registry Parameters
-------------------------------

Each of the Internet Information services have per service registry
configurations. There are several parameters which have the same name, but
different per-service values. The values are used on a per service basis. Below
is a description of all such common-named registry parameters applicable to all
services followed by service specific registry parameters.

Commonly Named Per Service Parameters
-------------------------------------

The parameters are located under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the
following subkey:

  \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;ServiceName&gt;\Parameters

where &lt;ServiceName&gt; is:

  MSFTPSVC                                FTP Service
  GOPHERSVC                               Gopher Service
  W3SVC                                   HTTP Service

AdminName                                       REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:Administrator
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

AdminName specifies the user friendly administrator name. Gopher service uses
this name to send back responses for Gopher queries. It also serves as a way of
identifying who owns a service using IIS manager.

AdminEmail                                      REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:Admin@corp.com
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

AdminEmail specifies the email address for administrator of a particular service.
Gopher service uses this name to send back responses for Gopher+ queries. It
also serves as a way of identifying who owns a service using IIS manager.

ServerComment                                   REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default: ""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

Specifies a user-friendly comment for a service. This information is supplied to
the IIS manager and is used to add configurable comment about a server.

EnableSvcLoc                                    REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default:1
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

IIS Services register themselves with a service locator so the service can be
discovered by administrative utility and clients. This parameter controls such
registration. If it is set to 0, then the service will forego registration of
the service. Otherwise, it registers the service for service location.
Administrators planning on having a private server should consider setting the
value of this parameter to 0.

AllowAnonymous                                  REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 1
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This flag specifies if an anonymous user should be allowed to connect and make a
request to the server. By nature, most Internet protocols allow anonymous
connections to access a limited set of files. Hence, it is essential to permit
anonymous connections.

AnonymousOnly                                   REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 0
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

AnonymousOnly specifies if only anonymous connection should be permitted. If this
flag is turned on no non-anonymous connections are permitted (especially true of
FTP server).

AnonymousUserName                               REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default: Guest
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

AnonymousUserName specifies the name of the local user account to use for
anonymous users. Server impersonates as a particular user to access the files so
that the file system security model is leveraged. This parameter should not be
changed by itself. It should be configured using the IIS Admin Manager so that
the appropriate password can also be set. The password is stored in a protected
area in the registry.

ConnectionTimeOut                               REG_DWORD
Range:  0-0xFFFFFFFF                            Default: 600 seconds
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

Specifies the time the server should hold on to a connection when there is no
activity on the same. Server automatically disconnects long hanging connections.
Units: seconds.

LogAnonymous                                    REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 1
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

This flag controls if a log record should be written for anonymous connections.
If set to 0, no log records are written for anonymous connections.

LogNonAnonymous                                 REG_DWORD
Range:  0, 1                                    Default: 1
Description:                                    CONFIGURABLE

This flag controls if a log record should be written for non-anonymous
connections. If set to 0, no log records are written for non-anonymous
connections. Only FTP and HTTP services have non-anonymous user support.

LogFileDirectory                  REG_EXPAND_SZ
Range:  String                    Default: %systemroot%\system32\logfiles
Description:                      ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This string specifies the directory in which log files are to be stored. Each
service generates a log record for each request processed.

LogFilePeriod                                   REG_DWORD
Range:  0,1,2,3                                 Default: 1
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This specifies an internal value for request logging module. The value specifies
the type of log files to be produced.

0   No period. The logfile size is limited to LogFileTruncateSize bytes.
1   Open a new log file each day - Daily
2   Open a new log file every week - Weekly
3   Open a new log file every month - Monthly

LogFileTruncateSize                             REG_DWORD
Range:  0-0xFFFFFFFF                            Default: 4,000,000,000
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This value specifies the maximum size of each log file generated. Once this size
is reached, the logging module automatically opens a new log file. A special
value of 0 means do not truncate.

LogSqlDataSources                               REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This string specifies the name of the ODBC data source to use for sending the
request logs for the service to a SQL compatible database system. This data
source should be a system DSN in the ODBC installation on server machine.

LogSqlTableName                                 REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This string specifies the name of the ODBC table name use for sending the request
logs for the service to a SQL compatible database system. The table should be
created by the administrator as per the specification provided with the
services. The user should also have proper access permissions to insert into
table.

LogSqlUserName                                  REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This string specifies the user name to use for talking to the ODBC data source
specified for ODBC based logging. This user should be a valid user on the
database system to which the LogSqlDataSource is pointing to.

LogSqlPassword                                  REG_SZ
Range:  String                                  Default:""
Description:                                    ADMIN CONFIGURABLE

This string specifies the password to establishing an ODBC connection for a
particular user account on the ODBC data source. Currently the password is
