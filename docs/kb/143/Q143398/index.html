SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Remote Registry service to remotely administer a
computer running the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS),
you may receive one of the following error messages:

- Unable to connect to &lt;computer name&gt;. Make sure that this computer is
  on the network, has remote administration enabled, and that both computers
  are running remote registry service.

- Unable to connect to &lt;computer name&gt;. Make sure you have permission to
  administer the computer.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- You attempt to use the Remote Registry service while you are logged on to a
  NetWare Directory Services (NDS) tree, and you are using a server for
  user-level security that is part of the same NDS tree.

- You are logging on to an NDS tree and your password on the NDS tree is
  different than the password for your account on the server that is providing
  user-level security.

- Bindery emulation is not set to the correct container on the NetWare 4.x
  server you are using for user-level security.

RESOLUTION
==========

To connect to a remote workstation using the Remote Registry service with MSNDS,
the following requirements must be met:

- Both workstations must be set up for the Remote Registry service.

- Both workstations must have Remote Administration set up correctly. For
  additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q141460 How to Install Remote Administration Services

- User-level security must be installed and set to a bindery-based NetWare
  server that is not part of the NDS tree. The server can be either a NetWare
  3.x server or a NetWare 4.x server with bindery emulation set for the
  container where user accounts reside. This server cannot be a member of the
  NDS tree you log on to.

- Your password for the NDS tree must be the same as the password on the server
  you are using for user-level security.

  NOTE: If your password for the user-level security server has been cached, it
  is possible to use a different password for logging on to the NDS tree.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Remote Registry service requires the use of user-level security and is
currently a bindery-based tool that does not understand NDS. Therefore, the
server used for user-level security must not be part of the NDS tree you are
logging on to.
