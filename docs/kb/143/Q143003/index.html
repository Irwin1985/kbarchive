SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information about the updates included with Microsoft
Windows 95 Service Pack 1.

For information about obtaining Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q142794 Availability of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following updates are provided with Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 and
are installed when you run Setup.exe.

File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks Update
------------------------------------------------------

Vserver.vxd New file version: 4.0.0.952

This update corrects a problem with File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft
Networks and Samba's SMBCLIENT UNIX network client. The update corrects a
problem with share-level security and includes a correction for a similar
problem with user-level security that Microsoft recently discovered as part of
its internal testing of the new driver. Windows 95 allows users of the Samba SMB
client to access the drive on which sharing is enabled by accepting certain
specific networking commands. The Samba client is the only known SMB client that
sends such networking commands.

SMBCLIENT users do not automatically have access to the drive on the Windows
95-based computer, and must know the exact steps to send these commands. The
updated driver prevents Windows 95 from accepting these commands, preventing
SMBCLIENT users from accessing the drive on which sharing is enabled. With the
updated driver, the SMBCLIENT user has access only to those shared folders that
the Windows 95 user has designated. For more information on this update, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q128079 Updated Drivers for File and Printer Sharing Security

File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks Update
----------------------------------------------------

File: Nwserver.vxd New file version: 4.0.0.951

Microsoft recently became aware of an issue with File and Printer Sharing for
NetWare Networks that may affect data security for corporate users. If your
computer is configured for file and printer sharing and the Remote
Administration service is enabled, another user on the network may gain
read-only access to your computer after the administrator has logged off and
before you have restarted your computer. To correct this problem, Microsoft has
released an updated driver for File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks.
The updated driver ensures that only valid administrators have access to the
computer's hard disk.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q128079 Updated Drivers for File and Printer Sharing Security

LPT Port Driver Update for ECP Ports
------------------------------------

File: Lpt.vxd New file version: 4.0.0.951

Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 automatically installs a version of the
parallel port driver (Lpt.vxd) that corrects issues seen on some computers
equipped with ECP ports. This driver is functionally identical to Lpt.vxd
version 4.0.0.503, which is included on the Windows 95 CD-ROM in the
Drivers\Printer\Lpt folder.

Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks Update
----------------------------------------------

File: Vredir.vxd New file version: 4.0.0.955

The Client for Microsoft Networks update fixes a problem that affects only
Windows 95 users who use Samba servers. The problem arises from the basic
Windows 95 and UNIX file name formats. UNIX allows file names that include the
"\" and "*" characters, but these are wildcard characters in Windows 95. If a
Samba server contains a file named \\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;\*.* (which is
a valid UNIX file name), and you try to delete this file from a Windows 95-based
computer using Windows Explorer or My Computer, all the files on
\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt; are deleted instead. The updated version of the
Client for Microsoft Networks prevents this from occurring by rejecting file
names that contain the "\" or "*" characters.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q140558 Deleting Files on Samba Servers May Delete Local Files Instead

Microsoft OLE32 Update
----------------------

File: Ole32.dll New file version: 2.10.35.37

The Windows 95 OLE32 update addresses file-management behavior in Microsoft Word,
Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, versions 7.0. Because
of the way these programs use OLE for file storage, document files created in
these programs may contain extraneous data from previously deleted files. This
data is not visible while you use the programs. However, it may be possible to
view a document file using Notepad or file-utility software and find legible
pieces of information from previously deleted files. This may pose information
security and privacy concerns if you distribute electronic versions of files
created using these programs. The OLE32 update corrects this behavior. Although
the problem is known to occur only in Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint for
Windows 95, the OLE32 update is designed to prevent any program from potentially
causing the same problem.

NOTE: There is a newer OLE update for Windows 95 than the update contained in
Service Pack 1. The newer update fixes the problem described above, as well as
two other issues. For information about the newer update, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139432 OLE Update for Windows 95

Microsoft Plus! System Agent Update Update
------------------------------------------

File: Sage.dll New file version: 4.40.0.311

The Microsoft Plus! Update Kit provides an updated version of the Sage.dll file
to fix a minor problem with System Agent. When System Agent version 1.0 is
running, programs that perform floating-point calculations may be slightly off
in precision. This problem does not occur if System Agent is disabled. For more
information on this update, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q140479 Updated Sage.dll File Corrects Floating-Point Math Errors

Windows 95 Common Dialog Update
-------------------------------

File: Comdlg32.dll New file version: 4.0.0.951

This update corrects an issue that occurs when 32-bit programs print using
Windows 3.1 monolithic drivers or the Windows 3.1 Pscript.drv and Unidrv.dll
drivers in Windows 95. When you use this configuration, the program may stop
responding (hang).

Windows 95 Password List Update
-------------------------------

File: Mspwl32.dll New file version: 4.0.0.951

File: Net.exe New file version: 4.00.951

The Windows 95 Password List update version 4.00.951 protects your password file
against potential security violations. When you connect to a password- protected
resource, such as a network drive, you can choose to save that password. Windows
95 then stores the password in an encrypted file on your hard disk. Recently, an
algorithm was posted on the Internet for decrypting this file. If someone has
access to your password file and knows the decryption algorithm, he or she may
be able to decrypt it and the passwords it contains, gaining access to the
password-protected resources. The Password List update provides vastly improved
encryption that is 2^96 (2 to the 96th power) harder to decrypt than the
previous encryption method.

Microsoft has released the Windows 95 Password List update version 9.00.952. For
more information on this update, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q132807 Enhanced Encryption for Windows 95 Password Cache

Windows 95 Shell Update
-----------------------

File: Shell32.dll New file version: 4.0.0.951

This update to the Windows 95 Shell32.dll file fixes a problem in which a file
copied onto itself can be truncated to a zero-length file. This occurs only in
the following circumstances:

- When you copy a file onto itself using two different views of the same
  network resource (these can be different mapped drive letters or UNC
  connections to a network resource).

- When you copy a file onto itself using a drive that was created by the SUBST
  command.

This update to the Shell32.dll file also makes it possible to browse Novell
NetWare Directory Service printers from the Add Printer Wizard (provided you
have installed the Service for NetWare Directory Services).

Knowledge Base:
