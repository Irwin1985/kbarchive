The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1 
- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 4.2, 5.0, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information regarding the redistribution of the DAO
components with your DAO-enabled application that was developed using Visual C++
4.0. The information in this article supersedes all documentation found on or
installed from the Visual C++ 4.0 CD-ROM.

This article addresses three major topics:

- The setup script located in Msdev\Redist\Dao

- Errors in the DAO SDK documentation regarding DAO setup

- The Microsoft Jet IISAM files

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup Script Located in Msdev\Redist\Dao
--------------------------------------------

The setup script located in Msdev\Redist\Dao is the script that is used by Visual
C++ to install the core DAO components, is also the setup script that is
recommended for redistribution. However, there are certain limitations to this
setup script that may make it unusable for redistribution with your DAO enabled
application.

- The setup script won't work across multiple floppy disks, which may mean you
  won't be able to redistribute on 1.44 Megabyte floppy disks. If you attempt
  to use multiple disks, you will receive this error:

  General file transfer error. Please check your target location and try
  again.

  Error Number:-2

  The script is not designed to look for the files it requires to be located on
  multiple disks.

  If you are redistributing on 1.44 Megabyte floppy disks, one way to work
  around this issue is to have your setup script copy all setup files to a
  temporary directory on the target drive and run the provided setup script
  from that location. Then delete the temporary directory when setup is
  complete.

- If you use the setup script as instructed in the Readme.wri file, the script
  won't install the IISAM files that Microsoft Jet requires to work with
  database file formats such as Paradox, Microsoft Excel, Xbase, or text files.
  However, the IISAM file required to work with Microsoft Access 2.0/1.x
  database (.mdb) files is installed.

- For more information on modifying the InstallShield setup script to work
  around this problem, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q151426 How to Create a DAO Setup That Installs Jet IISAM Files

  Alternatively, to work around this issue, have your setup script copy any
  required IISAM files to the appropriate system directory and register them
  per the instructions in the Daosdk\Setup\Daosetup.rtf file (section 3.4
  'Register the DLLs'). It is not sufficient to copy the IISAMs without
  registering them. These IISAM files are available in Msdev\Redist:

  IISAM File        Database File Format
  --------------------------------------
  MSPX3032.DLL      Paradox
  MSRD2x32.DLL      Microsoft Access 2.0
  MSTX3032.DLL      Text
  MSXB3032.DLL      XBase
  MSXL3032.DLL      Microsoft Excel

Errors in the DAO SDK Documentation Regarding DAO Setup
-------------------------------------------------------

The Daosdk.hlp file's "Installing DAO on another machine" section contains
several errors:

- The NOSDK setup script does not function as the documentation indicates.

  NOTE: This version of setup is identical to the one in Msdev\Redist\Dao -- see
  the previous section for details.

- The DAOMIN setup script will install the DAO components with no IISAM files
  as stated in the documentation. However, if the Microsoft Access 2.0/1.x
  IISAM file is not already present on the target computer, a message box is
  displayed stating:

  MSRD2X32.DLL not found.

  After this dialog box is dismissed, setup runs to a successful completion.

The Microsoft Jet IISAM Files
-----------------------------

The IISAM files that are installed by the DAO SDK setup scripts that do install
IISAM files differ in size from those located in Msdev\Redist. The IISAM files
located in Msdev\Redist are those installed by the ODBC setup script and are the
only IISAM files that you are authorized to redistribute.

Comparing the DAO SDK installed IISAM files with the redistributable IISAM files
reveals that the versions are identical but with the exception of the Microsoft
Access 2.0 IISAM Msrd2x32.dll, the SDK IISAM files are larger in size and have
an earlier timestamp. This is because the IISAM files installed by the DAO SDK
were included in the SDK prior to the removal of extra version information from
the DLLs.

When redistributing your DAO application, use the IISAM files from Msdev\Redist.

Additional information will be added to this article as it becomes available.

For Visual C++ 4.2 Users
------------------------

Visual C++ 4.2 includes the new InstallShield Express, and no longer installs the
InstallShield SDK directly. Instead, you will need to install the InstallShield
SDK from either the Visual C++ 4.0 or 4.1 CD-ROM. Then follow the instructions
in \ISHIELD\SDK\README.TXT to update the SDK with the latest files.

COMPILE.EXE, used to re-compile the DAOMIN.RUL file, is not shipped on the Visual
C++ 4.2 CD-ROM and can only be installed from the InstallShield SDK found on
either Visual C++ 4.0 or Visual C++ 4.1.
