SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft 3D Movie Maker allows you to import or record sound effects and speech
and add them to your movies. Sounds that are recorded or imported appear on the
last page of sound effects and speech lists for the current movie. They do not
appear in the sound effects or speech lists of other movies.

This article describes how to use those sounds in other movies you create.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make sounds placed in one movie available to other movies, use one of the
following three methods:

Method 1
--------

For best results, record your sounds using the utilities supplied with your sound
card or with Windows 95. You can import sounds saved as .wav files into any
movie and save them as part of that movie. In 3D Movie Maker, .wav files are
used for speech and sound effects. You also can use these sounds in other
applications which support .wav files.

Method 2
--------

You can move sounds from one movie to another by attaching them to an object and
then copying and pasting the object into another movie. To use this method to
copy sounds to another movie, do the following:

1. Open the movie that contains the sound you want to use.

2. Click Actors And Props.

3. Click the Props button, and then select any prop.

4. Click Sounds.

5. On the Sound Effects or Speech lists, select the sound you want to use.

6. Click the new prop to attach the sound.

7. Click the Cut, Copy, and Paste tools on the tool bar at the bottom on the
  screen.

8. Click the Cut tool (scissors).

9. Click the prop.

10. Click the portfolio, and then click New.

11. Click Get Rid Of The Changes.

12. Select a scene to create the new movie.

13. Click the Cut, Copy and Paste tools.

14. Click the Paste tool (glue bottle).

15. Click the scene where you want to paste the prop with the attached sound.

  The sound is added to the sound list in the new movie.

16. Click the Cut, Copy, and Paste tools.

17. Click the Remove 3D Object button (far right).

18. Click the prop to remove it.

The sound is now available in the sound list and can be saved as a permanent part
of the movie.

Method 3
--------

1. Click the appropriate sound effects button in your current movie.

2. Click the Find Sound Effects button in the lower left corner. (This button
  looks like the portfolio button).

3. Click the name of the movie that contains the sound you want to use.

4. Click OK. A list of all the imported and recorded sounds in that movie
  appears.

5. Click the sound you want to use. A short preview plays.

6. Click OK. The sound effects list for your current movie appears, and the new
  sound is added to the end of the list.
