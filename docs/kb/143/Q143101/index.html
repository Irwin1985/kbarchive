SUMMARY
=======

If the FrontPage Server Extensions are not available on the target Web server,
you can still use FrontPage to develop your Web pages. For example, you can
develop the Web by using the Microsoft Personal Web Server on your computer and
then transferring your Web content to the target Web server. Keep in mind that
when you do this, you may lose some features or experience some
incompatibilities between your working server and the target server. This
article discusses features to avoid if you are publishing your content to a
server on which you have not installed the FrontPage Server Extensions and how
to handle these incompatibilities.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your Web server and operating system are compatible with the FrontPage Server
Extensions, ask your service provider to install them. If the FrontPage Server
Extensions do not currently support your Web server and operating system, you
can submit a suggestion asking Microsoft to provide extensions for your server.
Microsoft welcomes suggestions or comments about changes in functionality and
product design. You are invited to submit suggestions by filling out the form at
the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/regwiz/regwiz.asp

NOTE: To determine whether your server and operating system are compatible With
the FrontPage Server Extensions, please see the following Microsoft World Wide
Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnservext/html/fpse02win.asp

Avoiding Browse-Time WebBot Components
--------------------------------------

Most WebBot components affect the Web only at authoring time. For example, a
WebBot Include component or WebBot Table of Contents component affects the page
it is on only when that page or some other page is created or modified. These
WebBot components are inactive at browse-time. However, some WebBot components,
especially those that are used with forms, rely on the FrontPage Server
Extensions at browse-time. If you are transferring your files to a Web server on
which the FrontPage Server Extensions are not installed, you should avoid using
the following WebBot components:

  WebBot Confirmation Field component
  WebBot Discussion component
  WebBot Guest Book component
  WebBot Registration component
  WebBot Save Results component
  WebBot Scheduled Image component
  WebBot Scheduled Include component
  WebBot Search component

If you use any of these WebBot components, customers who browse your Web Site may
receive an "HTTP 404" error when using the corresponding form.

Avoiding FrontPage Image Maps in FrontPage 1.0
----------------------------------------------

Image maps created with FrontPage 1.0 rely on the FrontPage Server Extensions at
browse-time. To avoid problems at browse-time, you should use The image map
utility that is supported by your Web server.

FrontPage 1.1 is capable of generating both client-side image maps and native
image maps for several server types. For more information about this feature,
click Web Settings on the Tools menu in FrontPage Explorer, and then click the
Advanced tab. When a browser is capable of using a client-side image map, it
will use this instead of a server-side image map.

Avoiding Server Incompatibilities
---------------------------------

If possible, develop your content on the same type of Web server that you are
using for your target Web server. If this is not possible, avoid
incompatibilities between your working server and your target server. Some
potential trouble areas include the following:

Access Control:

Access control does not carry over between Web servers of different types. You
will have to re-enter any access control information for the new server.

File Name Extensions:

Different Web servers may have different rules for mapping file name extensions
to Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types. For example, a
Windows-based server may recognize only .htm as HyperText Markup Language
(HTML), while a UNIX-based server may recognize only .html.

NOTE: You can reconfigure your working server to match the target server. The
FrontPage wizards and templates generate pages that have the .htm extension. If
possible, you should make sure that your target server recognizes the .htm
extension for HTML files.

Default Pages:

Different Web servers have different conventions for naming the default page. For
example, the CERN server recognizes Welcome.html (among others) by default,
while NCSA 1.4 recognizes Index.html. Note that you can reconfigure your working
server to match the target server. FrontPage will create the home page document
with whatever name the working server provides. For additional information about
configuring the default home page for the FrontPage Personal Web Server, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q150681 FP: How to Use a Document Other Than Index.htm as Default Page

Transferring the Content
------------------------

Once your content has been developed and tested on your working server, you can
copy or transfer the files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the target
server. The following files and folders should not be transferred:

All folders beginning with _vti_:

These folders contain information for use only when the FrontPage Server
Extensions are present.

Access Control Files:

These files vary depending on the type of Web server. In general, you should
remove all files that begin with a period if you are transferring files to a
UNIX server, and you should remove all files that begin with the number sign (#)
if you are moving files to a Windows-based server.

NOTE: If you are using FrontPage 1.1, you can obtain the Microsoft Web Publishing
Wizard to automate the FTP process. It will warn you if your Web contains files
that will not work on a server that does not have the FrontPage Server
Extensions. And, it will copy only the files that do work to the destination
server. You can download the Web Publishing Wizard from the following Microsoft
World Wide Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/webpost/
