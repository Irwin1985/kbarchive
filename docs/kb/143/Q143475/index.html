SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Server 4.0 System Key hotfix provides the capability to use
strong encryption techniques to increase protection of account password
information stored in the registry by the Security Account Manager (SAM).
Windows NT Server stores user account information, including a derivative of the
user account password, in a secure portion of the Registry protected by access
control and an obfuscation function. The account information in the Registry is
only accessible to members of the Administrators group. Windows NT Server, like
other operating systems, allows privileged users who are administrators access
to all resources in the system. For installations that want enhanced security,
strong encryption of account password derivative information provides an
additional level of security to prevent Administrators from intentionally or
unintentionally accessing password derivatives using Registry programming
interfaces.

NOTE: If you want to change where the SYSKEY key is stored, use the SYSKEY tool
do not modify the registry directly. If you modify the registry, SYSKEY will
work correctly but give the impression that it is not.

IMPORTANT: For important information about a security issue with the Syskey tool,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The strong encryption capability with the Windows NT 4.0 System Key hotfix is an
optional feature. Administrators may choose to implement strong encryption by
defining a System Key for Windows NT. Strong encryption protects private account
information by encrypting the password data using a 128-bit cryptographically
random key, known as a password encryption key.

Only the private password information is strongly encrypted in the database, not
the entire account database. Every system using the strong encryption option
will have a unique password encryption key. The password encryption key is
itself encrypted with a System Key. Strong password encryption may be used on
both Windows NT Server and Workstation where account information is stored.
Using strong encryption of account passwords adds additional protection for the
contents of the SAM portion of the registry and subsequent backup copies of the
registry information in the %systemroot%\repair directory created using the
RDISK command and on system backup tapes.

The System Key is defined using the command Syskey.exe. Only members of the
Administrators group can run the Syskey.exe command. The utility is used to
initialize or change the System Key. The System Key is the "master key" used to
protect the password encryption key and therefore protection of the System Key
is a critical system security operation.

There are three options for managing the System Key designed to meet the needs of
different Windows NT environments. The System Key options are the following:

- Use a machine-generated random key as the System Key and store the key on the
  local system using a complex obfuscation algorithm. This option provides
  strong encryption of password information in the registry and allows for
  unattended system restart.

- Use a machine-generated random key and store the key on a floppy disk. The
  floppy disk with the System Key is required for the system to start and must
  be inserted when prompted after Windows NT begins the startup sequence, but
  before the system is available for users to logon. The System Key is not
  stored anywhere on the local system.

- Use a password chosen by the Administrator to derive the System Key. Windows
  NT will prompt for the System Key password when the system is in the initial
  startup sequence, but before the system is available for users to logon. The
  System Key password is not stored anywhere on the system. An MD5 digest of
  the password is used as the master key to protect the password encryption
  key.

The System Key options using either a password or requiring a floppy disk
introduce a new prompt during the initialization of the Windows NT operating
system. They offer the strongest protection option available because master key
material is not stored on the system and control of the key can be restricted to
a few individuals. On the other hand, knowledge of the System Key password, or
possession of the System Key disk is required to boot the system. (If the System
Key is saved to a floppy disk, backup copies of the System Key disk are
recommended.) Unattended system restart may require that System Key material be
available to the system without Administrator response. Storing the System Key
on the local system using a complex obfuscation algorithm makes the key
available only to core operating system security components. In the future, it
will be possible to configure the System Key to obtain the key material from
tamper proof hardware components for maximum security.

WARNING: If the System Key password is forgotten or the System Key floppy disk is
lost, it may not be possible to start the system. Protect and store the System
Key information safely with backup copies in the event of emergency. The only
way to recover the system if the System Key is lost is using a repair disk to
restore the registry to a state prior to enabling strong encryption. See the
Repair Issues section below.

Strong encryption may be configured independently on the Primary and each Backup
Domain Controllers (DCs). Each domain controller will have a unique password
encryption key and a unique System Key. For example, the Primary DC may be
configured to use a machine generated System Key stored on a disk, and Backup
DCs may each use a different machine generated System Key stored on the local
system. A machine generated System Key stored locally on a Primary domain
controller is not replicated.

Before enabling strong encryption for Primary domain controllers, you may want to
ensure a complete updated Backup domain controller is available to use as a
backup system until changes to the Primary domain are complete and verified.
Before enabling strong encryption on any system, Microsoft recommends making a
fresh copy of the Emergency Repair Disk, including the security information in
the registry, using the command, RDISK /S. Please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base prior to using RDISK /S:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q122857
  TITLE : RDISK /S and RDISK /S- Options in Windows NT

The SYSKEY command is used to select the System Key option and generate the
initial key value. The key value may be either a machine generated key or a
password derived key. The SYSKEY command first displays a dialog showing whether
strong encryption is enabled or disabled. After the strong encryption capability
is enabled, it cannot be disabled. To enable strong authentication of the
account database, select the option "Encryption Enabled", and click OK. A
confirm dialog appears reminding the administrator to make an updated emergency
repair disk. A new dialog appears presenting options for the Account Database
Key. Use the options available on Account Database Key dialog to select the
System Key.

After selecting the System Key option, Windows NT must be restarted for the
System Key option to take effect. When the system restarts, the administrator
may be prompted to enter the System Key, depending on the key option chosen.
Windows NT detects the first use of the System Key and generates a new random
password encryption key. The password encryption key is protected with the
System Key, and then all account password information is strongly encrypted.

The SYSKEY command needs to be run on each system where strong encryption of the
account password information is required. SYSKEY supports a "-l" command option
to generate the master key and store the key locally on the system. This option
enables strong password encryption in the registry and allows the command to run
without an interactive dialog. The SYSKEY command can be used at a later time to
change the System Key options from one method to another, or to change the
System Key to a new key. Changing the System Key requires knowledge of, or
possession of, the current System Key. If the password derived System Key option
is used, SYSKEY does not enforce a minimum password length, however long
passwords (greater than 12 characters) are recommended. The maximum System Key
password length is 128 characters.

SYSKEY should be applied to all domain controllers. If this is not done, the SAM
on the backup domain controllers (BDCs) will not be as secure as that on the
primary domain controller (PDC). Thus, the point of installing SYSKEY would be
defeated.

REPAIR ISSUES
-------------

Introduction of strong encryption of account password information changes the
SYSTEM and SAM portions of the registry in ways that affect the repair options
available for recovery of a Windows NT system. Always use the RDISK command with
the /S option to create a new Emergency Repair Disk including a backup copy of
the SYSTEM and SAM portion of the registry in the \Repair folder.

For complete recovery options, the following Emergency Repair Disks should be
available:

- Prior to installing the System Key hotfix, create a fresh repair disk. This
  disk is a "pre-hotfix" repair disk that contains a copy of the system
  configuration and account information prior to installation of the hotfix.
  The "pre-hotfix" repair disk may be used to recover the registry and system
  files using the Windows NT distribution CDROM.

- After installation of the System Key hotfix, but before enabling strong
  encryption using the SYSKEY command, create a repair disk. This repair disk
  is "hotfix - Before Encryption". This repair disk can be used to repair the
  Registry to the state before strong encryption is enabled, for example it may
  be used to recover a system if the Windows NT System Key is lost or
  forgotten.

- After running SYSKEY to enable strong encryption, create a repair disk. This
  repair disk is "hotfix - After Encryption". This repair disk, and subsequent
  updates to this repair disk, can be used to recover the registry with strong
  encryption intact using the System Key in effect at the time the repair disk
  was last updated.

The System Key hotfix support for strong encryption affects the following system
components:

- SYSTEM and SAM registry hives

- Three system security component files: Winlogon.exe, Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll

In general, the repair process needs to use matching versions of these
components. Whatever repair option you choose, the repair process will
coordinate repair of the registry hives with the matching system files.

The following table lists the recovery options available.

                                           was made.

In the event that an Administrator needs to repair the system after the System
Key hotfix is installed, both the SYSTEM and SAM portions of the registry need
to be repaired at the same time. The System Key option in the SYSTEM portion of
the registry must match the strong encryption key used for the SAM portion of
the registry. If one registry hive is repaired without the other, it may be
possible for the system to try to use a different System Key option (password
derived or machine generated) that does not match the strong encryption key used
for the account password information.

Installation of the System Key hotfix will update the checksums for the system
security component (Winlogon.exe, Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll) in the System.log
file. The System.log file is saved on the Emergency Repair Disk. The System.log
file is used during recovery to determine if the files need to be updated from
the Windows NT Server 4.0 CD-ROM to match the pre-hotfix registry configuration.
If the desired recovery system configuration is Windows NT Server 4.0 with the
System Key hotfix, you will not be asked to repair these system security files.

After installing the System Key hotfix, and you have not enabled strong
encryption, if you attempt to repair the system files using a repair disk
created before installing the System Key hotfix (that is, using the "pre-
hotfix" repair disk) you also MUST repair the SYSTEM and SAM registry. If you do
not repair the registry, the system files and registry format will not match.
You will get an error (error number C00000DF) when you attempt to log on. When
the registry and system files are mismatched, the recovery procedure is to
repair matching system and registry files. Either repair the registry hives from
the same "pre-hotfix" repair disk, or use the "hotfix - Before Encryption"
repair disk, which has a registry format that matches the System Key hotfix
system files.

Finally, if you have a situation where the system security files (Winlogon,
Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll) are corrupted, then you must recover the system using a
"Pre-hotfix" repair disk and repair the corrupted files from a Windows NT Server
4.0 CD-ROM. You must also repair the SYSTEM and SAM registry hives to match the
system files from the "Pre-hotfix" repair disk.

Current United States export regulations allow the use of 128-bit encryption keys
to be used to protect authentication data, such as passwords. The encryption
keys used for Syskey are specific to the protection of passwords stored in SAM
and the Security portion of the registry. There are no application APIs
available for using 128-bit Syskey encryption for general-purpose data
protection.

In Windows 2000 and later operating systems, Syskey is enabled automatically, and
may not be disabled. The only option available for modification is to move the
startup key to a floppy disk rather than using local storage.
