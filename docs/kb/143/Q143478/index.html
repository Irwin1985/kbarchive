-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

A Stop 0x0000000A occurs in Tcpip.sys when receiving Out of Band (OOB) data.

CAUSE
=====

A sender specifies "Out of Band" data by setting the URGENT bit flag in the TCP
header. The receiver uses the URGENT POINTER to determine where in the segment
the urgent data ends. Windows NT bugchecks when the URGENT POINTER points to the
end of the frame and no normal data follows. Windows NT expects normal data to
follow.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated Tcpip.sys to correct the problem. Instructions for
installing it are available from Microsoft support channels, or directly from
the Internet locations below.

NOTE: This hotfix was originally posted on May 12, 1997. A subsequent fix was
