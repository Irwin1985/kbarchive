IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Microsoft PowerPoint Animation Player for ActiveX to view
PowerPoint presentations complete with animation and sound effects in a 32-bit
Web browser. This player has two parts: the Player (Axplayer.exe) and the
Publisher (Axpub.exe).

If you install the Player, you will be able to view the animation in a PowerPoint
presentation posted on the Web. If you install the Publisher, you can also
create your own animated presentations for the Web using PowerPoint 95.

The files Axpub.exe and Axplayer.exe are now available from Microsoft. For
information about obtaining these files, see the "To Obtain These Files" section
of this article.

Description of Axplayer.exe
---------------------------

If you choose to download just the Animation Player, you get a self-extracting
Setup program named Axplayer.exe. Double-click this file to install the
following files to your \Program Files\Common Files\ActiveX Animation Player
folder:

  Readme.txt       1KB
  Surge.exe    1,271KB
  Surgprox.dll    37KB
  Uninst.exe      56KB

If you have Netscape Navigator installed, the following file is installed to the
Netscape plugins folder:

  Npsurge.dll     27KB

Description of Axpub.exe
------------------------

Axpub.exe is a self-extracting file that runs a Setup program. When you
double-click this file, all of the files included with Axplayer.exe are
installed as well as these three files:

  Surge.ppa       96KB
  Surgeui.dll     60KB
  Template.htm     1KB

If you do not have PowerPoint 95 installed on your system, Axpub.exe will only
install the player files.

Registry Entries
----------------

PowerPoint depends on registration entries to find the Animation Player files in
order to provide you with the ability to convert PowerPoint slides to Web pages.
The entries are just like what you find for other add-ins which is how
PowerPoint knows to add this feature to the File menu.

You'll find a key in the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER that tells the location
of the surge.ppa file and the initial function within that file.

  \Software\Microsoft\Office\PowerPoint\7.0\Addins\Surge

     Initfunction  DeNileMain
     Path          C:\Program Files\Common Files\ActiveX Animation
                        Player\surge.ppa

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
