<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q32271
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
Operating System(s): MS-DOS
Keyword(s): ENDUSER | B_BasicCom | mspl13_basic
Last Modified: 20-AUG-1990

The following information applies to QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for
MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

Passing an element of a FIELDed array to a subprogram unFIELDs the
array, preventing the array from accessing the random file buffer.

QuickBASIC Versions 3.00 and earlier do not unFIELD the array and
allow you to access the random file buffer.

The program below works without modification in QuickBASIC Versions
3.00 and earlier. The program needs to be modified (to pass the array
elements by value or by a temporary variable) in QuickBASIC Versions
4.00 and later because arrays are handled differently.

For QuickBASIC Versions 4.00 and later, when an array element is
passed to a subprogram or function, the array element is copied to a
temporary variable and passed to the subprogram. Upon returning from
the subprogram, the temporary variable value is assigned to the array
element. This process is performed in case the array moves during the
execution of the subprogram or function; it also "unFIELDs" the array.

Please note that in all versions of BASIC, FIELDed variables are
"special" and have limited use. For example, you are not allowed to
say INPUT B$, where B$ is a FIELDed variable. You also cannot say
B$="test" and must instead say LSET B$="test" or RSET B$="test".

This change in how the arrays are handled may affect any program that
uses FIELDed arrays, including those applications that use Btrieve (a
file-management system developed by SoftCraft, Inc.; Btrieve was later
taken over by Novell, Inc.).

The easiest workaround is to pass a temporary variable instead of an
array element in the CALL statement.

Another workaround for this problem is to put parentheses around the
variable being passed in the CALL statement, thus causing it to be
passed by value rather than by reference. An array passed by value is
not unFIELDed. For example, the Code Example farther below could be
changed as follows:

   CALL TEST((a$(i)))

However, a disadvantage of passing by value is that if variables are
large (such as a large string length), they could consume stack space
quickly, possible leading to "Out of Stack Space" or "Out of Memory".

The following code example demonstrates the unFIELDing of the array
A$().

    DIM A$(2)
    OPEN "TEST.DAT" AS #1
    FIELD #1, 10 AS A$(0), 10 AS A$(1), 10 AS A$(2)
    K = 65
    FOR J = 1 to 2
       FOR I = 0 TO 2
        LSET A$(I)=STRING$(10,K)
        K = K + 1
       NEXT I
       PUT#1, j
    NEXT J
    CLOSE #1

    OPEN "TEST.DAT" AS #1
    FIELD #1, 10 AS A$(0), 10 AS A$(1), 10 AS A$(2)
    FOR J = 1 to 2
      GET#1, J
      FOR I = 0 to 2
          CALL TEST(a$(i))
      NEXT I
      print
    NEXT J
    END

    SUB TEST(b$) STATIC
      PRINT b$
    END SUB

The output is as follows:

   AAAAAAAA
   BBBBBBBB
   CCCCCCCC

   AAAAAAAA
   BBBBBBBB
   CCCCCCCC

As a workaround, the following modification can be made to the program
to receive the desired output:

   GET#1, J
   FOR I = 0 to 2
       temp$=a$(i)
       CALL TEST(temp$)
       LSET a$(i)=temp$
   NEXT I

The correct output is as follows:

   AAAAAAAA
   BBBBBBBB
   CCCCCCCC

   DDDDDDDD
   EEEEEEEE
   FFFFFFFF
