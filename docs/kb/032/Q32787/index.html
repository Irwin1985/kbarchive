Page 156 of the "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.0: BASIC Language Reference"
for Versions 4.00 and 4.00b and the "Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.0:
BASIC Language Reference" for Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and
MS OS/2 correctly states that an array dimension can have subscripts
from -32,768 to 32,767. This is also stated on Page 103 of the
"Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Language Reference" manual for Microsoft BASIC
Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00. For example DIM
Z%(-2000 TO 3000), which has 5001 elements, is legal.

However, these pages fail to mention that the TOTAL NUMBER of elements
in any one dimension of an array cannot exceed 32,767 (32K minus one).
For example, the following DIM statements are not allowed because they
make an array with more than 32,767 elements in one dimension:

   DIM X(-10000 TO 25000)  ' 35,001 elements is too many.
   DIM A%(0 TO 32767)  ' 32,768 elements is one too many.

To make an array that exceeds 32,767 total elements, you must
dimension it with two or more dimensions (making sure that no one
dimension has more than 32,767 elements; you must also compile with
the /AH option).

Below is an explanation of array usages that could give one of the
following errors:

   "Overflow," "Math Overflow," "Subscript Out of Range,"
   "Array Too Big," "Out of Memory"

To dimension an array larger than 64K, you must make the array dynamic
and compile with the /AH (huge array) option, as in the following
example:

   REM This program must be compiled with the /AH option
   ' $DYNAMIC
   OPTION BASE 1
   DIM A%(20000, 2)  ' 40000 elements, taking 80000 bytes in memory.
   DIM B%(20000, 4)  ' 80000 elements, taking 160000 bytes in memory.

The following is a list of array-related error messages and their
possible causes:

1. Compiling an array that has a subscript larger than +32,767 or
   smaller than -32,768 in the DIM statement causes an "Overflow"
   error in the QB.EXE editor. If you compile it with BC.EXE, you
   receive a "Math Overflow" error, as follows:

      ' $DYNAMIC
      DIM s%(33000)  ' produces "overflow" error in QB.EXE editor
                        ' and "math overflow" error in BC.EXE.

2. A "Subscript out of range" error occurs in the QB.EXE editor at
   run time if you DIMension more than 32,767 elements in one
   dimension, as in the following example (invoke QB /AH):

      ' $DYNAMIC
      DIM X%(-10000 TO 25000) ' Cannot use 35,000 elements in
                                 ' one dimension.

   Compiling the above program with BC.EXE does not cause a compile
   error, but gives a "Subscript Out of Range" error at run time in
   the .EXE program. (Be sure to compile with the BC /D (debug) option
   to properly trap array-bounds errors.)

   Note that if the array has exactly 32,768 elements, the error will
   not occur on the DIM statement in QB.EXE or a compiled .EXE program;
   the error will occur only when an array element is used later:

   REM $DYNAMIC
   DIM Y%(0 TO 32767)  ' Cannot use 32768 elements in one dimension.
   PRINT Y%(2000)  ' "Subscript Out of Range" occurs here, not on DIM.

3. An "Array Too Big" or "Subscript Out of Range" error will
   display if the array exceeds 64K, is not dynamic, and was not
   compiled with the /AH option. You must either make the array
   dynamic and compile with /AH or make the array smaller than 64K.
   If a dynamic array is larger than 128K, its array elements must
   have a size that is a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,
   512, etc.) so that array elements do not overlap on boundaries
   that are divisible by 64K.

4. An "Out of Memory" error means you have exceeded available RAM
   at run time. You should reduce the size of arrays or code, or
   try running the program as an .EXE program instead of inside the
   QB.EXE environment. You can use the FRE function to determine
   run-time memory usage.

Note that QuickBASIC Versions 2.00, 2.01, and 3.00 are limited to
arrays that do not exceed 64K in size or 32,767 elements per
dimension.

Note: 1K is equal to 1024 bytes.
