-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After receiving spoofed connection request (SYN) packets over TCP/IP, a computer
running Windows 95 may begin to operate slowly. After about one minute, Windows
returns to normal operation.

This problem may occur with TCP/IP on other operating systems as well.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs due to "Land Attack." Land Attack sends SYN packets with
the same source and destination IP addresses and the same source and destination
ports to a host computer. This makes it appear as if the host computer sent the
packets to itself. Windows 95 operates more slowly while the host computer tries
to respond to itself.

==========
