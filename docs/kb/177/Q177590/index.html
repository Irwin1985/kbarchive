-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access for Windows 95, version 7.0 
- Microsoft Access 97 
- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 
- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup wizard
or the Microsoft Access 7.0 Developer's Toolkit (ADT) to create a custom Setup
program, and you include a database file name on the screen that asks

  Do you want to run an executable file after your custom Setup program is
  completed?

you may receive the following error message when you run your custom Setup
program on any computer:

  Setup was not completed successfully

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the custom Setup program cannot find or open the
executable file (Msaccess.exe) that was specified in the "Enter or edit the
command line that is used to run the executable file:" text box.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve this behavior by using one of the following methods. Both of
these methods are described in detail later in this article.

- Modify the Setup wizard program to include the correct path to the executable
  file.

- Modify the SETUP.STF file to include the correct path to the executable
  file.

  NOTE: Modifications to an STF file should be made using a backup copy of the
  file and following the procedures outlined in the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q111248 OFF: Saving .STF File in Excel May Cause Setup Error Messages


Modifying the Setup Wizard Program
----------------------------------

1. Start the Setup wizard program.

2. Modify the "Enter or edit the command line that will be used to run the
  executable file:" text box to include a valid path. For example, if you are
  adding a line similar to the following to the command line

  "$(Filepath)\msaccess.exe" /runtime FilePath)\Northwind.mdb"

  you should change it to the following:

  "\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\msaccess.exe" /runtime
  "$(FilePath)\Northwind.mdb"

3. Recreate your disk images.

4. Rerun your custom setup program.

Modifying the SETUP.STF File
----------------------------

NOTE: This procedure makes changes to the SETUP.STF file, which is not supported
by Microsoft. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without warranty of
any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.

1. Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file located in your DISK1 folder (or the
  network folder if you chose a Network Setup), and name the backup copy
  SETUPSTF.BAK.

2. Open the SETUP.STF file that the Setup wizard program creates using Microsoft
  Excel.

3. Modify the line that contains the custom command line. For example, if the
  CustomAction for the command line reads as follows

  "msacccah.dll","AsyncEXECalloutCAH","""%1325\msaccess.exe""
  ""/runtime"" ""%1325\Northwind.mdb"""

  you should change it to the following:

   In Microsoft Access 97
   ----------------------

    "msacccah.dll","AsyncEXECalloutCAH","""\Program Files\Microsoft Office\msaccess.exe"" ""/runtime"" ""%1325\Northwind.mdb"""

    Note that in the example, you are modifying the first reference to
    "%1325" with "\Program Files\Microsoft Office".

   In Microsoft Access 7.0
   -----------------------

    "msacccah.dll","SyncEXECalloutCAH","""\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Microsoft Access Runtime\msaccess.exe"" ""/runtime""""%1325\Northwind.mdb"""

Note that in the example, you are modifying the first part of the command that reads as

"%825" with "\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Microsoft Access Runtime".

1. Close and save the SETUP.STF file.

  NOTE: Make sure that you replace the existing SETUP.STF file by specifying the
  correct folder for the newly saved file.

2. Rerun your custom Setup program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit 7.0 Setup wizard or the Microsoft
  Office 97 Developer Edition Tools Setup wizard, create a custom Setup program
  that includes the sample database Northwind.mdb.

2. On the screen that asks

  Do you want to run an executable file after your custom Setup program is
  completed?

  enter the Northwind database as the file that you want to run after setup
  completes.

3. Type the following command line in the "Enter or edit command line that will
  be used to run the executable file.":

  "$(AppPath)MSACCESS.EXE" /runtime "$(FilePath)\Northwind.mdb"

4. Click to select the "Allow Setup to Complete Before the File Finishes
  Executing" check box.

5. Create your disk images and install them on any computer. Note that you
  receive the message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.

NOTE: This means you may need two copies of your run-time application: one copy
for those computers that have the retail version of Microsoft Access, and one
copy for those computers that do not have the retail version.
