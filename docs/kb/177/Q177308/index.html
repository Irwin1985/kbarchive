-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following are symptoms of this issue:

  Slow client logons (up to 10 minutes or more) during peak logon hours or even
  relatively slow logons for solitary or small group logons.

  In the Windows NT Performance Monitor (PerfMon), Process, % CPU utilization,
  DSAMAIN.EXE (DS) will sustain a very high CPU utilization percentage (75% or
  more) throughout the peak logon periods. In addition, the DS may jump up high
  for relatively long times (1-4 minutes) for solitary or small group logons
  (~5).

  Enabling the Directory Service logging, ExDS interface logging to maximum will
  log numerous "ds_read entered" and "ds_read completed" events (1136 and 1137,
  respectively). Also, enabling maximum MAPI interface, logs NspiBind events
  (1136 - client and otherwise).

  A network trace between the Exchange client and server may show that a long
  time elapses between when the first RPC OpNum2 request to the store's GUID is
  issued, and when the server actually returns an RPC response to this request.

CAUSE
=====

When the client logs on, a comparison between the existence of one-off address
templates in the directory, and the Address-Types in the ODI cache of the store
is performed. If an address-type exists in the ODI cache, but a corresponding
address template does not exist in the DS, a flag is set to reload the ODI
cache. The cache is reloaded, but the flag is never reset, so a cache reload is
continually signaled.

The logon process is serialized behind this cache reload.

This can noticeably impact logon if:

1. There are many non-native Exchange address-types, or if a particular
  non-native Exchange address type has many entries in the Microsoft Exchange
  Administrator program under:

  &lt;org&gt;/&lt;local-sitename&gt;/Configuration/Site Addressing/Routing tab

2. No address template is installed in the site for this address-type.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

- Make sure that there is a one-off addressing template installed within the
  site for any non-native Exchange address-type.

- Examine \exchsrvr\mtadata\GWART0.MTA to derive a list of unique address
  types.

- View the list of installed one-off address templates under:

  &lt;org&gt;/&lt;local-sitename&gt;/Configuration/Addressing/One-off Address
  Templates/&lt;language&gt;

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service

MORE INFORMATION
================

A code change has been implemented to discriminate between the cases when an
address template is "not found" versus the case when "an error occurred looking
for an address template". The reload flag is no longer signaled for the former
case.

This case involved a single-server Exchange version 4.0 site that had replicated
with the rest of the organization, which included a mix of Exchange 4.0 and 5.0
sites and servers. One of the 5.0 sites had implemented a CCMAIL connector to an
extensive cc:Mail installation. This resulted in many CCMAIL routes being added
into the routing table (GWART). These routing entries were replicated throughout
the organization.

Exchange 5.0 supports the CCMAIL address-type as a native Exchange address- type,
and includes a One-off Address template for this address-type. Exchange 4.0 does
not support the CCMAIL address-type as a native Exchange address-type. The
solitary Exchange 4.0 Site did not have a CCMAIL One-off Address template
installed, thus logons within this site experienced this inefficiency.
