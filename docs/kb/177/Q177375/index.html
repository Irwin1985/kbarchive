-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Some messages contain partial MIME headers with UUEncoded bodyparts. In the case
of a CONTENT-TYPE header being present (without a full MIME version header), the
Microsoft Exchange Server will assume the message to be MIME and will not decode
the UUEncoded bodyparts.

CAUSE
=====

This is because the registry fix detailed in the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base article applied to partial headers in top-level messages only and not
within embedded messages:

  Q175704 XFOR: IMS Failing to Decode Uuencoded Attachments

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue is an extension of the issue detailed in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

  Q175704 XFOR: IMS Failing to Decode Uuencoded Attachments

where UUEncoded bodyparts within a message received via the Microsoft Exchange
Internet Mail Service are not decoded into an attachment. Instead, they are left
as UUEncoded text within the message.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To correct this problem, apply the fix described above and follow these steps:

1. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor. Use Regedt32.exe if you are running
  Windows NT 3.51 and either Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe for Windows NT 4.0.

2. Create the following registry value:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ 
  ParametersSystem\InternetContent

  Value Name: ContentTypeEQMimeVer
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 0 or 1 (default is 1)

3. Exit Registry Editor. Stop and restart the Microsoft Exchange Information
  Store for the change to take effect.

Setting this value to 1 means that if a top-level Content-Type header is found in
an inbound Internet Message, the message is treated as a MIME message even if a
MIME Version header is missing.

The problem occurs when embedded messages contain MIME headers without the MIME
version header being present.
