SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the error messages you might encounter as you install
DirectX. DirectX a suite of components that enhance performance by accessing
hardware features directly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DirectX uses Dsetup.dll to control the installation of DirectX. If there is a
problem during installation, you can use the following error codes to begin to
diagnose the problem. For some error messages, suggestions for troubleshooting
are provided.

(SETUP_SUCCESS-RESTART) Setup of DirectX 5.0 was successful and Setup prompts for
a restart of the computer. This message should not be displayed.

0
-

(SETUP_SUCCESS) Setup of DirectX 5.0 was successful. This message should not be
displayed.

-1
--

(BADWINDOWSVERSION) DirectX cannot be run on this version of Windows. This
version of Windows is either Windows 3.x or a version of Windows NT that does
not support this version of DirectX. Please do not attempt to install DirectX
except in these operating systems.

DirectX is designed to work with Windows 95 or later and Windows NT 4.0 and later
only.

This error message can also occur if the computer hardware is incompatible with
this version of DirectX. For example, the NEC PC-98 is supported by DirectX 5.0,
but the PC-98 drivers folder is required for installation.

-2
--

(SOURCEFILENOTFOUND) Setup could not find one of the DirectX files it is trying
to install in its source folder.

This error message may occur if you remove the CD-ROM containing the DirectX
Setup files. Replace the CD-ROM and restart the installation of DirectX.

-3
--

(BADSOURCESIZE) Setup detected a file it was attempting to install with a
different size from the file shipped with DirectX 5.0.

A file may be damaged. Check with the provider of DirectX (such as the game
manufacturer if DirectX came on a CD-ROM). If you downloaded DirectX, download
the DirectX files again. You can download DirectX from Microsoft for free from
the following Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp

Run Setup again.

-4
--

(BADSOURCETIME) Setup detected a file it was attempting to install with a
different date from the file shipped with DirectX 5.0.

A file may be damaged. Check with the provider of DirectX (such as the game
manufacturer if DirectX came on a CD-ROM). If you downloaded DirectX, download
the DirectX files again. You can download DirectX from Microsoft for free from
the following Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp

Run Setup again.

-5
--

(NOCOPY) Setup was unable to copy a file.

The DirectX source disk may not be available. A file may be damaged. Run Setup
again.

-6
--

(OUTOFDISKSPACE) Setup detected there was not enough disk space to install
DirectX 5.0.

Attempt to install to a different drive, or clear space from your destination
drive and run DirectX Setup again.

-7
--

(CANTFINDINF) Setup could not find one of the .inf files used to install DirectX
5.0 (for example, the Directx.inf or Ddraw.inf file).

The DirectX source disk may not be available. A file may be damaged. Run Setup
again.

-8
--

(CANTFINDDIR) Setup could not find a folder needed to install DirectX 5.0.

Verify that the source folder still exists and is available for the DirectX
installation files. If not, download DirectX and Run Setup again.

-9
--

(INTERNAL) Setup detected an internal error. There are only two situations known
to cause this error message:

- Dsetup.dll could not load the Dsetup32.dll and Dsetup16.dll files.

- Setup attempted to call a unicode version of Setup Advanced Programming
  Interfaces (APIs), which are not implemented.

If you receive this error message, rename the Dsetup16.dll and Dsetup32.dll
files. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. Type the following line in the Named box, and then click Find Now:

  dsetup16.dll

3. Click the file, and then click Rename on the File menu.

4. Change the name to a .dxx extension. The file name should read as follows:

  Dsetup16.dxx

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the Dsetup32.dll file.

6. Reinstall DirectX.

(NOTPREINSTALLEDONNT) Setup detected that it could not install DirectX in Windows
NT because it did not detect an earlier version previously installed. Setup
checks the version of Windows NT, and if it detects Windows NT 4.0 or later, it
expects an earlier version of DirectX to be previously installed.

-14
---

DirectX Installation Error -14

Error -14 is generated when trying to install on a system with the same or later
version of DirectX already installed.
