SUMMARY
=======

This article covers some basic concepts and tips needed for reading SPX traces.
The trace analysis is done with Network Monitor, so you may see different
results with Network General Sniffer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SPX is connection-oriented network protocols that ride on top of IPX. Programs
that need connection oriented data connection can use this protocol.

A good example is Lotus Notes.

SPX Header
----------

The SPX header is 12 bytes long. A packet type of 0x5 in the IPX packet indicates
that the packet uses SPX for transport.

SPX header has the following fields:

+---------------------------------------+
| Connection Control        | (1 Byte)  | 
+---------------------------------------+
| DataStream Type           | (1 Byte)  | 
+---------------------------------------+
| Source Connection ID      | (2 Bytes) | 
+---------------------------------------+
| Destination Connection ID | (2 Bytes) | 
+---------------------------------------+
| Sequence Number           | (2 Bytes) | 
+---------------------------------------+
| Acknowledgment Number     | (2 Bytes) | 
+---------------------------------------+
| Allocation Number         | (2 Bytes) | 
+---------------------------------------+

Connection Control
------------------

Connection Control is equivalent to the TCP flags in functionality. Connection
control controls the bi-directional flow of data, congestion control, and so
forth. The connection control field can have the following values. These values
can be logical or together to set multiple flags.

End-of-Message (0x10):

Indicates the end of message to the transmission partner. Because SPX is a
message-based transport protocol, the sending side sets this flag to indicate
the message is complete. After the receiving side gets this packet, it will pass
the data in the message buffer to the application above. This flag is also set
during a session disconnection.

Acknowledgment required (0x40):

Data has been sent and acknowledgment is required. This is an indication to the
transmission partner that an acknowledgment is needed for this packet before
more data can be sent.

System Packet (0x80):

This is an acknowledgment packet. It is used internally by the SPX protocol to
confirm if the session partner is up and running on an idle session.

DataStream Type
---------------

This field indicates the type of data contained within the packet. It can be set
to a defined number by the application through Winsock. The main purpose of this
field is to provide a mechanism for graceful session disconnection. By default,
it has one of the following values:

End-of-Connection (0xFE):

Generated to indicate that a session partner wishes to terminate a session

End-of-Connection (0xFF):

Transmitted upon receipt of an End-of-Connection request.

Source and Destination Connection ID
------------------------------------

These are two bytes fields, they are used to de-multiplex SPX sessions over a
single socket at the IPX level. Because the sender does not know the destination
connection ID during the initial connection, the destination connection ID will
be set to 0XFFFF.

Sequence Number
---------------

Sequence number is a 2 byte field that contains the count of data packets
transmitted. This number will increase only after receiving an acknowledgment
for a data packet transmitted.

Acknowledge Number
------------------

The acknowledge number field indicates the value of the sequence number expected
in the next SPX packet from the SPX partner.

Allocation Number
-----------------

The allocation number field indicates the number of receive buffers available at
a workstation. Normally, you should see the allocation number larger then the
acknowledge number. The number of free buffers available is calculated as Window
size.

  Window size = Allocation number - Acknowledge Number + 1.

This field is used as a flow control mechanism. When the receiving side sends an
allocation number that is lower than the acknowledgment number, the sender
should not send any more data and wait until the receiving side sends a packet
with an allocation number greater than the acknowledge number.

Example of Establishing a Connection
------------------------------------

The Network Monitor trace shown below shows the sequence for a successful session
initialization. Notice that the destination connection ID is set to 0xFFFF, and
the allocation number is 0xFFFF. This sequence of packets is called an SPX
handshake.

SPX: ConCtrl = 0xC0, DtaStrm = 0x00, 0xE8A2 -&gt; 0xFFFF, Seq = 0, Ack = 0, Alloc
= 65535

SPX: ConCtrl = 0x80, DtaStrm = 0x00, 0x9774 -&gt; 0xE8A2, Seq = 0, Ack = 0, Alloc
= 3

Example of Normal Data Flow
---------------------------

The Network Monitor trace shown below, shows a successful data transmission.
Notice, how the Seq and ACK relate, also notice that the allocation number
(Alloc) is always more than the ACK.

SPX: ConCtrl = 0x80, DtaStrm = 0x00, 0xE8A2 -&gt; 0x9774, Seq = 7, Ack = 8, Alloc
= 9
SPX: ConCtrl = 0x50, DtaStrm = 0x00, 0x9774 -&gt; 0xE8A2, Seq = 8, Ack = 7, Alloc
= 10
SPX: ConCtrl = 0x80, DtaStrm = 0x00, 0xE8A2 -&gt; 0x9774, Seq = 7, Ack = 9, Alloc
= 10
SPX: ConCtrl = 0xC0, DtaStrm = 0x00, 0x9774 -&gt; 0xE8A2, Seq = 9, Ack = 7, Alloc
= 10

Example of a Graceful Session Closed
------------------------------------

The Network Monitor trace shown below shows a successful session termination
sequence. Notice that the DtaStrm field is set to indicate the end of connection
request and response.

SPX: ConCtrl = 0x50, DtaStrm = End of Connection Req., 0xE8A2 -&gt; 0x9774, Seq =
10, Ack = 10, Alloc = 12

SPX: ConCtrl = 0x00, DtaStrm = End of Connection Resp., 0x9774 -&gt; 0xE8A2, Seq
= 10, Ack = 11, Alloc = 14

General Tips for Reading SPX Traces
-----------------------------------

The tips below can be helpful to narrow down problems.

- You may see multiple session ID coming from the same computer. Try to isolate
  the trace for a particular session ID to verify if it is normal.

- Look for the number of hops and the physical layer Ethernet vs Token Ring.
  The problem may be related to routers in between or the packet size. Remember
  that SPX does not do packet negotiation.

- Look for the allocation number and verify that it is larger then the
  acknowledge number. This to verify that we are not running any of the buffer
  overflow problem. This mostly happens with 16-bit real-mode clients.

- Check for any retransmission of data packets. Normally a retransmission
  problem will show up as a performance issue. Check for the Time Delta in
  between the Data and ACK packet to check if there is time latency.

Limitations of the SPX protocol
-------------------------------

Although SPX provides a connection-oriented transport, SPX does have several
limitations.

- Only one packet can be outstanding at any time.

- SPX-based communication does not do any packet negotiation.

NOTE: The above limitations apply only to the SPX protocol. SPX II is an advanced
version of SPX with the following improvements:

- SPX II uses the maximum packet size allowable on the network. Example 1518
  bytes on Ethernet (SPX has a 576-byte maximum).

- SPX II Windowing allows multiple outstanding packets and is able to transmit
  a negative acknowledgment (NAK) to indicate some packets were not received.

- SPX II allows packet size negotiation. A Negotiate Size Request packet can be
  sent at any time in the communications process if packets are not getting
  through to the destination.
