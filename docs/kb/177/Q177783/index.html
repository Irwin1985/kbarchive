The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Generating an Offline Address Book (OAB) on a drive that has low disk space will
fail, leaving the drive with temp files related to this unsuccessful operation.

When you generate the OAB within the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program,
temporary files are created. Running this task on Microsoft Windows NT Server
causes these files to be created on the system drive of the server or in the
location to which the Administrator points the %temp% and %tmp% environment
variables.

If the directory service is large and low disk space conditions are encountered
on the server, an error may occur and you may receive the following error
message:

  An error occurred while generating the offline Address Book. To view
  details, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer
  on the offline Address Book Server.

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no. c1031662

The following information is written in the application log in the Windows NT
Event Viewer:

  Event ID 5004 Generation of the offline Address Book is complete.
  Result: An error occurred.

WORKAROUND
==========

The remaining temp files are not automatically deleted and must be deleted
manually. If temp files still remain, repeat the operation to complete. It is
commonly expected that temporary files associated with failed attempts would be
deleted, but in this case, they are not.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
