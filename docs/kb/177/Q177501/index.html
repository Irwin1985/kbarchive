-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an application component was tested, the code page for English (United
States) was used for character translation, but the Language Locale attribute
specified in the Remote Environment (RE) Properties page was French (Standard).
The default code pages were selected for both Language Locales.

CAUSE
=====

The RE was created with the Language Locale attribute set to English. A
component was assigned to this RE and tested. After this test, the Language
Locale in the RE was changed to French (Standard) and the component was tested
again. However, the new French code page was not used and the application did
not work properly.

Changes to locale and code page attributes for a Remote Environment will not take
effect until all run-time activity is stopped.

Specifically, locale and code page attributes of an RE can be changed using the
COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) Management Console on the Locale property
page. When the user updates these attributes, the COMTI Management Console
immediately saves the updated values in the Windows NT registry. However, these
updated values are not loaded by the COMTI run-time elements if components
assigned to the RE are being used.

WORKAROUND
==========

To ensure that the COMTI run-time elements use modified locale and code page
information, locate the My Computer item in the Microsoft Transaction Server
folder and issue the Shut Down Server Processes command. This will stop the
COMTI run-time elements and force a reload of the updated RE information from
the Windows NT registry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 4.0. A supported fix
is now available for SNA Server 4.0, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that
you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Product Support Services for more information.
