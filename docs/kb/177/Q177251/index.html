The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft Exchange Server information store starts, two public folder
(PF) replication status messages are sent. If Replication Outgoing Messages
logging is set to max in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, you will
see the following Event IDs in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application log:

  This is a status message for the public folder hierarchy, it is sent
  from every server with a public store (pub.edb) to every server with a
  public store in the Microsoft Exchange Organization:

  Event ID: 3017
  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Information
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  Outgoing Message Type 0x20
  Message ID: 1-1B64 (this will not be the same)
  Folder(s): (1-1) IPM_SUBTREE

  This is a status message for the System Folders (Offline Address Book,
  Schedule+ Free Busy Folder, and so forth) (Note: the numeric
  information in the description will differ from server to server) and
  is sent from every site folder server in a site to any other site
  folder servers in other sites it has knowledge of:

  Event ID: 3019
  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Information
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  An outgoing replication message was issued.

  Type: 0x80000002
  Message ID: 1-1B62
  CNSET: 12-1B67,12-1B67
  12-1B69,12-1B69
  , CNSET(FAI): {0}

  RFIs: 2
   1: 2-7,1-4,48
  NON_IPM_SUBTREE\SCHEDULE+ FREE BUSY\EX:/o=ORGNAME/ou=SITENAME
  2: 2-8,1-5,666
  NON_IPM_SUBTREE\OFFLINE ADDRESS BOOK\EX:/o=ORGNAME/ou=SITENAME

  IDCN Deleted:
  {0}

In large Exchange organizations where there are many single server sites
connected over slow links and the information stores are stopped each night for
offline backups (in lieu of the preferred online backups), these messages may
cause the Microsoft Exchange message transfer agent (MTA) queues to back up.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can do the following to try to work around this problem:

1. Remove the public information store from any Exchange Server computer
  possible. This will only be valid in multi-server sites with a dedicated
  public folder server.

2. Increase the speed of the WAN links where/when possible.

3. Perform ONLINE backups of the information store.

STATUS
======

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

After applying the updated files, the following registry entry must be added for
the replication status message to be suppressed:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/SERVICES/MSExchangeIS/ 
  ParametersPublic/Disable Replication Messages At Startup

Set the type to DWORD and the default value to 0.

If this registry entry is not present or present and set to 0, the PF replication
will work as originally designed. In other words, it will send the replication
status messages at startup of the IS.

If this registry is present and set to 1, the PF Replication will not send the
status messages at startup of the IS.

If set to 1, two new Event ID's were added to notify the administrator that the
PF replication messages are not being sent out, they will look similar to the
following:

  Event ID: 3094
  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Warning
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  The site folder server status message was not sent out.

This is because the following registry entry has been intentionally set to 1 by
the system administrator.

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/SERVICES/MSExchangeIS/ 
     ParametersPublic/Disable Replication Messages At Startup

  Event ID: 3093
  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Warning
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  The replication startup status message was not sent out.

This is because the following registry entry has been intentionally set to 1 by
the system administrator.

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/SERVICES/MSExchangeIS/ 
     ParametersPublic/Disable Replication Messages At Startup.

It is strongly recommended that this registry entry only be used in the in cases
described in the Symptoms section. Setting this registry entry and preventing
the status messages from going out on startup has the following caveats:

1. If a replication connector between 2 Exchange Sites is torn down, the system
  folders from the foreign Site are marked as removed and they will not show up
  in the Systems Folder hierarchy. If these Sites are reconnected, the System
  folders from the foreign Site will still not show up since we are preventing
  the status message, which is the message that causes the marked as removed
  flag to be reset, from reaching the other Site. This registry entry must be
  set to 0, and then the IS re-started to get the System Folders to synch up
  again.

2. Public Folder hierarchies may temporarily become out of synch because changes
  are only known to other Sites when an actual hierarchy change message is
  received.
