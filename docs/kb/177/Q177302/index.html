The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a

SUMMARY
=======

WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested by
Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been taken from
unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS
ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not limited to
the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular
purpose.

Both FoxPro and Visual FoxPro may produce memory related error messages when you
run them on the new Macintosh OS 8 software. These errors may occur at any point
in the usage of either the development version of FoxPro or within a compiled
application. Since both Microsoft FoxPro 2.6a for the Macintosh and Visual
FoxPro for the Macintosh 3.0b were designed to run on Apple OS 7.x systems,
Microsoft cannot guarantee the either product will operate successfully on OS 8.
However, some users have been able to run FoxPro and Visual FoxPro on OS 8
systems.

Listed below are some suggested troubleshooting steps to take if memory related
errors appear while running under OS 8.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are a list of steps you may use in troubleshooting memory problems
under OS 8. The suggestions provided below may not work in all situations.
Often, the suggestions need to be cumulatively applied to the computer. Please
note that these suggestions have helped some users. However, these steps do not
correct all problems. If these steps do not provide the user with a stable
system, you may have to run FoxPro or Visual FoxPro on a computer with a version
of System 7.x.

Microsoft does not support, endorse, or recommend any of these products. We
provide this information only as a convenience for our customers and do not
provide warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not
limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose.

1. Reduce the number of colors the monitor uses to either thousands or 256. This
  frees up memory.

2. Turn off the virtual memory on the machine. If it already off, turn it on.
  Start with virtual memory set to 1 MB more than the amount of physical RAM.
  If this does not help, try increasing the amount of virtual memory.
  Conversely, if virtual memory is already set to a large value, try reducing
  the amount available.

3. If you are using a CoStar AddressWriter printer, remove the driver. We have
  received unconfirmed reports that version 2.1 of the AddressWriter printer
  driver causes conflicts.

4. Remove the FoxPro Settings file from the Preferences folder and restart
  FoxPro.

5. Remove the extensions Foxtools.cfm, on Visual FoxPro for the Macintosh, or
  Foxtools.mlb in FoxPro 2.6, and Foxdoc.mlb from the System's Extension
  folder. After removing these files, restart the machine and start FoxPro.

6. Try increasing or decreasing the amount of disk cache used on the computer.
  This setting is found in Control Panel under Memory.

7. If you are running a PPC application on a Power Macintosh machine and memory
  errors occur, try making a 68K version of the application. While this
  application may prove slower, it may help solve the memory conflict.

8. Rebuild the desktop and remove any desktop pictures or patterns.

9. Try turning off file sharing.

10. If FoxPro is running over a network, try running it locally and see if the
  network is causing the problem.

11. The default font used in FoxPro is Geneva. If this font becomes corrupted,
  errors may occur. To replace this font, remove it from the System's Font
  folder and copy the Geneva font file from the System disks to that location.

12. Remove the OpenDoc files from System Folder\Editors\OpenDoc folder and place
  these files in a temporary folder you create on your desktop. After you
  restart the computer, start FoxPro. If this does not solve the problem copy
  the files back from the temporary folder.

13. Instant Organizer from Claris has been reported to cause menu corruption
  with FoxPro. This may not be limited to OS 8 and may occur in system
  software versions prior to OS 8.
