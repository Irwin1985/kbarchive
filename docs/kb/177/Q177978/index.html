-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a calling card rule with Dial-Up Networking,
HyperTerminal, Microsoft Fax, Phone Dialer, or any other program that uses
Windows 95 telephony, your modem may not dial all the numbers in the dial
string.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions exists:

- The buffer on your modem is too small to store all the numbers in the calling
  card rule.

- The following line exists in your modem's .inf file:

        HKR, Settings, DialSuffix,, ";"

  The semicolon (;) between the quotation marks causes your modem not to dial
  all the numbers in the calling card rule.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, follow the steps in the appropriate section below:

The Buffer on Your Modem Is Too Small
-------------------------------------

To determine if the buffer on your modem is too small to store all the numbers in
the calling card rule, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

2. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

  " echo atdt &lt;dial string&gt; &gt; com&lt;n&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;n&gt; is the number of the communications port your modem is
  connected to, and &lt;dial string&gt; are the numbers you specified in the
  calling card rule.

If your modem does not dial all the numbers in the calling card rule, the buffer
on your modem is too small. To resolve this issue, contact the modem's
manufacturer to inquire about a possible firmware update.

The .inf File Contains a "DialSuffix" Line with a Semicolon
-----------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your modem's .inf file before you proceed.

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open your modem's .inf file in the
  Windows\Inf folder. Please see the "More Information" section later in this
  article for the .inf file your particular modem uses.

  NOTE: The Inf folder is a hidden folder. To view this folder, click Start,
  point to Programs, click Windows Explorer, click Options on the View menu,
  click Show All Files on the View tab, and then click OK.

2. Search for all instances of the following line, and remove the semicolon only
  (do not remove the quotation marks):

  HKR, Settings, DialSuffix,, ";"

3. Save the .inf file, and then quit the text editor.

4. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

5. In the Named box, type "drvdata.bin drvidx.bin" (without the quotation
  marks), and then click Find Now.

6. In the list of found files, right-click each file, and then click Delete.

7. Close the Find window.

8. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

9. Double-click Modems.

10. On the General tab, click your modem, and then click Remove.

11. Click Add.

12. If you want Windows 95 to detect your modem, click Next. If not, click the
  "Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list" check box to select
  it, and then click Next.

13. If you chose to have Windows 95 detect your modem, Windows 95 queries the
  serial ports on your computer looking for a modem. If Windows 95 detects an
  incorrect modem, click Change, and then click the appropriate manufacturer
  and model for your modem. Click Next, and then skip to step 16.

14. If you choose to select your modem manually, click the appropriate
  manufacturer and model for your modem, and then click Next.

15. Click the communications port your modem uses, and then click Next.

16. Click Finish, and then click Close. The .bin files you deleted are replaced
  with new versions, and the updated .inf file for your modem is used.
