Indeo Video Drivers

 Indeo(R) video interactive R4.1 - V4.11.15.60  [filename: ir41_32.dll]
 Indeo(R) video R3.2             - V3.24.15.02  [filename: ir32_32.dll]
 Indeo(R) video Raw YVU9         - V1.10.15.11  [filename: iyvu9_32.dll]

Installation

Windows 95:

The setup program installs the Indeo video drivers in the Windows 95
System subdirectory (e.g. \windows\system). Setup puts the
following entries in the System.ini file:

[drivers32]
VIDC.IV41=ir41_32.dll
VIDC.IV32=ir32_32.dll
VIDC.IV31=ir32_32.dll
VIDC.YVU9=iyvu9_32.dll

Setup also places the following entries in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
section of the system registry:

System\CurrentControlSet\control\MediaResources\icm\vidc.IV41
System\CurrentControlSet\control\MediaResources\icm\vidc.IV32
System\CurrentControlSet\control\MediaResources\icm\vidc.IV31
System\CurrentControlSet\control\MediaResources\icm\vidc.YVU9

Windows NT:

The setup program installs the Indeo video drivers in the Windows NT
System32 subdirectory (e.g. \windows\system32). Setup puts the
following entries into the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE section of the
system registry:

Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers\VIDC.IV41
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers\VIDC.IV32
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers\VIDC.IV31
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers\VIDC.YVU9
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\drivers.desc\IR41_32.DLL
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\drivers.desc\IR32_32.DLL

- VFW_SPEC.H
 A header file to match the Video for Windows ICM messages and
 structures for the Indeo video interactive codec.

- IVR4PAL.DOC
 An explanation of a new configurable palette mode that is not

Known Operating Characteristics of R4.1

- Can not use MCIAVI to access interactive features

 In order to access the new interactive features and capabilities
 introduced by Indeo video interactive within the existing Video For
 Windows architecture, the ICM interface must be used. VfW does not allow
 access to the ICM via the MCIAVI interface. As a result, an interactive
 application must provide the MCIAVI functionality for decoding such as
 avi file I/O, sound play and synchronization, and keyframe management.

 Linear applications, such as those presently using Indeo Video R3.2,
 can use the MCIAVI interface and obtain the image quality and the
 automatic scalability capability of Indeo video interactive.

- Does not load on 386 machines

 In order to provide a high quality image with good playback performance,
 the recommended minimum system configuration for Indeo video interactive
 is a  486DX2/66. The Indeo video interactive codec is implemented with
 instructions specific to 486 or later processors. If the codec detects a
 386 processor or less, then the codec is not loaded. It is recommended
 that applications check the processor type and notify the 386 user that
 they have insufficient resources to play the video portions of the
 application.

- Playing Multiple clips

 Multiple clips will play simultaneously; however, playing clips with
 different frame rates disables the scalability mechanism. During
 concurrent playback, both clips will play all frames and all bands.
 Scalability will be re-enabled as soon as all active clips have the
 same frame rate.

- Transparency Playback and Dropped Frames

For software vendors using Transparency and drawing directly to
     the on-screen frame buffer:

     If the application requires all frames to be returned, such as in
     an application that uses transparency to an on-screen buffer, then
     the codec should be used without ICM_DRAW_BEGIN and ICM_DRAW_END
     calls surrounding the DECOMPRESS messages for the motion playback.
     This ensures that no frames will be dropped so that the
     non-transparent section is overlayed on the background.
     These DRAW messages cause the decoder to begin scaling back and
     dropping frames when the required decode time is not available.
     The ICM_DRAW_BEGIN message puts the the decoder in "Normal
     Playback" mode, and the ICM_DRAW_END message takes it out and puts
     it back into "Stepping Mode" (The default playback mode of the
     decoder), where all frames are returned.

For software vendors using Transparency and drawing to an
     off-screen frame buffer:

     The application needs to recognize the codec's "Don't Draw"
     message and not flip screen buffer pages in this case.

- IF09 and Transparency / Local Decode

 IF09 is a data format which can be output by the R4.1 codec.  It is
 similar to the Raw YVU9 format. IF09 is used as input to DCI enabled
 hardware that handles color space conversion.

The IF09 output format supported by Indeo video interactive does
     not directly support the Transparency and Local Decode features
     of the algorithm, however they can be used together with
     application support.

IF09 and Transparency: The entire IF09 buffer is filled by image
     data regardless of Transparency (or local decode). Thus,
     transparent pixels ARE written in this buffer. To use
     transparency, the calling application must request to have the
     transparency mask exposed, and combine it with the IF09 buffer at
     color conversion time.

IF09 and Local Decode: The calling application has 2 ways of
     getting full local decode support with the decoder. It may
     manually clip view rectangle from the IF09 buffer, as it color
     converts it to the screen, or it may request the transparency
     mask, which is clipped to the view rect, and treat local decode
     as transparency. In either case, the Decode rectangle will
     still correctly tell the decoder the portions of video to decode.

- New Indeo Video Interactive Palette

 The Indeo video interactive palette has changed relative
 to the Indeo Video R3.2 palette. Any graphics or video files
 created based on the Indeo Video R3.x palette will need to be
 re-done to work with the Indeo video interactive palette.

- Advanced Compression Options

 When using VidEdit, you must use 'Save as Default" in order
 to have the codec use your current settings. This is due to
 the operating characteristics of VidEdit.

- Frame Sizes

 In increments of 4, the minimum supported frame size is 32x32
 (pixels); and the maximum supported frame size is 8192x8192
 (pixels).

- Concatenating files using an editing application

 When concatenating multiple V4.1 encoded files using an editing
 application such as Adobe Premiere, you must insure that all the
 clips are the same size and were encoded with the same features
 in the Advanced Dialog box (bi-dir, transparency, view port,
 scalability, ...). Combining files with different parameters
 will have undetermined behavior.

Software Requirements

- Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT

Minimum Hardware Configuration

486DX2/66 Mhz CPU
8 MB system RAM
CD-ROM drive(300KB/sec)
SVGA display (VESA compliant)
8-bit Sound board

For best frame rate performance, configure the graphics card for 8-bit
color mode. For best image quality, use 24-bit color mode.

Off-line encoding is CPU-intensive, i.e. the faster the CPU the faster the
compression time.
