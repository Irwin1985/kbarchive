the Microsoft programs listed earlier in this article, you may experience one of
the following symptoms:

- Sounds may not play.

- Sounds may be broken up or choppy.

- Introductory sounds may be broken up or choppy.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if RSX 3D Audio is installed on your computer. RSX 3D
Audio is installed with some VRML browsers and 3D animation programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure RSX 3D Audio to work with the Microsoft
programs listed earlier in this article. To do this, follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Use Registry Editor to open the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\Realistic Sound Experience\2.0

2. Modify the value data of the Device Type value to "wave" (without the
  quotation marks).

3. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, remove RSX 3D Audio from your computer.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Intel RSX 3D, and then click Add/Remove.

4. When you are prompted to remove Intel RSX 3D, click Yes.

5. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

To delete any copies of the Rsx.dll file remaining on your computer, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "rsx.dll" (without the quotation marks).

3. Click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, right-click the Rsx.dll file, and then click
  Delete. Repeat this step to delete any other copies of the Rsx.dll file that
  remain on your computer.
