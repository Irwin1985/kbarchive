SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to test Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
performance, and how to troubleshoot RPC error messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

RPC is compatible with the Open Software Foundation (OSF) design and
interoperable with other Data Communications Exchange (DCE) standards. RPCs are
industry standard Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanisms for client-server
communications that are network independent and can work over a variety of
network protocols. RPC uses IPC mechanisms to establish communications between
the client and server to call program functions on a remote computer. The
complex programs that use this level of service require that there be a
connection, or level of throughput, to adequately deliver this functionality.
For example, when you are using Microsoft Exchange Server, a connection is
needed to reliably maintain the flow of data.

RPC Error Messages
------------------

When you use RPC, you may receive any of the following error messages, which may
or may not be caused by slow network connectivity:

- The RPC protocol sequence is not supported.

- The RPC protocol sequence is invalid.

- The RPC server is already listening.

- The RPC server is not listening.

- The RPC server is unavailable.

- The RPC server is too busy to complete this operation.

- A remote procedure call (RPC) protocol error occurred.

- The transfer syntax is not supported by the RPC server.

- The RPC protocol sequence was not found.

- An internal error occurred in a remote procedure call (RPC).

- The RPC server attempted an integer division by zero.

- An addressing error occurred in the RPC server.

- A floating-point operation at the RPC server caused a division by zero.

- A floating-point underflow occurred at the RPC server.

- A floating-point overflow occurred at the RPC server.

- The list of RPC servers available for the binding of auto handles has been
  exhausted.

- The error specified is not a valid Windows RPC error code.

- Incompatible version of the RPC stub.

- The RPC pipe object is invalid or corrupted.

- An invalid operation was attempted on an RPC pipe object.

- Unsupported RPC pipe version.

- Invalid asynchronous RPC call handle for this operation.

- The RPC pipe object has already been closed.

- The RPC call completed before all pipes were processed.

- No more data is available from the RPC pipe.

Troubleshooting RPC Performance and Error Messages
--------------------------------------------------

There are many tools you can use to determine if an RPC error message is being
caused by a slow network connection. If you receive an RPC error message,
eliminate slow network connectivity as the possible cause. Use one or more of
the following methods to isolate the problem.

- To resolve the problem of name resolution as a cause of the RPC error
  message, verify that you can use the NET VIEW command at a command prompt on
  the destination server. If Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
  (TCP/IP) is the protocol used between the client and server programs, you can
  use an Lmhosts file to eliminate Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) as a
  possible contributor to the problem.

- You can test basic RPC connectivity by using another RPC program. Windows NT
  Server includes several RPC programs. Event Viewer (Eventvwr.exe) and
  Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) can have their focus set to any computer
  running Windows NT. Other programs such as User Manager (Usrmgr.exe) and
  Server Manager (Srvmgr.exe) set their focus on the Primary Domain Controller
  (PDC) by default. Use one of these programs as another test for RPC
  connectivity.

- To test network connectivity, monitor the speed of a basic file copy across
  the network using Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe). To give the test an
  adequate sampling time and to fully allow for segmenting and sequencing, only
  test with a file that is at least 2 megabytes (MB) in size. To copy a file
  across the network using Performance Monitor:

  1. Locate a 2 MB or larger file. If you do not have a 2 MB file readily
     available, you can use the COPY command to create the file from an
     existing file. To do so, type the following command at a command prompt,
     and then press ENTER:

  "copy /b file.ext + file.ext + file.ext + file.ext destination.ext" (without
  the quotation marks)

     NOTE: Use the binary (/b) switch when the source file is not text. This
     prevents CTRL+Z being read as an end-of-file character.

  2. Start Performance Monitor on the client computer. Since Performance
     Monitor cannot distinguish between connections to different computers for
     a file copy, you may want to disconnect all current network connections if
     other connections may influence the results. To disconnect all current
     network connections, type "net use * /d" (without the quotation marks) at
     a command prompt, and then press ENTER.

  3. Performance Monitor can monitor a file copy for the server or redirector
     object using the Bytes Transmitted/sec, Bytes Received/sec and Bytes
     Total/sec counters. To simplify the procedure, and to more accurately
     represent the flow of data in the RPC connection, copy a file from the
     server computer to the client computer that is running the RPC program. A
     2-MB file needs to be located on the server computer.

  4. In Performance Monitor on the client computer, follow these steps:

     a. On the Edit menu, click Add To Chart.

     b. In the Object box, click Redirector.

     c. In the Counter box, click Bytes Received/sec, and then clickAdd.

  5. At a command prompt, map a network drive letter to the server computer and
     then copy the file from the server computer to the client computer.

  6. In Performance Monitor, observe the average, maximum, and minimum values.
     If you are testing with a 128-Kbps link, observe the average counter to
     verify that the copy process is running close to 75 percent of the 16,384
     bytes per second theoretical limit (.75 x 16,384 = 12,288 bytes per
     second). This value should be higher for important functionality and may
     indicate the need for network expansion. As a gauge, measurements that
     approach 800,000 bytes per second (bps) are excellent. The following table
     lists conversions for kilobits per second (kpbs) and Kilobytes per second
     (KBps):

     +--------------------------------------------+
     | Connection speed  | Bytes per second (bps) | 
     +--------------------------------------------+
     | 128kbps           | 16,384                 | 
     +--------------------------------------------+
     | 512kbps           | 65,536                 | 
     +--------------------------------------------+
     | 1.544Mbps (T1)    | 193,000                | 
     +--------------------------------------------+
     | 10Mbps (Ethernet) | 1,250,000              | 
     +--------------------------------------------+
     | 46.320Mbps (T3)   | 5,790,000              | 
     +--------------------------------------------+

     With a certain line speed, such as 128K, you see less than the full 16,384
     bps throughput based on utilization and other factors. These numbers are a
     theoretical maximum, and network overhead reduces them.

  7. To further eliminate general network connectivity as the problem:

     a. In Performance Manager on the client computer, click Add To Chart on
        the Edit menu.

     b. In the Object box, click Redirector.

     c. In the Counter box, click Bytes Transmitted/sec, and then click Add.

     d. Copy the file back to the server computer, and monitor the rate at
        which the file is copied.

  NOTE: Be certain that these tests between the client computer and server
  computer are acceptable for the level of service desired. To perform
  additional tests using Performance Monitor, by reverse the direction of data
  flow between the client and server computer, select the appropriate counters.

- Another way to test RPC communication between two computers is to use the
  Rpcping tool.

For additional information about how to use the Rpcping tool, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q167260 How to Use RPCPing to Test RPC Communication

- Other causes of RPC error messages may be third-party services or larger
  services running on the client or server computer. To determine if running
  services are causing the problem, stop all non-default services and test RPC
  performance using Event Viewer and Performance Monitor again.

- Check the state of the RPC services on the client and server computer. To do
  so, type "net start" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt, and
  then press ENTER. For a domain controller, the following information is
  displayed:

  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator
  Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service

- To further check the state of these services, use the Sc.exe tool included
  with the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit.

For additional information about using the Sc.exe tool, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q166819 Using Sc.exe and Netsvc.exe to Control Services Remotely

- Services.exe contains much of the RPC code, and one of its threads may be in
  a hung state. Use the Dr. Watson tool (Drwtsn32.exe) to determine if an error
  message has been reported. Even if no error message has been reported, one of
  its threads may be hung. If this is the case, you may need to restart your
  computer.

- You can use the Tlist.exe tool included with the Windows NT Resource Kit to
  obtain information similar to the following:

     62 Win32StartAddr:0x022a3ca1 LastErr:0x000003e5 State:Waiting
     64 Win32StartAddr:0x022a4895 LastErr:0x00000000 State:Waiting
     67 Win32StartAddr:0x76e03f90 LastErr:0x00000000 State:Waiting
     4.0.1381.4 shp  0x02290000  services.exe
     4.0.1381.4 shp  0x77f60000  ntdll.dll
     4.0.1381.4 shp  0x77e10000  RPCRT4.dll

  Examination of the state, files, and dates may provide additional information.

- You can use the Pmon.exe tool (included with the Windows NT Resource Kit)
  Task Manager to obtain information about Services.exe, such as memory and CPU
  consumption.

- The Pstat.exe tool, included with the Windows NT Resource Kit, displays
  thread states for Services.exe.
