IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to save a file as the file type of Word 6.0/95 (*.doc), the choice
does not appear in the Save As Type list in the Save As dialog box (click Save
As on the File menu), even when the converter is installed properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain and install Microsoft Office 97 Service Release
2. For additional information, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q151261 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-2

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, try methods 1 and 2 first. Use method 3 only as a
last resort.

Method 1: Check for the Converter
---------------------------------

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Close Microsoft Word.

2. Right-click Start, and then click Explore to start the Explorer.

3. Find the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv

  NOTE: This is the default setting; this may be different if you changed the
  default location of Word.

4. Look for the Wrd6ex32.cnv file.

  If the file is not there, then you probably have not installed it. You will
  need to add the converter. Use the following article to help you in that
  process.

  Q120802 Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office Program or Component

  If WRD6EX32.CNV is located in the proper place, then proceed to step 5.

5. Start Microsoft Word and type some text in the new blank document.

6. On the File menu, click Save As. In the Save As Type box, select Text Only,
  name the file, and then click Save.

7. Close the file.

8. On the Tools menu, click Options, select the General tab, click to select
  Confirm Conversion At Open, and then click OK.

9. Re-open the Text Only file as a text file. On the File menu, click Save As
  and check to see if the File As Type of Word 6.0/95 is displayed.

Step 2: Rename and Re-Install the Converter
-------------------------------------------

Rename Wrd6ex32.cnv and then reinstall the converter. There are many ways that
this converter could have been installed. If you have the Microsoft Office CD,
you can copy the converter from the following location on the CD:

  &lt;CD Drive&gt;\OS\MSAPPS\TEXTCONV

It should be copied to the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv

Step 3: Check the Microsoft Windows 95 Registry for Proper Settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If steps 1 and 2 do not work, you need to look at a registry key called
MSWord6Exp, which governs this particular Save As Type option. This key is found
in two places within the Microsoft Windows 95 Registry.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To review, change, or add the settings for MSWord6Exp, do the following:

1. Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

2. On the Windows taskbar, click Start and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and click OK.

4. Locate the following key by clicking the plus signs in front of the
  appropriate folders.

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\MSWord6Exp

5. Click MSWORD6EXP once to select and to open its folder. To export this
  registry key to the desktop, follow these steps:

  a. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

  b. Beside File Name, type your name, note the location of the Save In
     (default is desktop), and then click Save. A file named,
     &lt;Yourname&gt;.reg, will now appear on the desktop for recovery
     purposes, if necessary.

6. On the right side of the Registry Editor, under Name, there should be a
  (Default) and Path setting. Under Data, the (Default) item will read (value
  not set.). The Path item should read:

  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv\WRD6EX32.CNV"

  NOTE: This is the default setting; this may be different if you changed the
  default location of Word.

7. If the Path is incorrect, double-click Path (under Name) and under the Value
  Data, change the path to point to where the file WRD6Ex32.CNV is located.

8. Click OK.

9. Locate the second entry for the MSWord6Exp key location by clicking the plus
  sign in front of the appropriate folders.

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text Converters
      Export\MSWord6Exp

10. On the right side of the Windows 95 Registry Editor, under Name, you should
  see the following entries:

  Name                  Data

  Extensions            "doc"
  Name                  "Word 6.0/95"
  Path                  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared
                         Textconv\WRD6EX32.CNV"

  NOTE: This is the default setting; this may be different if you changed the
  default location of Word.

11. Correct or add the registry keys by doing one of the following:

  If the entry is incorrect:

  Select the incorrect Name string, and then, on the Edit menu, click Modify.
  Under Value Data, type in the correct data as stated in step 9.

  -or-

  If the entry is missing:

  If these settings are missing, then the entries within the registry will have
  to be created. To do this within the Microsoft Windows 95 Registry, follow
  the steps in the "How To Add a Microsoft Windows 95 Registry Key," section
  later in this document.

12. Click OK.

13. Close Registry Editor.

How to Add a Microsoft Windows 95 Registry Key
----------------------------------------------

To add a registry key, follow these steps:

1. Select the already existing key under which the new key is to be created (for
  example, select Export).

2. On the Edit menu, point to New and then click Key. Enter MSWord6Exp as the
  name and then press Enter.

3. Select the new key (MSWord6Exp) and on the Edit menu, point to New and then
  click String Value.

4. On the right side of the Registry Editor, select the New Value #x and type in
  any of the missing items and then press ENTER. The missing items will be any
  of the following:

  Extensions
  Name
  Path

5. Select the newly named string and then on the Edit menu click Modify. Under
  Value Data, type in the correct data as indicated follows for the appropriate
  key and then click OK.

     For this key               Type this
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Extensions            doc
     Name                  Word 6.0/95
     Path                  C:\Program Files\Common Files
           Microsoft Shared\Textconv\WRD6EX32.CNV

  NOTE: The path listed here is the default setting; this may be different If
  you changed the default location of Word.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until all of the proper string items have been put in place
  under the proper keys.

7. On the Registry menu, click Exit.

NOTE: You may still have to force the converter to work by saving a file as a
Text Only document, closing it, and then re-opening it with Confirm Conversions
turned. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options and then select the General tab.

2. Click to select Confirm Conversion At Open.

3. Click OK.

This will initialize the converters and force them to work properly.
