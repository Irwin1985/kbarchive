MORE INFORMATION
================

Setup Will Not Install on Windows 3.1
-------------------------------------

When you attempt to install the files from the companion disc to a Microsoft
Windows 3.1 or Windows 3.11 system, you may receive an error similar to the
following:

  Win32s error: F:\setup.exe: Invalid Format
  Unexpected error: 21

The program will then abort. The program may also abort without first displaying
the error message given above.

The Setup program is not compatible with Microsoft Windows 3.1.

The files will install correctly on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 system.

If you purchased this book in the belief that it would work on a Windows 3.1
computer and you cannot make use of this book otherwise, you may return the book
for a full refund. In the United States, if you have not opened any of the
CD-ROM sleeves, please return the book to the point of purchase. If you have
opened one of the CD-ROM sleeves, please call 1-800-MSPRESS to arrange for a
refund check to be sent to you.

Outside the United States, please return your book to the point of purchase.

  Back cover correction:
  System requirements, sentence two:
  Delete "... or Microsoft Windows 3.1."


Cannot Run Labs &amp; Demos Directly from CD-ROM
--------------------------------------------

Exercises which are companion to the material covered in the book are included on
the CD-ROM. However, these exercises cannot be run from the CD. they must be
loaded onto the hard drive by running a setup program. This takes about 173 MB
of HD space (about 165 MB for demos and 8 MB for labs).


Error: Missing Oleaut32.dll in Setup Program
--------------------------------------------

When you run the Setup program from the companion disc, you may receive an error
message similar to the following:

  The SETUP.EXE file is linked to missing export OLEAUT32.DLL:420

Oleaut32.dll is a shared file installed by the operating system and used by the
Setup program. The Setup program is looking for a newer version of the file than
the one that you have installed on your computer. The current Oleaut32.dll file
size is 473,872 bytes, and version 2.20.4049 or later.

To correct this problem, download and install MSVBVM50.EXE from the Microsoft
Software Library. Run the executable file after download. This file installs
Oleaut32.dll and other files needed to run the Setup program successfully. This
should eliminate the error message.

See the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for further information on
MSVBVM50.EXE:

  Q180071 FILE: MSVBVM50.EXE Visual Basic 5.0 Run-Time Files

This error does not affect Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2).

The newer version of Oleaut32.dll is installed and used by programs, including
Microsoft Office 97 and later, Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 and later, and
Microsoft Visual Studio.


Setup Does Not Install Shortcuts to Start Menu
----------------------------------------------

After running Setup.exe from the companion disc, the Networking Essentials,
Second Edition folder on the Start menu does not contain any shortcuts.

Use Windows Explorer to access the files you want from the Networking Essentials
folder. By default, this folder is C:\Netess.


Demonstration Files and Labs Do Not Match Text
----------------------------------------------

Several of the lab executable files included on the CD-ROM do not match the
Networking Essentials, Second Edition text.

Microsoft Press has prepared a set of corrected lab directions that will match
the executable files included on the CD-ROM. These lab directions are in
Microsoft Word 95 format and can be viewed using Microsoft Word 95, Word 97, or
Microsoft Wordpad.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Ne2labs.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/MSPressPub/mspress/2.0/W9XNT4/EN-US/Ne2labs.exe)

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.



Videos Do Not Work on 1280 x 1024 Displays
------------------------------------------

The lab files contain AVI video files that do not play properly on high display
resolutions (1280 x 1024 and higher).


Readme.txt Missing from CD-ROM
------------------------------

The Readme.txt mentioned on page xxix of the book is missing.

No Readme.txt file was created for the first printing of this title. The
Readme.txt file created for the second printing is available below. Please note
that some errors mentioned in this Knowledge Base article were fixed in the
second printing. These errors are not listed in the Readme.txt file.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Nereadme.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/MSPressPub/mspress/2.1/W9XNT4/EN-US/Nereadme.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.



Videos Do Not Have Sound
------------------------

When you play one of the demonstration files included on the companion disc, you
will not hear any sound. The demonstration files were designed to be compatible
with computers that do not include sound cards. Therefore, the demonstration
files do not include sound.


Demo03.exe: Small Typo on Screen 6
----------------------------------

In Demo 03 ("Topologies"), Screen 6 ("Bus Topology") has the following text:
"Computer 6 has another signal for Computer 1...".

However, on the video, what is shown is a signal emanating from Computer 6 and
going to Computer 2. All the other computers, including Computer 1, in the bus
indicate "Not Me!", and Computer 2 indicates "Mine!"

The text on this screen should be corrected. "for Computer 1" should be changed
to "for Computer 2", so that text and video match. This will also match previous
screens in the Demo where Computer 6 sends to Computer 2.


Demo21.exe: Slide 3 Screen Shot From NT 3.51
--------------------------------------------

The third screen shot seen in Demo21.exe is from Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, not
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. This screen shot will be updated with the equivalent
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 screen shot in future reprints and editions.


Figure 3.22 and Demo21.exe Show NT 3.5 and describe NT 4.0
----------------------------------------------------------

Note: this figure and the demo are not related in the book. However, they
demonstrate the same problem.

Page 219 shows a screen capture of the Windows NT Server Setup program. The text
describes installation of Windows NT Server 4.0, but the screen capture does not
describe NT 4.0 (titles in title bars are centered, for example).

Demo 21 shows a number of screen captures which illustrate the Performance
Monitor. Twelve of the screen captures do not illustrate NT Server 4.0, although
throughout the book, references to NT Server 4.0 are made.


Content For Lab Help Files Is Based On NT 3.51
----------------------------------------------

The content for the Lab Help files is based on Microsoft Windows NT 3.51.
Therefore, some of the information is outdated with respects to NT 4.0.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
