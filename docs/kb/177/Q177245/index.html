-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A multiprocessor computer running Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 may appear to
stop responding (hang) when subjected to heavy TCP/IP stress. The system will
continue to respond to PINGs, but higher level TCP/IP activity will be blocked.
If other network protocols are installed, the system may continue to function
normally except for activities that depend on TCP/IP.

CAUSE
=====

For this problem to occur, a process must have an open handle to an address and
an open handle to a connection and must try to close both simultaneously (as,
for example, might happen at process termination). Under very specific and
timing-dependent situations, Tcpip.sys can become deadlocked, blocking further
work by the driver. When this happens, other parts of the system will typically
continue running for a period of minutes or longer until higher level services
that depend on Tcpip.sys also become blocked, waiting for the driver.


RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
