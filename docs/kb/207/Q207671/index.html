SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information about problems with accessing files on a
computer other than your Internet Information Server (IIS) server from an
Internet Server API (ISAPI) extension, Active Server Pages (ASP) page, or Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) application. This article lists some of the issues that
are involved and some possible methods to make this work.

Although this article is written primarily in the context of accessing files on
network shares, the same concepts apply to named-pipe connections as well. Named
pipes are frequently used for SQL Server connections and also for remote
procedure call (RPC) and Component Object Model (COM) communications. In
particular, if you connect to a SQL Server across the network that is configured
to use Microsoft Windows NT Integrated Security, you cannot connect because of
the issues that are outlined in this article. RPC and COM may also use other
communication mechanisms that have similar network authentication schemes.
Therefore, the concepts in this article can apply to a wide variety of network
communication mechanisms that may be used from your IIS applications.

Authentication and Impersonation Types
--------------------------------------

When IIS services an HTTP request, IIS performs impersonation so that access to
resources to handle the request is limited appropriately. The impersonated
security context is based on the kind of authentication performed for the
request. The five different types of authentication available from IIS 4.0 are:

Authentication Type                          Impersonation Type
 
Anonymous Access (no authentication)         Network
Auto Password Synchronization is
ON (ON=default)

Anonymous Access (no authentication)         IIS Clear Text
Auto Password Synchronization is OFF         

Basic Authentication                         IIS Clear Text 

NT Challenge/Response Authentication         Network 

Client SSL Certificate Mapping               Interactive

Token Types
-----------

Whether or not access to network resources is permitted is dependent on the kind
of impersonation token under which the request is being processed.

- Network tokens are "NOT" permitted to access network resources. (Network
  tokens are named so because this kind of token is traditionally created by a
  server when a user is authenticated across the network. To allow the server
  to use a network token to act as a network client and access another server
  is called "delegation" and is considered a possible security hole.)

- Interactive tokens are traditionally used when authenticating a local user on
  the computer. Interactive tokens are permitted to access resources across the
  network.

- Batch tokens are designed to provide a security context under which batch
  jobs run. Batch tokens have network access.

IIS has the concept of a Clear Text logon. Clear Text logon is named so because
of the fact that IIS has access to both the username and the password in clear
text. You can control whether a Clear Text logon creates a Network token, an
Interactive token, or a Batch token by setting the LogonMethod property in the
metabase. By default, Clear Text logons receive an Interactive token and have
access to network resources. The LogonMethod can be configured at the server,
the site, the virtual directory, the directory, or the file level.

Anonymous access impersonates the account configured as the anonymous user for
the request. By default, IIS has a single anonymous user account called
IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt; that is impersonated when handling a non-authenticated
request. By default IIS 4.0 has a configurable feature called "Enable Automatic
Password Synchronization" that uses a security sub-authority to create the
token. Tokens that are created in this manner are network tokens which do "NOT"
have access to other computers on the network. If you disable Automatic Password
Synchronization, IIS creates the token in the same manner as the Clear Text
logon mentioned earlier. Automatic Password Synchronization is only available
for accounts that are located on the same computer as IIS. Therefore, if you
change your anonymous account to a domain account, you cannot use Automatic
Password Synchronization and you receive a Clear Text logon. The exception is if
you install IIS on your Primary Domain Controller. In this case, the domain
accounts are on the local computer. The anonymous account and the Automatic
Password Synchronization option can be configured at the server, the site, the
virtual directory, the directory, or the file level.

You must have the correct type of token as the first step in accessing a resource
on the network. You must also impersonate an account that has access to the
resource across the network. By default, the IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt; account
that IIS creates for anonymous requests exists only on the local computer. Even
if you disable Automatic Password Synchronization so that you can get an
Interactive token that can access network resources, the
IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt; account typically does not have access to most network
resources because this is an account that is unrecognized on other computers. If
you want to access network resources with anonymous requests, you must replace
the default account with an account in a domain on your network that can be
recognized by all computers. If you install IIS on a Domain Controller, the
IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt; account is a domain account and must be recognized by
other computers on the network without taking additional action.

Problem Avoidance
-----------------

Following are ways to avoid problems when you access network resources from your
IIS application:

- Keep files on the local computer.

- Some network communication methods do not require a security check. An
  example is using Windows sockets.

- You can provide direct access to the network resources of the computer by
  configuring a virtual directory to be:

  "A share located on another computer."

  All access to the computer that shares the network resources is performed in
  the context of the person specified under the Connect As.. dialog box. This
  occurs no matter what kind of authentication is configured for the virtual
  directory. By using this option, all files on the network share are available
  from browsers that access the IIS computer.

- Use basic authentication or anonymous authentication without Automatic
  Password Synchronization.

  By default, the impersonation that Internet Information Server does for basic
  authentication provides a token that can access network resources (unlike
  Windows NT Challenge/Response, which provides a token that cannot access
  network resources). For anonymous authentication, the token can only access a
  network resource if Automatic Password Synchronization is disabled. By
  default, Automatic Password Synchronization is enabled when Internet
  Information Server is first installed. In such a default configuration, the
  anonymous user token cannot access network resources.

  Q259353 Must Enter Password Manually After You Toggle Password Sync

- Configure the anonymous account as a domain account.

  This permits anonymous requests from potential access to resources across the
  network. To prevent all anonymous requests from having network access, you
  must only make the anonymous account a domain account on the virtual
  directories that specifically require access.

- Configure the anonymous account with the same username and password on the
  computer that is sharing the network resources and then disable Automatic
  Password Synchronization.

  If you do this you must make sure that the passwords match exactly. This
  approach must only be used when the "Configure the anonymous account as a
  domain account" mentioned earlier is not an option for some reason.

- NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes can be used to allow access to a
  specific network share or to a named pipe when your request is handled with a
  network token.

  If you have a network token and you try to establish a connection to a network
  resource, the operating system tries to establish a connection as a
  non-authenticated connection (referred to as a "NULL Session"). This registry
  setting must be made on the computer that is sharing the network resource,
  not on the IIS computer. If you try to access a NullSessionShare or
  NullSessionPipe with a non-network token, typical Microsoft Windows
  authentication is used and access to the resource is based on the account
  user rights of the impersonated user.

- You can potentially perform your own impersonation to create a Thread token
  that does have network access.

  The LogonUser function and the ImpersonateLoggedOnUser function can be used to
  impersonate a different account. This requires that you have the Clear Text
  username and password of another account available to your code. LogonUser
  also requires that the account that calls LogonUser has the "Act as part of
  the operating system" privilege in User Manager. By default, most users who
  IIS impersonates while it handles an HTTP request do not have this user
  right. However, for "In Process Applications" there are a number of ways to
  cause your current security context to change to the LocalSystem account,
  which does have the "Act as part of the operating system" administrative
  credentials. For ISAPI DLLs that run in-process, the best way to change the
  security context that IIS has created to the LocalSystem account is to call
  the RevertToSelf function. If you are running your IIS application "Out of
  Process", this mechanism does not work by default because the process is
  running under the IWAM_&lt;machinename&gt; account and not the Local System
  account. By default, the IWAM_&lt;machinename&gt; does "NOT" have the "Act as
  part of the operating system" administrative credentials.

- Add the component that is called from the ASP page to a Microsoft Transaction
  Server (MTS) Server package or COM+ Server application, and then specify a
  specific user as the identity of the package.

  NOTE: The component runs in a separate .exe file that is outside of IIS.

NOTE: Do not forget that you can prevent network access for anonymous requests
where password synchronization is disabled and requests are authenticated by
using basic authentication (Clear Text logons) if you set the LogonMethod
metabase property to "2" (indicating that a network logon is used to create the
impersonation token). With this setting, the only way for requests to avoid the
network token limitation is to connect to NullSessionShares or
NullSessionPipes.

Do not use drive letters mapped to network shares. Not only are there only 26
potential driver letters to select from, but if you try to use a drive letter
that is mapped in a different security context, problems can occur. Instead, you
must always use Universal Naming Convention (UNC) names to access resources. The
format must look similar to the following:

  \\MyServer\filesharename\directoryname\filename

The information in this article pertains only to Internet Information Server 4.0.
In Internet Information Server 5.0 (that is included with Windows 2000), there
are significant changes to new authentication types and capabilities. Although
most of the concepts in this article still apply to IIS 5.0, the details on the
kinds of impersonation tokens that are generated with certain authentication
schemes in this article apply strictly to IIS 4.0.

  Q319067 HOW TO: Run Applications Not in the Context of the System Account

If you cannot determine what kind of logon is occurring on your IIS server to
handle requests, you can turn on auditing for Logons and Logoffs. Follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, click Settings, click Control Panel, click Administrative Tools,
  and then click Local Security Policy.

2. After you open Local Security Policy, in the left Tree View pane, click
  Security Settings, click Local Policies, and then click Audit Policy.

3. Double-click Audit Logon Event and then click Success and Failure.

Event Log entries are added under the Security log. You can determine the kind of
logon by looking at the event details under the Logon Type:

  2=Interactive
  3=Network
  4=Batch
  5=Service
