IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Following is an explanation of how an administrator specifies computers to be
excluded from discovery and installation by the Windows NT Remote Client
Installation service. In addition, you may want to exclude specific workstations
and/or servers that reside within site boundaries from becoming Systems
Management Server 2.0 clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To exclude servers and workstations from being discovered and installed as
Systems Management Server 2.0 clients, perform the following steps on the site
server:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components

3. On the Edit menu, click New, then select Key. Type
  "SMS_DISCOVERY_DATA_MANAGER" (without the quotation marks) for the new key.

4. With the new key selected, on the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add
  the following:

  Value Name: ExcludeServers
  Data Type:  REG_MULTI_SZ
  Value:    &lt;computer names to exclude&gt;  

5. Modify the value to add or remove the Windows NT computer names that you want
  to exclude from receiving Systems Management Server 2.0 Client Components
  installed on them. Delineate multiple entries with a &lt;Return&gt; tag to
  place them on separate lines.

6. Click OK when finished and close the Registry Editor.

Note that after the system is discovered, and in the discovery database, removing
the server name from the ExcludeServers list will not cause the computer to
install. The client can be installed on this computer if either Logon Discovery
method or Logon Installation method is enabled and Smsman.exe is run on the
client. SMSMAN can be distributed with software distribution to the target
server.
