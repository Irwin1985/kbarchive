SUMMARY
=======

One of the more difficult tasks when you are attempting to find the root cause
of Event 23 "00AF" (link lost) or other network outage errors posted in
Application Event logs, is knowing when to stop a Netmon trace after a failure
has occurred. Frequently, because of high network traffic, the network incident
that spawned the Event 23 or other network outage has been overwritten by the
time network personnel have been notified to stop the Netmon trace.

You can use Evtscan.exe to send a pop-up message containing a predefined message
within seconds of an Event 23 error to any designated computer(s). The utility
can send a message for any event and within a configurable length of time after
the event transpires. In addition, a predefined e-mail message can be sent to
specific users notifying them to stop the Netmon capture. Because the e-mail
message is sent containing known specific strings, other actions can be taken on
receipt of that specific text string (for example, paging a particular pager
number, forwarding the message, and so forth).

Evtscan.exe is a utility that ships with the Back Office Resource Kit (Part 1)
(in the Exchange\Tools\Evtlog directory), and has also shipped with the May 1998
Tech Net CD, on a supplemental CD entitled "BackOffice Resource Kit Utilities,
Second Edition" (in the Exchange/Winnt/I386/Admin/Evtlog directory). Evtscan.exe
ships as an Exchange utility, but has been recently used in the SNA arena,
helping to report network outages (Event 23s) as soon as they are recorded in
the Event logs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Frequently, when troubleshooting link lost and other intermittent LAN errors, it
becomes essential to capture network traces (using Netmon). As the outages are
intermittent, prompt identification and notification of the network outage will
enable support personnel to stop the network tracing device while the LAN error
is still in the trace buffer, and not overwritten.

The EVTSCAN utility can be used to track any event ID that is generated in the
event logs on specific computers running Windows NT Server. For the purposes of
this article, we will be using Event 23 as an example.

To use EVTSCAN, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the files Evtscan.exe and Evt.cfg to the Winnt\System32\Config directory
  on the monitoring computer running Windows NT Server or Windows NT
  Workstation.

  The Evt.cfg file contains the instructions EVTSCAN will use when monitoring
  the event logs. The format of the Evt.cfg file is:

  Event ID; Source Service; Action to take; Screen pop up list; email list;
  Message to be sent

  The Evtscan utility will monitor the Application log for:
   - An Event 23,

   - Taking no action, (that is not stopping or restarting the service)

   - Sending a screen pop-up message to the machine "SNA Monitor"

   - Sending e-mail to the SNA-Admin alias

   - With the following message " Event 23 has occurred- stop netmon trace
     immediately"

  The evt.cfg file would be modified to contain only the following string:

  23; SNA Server; ; SNA Monitor; SNA-Admin; Event 23 has occurred- stop netmon
  trace immediately

2. Ensure that the client is Mapi32-compliant so the mail message function works
  correctly. The simplest way to ensure the mail message will be sent is to
  install an Exchange client on the monitoring computer, then start Exchange,
  and then minimize it.

3. Go to an MS-DOS command prompt and change directories to the
  \Winnt\system32\config directory. Then start EVTSCAN by typing the following
  commands:

  evtscan -f &lt;Evt.cfg (in this case)&gt; -u &lt;the Exchange profile to be
  used(if necessary)&gt; -p &lt;password for the Exchange profile&gt; -t
  &lt;how many seconds between scans&gt; &lt;Target server to be scanned #1&gt;
  &lt;Target server to be scanned #2&gt;, and so forth.

  For example, if you have logged into the monitoring computer with your user
  name and password and have started and minimized Exchange, use the following
  command string:

  "evtscan -f evt.cfg -t 15 SNAServer#1,SNAServer#2,SNAServer#3" (without the
  quotation marks)

  This will bring about the following results:
   - Scanning SNAServer#1, SNAServer#2, and SNAServer#3

   - Every 15 seconds

   - For Event 23s

   - We will send screen pop-up messages to SNA Monitor

   - We will send e-mail to SNA-Admin

  You can then minimize the MS-DOS window under which EVTSCAN is running.

4. After notifications have been sent, and there is no further need to run
  EVTSCAN, you can exit EVTSCAN by typing the following command:

  "^C (Ctrl+C)" (without the quotation marks)
