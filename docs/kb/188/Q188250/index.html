-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the IRIX(SGI) Netscape Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) or Internet
Mail Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) client to submit a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) message to an Exchange Server computer, the message may be rejected or
not leave the Outbox. This problem occurs only if one of the following client
restrictions is enabled on the Connections tab of Internet Mail Server
properties:

- Clients can only submit if homed on this server

- Clients can only submit if authentication account matches the SMTP submission
  address

Although the authenticated connections are accepted from the same client, and
retrieval of messages through POP3 or IMAP4 may work, the application log of the
Event Viewer may show the following error message:

  Event ID: 4151
  Source:  MSExchnageIMC
  Category:  SMTP Interface Events
  Description:
  An inbound mail message was not accepted on &lt;Exch.MyDomain.com&gt;
  because the authentication account did not have permission to use the
  originator address on the message.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the Netscape client adds the RFC-822 header "SENDER",
populated by the user's logon name from the foreign system. This does not match
the authentication account, which was in the format: Ntdomain\Ntaccount, and
Exchange Server rejects the submission. This occurs if either or both of the
above client restrictions are enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, edit the Preferences.js file located in the hidden
directory ".netscape", in the user's home directory on the IRIX workstation.
This is a Netscape preferences file that instructs the Netscape client whether
to send the SENDER header information. Editing this file can suppress sending
this header information.

To edit this file, perform the following steps:

1. Open the Preferences.js file using a plain text editor, and verify that the
  following entry exists:

        Pref("mail.suppress_sender_header", true);

2. If the entry is set to "false", edit the entry so that it appears as in step
  1 above.

If you are not able to edit this file, there is an alternate workaround. (NOTE:
This workaround retains the client restrictions for all hosts except those
specified in the workaround):

1. In Microsoft Exchange Administrator, view the Internet Mail Service
  properties.

2. Click the Connections tab, Click Accept connections, and then click Hosts.

3. Click Add, and type the IP address and subnet mask of the IRIX host using
  Netscape. If you want authentication, specify it here.

4. Select the "This host is a relay server" check box.

5. Stop and start the Internet Mail Service.

This workaround must be performed for each IRIX host that will be submitting SMTP
mail to the Exchange Server computer with the Netscape Communicator client.

Note that setting the IRIX host as a relay server will override the security
settings in the Connections property sheet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SMTP protocol log shows successful authentication by the Exchange Server
computer and proceeds through "354 Send data", at which point the Exchange
Server computer will issue the following message:

  554 Originator address does not match authentication credentials

The session then terminates without accepting the message.
