-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how an Exchange administrator can determine when
permissions have been modified on the Organization, Site, or Configuration
objects in the Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following event appears in the application log of the event viewer after an
administrator has modified the permissions on one of these objects:

  Event ID 1175
  Source  MSExchangeDS
  Type  Information
  Category  Security

With the following descriptions:

- If the change is made at the Organizational level: Description: The Security
  attributes of object /o=&lt;Organization Name&gt; were modified.

- If the change is made at the Site level: Description: The Security attributes
  of object /o=&lt;Organization Name&gt;/ou=&lt;Site Name&gt; were modified.

- If the change is made at the Configuration level: Description: The Security
  attributes of object /o=&lt;Organization Name&gt;/ou=&lt;Site
  Name&gt;/cn=Configuration were modified.

With diagnostic logging set to Maximum on "Security" in the properties of
Directory Service/Diagnostic Logging, the following event is logged:

  Event ID 1053
  Source MSExchangeDS
  Type Information
  Category Security

With the following descriptions:

- If the change is made at the Organizational level: Description: The security
  descriptor granted 0x80 access on object /o=&lt;Organization Name&gt; for
  this user.

- If the change is made at the Site level: Description: The security descriptor
  granted 0x80 access on object /o=&lt;Organization Name&gt;/ou=&lt;Site
  Name&gt; for this user.

- If the change is made at the Configuration level: Description: The security
  descriptor granted 0x80 access on object /o=&lt;Organization
  Name&gt;/ou=&lt;Site Name&gt;/cn=Configuration for this user.

In the previous Events, "admin" permissions were granted to a user; this equals
"0x80" in the description. This number varies depending on which permissions
were modified.

The description does not state which user made the modification to the objects;
however, in the application log under the USER column, it states which user
caused the event to be generated.
