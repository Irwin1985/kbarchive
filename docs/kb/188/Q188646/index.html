SYMPTOMS
========

When you are trying to perform an online backup of the Microsoft Exchange Server
databases, the operation may fail and the application event log may display
events similar to the following:

  Event ID 105
  Source:  ESE97
  Type:  Error
  Category:  Logging/Recovery
  MSExchangeIS ((215) ) The database engine has stopped the backup with
  error -1018.

  Event ID 118
  Source:  ESE97
  Type:  Error
  Category:  Database Page Cache
  MSExchangeIS ((215) ) Direct read found corrupted page (826096) with
  error -1018. Please restore the databases from a previous backup.

The event viewer may also display events similar to the following during online
defragmentation:

  Event ID 184
  Source:  ESE97
  Type:  Error
  Category:  Online Defragmentation
  MSExchangeIS ((215) ) Online defragmentation of database
  'D:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\PRIV.EDB' terminated prematurely after encountering
  unexpected error -1018.

  Event ID 116
  Source:  ESE97
  Type:  Error
  Category:  Database Page Cache
  MSExchangeIS ((215) ) Synchronous read page checksum error -1018
  ((1:826096 1:2184256518)
  (4119191402-546568656) (0-24859366)) occurred. Please restore the
  databases from a previous backup.

CAUSE
=====

In certain database operations such as, but not limited to, online backup, the
backup routine makes a call to the operating system to read a 4-KB page of data
from the database on disk and write it to tape. Before committing the data
returned from the operating system call to the tape, the online backup process
compares the checksum value in the page header (recorded when this page was
written to disk) to that being returned from the READ call. If the checksum
values do not match, the Exchange database engine detects this and returns -1018
(JET_errReadVerifyFailure).

WORKAROUND
==========

First determine the root cause of the corruption; that is, check the system log,
run chkdsk, and so on. If the cause of the -1018 is not determined and fixed,
the corruption problem will recur.

In order to perform a successful backup, use one of the following methods:

- Restore the information store from the previous backup.

  NOTE: If the information store cannot be started after restoring from backup
  because a "corrupted" log file is encountered, the log files may need to be
  removed. This will cause loss of data since the time of the last backup.

- Move Users to another server. Moving users will not also move the corruption,
  because the checksum errors also cause the move process to fail for the
  affected mailboxes. Any mailboxes that fail the Move Users process should
  have their contents downloaded to PSTs.

  NOTE: The specific messages that are directly associated with the corruption
  may fail to move to a PST and would then be lost.

The "corrupted" but now empty Priv.edb file may be deleted from the original
server after users are moved off. The information store, when re- started,
causes a new Priv.edb file to be generated. After this is done, the users may be
moved back to the original server. The root cause should be determined prior to
moving users back to the original server to prevent recurrence of any corruption
problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The event viewer system log may report array errors similar to the following:

  Event ID:    9
  Source:      aic78xx
  Description: The device, \Device\ScsiPort0, did not respond within the
               timeout period.

In almost all cases, these messages are being posted due to hardware problems
with either the controller or, more likely, a device that is attached to the
controller in question. The hardware problems can be associated with poor
cabling, incorrect termination or transfer rate settings, lazy or slow device
responses to relinquish the SCSI bus, a faulty device or, in very rare cases, a
poorly written device driver.

Event 9 and Event 11 Error Messages."
