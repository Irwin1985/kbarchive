The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade Edition, the
following error message may be displayed:

  This upgrade program cannot be used to upgrade a promotional copy of
  Microsoft Exchange Server. You must first install a licensed copy of
  Microsoft Exchange Server.

  Microsoft Exchange Setup
  ID no: c1032695

CAUSE
=====

You are attempting to upgrade an Evaluation Edition of Microsoft Exchange
Server.

WORKAROUND
==========

Option 1:
To directly upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 after using the Evaluation
Edition of Exchange Server 5.5, you must purchase the full copy of Exchange
Server 5.5.

Option 2:
If you mistakenly upgraded your Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0 computer to
Exchange 5.5 using the Exchange Server Evaluation Edition, follow these steps to
correctly upgrade your server using the Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade Edition:

1. Back up your current Exchange Server 5.5 directory and information store.

  Make note of the exact spelling, punctuation, and capitalization of the
  Organization and Site names and verify the Exchange service account. Note the
  locations of the directory and information store EDB, LOG, and CHK files.
  Note which connectors are installed on this server.

2. Run Exchange Server 5.5 Evaluation Edition Setup, and select Remove All. Do
  NOT connect to a server in the site and remove the affected server from the
  site.

3. Run Exchange Server Setup from your original distribution media (either
  Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0).

  When doing the installation, select the Create a New Site option, NOT the Join
  Existing Site option. You must re-install with the exact same Organization
  name, Site Name, and Exchange Service account as noted in step 1. (If
  changing hardware, the machine name must also be the same and the Domain must
  be the same as the original.)

  Be sure to add all connectors that were on the original system so that they
  are upgraded as well. After Setup is complete, run Optimizer to put the
  directory and information store files on the same drives\paths as the
  original.

4. After Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0 Setup has completed, run Setup from your
  Exchange Server 5.5 Upgrade Edition.

5. Restore your Exchange Server 5.5 Evaluation Edition directory and information
  store (which were backed up in step 1). If this is a multi- server site,
  restoring the directory restores the connection to the other servers in the
  site and resumes replication.

For more information on the recovery process, please refer to the Backup and
Restore White Paper available on the Microsoft Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 using the Version Upgrade Edition,
you must own Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0.
