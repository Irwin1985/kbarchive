SYMPTOMS
========

When using the constant vbKeySeparator to evaluate keystrokes in the KeyUp,
KeyDown, or KeyPress event, the comparison always returns False.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual Basic documentation lists a keycode constant of vbKeySeparator. The
value of this constant is 108 (0x6C) and that value corresponds to the ENTER key
on the Numeric Keypad. It also lists the constant vbKeyReturn that has the value
13 (0xD) and corresponds to the ENTER key on the Keyboard. In the KeyDown,
KeyPress, or KeyUp events, the keycode returned is 13 regardless of which ENTER
key is pressed. A test to see if the keycode is equal to 108 will always return
False because 13 is obviously not equal to 108. The result is that there is no
way to determine which ENTER key was depressed.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is possible to differentiate between the two ENTER keys using the Win32 API
PeekMessage. A bitwise comparison can then be made to determine which of the
ENTER keys was pressed.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add the following code to Form1:

        Private Declare Function PeekMessage Lib "user32" Alias _
          "PeekMessageA" (lpMsg As MSG, ByVal hwnd As Long, _
          ByVal wMsgFilterMin As Long, ByVal wMsgFilterMax As Long, _
          ByVal wRemoveMsg As Long) As Long

        Private Type POINTAPI
           x As Long
           y As Long
        End Type

        Private Type MSG
           hwnd As Long
           message As Long
           wParam As Long
           lParam As Long
           time As Long
           pt As POINTAPI
        End Type

        Const PM_NOREMOVE = &amp;H0
        Const WM_KEYDOWN = &amp;H100
        Const WM_KEYUP = &amp;H101
        Const VK_RETURN = &amp;HD

        Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
        Dim MyMsg As MSG, RetVal As Long

        ' pass:
        '   MSG structure to receive message information
        '   my window handle
        '   low and high filter of 0, 0 to trap all messages
        '   PM_NOREMOVE to leave the keystroke in the message queue
        '   use PM_REMOVE (1) to remove it
        RetVal = PeekMessage(MyMsg, Me.hwnd, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE)

        ' now, per Q77550, you should look for a MSG.wParam of VK_RETURN
        ' if this was the keystroke, then test bit 24 of the lparam - if ON,
        ' then keypad was used, otherwise, keyboard was used
        If RetVal &lt;&gt; 0 Then
           If MyMsg.wParam = VK_RETURN Then
              If MyMsg.lParam And &amp;H1000000 Then
                 MsgBox "Enter from Keypad pressed"
              Else
                MsgBox "Enter from Keyboard pressed"
              End If
        End If
        Else
        MsgBox "No message waiting, or possible problems calling PeekMessage"
        End If
        End Sub

3. Run the project and press on both ENTER keys. You will get a message box
  correctly identifying which ENTER key was pressed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add the following code to Form1.

        Private Sub Form_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
        Select Case KeyCode

           Case vbKeyReturn
              MsgBox "KeyCode 13. Keyboard Enter Key Pressed."

           Case vbKeySeparator
              MsgBox "KeyCode 108. NumPad Enter Key Pressed."

        End Select
        End Sub

3. Run the project and press both ENTER keys. Note that the KeyCode is 13
  regardless of which ENTER key is pressed.
