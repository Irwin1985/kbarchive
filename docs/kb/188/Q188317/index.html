The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0sp3 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0sp3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SuperTip sample demonstrates some common uses of tool tips in an MFC
application:

- Tool tip support for toolbars

- How to use EnableToolTips

- A CToolTipCtrl object in a view, creating tools for windows and rectangular
  regions

For each of these tasks, the SuperTip sample demonstrates the default MFC support
for tool tips, as well as how to change tool-tip text at run time.

Task 1: Tool tip support for toolbars
-------------------------------------

To enable tool tips on a toolbar, follow these steps:

1. When calling CToolbar::Create(), pass CBRS_TOOLTIPS in to SetBarStyle(). This
  process is already done for the default toolbar in AppWizard- generated
  projects.

2. For each button on the toolbar, add a string to your string resource table
  corresponding to the button's command ID in the form:

  "This is the fly-by text\nThis is what shows up in the tool tip"

  This process is also done automatically for you by AppWizard. For example,
  ID_FILE_NEW, the first button on the toolbar has the string entry "Create a
  new document\nNew." "New" is the text that shows up in the tool tip. You need
  to add a string to your string resource table corresponding to the button's
  command ID for any buttons or toolbars that you add.

  That's it! Because AppWizard does this for you, by using AppWizard you already
  have a toolbar with working tool tips.

  However, the process is more complicated if you want to change the text shown
  in a tool tip at run time:

3. On the Project menu, click Settings, and click the "C/C++" tab. Choose
  "General" in the Category field; in the Preprocessor Definitions edit box add
  "NO_ANSIUNI_ONLY" (without the quotation marks) as one of the preprocessor
  definitions.

4. Add the following message map entries to the message maps of your CMainFrame
  class and CchildFrame class:

        ON_NOTIFY_EX_RANGE(TTN_NEEDTEXTW, 0, 0xFFFF, OnDynamicTipText)
        ON_NOTIFY_EX_RANGE(TTN_NEEDTEXTA, 0, 0xFFFF, OnDynamicTipText)

  Note that this method is for an MDI application. If your application is SDI,
  you won't have a CChildFrame class.

5. Add a function to both your CMainFrame class and (if MDI) CChildFrame class
  called OnDynamicTipText that handles the TTN_NEEDTEXT notification and enters
  the appropriate text into the NMHDR structure based on the idFrom that comes
  in. Refer to the SuperTip sample for a complete example of how to do this.

Task 2: How to use EnableToolTips
---------------------------------

EnableToolTips is a new MFC version 4.0 function that gives a window with child
controls on it some basic tool tip support. EnableToolTips works well with a
form view, which is what the SuperTip sample demonstrates.

For more information on this task, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140595 DOC: How to Display Tool Tips After Calling EnableToolTips

1. In the OnInitialUpdate() of your view, call EnableToolTips(TRUE);.

2. Add handlers for the TTN_NEEDTEXT notification to your view class only, as
  described in steps 4 and 5 under Task 1 above.

3. If you don't need to dynamically change the tool-tip text at run time, add
  code to your handler to load a string from the string resource table and
  place it in the NMHDR structure. Otherwise, determine in your handler what
  text you want to display and place it in the NMHDR structure.

Task 3: CToolTipCtrl
--------------------

1. Add a CToolTipCtrl object to your view. The SuperTip sample creates a
  CToolTipCtrl object as an embedded member of the CSuperTipView.

2. Call the Create member function of your CToolTipCtrl object. Provide the
  TTS_ALWAYSTIP style if you want the tool tips displayed even when the parent
  window of the tool tip control isn't currently active. Note that tool tips
  for this tool tip control are displayed even when the application isn't
  active and is in the background.

3. Add tools to the CToolTipCtrl object for each desired tip location. There are
  two ways to define the area that causes the tool tip to be displayed:

  a. Specify a rectangular region of the client area of the CToolTipCtrl's
     parent window

  b. Specify that a tool tip show for the entire area of a child window on the
     view.

  Additionally, there are two ways to specify what text to display for the tool
  tip.

  a. Pass in a string that is automatically used for that tool.

  b. Pass in the value defined by LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK. This causes the tool tip
     control to send the notification TTN_NEEDTEXT whenever a tool is about to
     be displayed; this a request that the recipient dynamically supplies a
     string to be displayed.

  LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK is always used when using tool-tip support for toolbars
  (Task 1) or CWnd::EnableToolTips (Task 2). MFC provides a default handler for
  TTN_NEEDTEXT in CframeWnd, which gets the requested string from the string
  resource table. The SuperTip sample intercepts the TTN_NEEDTEXT message so
  that the default MFC handler is never called. The handler function in this
  sample provides the default support (grabs text from string table) or
  supplies some dynamic text. Refer to the Needtext.cpp file to see this
  handler. The SuperTip sample does the following:

  a. The sample adds a tool to the Plain View for a rectangular region with
     pre-specified text (not LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK.)

  b. The sample adds a tool to the Plain View for a rectangular region with
     LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK specified so that our NeedText handler is called.

  c. The sample adds a tool to the Plain View for a child window on the view
     with pre-specified text (not LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK).

  NOTE: When the application is run, the text for the child window and the "Big
  Blue Rectangle" doesn't change when "Dynamic Tips" are selected on the menu.
  This is because the tool tips associated with child window and the Big Blue
  Rectangle do not specify LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK. If you changed the AddTool calls
  to use LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK, then tool tips for these two items would display
  text similar to other tools in this application.

4. Relay messages to the tool tip control so that it can determine when to show
  the tool tip using the RelayEvent member function of CToolTipCtrl.

5. If you specify LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK for any of the tools that you add to your
  tool-tip control, you need to provide a handler for the TTN_NEEDTEXT(A/W)
  messages in the view.

  Because the TTN_NEEDTEXT message is sent through MFC's command routing
  architecture, there can be some confusion as to what handler is being called.
  The SuperTip sample routes all TTN_NEEDTEXT notifications to a single handler
  function, NeedText(). NeedText handles requests for tool-tip text in a
  general way, whether the tool tip is for a toolbar button, a child window, a
  rectangular area, and so on.

  Technically, if you have the handles for the WM_NEEDTEXT(A/W) messages in your
  frame windows as added in Tasks 1 and 2, the TTN_NEEDTEXT notification finds
  a handler anyway. The handlers in SuperTipView are included here only for
  completeness.

6. In MFC versions 4.0 and 4.1, all CToolTipCtrl objects in an application are
  deactivated when a modal dialog box is created. The CtoolTipCtrl objects are
  not reactivated when the dialog box goes away. To correct this problem, the
  SuperTip sample calls Activate(TRUE) before relaying any messages to the
  tool-tip control.

NOTE: There are several problems in versions of VC++ earlier than VC++ 5.0,
Service Pack 3 (SP3), involving tool tips that cause SuperTip sample to work
incorrectly. For more information, please see the following articles in the
