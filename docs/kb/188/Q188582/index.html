-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic 6.0 allows an ActiveX control to require a design-time license in
order for it to be used in a development environment. This license is not
automatically included when the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) packages the
control for distribution.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When packaging an ActiveX control that has been developed with Visual Basic 6.0,
the license for the control can be included in the distribution. This means that
whomever installs this control can then use the control for development
(design-time), and include it their own projects and applications.

When the "Require License Key" option is selected as a Project Property, the
ActiveX control cannot be used within a development environment unless the
control's license has been installed upon that system.

By default, compiling an ActiveX control with the "Require License Key" option
selected will generate a license for that control and install it on that system.
This allows the control to be used in a development environment on that machine
without any extra work by the developer.

Distributing the ActiveX control with the Package and Deployment Wizard does not
automatically bring the license along with the control. Choosing the default
options with the PDW will simply create a run-time setup for the control (the
control will install and programs can use it during run- time, but end users
cannot develop with the control). Attempting to use the control in a design
environment without the proper license will result in the following error:

  License information for this component not found. You do not have an
  appropriate license to use this functionality in the design environment.

Adding the Design License to an ActiveX Control Distribution Set
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX control in Visual Basic.

2. Select Properties from the Project menu, then select General. Check the
  "Require License Key" option.

3. Add the following code to the UserControl1 object:

        Private Sub UserControl_Initialize()
           UserControl.BackColor = vbBlue
        End Sub

4. Save the project and make the OCX.

5. On the original development machine, start the Package and Deployment Wizard.

6. Go through the setup as you normally would until you get to the step "Package
  And Deployment Wizard - Included Files."

7. Click the "Add" button. You will then be allowed to add files to the
  distribution set.

8. Change the "Files Of Type" filter to "License Files."

9. Select the VBL file that is associated with your test ActiveX Control
  (Project1) and then continue.

10. There will be a new dialog "Package And Deployment Wizard - Registry
  Information." This appears because of the VBL file. For this Demonstration,
  select the default action of "Update Registry." This option will install the
  license for the ActiveX control into the system's registry and there is no
  need for a file to be installed.

11. Continue through the wizard, selecting the default settings.

12. Install the ActiveX control onto a second development machine.

The ActiveX control can now be used in a design environment. You can test this by
creating a new project in Visual Basic on the second development machine and
adding the control to a form.
