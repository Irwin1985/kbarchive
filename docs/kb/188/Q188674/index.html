The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to bring the Microsoft Exchange Directory resource online after
an online restore, the resource will not start and enters a failed state. The
Application Event Log reports an event 1002.

CAUSE
=====

When a service is brought online, the state of the registry is restored to the
last known good state. This is the state of the registry prior to the failure
and is known as a Registry CheckPoint. During an online restore, the backup
program adds the registry key "Restore in Progress". This key is required to
recover from an online restore. Because of the Registry CheckPoint process in
Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS), the Restore in Progress key is overwritten.
When the directory service is brought online, the Exchange database engine does
not find a Restore in Progress Key and enters the normal initialization process.
The Exchange database engine is expecting to find a consecutive log sequence to
include an EDB.log file. Because this is not the case, the Exchange database
engine fails to initialize with a -528 JET_errMissingLogFile.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you are restoring to a cluster setup of Exchange, use the Start Services
after Restore option. As an alternative, you can start the Microsoft directory
service from the Services dialog box in Control Panel. This process will
preserve the Restore in Progress key and allow the Exchange database engine to
read this key and initialize properly. As a final step, go into Cluster
Administrator and bring the Microsoft Exchange directory resource online. This
produces the following System Event log entry, which can be ignored:

  Event ID 1024
  Source:  ClusSvc
  Type: Error
  Category:  (64)

  Description:
  The registry checkpoint for cluster resource Microsoft Exchange
  Directory could not be restored to registry key
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS. The
  resource may not function correctly. Make sure that no other processes
  have open handles to registry keys in this registry subtree.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Registry CheckPoint process in MSCS overwrites the Restore in Progress
key, the following events are logged:

  System Log
  ==========
  Event ID:  1042
  Source: ClusSvc
  Type: Error
  Category (2050)
  Description:
  Cluster generic service 'Microsoft Exchange Directory' failed.

  Application Log
  ===============
  Event ID: 1002
  Source:  MSExchangeDS
  Type: Error
  Category: Internal Processing
  Description:
  The Microsoft Exchange Server database (EDB) could not be initialized
  and returned error -528. Unrecoverable error, the directory can't
  continue.

CheckPoint, see Knowledge Base article Q174070.
