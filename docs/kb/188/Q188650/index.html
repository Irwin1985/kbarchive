-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After restoring only the private information store database of Exchange Server
to a recovery computer, the information store service will fail to start with
server specific error 3355445011. This failure will occur using ARCServe version
6.5, Build 620, with the Exchange Agent version 2.0, Build 53.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of the failure is an incorrect setting in the Restore In Progress key
in the registry during the restore process.

WORKAROUND
==========

After restoring the information store with the ARCServe program, and before
starting the information store service, the registry will need to be modified in
two places.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your EmergencyRepair Disk
(ERD).

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS
   \Restore in Progress

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Double-click on the EDB_RstMap entry, and delete the two lines that reference
  the Pub.edb file, then click OK.

4. Double-click on the EDB_RstMap Size entry, and change the value from 0x2 to
  0x1, then click OK.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: There is no need to restart the Exchange Server computer after this change
has been made to the Registry.

The information store service should now be able to start.
