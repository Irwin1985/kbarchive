-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Systems Management Server inventory (either by running the
Smsls.bat logon script at startup or by manually running the Runsms.bat file) on
a client computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98, you may receive either of
the following error messages:

- Runtime error R6005 not enough memory on exec

  -or-

- Runtime error R6009 not enough space for environment

CAUSE
=====

A version of McAfee VShield earlier than 3.18 is installed on the system.
Earlier versions of VShield may consume more memory, which may not allow Systems
Management Server inventory to run.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can change the load order so that Systems
Management Server inventory runs before the VShield software is loaded. This
will allow inventory to be run at startup, by means of SMSLS. To do this,
perform the following steps:

1. From the McAfee VirusScan95 group, run the VShield Configuration Manager.

2. Click the Detection tab. In the General section, click to disable the 'Load
  VShield At Startup' option.


3. Create a shortcut to Vshwin32.exe and place it in the Startup group, so that
  VShield continues to load automatically when the computer is started.

4. Restart the computer.

NOTE: If you require the ability to run inventory after VShield is running, you
can try setting VShield to "Scan Only *.EXE Files". Doing this may allow Systems
Management Server to run inventory by means of RUNSMS, but may not always work.
