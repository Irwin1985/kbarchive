SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Windows Script Host (WSH) in Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WSH is a language-independent scripting host for 32-bit Windows platforms.
Microsoft provides both Microsoft Visual Basic Script and Java Script scripting
engines with WSH. It serves as a controller of ActiveX scripting engines, just
as Microsoft Internet Explorer does. Because the scripting host is not a full
Internet browser, it has a smaller memory footprint than Internet Explorer;
therefore, WSH is appropriate for performing simple, quick tasks. Scripts can be
run directly from the desktop by double-clicking a script file, or from a
command prompt. WSH provides a low-memory scripting host that is ideal for
non-interactive scripting needs such as logon scripting, administrative
scripting, and so on. WSH can be run from either the protected-mode
Windows-based host (Wscript.exe), or the real-mode command shell-based host
(Cscript.exe).

Installing Windows Script Host
------------------------------

To install the Windows Script Host, please see the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm?/scripting/windowshost/download/default.htm

NOTE: Windows Script Host is included in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.


Running Scripts
---------------

To run scripts from within Windows, you can use one of the following methods:

- Double-click a .vbs or .js file.

- Click Start, click Run, and then type the name of a .vbs or .js file in the
  Open box.

NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.0 and later treat WSH objects as unsafe ActiveX
controls. If a Web site tries to initialize or script a WSH object (for example,
to access files on your local computer), Internet Explorer does not initialize
or script the object at high or medium security settings and provides the
following warnings at low security:

Internet Explorer 5:

  Some software (ActiveX controls) on this page might be unsafe. It is
  recommended that you not run it. Do you want to allow it to run?

Internet Explorer 4.0, 4.01, 4.01 Service Pack 1:

  An ActiveX object on this page may be unsafe. Do you want to allow it to
  initialize and be accessed by scripts?

To enable Internet Explorer 4.0 or later to initialize and script WSH objects
from a Web page without warnings (not recommended), select a custom setting for
the security zone where the Web page resides, and enable the Initialize and
script ActiveX controls not marked as safe option.

Note that Web sites can also create links to .vbs or .js files on a Web page.
When you click such a link in Internet Explorer, a File Download dialog box
appears prompting you (by default) to either open the file from its current
location or save the file to disk. If you click Open, the file is downloaded and
run from your local file system bypassing Internet Explorer's security
settings.

IMPORTANT: If you click Open in the File Download dialog box and click the Always
ask before opening this type of file check box to clear it, Internet Explorer no
longer prompts you with a File Download dialog box. To cause Internet Explorer
to prompt you with a File Download dialog box again, follow these steps:

1. In My Computer, click Folder Options on the View menu.

2. On the File Types tab, select the appropriate registered file type (.vbs or
  .js).

3. Click Edit, and then click the Confirm open after download check box to
  select it.

4. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Several "HTML viruses" have been reported to use WSH objects. For example,
HTML.Internal (or HTML.Prepend), HTML.Offline, and HTML.Redirect.Companion.
Anti-virus software should not be necessary to protect you from such viruses
provided you follow safe computing practices (including not installing software
or scripts from unknown and untrusted sources). Viruses that use WSH objects do
not expose or exploit any security issue regarding the Windows or Internet
Explorer suite of products. Anytime you install software or run scripts from
unknown or untrusted sources, you risk compromising your computer.


Minimum Requirements for WSH
----------------------------

The minimum requirement for WSH to function is Internet Explorer version 3.0 or
later. WSH relies on the Visual Basic Script and Java Script engines provided in
Internet Explorer.

Troubleshooting WSH
-------------------

Several sample scripts are installed in the Windows\Samples\WSH folder. If these
scripts run correctly, but others do not, contact the author of the script for
support. Support and additional information is also available on the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/windowshost/default.htm
