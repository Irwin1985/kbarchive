-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to inventory software, you are unable to query files with a file
date of year 2000. The Systems Management Server Administrator program allows
you to select a date in the year 2000 in the File Date dialog box, but after
clicking OK, the DATE property is not recorded.

For this problem to occur, the file date must have a value between 1/1/00 and
12/31/00. Requesting a file with a date value outside that range works
correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

This fix should have the following file attributes:

  Date     Time    Size    File Name Platform
  -------------------------------------------

  7/3/98  4:37pm   369KB   BASE3.DLL  Intel
  7/3/98  4:25pm   625KB   BASE3.DLL  Alpha



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server, all workstations where the Systems Management Server
Administrator is installed, and the Remote Administrator console. If you are on
a remote workstation and have not applied the hotfix to the Remote Administrator
console, it may not display the changes.

1. Close the Systems Management Server Administrator Console.

2. Stop the following Systems Management Server Services on the site server:

  SMS_EXECUTIVE
  SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER
  SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER

3. Replace the Base3.dll file in the &lt;SMS_root_directory&gt;\Site.srv\x86.bin
  directory on the site server or in the Systems Management Server
  Administrator installation directory on a standalone administrator computer.

4. Restart the Systems Management Server Administrator Console.

5. Restart the Systems Management Server Services stopped in step 2.

You can also install the hotfix files on a site server by running Hotfix.exe with
the hotfix files and the provided Hotfix.ini file for your platform after you
stop the required services.
