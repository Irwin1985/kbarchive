IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Pool damage may be the root cause of many of the most evasive issues with
Windows NT. Pool damage is caused when a kernel-mode component writes to memory
outside of its allocated pool area. By writing to memory beyond the boundary of
its allocated area, it is likely that another area of allocated memory, possibly
owned by another component, is overwritten. This damage can cause problems such
as blue screens in completely unrelated areas of code. A kernel-mode component
reading beyond its allocated area can also cause problems.

Whether it is caused by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) drivers or
problems in Windows NT, pool damage problems are some of the most difficult to
identify. Usually, all that can be seen in a crash dump analysis is the symptom
of the real problem, such as a data area becoming damaged and causing problems
in a completely unrelated piece of code. Up until now it has been almost
impossible to identify the piece of code damaging the memory.

The source of pool damage can now be identified at the instruction causing the
pool damage. A new memory management utility called Special Pool is included
with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) and Windows 2000. The Special Pool
utility identifies the kernel-mode component that is damaging pool data by
writing to memory outside its allocated area.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The way the Special Pool utility works is by allocating two pages of virtual
memory for every pool allocation requested through ExAllocatePoolWithTag that
matches the following criteria:

- The allocation request must be for a size smaller than the maximum allocation
  that will fit in a pool page.

- The request must match the PoolTag specification in the registry.

For pool overrun detection, the first page is used to contain the allocation at
the end of the page. The second page is a guard page. For pool underrun
detection, the first page is the guard page. It is followed by a page that
contains the allocation at the beginning of the page.

Overrun detection is probably the most used. For overrun detection, the requested
allocation is placed at the end of the first page by backing up the request size
from the end of the page. The allocation size is rounded up to an 8-byte
boundary. A pattern key, the size, and the pool tag information are written to
the header at the first eight bytes of the first page. The pattern is also
propagated throughout the page. Since the allocation is placed on the nearest
8-byte boundary, there may be as many as seven slop bytes following the
allocation. The pattern is also written to the slop bytes following the
allocation.

The second page is the guard page. The guard page consists of a special page
table entry (PTE) that is marked with no-access protection. By marking this
second page with no-access protection, any code attempting to read or write
beyond the end of the first page immediately causes an access violation
resulting in a Stop 0x0000000A or Stop 0x0000001E error. This enables someone
debugging the system to identify the exact instruction causing pool damage.

As a backup check to catch violators that write beyond the end of the allocation
but not beyond the end of the page, the slop bytes at the end of the allocation
are validated during the free pool request (ExFreePoolWithTag). The slop bytes
are compared to the pattern in the allocation header to verify if anything is
overwritten in the slop byte area. If the verification check does not work, a
Stop 0x00000001A error occurs.

This check does not necessarily identify the exact piece of code causing the pool
damage, but it may assist in identifying the component causing the damage.

To activate the Special Pool utility, add the following keys and values to the
registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\ 
     Memory Management

  Value Name: PoolTag
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data      : Pool tag mask | Allocation size mask | 0

The pool tag mask is the pool tag ID containing masking characters of the pool in
which you want to put in the special pool. This mask must be specified in
hexadecimal in reverse order. This mask may also contain "?" to mask a single
character or "*" to mask from here to the end of the tag. For example, to
monitor all pools with a pool tag beginning with "Nt", specify "2A744E" (without
the quotation marks), which represents "*tN".

The following table lists more examples:

  Pool to monitor   Character representation   Pool tag mask
  ----------------------------------------------------------               
  All pools         "*"                        0x2A
  N??s              "s??N"                     0x733F3F4E

Allocation size mask specification places all pool allocations of a specified
size into the special pool. This is also specified in hexadecimal. For example,
if all allocations of 32 bytes are placed in the special pool, specify 0x20.

When zero (0x0) is specified, the Special Pool utility is not initialized. In
addition, the Special Pool utility is not initialized if the PoolTag registry
value is not defined in the registry.

  Value Name: PoolTagOverruns
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data:    1 | 0

"1" indicates that pool allocation overruns are detected for the tag specified.
The allocation is placed at the end of the page and the guard page follows.

Common use examples to create these two registry keys would be:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\ 
     Memory Management

  Value Name: PoolTag
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data      : 0x2A

  Value Name: PoolTagOverruns
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data      : 1

"0" indicates that pool allocation underruns are detected for the tag specified.
The allocation is placed at the beginning of the page and the guard page
precedes the page that contains the allocation.

NOTE: For Windows NT Terminal Server 4.0, you need to disable KStackPool when
using special pool. To do this, add the following registry value:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
  Management

  EnableKStackPool
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  0 - KStack pool disabled
  1 - KStack pool always enabled
  2 - KStack pool enabled for &gt;= 256 MB computers (default)

If you do not make this change on Terminal Server computers with &gt;=256 MB, you
may receive STOP 0x00000078 (PHASE0_EXCEPTION) error messages.

NOTE: After you make any of the registry changes described in this article,
reboot the computer to cause the changes to take effect.

If after you enable the Special Pool feature, the computer stops responding
(hangs) with an error message on a blue screen during startup, reboot the
computer and start it by using the Last Known Good Configuration option.
Enabling the Special Pool feature is not written to the Last Known Good
Configuration entry in the registry until after a successful logon.
