The GRAPHICS.COM utility [a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program]
provided with MS-DOS Versions 2.x through 3.x supports printing of
graphics in CGA SCREEN modes 1 and 2 to Epson-compatible printers, but
does NOT support printing Hercules graphics SCREEN 3. [While
GRAPHICS.COM provided with MS-DOS 4.00 supports screen dumps to Epson
printers for EGA and VGA SCREEN modes (7 through 13), it still doesn't
support Hercules.]

A TSR can be obtained from Hercules Computer Technology that may
enable printing Hercules graphics screens. Details on obtaining this
TSR are given below.

This article applies to QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, to
Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS, and to
Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

Once you have installed GRAPHICS.COM, the graphics screen dump ability
is enabled for the PRINT SCREEN key (or SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN on
nonenhanced keyboards) and for the equivalent CALL to hardware
interrupt 5. However, GRAPHICS.COM doesn't support Hercules graphics
SCREEN 3. Hercules memory is arranged in a fashion incompatible with
GRAPHICS.COM.

Hercules Computer Technology provides two TSR software drivers that
allow dumping either page of Hercules graphics memory to a printer.
HGC and HPRINT are available as a combined set by calling Hercules
Technical Support at (415) 540-0749. These drivers work correctly with
the IBM EGA or VGA graphics.

Microsoft has not officially tested these products with QuickBASIC and
makes no guarantees of compatibility. According to customers who have
these drivers, they work properly with QuickBASIC Version 4.00. As
always, you should be careful using any memory-resident program with
QuickBASIC.

As an alternative to the above products, if you would like a
QuickBASIC program that can perform a Hercules graphics screen dump,
search for the following words:

   Hercules and Epson and screen and print and QuickBASIC

Note: QuickBASIC versions earlier than Version 4.00 have no support
for Hercules-monochrome graphics adapters.

Hercules-compatible monochrome graphics is provided in QuickBASIC 4.00
and later. Hercules graphics mode is invoked with SCREEN 3. To invoke
SCREEN 3, the Hercules support-driver must be loaded. This driver is
called QBHERC.COM in QuickBASIC Versions 4.00 and 4.00b and in the
BASIC compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b. This driver is called
MSHERC.COM in QuickBASIC 4.50 and in BASIC PDS 7.00.
