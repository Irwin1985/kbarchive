IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Client Setup may not start on a Windows 2000-based domain controller because the
replication of the SMS#_&lt;DCname&gt; account creation takes longer than 60
minutes on a large Windows 2000 Active Directory site. The same symptoms occur
if the replication for the temporary bootstrap account succeeds in time and the
SMS#_&lt;DCname&gt;client service account is created.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS#_&lt;DCname&gt; account is created by the CCM thread of the SMS
Executive service after the thread receives a client configuration request for
the target system. The Systems Management Server (SMS) Client Configuration
Manager (CCM) Client Bootstrap is started with this account to start the client
installation on the domain controller. After startup, the Bootstrap service
creates the SMS&amp;&lt;DCname&gt; account, which is used by the Client service
to spawn the client agents in a separate account context.

Both accounts are created only when the SMS client is installed on a domain
controller and needs the "Logon as a service," "Act as part of the operating
system," "Create objects," "Increase quotas," and "Shut down system" user
rights. These rights are assigned after the account creation. The client code
waits a maximum of 60 minutes for the account replication between the primary
domain controller (the PDC emulator in Windows 2000 Active Directory) and backup
domain controller. Because of the architectural changes in Windows 2000, the
replication may take longer than 60 minutes and the client installation may not
work on a Windows 2000-based domain controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.


MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You must configure a time-out value on the primary domain controller (PDC)
emulator in Windows 2000 Active Directory because the client installation reads
the value directly from the PDC's registry. You need to insert the registry
value only on the PDC emulator. To determine which computer is the PDC
emulator:

1. Start the Active Directory Users and Computers administrative tool.

2. Right-click the domain, and then click Operations Master.

3. The PDC emulator is listed on the PDC tab under Operations Master.

To configure the time-out value, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) on the PDC emulator only.

2. Locate and click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Domain
  Controller

3. Add the following value :

  Value name: Account Synchronization Max Wait (minutes)
  Data type: DWORD
  Value: 60 is the default; set the value depending on the domain replication
  interval or use 300 minutes (5 hours) as a start point.
