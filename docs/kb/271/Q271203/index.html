SUMMARY
=======

This article describes issues that occur when you use Clone Principal to move
user accounts. When you use Clone Principal, user accounts have two Security ID
numbers (SIDs), the SID for the previous Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 domain, and an
SID for Windows 2000 Active Directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you select a user that has Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator accounts in
Microsoft Windows 2000 Active Directory, if you have moved Active Directory by
using Clone Principal, the user account may resolve to the new Active Directory
account even if you selected the previous Windows NT 4.0 account. If you select
the account from the Windows NT 4.0 domain, the account is displayed correctly.
If you select a Windows 2000 account from the Windows NT 4.0 domain, the account
is also displayed correctly.

The following scenario is an example of this behavior:

You have a user that was in the previous domain called WindowsNT4_DOM/user1. That
user was moved to the Windows 2000 domain by using Clone Principal and now has
two SIDs:

- One for the WindowsNT4_DOM/user1 account

- One for the new Windows2000_DOM/user1 account

From the Windows 2000 domain:

You have used the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to associate
the Windows NT account for the mailbox of User1 with the WindowsNT4_DOM/user1
account. However, if you click the user account, and then click Apply, the
account is resolved as the Windows2000_DOM/user1 account. This behavior occurs
because the Administrator program gets its information from the Active Directory
database; the Administrator program selects the first returned account for the
SID, which is the new Windows2000_DOM account. The accounts both share the SID
so that the user is able to log on to the mailbox and authenticate
successfully.

From a Windows NT 4.O domain:

When you run the Administrator program on a Windows NT 4.0-based server in the
Windows NT 4.0 domain, if you select the user from the Windows NT 4.0 domain,
the account is resolved correctly. In addition, if you select the account from
Windows2000_DOM/user1, the account also works correctly and displays
"Windows2000_DOM/user1" in the associated Windows NT account dialog box.

This behavior is by design.
