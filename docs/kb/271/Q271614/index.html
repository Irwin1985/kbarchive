-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Calendar Connector for Novell GroupWise from an Exchange Server
computer to obtain the free and busy information of a GroupWise user, some
appointments in the near future may not be marked as busy.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Calendar Connector uses a hard-coded time zone
of +0 for all requests. If a user on the west coast of the United States
requests free and busy information, the free and busy window that the user
requested starts at the current time minus eight hours (because -8 is the
current time zone). In effect, the user receives eight hours of extra free and
busy information before the user needs that information.

However, if a user on the west coast of Australia requests the same information,
the free and busy window that the user requested is eight hours in the future
(because +8 is the current time zone). The next eight hours is displayed as
free, even though appointments may be scheduled during that time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
