CD-ROM: Duwamish Files Are Not Included
---------------------------------------

The Duwamish files mentioned on pages 51-56 are not included on the companion
CD-ROM. These files are available for download from the Microsoft Developer
Network (MSDN) web site at:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/default.asp.


CD-ROM: Missing Code Sample Files For Chapter 4 Exercise 2
----------------------------------------------------------

The files in C:\DISV\Labs\Ch04\Ex02 do not match the exercise in the book as
outlined on pages 201-210. The DISVCh4X2.EXE self-extracting executable file
contains the correct sample files for this exercise.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DISVCh4X2.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc60pro/DISVC4X2/1.0/WIN98/EN-US/DISVCh4X2.exe)

Page 212: Replace Parentheses With Brackets
-------------------------------------------

On page 212, Steps 4 and 5 should have brackets after the code statement rather
than parentheses. Change:

  if(Dib.Load(&amp;DibFile))
  )

To:

  if(Dib.Load(&amp;DibFile))
  {

Also change:

  CDIBPal* pTemp = new CDIBPal;
  ASSERT(pTemp != NULL);
  if(pTemp-&gt;Create(&amp;Dib))
  )

To:

  CDIBPal* pTemp = new CDIBPal;
  ASSERT(pTemp != NULL);
  if(pTemp-&gt;Create(&amp;Dib))
  {


Pages 281 and 282: Code Errors
------------------------------

On page 281, in the second line from the bottom,

Change:

  return m_pParent-&gt;QueryInterface(riid,ppv);

To:

  return m_pParent-&gt;InternalQueryInterface(riid,ppv);

On page 282, in the third line

Change:

  return m_pParent-&gt;AddRef();

To:

  return m_pParent-&gt;InternalAddRef();

On page 282, in the seventh line,

Change:

  return m_pParent-&gt;Release();

To:

  return m_pParent-&gt;InternalRelease();


Pages 298 and 776: Incorrect Question And Answer
------------------------------------------------

On pages 298 and 776, change question 4, and its answer, as follows.

On page 298 change the question from:
4. What are the four interfaces that every COM class must implement?

To:
4. What is the interface that all COM classes must support?

On page 776, change the question and corresponding answer from:
4. What are the four interfaces that every COM class must implement?
IUnknown, QueryInterface, AddRef, and Release are the standard interfaces
developed by Microsoft for use with COM, as opposed to any custom interfaces
that you develop within your own code.

To:
4 What is the interface that all COM classes must support?
IUnknown is the interface that all COM classes must support. All interfaces
inherit from IUnknown. The methods of IUnknown are QueryInterface, AddRef, and
Release."
