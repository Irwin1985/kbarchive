-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you set up intersite directory replication in an Exchange Server 5.5
organization, directory replication may run successfully and then stop
responding. The bridgehead server in one site cannot send requests or retrieve
any incoming requests that are in the directory service mailbox. In addition,
the following event ID message may be logged in the Application event log:

  Event ID: 1091
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Warning
  Category: Replication
  Description: The directory replication agent (DRA) attempted to open mail with
  name
  /o=Organization/ou=SITE/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=ServerName/cn=Microsoft
  DSA ServerName but received error 2147942414. Messages could not be sent.
  Make sure that the mail service on this Microsoft Exchange Server computer is
  running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior:

1. Open Control Panel, and then quit the Microsoft Exchange Server Directory
  Service.

2. Use the Mdbvu32.exe program to empty the directory service mailbox. Refer to
  the "More Information" section in this article for detailed steps about how
  to use Mdbvu32.exe.

3. Quit the Network Associates GroupShield service.

  NOTE: If you quit the Network Associates GroupShield service and it does not
  resolve the issue, remove GroupShield.

4. In Control Panel, start the Microsoft Exchange Server Directory Service.

This behavior can also be related to Norton AntiVirus. Use the same resolution to
resolve that behavior, but substitute Norton AntiVirus where Groupshield is
mentioned.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use Mdbvu32.exe successfully, create a profile for the directory service
mailbox, and then run Mdbvu32.exe.

IMPORTANT: Before you begin, back up the directory service mailbox and private
information store.

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

First, create a profile for the service mailbox folder:

1. Log on to the computer that runs Windows NT Server as the Exchange service
  account.

2. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in Raw mode. To do
  so, type "admin /r" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt, and
  then press ENTER.

3. In the left pane, under the appropriate site, click to expand the
  Configuration object, click to expand the Servers object, and then click the
  appropriate server.

4. In the right pane, click the Directory Service object.

5. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

6. In the raw properties for the Directory Service object, in the List
  Attributes Of Type box, click Optional.

7. In the Object Attributes list, click Display Name.

8. In the Edit Value box, type "&lt;servername&gt;DS" (without the quotation
  marks), where &lt;servername&gt; is the name of your server.

9. Click Set, and then click Apply.

10. In the Object Attributes list, click Obj-Dist-Name.

11. Click all of the text in the Edit Value box, and then press CTRL+C to copy
  the text to the clipboard.

12. Click OK to close the raw properties for the Directory Service object.

13. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Mail.

  NOTE: If the Mail icon is not displayed in Control Panel, install the
  Exchange Server client. Click the Show Profiles button in the dialog box
  that is displayed. If a Show Profiles button is not displayed, proceed to
  the next step.

14. Click Add, click to select the Microsoft Exchange Server check box, and then
  click Next.

15. If you are prompted to specify a profile name, type "&lt;servername&gt;DS"
  (without the quotation marks), where &lt;servername&gt; is the name of your
  server, and then click Next.

16. In the Microsoft Exchange Server dialog box, type the name of the server.

17. In the Mailbox box, press CTRL+V to paste the text that you copied in step
  11, and then click Next.

18. Proceed through the remainder of the wizard. When you finish the wizard, you
  automatically return to the General tab for profiles.

19. Click the new profile, and then click Properties.

20. In the list of information services, click Microsoft Exchange Server, and
  then click Properties.

21. On the General tab, click Check Name. The server and mailbox resolve.

  NOTE:The display name that you specified in step 8 is displayed in the
  Mailbox box, and both the server and mailbox are underlined.

22. Click OK, click OK again, and then click Close.

Next, use Mdbvu32.exe to remove messages from the directory service mailbox:

1. Run Mdbvu32.exe. The file is located in the Server\Support\Utils folder on
  the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM.

2. In the MAPILogonEx(MAPI_LOGON_UI) dialog box, click to select the following
  check boxes, and then click OK:

   - MAPI_NEW_SESSION

   - MAPI_EXPLICIT_PROFILE

   - MAPI_NO_MAIL

3. After you receive a prompt to select a profile, click the profile that you
  created for the directory service mailbox. If you were prompted to specify a
  profile name when you created the profile, the profile name is
  &lt;servername&gt;DS, where &lt;servername&gt; is the name of your server.

4. In the MDB Viewer Test Application window, click OpenMessageStore on the MDB
  menu.

5. In the Select Message Store to Open dialog box, click the entry for the
  directory service mailbox, and then click Open.

6. In the MDB Viewer Test Application window, click Open Root Folder on the MDB
  menu.

7. In the MAPI_FOLDER - Root dialog box, double-click "Top of Information Store"
  in the Child Folders box.

8. In the "MAPI_FOLDER - Top of Information Store" dialog box, double-click
  Inbox in the Child Folders box.

  In the MAPI_FOLDER - Inbox dialog box that is displayed, the messages that are
  waiting for a response in the directory service mailbox are displayed in the
  Messages In Folder box. This box may take some time to populate. Each message
  is displayed in the following format:

  Replication Message &lt;version number&gt;

NOTE: The time it takes for the box to populate depends on the number of messages
that are backed up in the mailbox.

9. Click the message that you want to delete.

10. In the Operations available box, click IpFld -&gt; DeleteMessages().

11. Click Call Function to delete the selected message.

12. Repeat steps 9 through 11 for any additional messages that you want to
  delete.

  NOTE: You can delete multiple messages at the same time by using either the
  CTRL or SHIFT key to select multiple messages in step 9.

13. After you delete all the messages that you want to delete and there are no
  replication messages in the Inbox, click Close three times to return to the
  MDB Viewer Test Application window.

14. Click Session Logoff on the Session menu, and then click OK in the
  IpMDB-&gt;StoreLogoff() dialog box.

Finally, open Control Panel, double-click Mail, and then delete the profile that
you created for the directory service mailbox.
