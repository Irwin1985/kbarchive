SYMPTOMS
========

Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set (HKSCS) is a package that was developed
for the Hong Kong government that contains about 4,768 characters in addition to
the Traditional Chinese characters.

Some characters in HKSCS cannot be displayed in Windows NT 4.0. This issue could
also affect other fonts in Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000.

CAUSE
=====

When you try to display a character that is not in the original font but is in a
linked font, the character should be displayed from the linked font. However,
Graphics Device Interface (GDI) assumes that the original font has the glyph for
that character. The linked font is not used, and a space is displayed for the
character.

==========
