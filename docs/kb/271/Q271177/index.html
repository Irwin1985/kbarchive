-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC Driver for Access, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.5, 2.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Microsoft Access ODBC driver, you can repair or compact a Microsoft
Access database. This functionality is accessable from the ODBC Control Panel,
through the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box. This repair and compact
functionality works correctly for non-password protected databases. However,
when you attempt to repair or compact password protected databases, the repair
or compact fails with the following error message:

  Not a valid password

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is fixed in the latest service packs for Windows 2000 and MDAC
2.5.

- To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
  additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

- To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Data
  Access Components 2.5. For additional information, please see the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q293312 INFO: How to Obtain the Latest MDAC 2.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date        Version     Size     File name      Platform
  --------------------------------------------------------
  08/29/2000  4.0.5629.0  270,608  Odbcjt32.dll   x86 





WORKAROUND
==========

One workaround is to use the JetComp tool that is included with Microsoft Jet
4.0 Service Pack 4. JetComp is a standalone tool that allows you to repair and
compact a Microsoft Access database, even if Microsoft Access is not installed
on the computer.

Starting with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6, MDAC no longer
contains the following Jet components:

- Microsoft Jet
- Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider
- ODBC Desktop Database Drivers

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q239114 ACC2000: Updated Version of Microsoft Jet 4.0 Available in Download
  Center

The "MDAC 2.5 Stack and Windows File Protection" white paper contains a full list
of the components that are shipped with MDAC 2.5, along with a discussion of
Windows File Protection. Refer to this white paper for more information about
the Jet dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are included in MDAC 2.5, which are
no longer a part of MDAC 2.6.

For more information about MDAC 2.5 and Windows File Protection, see the
following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data/mdacwfp.htm

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Microsoft Data Access Components 2.5 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft Windows 2000
Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Using Microsoft Access, create a password protected database named
  C:\Password.mdb on a computer that has Microsoft Access 2000 and Microsoft
  Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5 installed.

2. Double-click Password.mdb and note that a Password dialog box appears.

3. Type in your password and press ENTER. You should be able to open the
  database.

4. Open the ODBC Data Source Administrator in Control Panel and click the Add
  button.

5. Select "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)," and then click Finish.

6. Click the Advanced... button and enter your password in the Password dialog
  box. Click OK.

7. Click the Repair... button and select the database file created in step 1,
  and then click OK.

Note that the following error message occurs:

  "Not a valid password"
