SYMPTOMS
========

This article lists the minimum NTFS access permissions that are needed for an
IIS 5.0 Web site. When IIS is installed, it should already have the proper NTFS
access permissions for the default Web site and the default FTP site. There are
a number of different folders that need the correct NTFS permissions. Incorrect
settings on any one of these can cause one or more of the following errors:

In the Web browser:

  You are not authorized to view this page
  You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the
  credentials you supplied.

  HTTP 401.3 - Access denied by ACL on resource Internet Information Services

-or-

In the Web browser:

  Server Application Error
  The server has encountered an error while loading an application during the
  processing of your request. Please refer to the event log for more detailed
  information. Please contact the server administrator for assistance.

CAUSE
=====

NTFS permissions have been changed from the default settings and are no longer
sufficient for IIS 5.0 to run properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: Following the steps in this article restricts permissions so that only
Administrators are able to install or run software on the IIS 5.0 computer.
After you reset the permissions as specified in this article, it may be
necessary to perform a Check Server Extensions task for each Web site through
Internet Service Manager. This step is necessary in order for FrontPage clients
to be able to connect by using the HTTP protocol.

Using Windows Explorer, follow these steps:

1. Reset the entire hard drive to the following:

  SYSTEM - Full Control
  ADMINISTRATORS - Full Control

To do this, click Advanced and select Reset permissions on all child objects and
enable propagation of inheritable permissions.

NOTE: You will receive an error message when you attempt to apply permissions to
the Pagefile.sys file. Click Continue for this and any similar error messages.

2. For Program Files\Common Files, add Everyone and select Read &amp; Execute,
  List Folder Contents, and Read.

NOTE: Do not clear the Allow inheritable permissions from parent to propagate to
this object check box.

3. For Inetpub\Wwwroot, add IUSR_MACHINE and select Read &amp; Execute, List
  Folder Contents, and Read.

NOTE: Do not clear the Allow inheritable permissions from parent to propagate to
this object check box.

4. In the Winnt\System32 folder, select all folders except Inetsrv and Certsrv
  if these are present.

Open the Properties sheet for these folders and clear Allow inheritable
permissions from parent to propagate to this object. In the dialog box that
appears, click Copy. Click OK to exit the Properties sheet.

5. In the Winnt folder, select all folders except Downloaded Program Files,
  Help, IIS Temporary Compressed Files, Offline Web Pages, System32, Tasks,
  Temp, and Web.

Open the Properties sheet for these folders and clear Allow inheritable
permissions from parent to propagate to this object. In the dialog box that
appears, click Copy. Click OK to exit the Properties sheet.

6. For Winnt, add Everyone and select Read &amp; Execute, List Folder Contents,
  and Read.

NOTE: Do not clear the Allow inheritable permissions from parent to propagate to
this object check box.

7. For Winnt\Temp (this allows Access databases to be viewed on ASP pages),
  select the Everyone group (this group should already be present by inheriting
  from the Winnt folder) and select Modify.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although permissions can be specialized to fit each system administrator?s
needs, it is best that you use the Everyone group instead of the IUSR_MACHINE
account:

The Everyone group encompasses the Users group, the IUSR_MACHINE account, and the
IWAM_MACHINE account.

IIS 5.0 uses two separate accounts to execute Web pages. When anonymous
authentication is used, IIS uses the IUSR_MACHINE account to view those pages.
However, IWAM_MACHINE is used to start up a separate process called Dllhost.exe.
All Active Server Pages (ASP), Component Object Model (COM) components, or other
ISAPI extensions (ASP is considered an ISAPI extension) are run inside the
Dllhost.exe process. This is primarily for stability purposes. If a custom COM
component that is called from an ASP page crashes (that is, causes an access
violation that stops the process), it does not affect Inetinfo.exe, so the Web
service continues to run.

The two protection levels in IIS 4.0 are as follows:

- Default: IIS 4.0 runs all applications in-process (that is, inside the
  Inetinfo.exe process), which is started up by the SYSTEM account. When Web
  pages are viewed, the particular thread that is serving the page is run under
  the context of the IUSR_MACHINE account. HTM, ASP and any other ISAPI
  extensions are run inside the Inetinfo.exe process.

- Run in Separate Memory Space (Isolated Process): This is also known as
  out-of-process. This uses the IWAM_MACHINE account to spawn a separate
  Mtx.exe process that runs ASP and other ISAPI extensions.

The three protection levels in IIS 5.0 are as follows:

- Low (IIS Process): This setting is similar to the default setting under IIS
  4.0. All Web pages, whether HTM or ASP, are run inside the Inetinfo.exe
  process.

- Medium (Pooled): This is the default. As with IIS 4.0, this setting starts a
  separate process called Dllhost.exe in which all ASP and COM components are
  run. This process is started by the IWAM_MACHINE account just as in IIS 4.0.
  Also, this setting is known as pooled because all Web sites that are running
  in IIS share this single Dllhost.exe for executing ASP pages. Note that
  Windows 2000 replaces Mtx.exe with Dllhost.exe.

- High (Isolated): This setting starts a dedicated Dllhost.exe process for each
  Web site or application. If you have 5 Web sites, each set on High
  protection, you see a total of six Dllhost.exe processes: five Dllhost.exe
  processes plus one additional Dllhost.exe process that COM+ starts under the
  System Application.
