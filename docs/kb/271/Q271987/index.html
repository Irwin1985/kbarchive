The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a general overview of the database architecture and
database engine for Microsoft Exchange Server. The discussion includes
information about the database components, maintenance of database consistency,
possible types of database failures, and database utilities.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server uses fault-tolerant, transaction-based databases to store
messages and directory information before it is applied to the database. For
Exchange Server 5.5 Standard Edition, each database can grow to a maximum of 16
gigabytes (GB). For Exchange Server 5.5 Enterprise Edition, size is limited only
by hardware.

If a power outage or other abnormal system failure occurs, Exchange Server uses
transaction log files to reconstruct data that is already accepted by the server
but not yet written to the database.

Database Components
-------------------

The design of Exchange Server is based on standard database technology. The
system relies on an embedded database engine that lays out the structure of the
disk for Exchange Server and manages memory. The database engine technology is
also used behind the scenes by other Windows applications, for example, Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

Information Store:

The information store, which is the key component for database management in
Exchange Server, is actually two separate databases. The private information
store database, Priv.edb, manages data in user mailboxes. The public information
store, Pub.edb, manages data in public folders.

The information store works with the Messaging Application Programming Interface
(MAPI) and the database engine to ensure that all user actions are recorded on
the server's hard disk. For example, when a user saves a message in Microsoft
Outlook, MAPI first calls the information store, which then calls the database
engine, which then writes the changes to disk.

JET Database Engine:

Exchange Server databases are based on the JET format, which uses log files to
track and maintain information. Microsoft JET is an advanced 32-bit
multithreaded database engine that combines speed and performance with other
advanced features to enhance transaction-based processing capabilities.

The database engine caches the disk in memory by swapping 4-kilobyte (KB) pages
of data in and out of memory. It updates the pages in memory and writes new or
updated pages back to the disk. This makes the system more efficient because
when requests come, the database engine buffers data in memory instead of
constantly going to the disk.

In versions earlier than Exchange Server 5.5, the buffer cache is a fixed size.
If more memory is needed, the administrator must manually change the buffer
size.

In Exchange Server 5.5, dynamic buffer allocation allows the buffer cache to grow
or shrink, depending on how much memory is available and on what resources are
in use by other services that are running on the Microsoft Windows NT Server
computer. If other services are not using memory, the Exchange Server database
engine takes up as much memory as it needs. If other services need memory, the
database engine gives up some memory by transferring pages to the hard disk and
shrinking the size of the buffer.

When a user makes a request, the database engine loads the request into memory
and marks the pages as "dirty" (a "dirty" page is a page that has been written
with data and is still being held in memory). These dirty pages are later
written to the information store databases on the disk.

Maintaining Database Consistency
--------------------------------

Although caching in memory is the most efficient way to process data, one effect
is that information on the disk is never completely up-to-date. Dirty pages in
memory cause the databases to be flagged as inconsistent even though Exchange
Server is running normally. Databases are truly in a consistent state only when
all the dirty pages are successfully transferred to disk during a shutdown in
which no errors occur.

What if you lose the contents of memory? For example, what if the server crashes
before the data is written to disk and you are left with an inconsistent
database? Exchange uses transaction log files to recover from this situation.

Transaction Log Files:

Transaction log files keep a secure copy of volatile data that is in memory. If
the system crashes, assuming the database is undamaged, the log files enable you
to recover data up to the last committed transaction before the crash. (Note
that it is recommended that you store the log files on a dedicated hard disk, so
that the logs are not affected by possible disk failures that can corrupt the
database.)

Exchange is a "transaction-based" messaging system, and the information store is
a transactional database. A transaction is a set of changes to a database, such
as inserts, deletes, and updates, in which the system follows four "ACID"
invariants:

- Atomic: Either all the operations occur or none of them occur.

- Consistent: The database is transformed from one correct state to another.

- Isolated: Changes are not visible until they are committed.

- Durable: Committed transactions are preserved in the database even if the
  system crashes.

Following these invariants means that the database engine commits a transaction
only when it can guarantee that the data is durable or persistent, protected
from crashes or other failures. The database engine commits data only when that
data has been transferred from memory to the transaction log file on the hard
disk.

For example, to move a message from the Inbox folder to the Important folder,
Exchange Server performs three operations:

1. Deletes the message from the Inbox folder

2. Inserts the message into the Important folder

3. Updates the information about each folder to reflect the number of items and
  unread items

These operations are done in one transaction. The order of the operations does
not matter. Exchange Server can safely delete the message from the Inbox folder
because the deletion is committed only when the message is safely inserted into
the Important folder. Even if the system crashes, Exchange Server never loses a
message while moving it and never ends up with two copies of the message.

Logically, you might think of the data as moving from memory to the log file and
then to the database on disk, but what actually happens is that data moves from
memory to the database on disk. The log files are optimized for high-speed
writes, so during normal operations, the database engine never actually reads
the log files. It reads from the log files only if the information store service
stops abnormally or crashes and the database engine needs to recover by
replaying the log files.

The Checkpoint File

The database engine maintains a checkpoint file called Edb.chk for every log file
sequence in order to keep track of the data that has not yet been written to the
database file on disk. The checkpoint file is a pointer in the log sequence that
indicates where in the log file the information store needs to start the
recovery in case of a failure. The checkpoint file is essential for efficient
recovery. Without it, the information store would start from the beginning of
the oldest log file on the disk and check every page in every log file to
determine whether it had already been written to the database--a time-consuming
process, especially if all you want to do is make the database consistent.

The checkpoint file is located on the system disk. If you have to recover your
system disk, this file is probably missing or in only an invalid version. But in
most cases the checkpoint file takes care of itself.

Normal Logging

The following steps illustrate the process of "normal logging" where data is
written to transaction log files:

1. The user sends a message.

2. MAPI calls the information store to tell it that the user is sending the
  message.

3. The information store starts a transaction in the database engine and makes
  the corresponding changes to the data.

4. The database engine records the transaction in memory by dirtying a new page
  in memory.

5. Simultaneously, the database engine secures the transaction in the
  transaction log file and creates a log record. When the database engine
  reaches the end of a transaction log file, it rolls over and creates a new
  log file in sequence.

6. The database engine writes the dirty page to the database file on the hard
  disk.

7. The checkpoint file is updated.

Circular Logging

Exchange Server supports a feature called circular logging, which was implemented
at a time when administrators were more concerned about server disk space than
about data recovery.

Circular logging works in much the same way as normal logging except that the
checkpoint file is essential for keeping track of information that is
transferred to disk. During circular logging, as the checkpoint file advances to
the next log file, old files are reused. When this happens, you cannot use the
log files on disk in conjunction with your backup media to restore to the most
recent committed transaction.

By default, circular logging is turned on in Exchange Server 5.5 to maintain a
fixed size for log files and prevent buildup. When a log file reaches its 5-MB
limit, the database engine deletes it and creates a new log file in the
sequence. As a result, Exchange Server keeps only enough data on the hard disk
to make the database consistent if a crash occurs.

It is recommended that you turn off circular logging on your Exchange Server
computer. Circular logging may reduces the need for disk space, but it also
eliminates your ability to recover up to the last committed transaction before a
failure. You cannot replay log files and can only recover data up to the last
full backup. Even if only one log file is overwritten, there is no way to
recover the other 99 percent of the log data.

In effect, circular logging negates the advantages of a transaction-based system.
Leaving circular logging turned on makes sense only if you do not need your data
or if you have other means of data recovery. If you are concerned about log
files' consuming your disk resources, it is better to clean them up by
performing regular online backups. Backup automatically removes transaction log
files when they are no longer needed.

Data Protection:

It seems logical to think that database files are the most important aspect of
data recovery. But in Exchange Server, transaction log files are more important
because they contain information that is not in the database files. (This is why
you should locate them on a stable server and place them on dedicated,
high-performance disks, even if that means putting the database files on slower
disks.)

Transaction log files keep a secure copy on disk of volatile data that is in
memory so that the system can recover in the event of a failure. If the system
crashes but the database is undamaged, as long as you have the log files, you
can recover data up to the last committed transaction before the failure.

Transaction log files also make writing data more efficient because it is faster
to update pages sequentially in a log file than to insert pages into the
database. When a change occurs in the database, the database engine updates the
data in memory. It synchronously writes a record of the transaction to the log
file, telling it how to redo the transaction if the system fails. Then the
database engine writes the data to the database on disk. To minimize disk
input/output, the database engine transfers pages to disk in batches.

Each log file in a sequence can contain up to 5 MB of data. When a log file is
full, it is renamed as a previous log file, and a new one is created with the
Edb.log file name. Exchange Server associates each log file with a hexadecimal
generation number. Because log files can have the same name, the database engine
stamps the header in each file in the sequence with a unique signature so it can
distinguish between different generations of log files.

Database Corruption
-------------------

Exchange may experience a failure, such as a hardware failure, that requires the
system to attempt to get back to a consistent state. Because there are different
types of database corruption with differing symptoms, different tools and
techniques are required to diagnose and fix problems.

There are two types of corruption:

- Physical corruption
  At the lowest level, data can become physically corrupted on the disk. This is
  usually a hardware-related problem that always requires you to restore from
  backup.

- Logical corruption
  Typical logical corruption occurs at the database level. For example, database
  engine failure can cause index entries to point to missing values. Logical
  corruption can also occur at the application level, in mailboxes, messages,
  folders, and attachments. For example, application-level corruption might
  cause incorrect reference counts, incorrect access control levels, a message
  header without a message body, and so on.

Physical Corruption:

Physical corruption is serious because it can destroy data, and the only thing
you can do is restore Exchange from backup. It is important that you detect
physical corruption early and resolve the issues quickly.

Detecting Physical Corruption

Physical corruption in the information store generates the following errors in
the application log of Event Viewer:

- -1018 (JET_errReadVerifyFailure) The data read from disk is not the same as
  the data that was written to disk.

- -1022 (JET_errDiskIO) The hardware, device driver, or operating system is
  returning errors.

- -510 JET_errLogWriteFail The log files are out of disk space or there is a
  hardware failure with the log file disk.

Although Exchange typically displays a -1018 or -1022 error message when there is
physical corruption, you can also detect physical corruption by performing
online backups, which are Microsoft's recommended method for backing up data.
Online backup also is the best way to detect corruption in a database file
because it is the only process that systematically checks every single page in
the database.

When you run an online backup, the Windows NT Backup software reads each 4-KB
page in the database file, passes it to the database engine, and then writes it
to tape. The database engine verifies that the checksum on each page is correct.
If the checksum on the page does not match the checksum that the database engine
calculates, there is physical database corruption on the hard disk and NT Backup
logs an -1018 error.

Preventing Physical Corruption

The best way to prevent physical corruption is to outfit the server with quality
hardware components and configure the system correctly. Make sure that you are
not running file-level utilities, such as antivirus software, against database
and log files on the computer that runs Exchange Server.

If you have reliable hardware, you may never see indications of physical
corruption. If you do consistently run into -1018 errors, you probably have a
hardware problem, possibly a bad disk or disk controller.

A word about write-back caching: Some write-back caching array controllers
incorrectly return successful commits on transactions before the data has
actually been secured to disk. The safest course is to turn off write-back
caching unless the process has battery backup. If you do use write-back caching,
avoid having a corrupted database by making sure that data is fully protected
and that you have procedures to ensure that cached data is replayed to the right
disks after a crash.

Recovering from Physical Corruption

The only way to recover from physical database corruption is to restore from the
last good backup (if a backup ran without errors, it is good) and roll the log
files forward to bring the system to a consistent and undamaged state. Repeated
failure probably indicates a problem with the disk where the database is
located.

There is really no safe way to repair physical corruption to the database. You
can run the Eseutil.exe utility in repair mode to get the database functioning
again, but this is not recommended because Eseutil simply deletes bad pages.

NOTE: If it is at all possible, avoid using Eseutil in repair mode (Eseutil /p).
Eseutil, which comes with Exchange Server, is a last resort for repairing
database damage when all else fails. In repair mode, it gets a broken database
running again by simply deleting damaged pages. Eseutil should never be used to
recover data. If you do run the "Eseutil /p" command, you must run the "Isinteg
-test alltests -fix" (without the quotation marks) command to restore a
consistent state.

Logical Corruption:

Logical corruption is much more difficult to diagnose and fix than physical
corruption because logical corruption is unpredictable and is typically caused
by software bugs. Usually it requires a problem to alert you to logical
corruption. (Logical corruption is extremely rare in Exchange Server 5.5.)

Preventing Logical Corruption

Because logical corruption is so unpredictable, there is no foolproof way to
prevent it. However, there are ways to reduce the risk:

- Install the latest service pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 as
  soon as possible. Service packs fix a number of known problems in Exchange
  Server 5.5.

  For additional information about service packs and how to obtain them, click
  the article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q191014 How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

- Make sure that your Exchange Server computer is secure and that your
  configuration is not changed.

If you discover a problem and it persists after you follow through on these
precautions, you may have found a new bug. If this is the case, notify Microsoft
as soon as possible.
Repairing Logical Corruption

Logical corruption can occur in the information store or in the database engine.
Because logical corruption can cause serious damage to data, do not ignore
reports of errors.

You can use the Isinteg utility to check into problems in the information store
or the Eseutil utility to check into problems in the database engine. Note that
you should use these utilities only as a last resort after you have tried to
restore the system from backup.

The Isinteg Utility

The Information Store Integrity Checker (Isinteg) finds and eliminates errors
from the public and private information store databases. These errors may
prevent the information store from starting or prevent users from logging on and
receiving, opening, or deleting e-mail.

Isinteg is not intended for use as a part of normal information store
maintenance; it is provided to assist in disaster recovery situations. For
example, you can run Isinteg to correct information store counters in memory
when they get out of sync after a system crash.

Because the Isinteg utility works at the logical schema level, it can recover
data that Eseutil utility cannot recover. This is because data that is valid for
the Eseutil utility at the physical schema level can be semantically invalid at
the logical schema level. Isinteg records information in the application log in
Event Viewer so that you can track the progress of the recovery.

The Isinteg utility performs two main tasks:

- It patches the information store after a restore from an offline backup.

- It tests and optionally fixes errors in the information store.

Isinteg utility, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q182081 XADM: Description of ISINTEG Utility

or see the Isinteg.rtf document on the Exchange Server 5.5 compact disc, in the
Support\Utils directory.

The Eseutil Utility

The Eseutil utility examines the structure of the database tables and records and
defragments, repairs, and checks the integrity of the information store and
directory. Because running Eseutil in repair mode simply deletes damaged pages,
use this utility only after you have tried to restore from backup.

Support\Utils directory.

Data Backup
-----------

Because Exchange Server is transaction-based, avoid performing a file-level or
offline backup of the database files on disk. The best way to ensure that you
are preserving all data in the system, including transactions that have not yet
been flushed to disk, is to perform regular online backups.

Online Backup:

Online backup enables you to back up Exchange Server databases to your backup
medium without shutting down the server. When Exchange Server is performing an
online backup, all services, including the information store, continue to run
normally. Pages continue to be updated in memory and transferred to the database
files on disk, transactions are recorded in the log files, and the checkpoint
file continues to move along.

Exchange uses a .pat (patch) file that keeps track of updated pages while the
backup software is running, to make sure that pages that are modified during
backup are also backed up. There are two .pat files, Priv.pat for the private
information store and Pub.pat for the public information store.

When you perform an online backup, regularly check the application log in Event
Viewer to make sure that backups are completing successfully.

Process of Online Backup

A backup program, for example Windows NT Backup (Ntbackup.exe), does the
following during a full backup or a copy backup:

1. Makes a copy of the database and backs it up to the tape.

2. Adds a subset of pages to the .pat file, the pages that change after being
  copied to tape.

3. Renames the current Edb.log file to Edbx.log, where x is the log file
  generation number in hexadecimal format, and creates a new log generation.

4. In a full backup, backs up the .pat file and all log files after the
  checkpoint (except the new Edb.log) onto the tape. In a copy backup, backs up
  all log files before and after the checkpoint.

5. In a full backup, deletes transaction log files that are older than the
  checkpoint. In a copy backup, does not delete any transaction log files.

A backup program does the following during an incremental backup or a
differential backup:

1. In an incremental backup, makes a copy of the log files and backs them up to
  the tape. In a differential backup, copies the database to tape.

2. Adds a subset of pages to the .pat file, the pages that change after being
  copied to tape.

3. Renames the current Edb.log file to Edbx.log and creates a new log
  generation.

4. Backs up the .pat file and all log files before and after the checkpoint,
  including the new Edb.log, to tape.

5. In an incremental backup, deletes transaction log files older than the
  checkpoint. In a differential backup, does not delete any log files.

Offline Backup:

Try to avoid doing offline backups. In an online backup, the backup program
manages files for you, but offline backup is a manual, labor-intensive process
that is prone to human error. Additionally, in an offline backup, you cannot
validate the checksum on each page of the database. Online backups are the
single most valuable tool for detecting corruption and performing data
recovery.
