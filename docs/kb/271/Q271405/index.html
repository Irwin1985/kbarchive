-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run a batch file as a post executable in an setup package built
by Visual FoxPro's Setup Wizard, the batch file does not execute if it is run on
a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or a Microsoft Windows 2000-based operating system.
The batch file does execute properly if it is run on Microsoft Windows 9X-based
operating systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In step 4 of the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard, there is a Post-Setup Executable
text box. The file specified in this box runs at the end of the setup package
created by the wizard. This file is usually an executable (.exe) or batch (.bat)
file. An .exe executes at the end of the setup routine regardless of what
operating system is running, but a .bat file does not execute on NT 4.0 or
Windows 2000-based operating systems.

NOTE: .CMD files, an alternative to batch files on Windows NT and Windows 2000
computers, also do not run as Post-Setup Executables.


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a batch file called "Do_Batch.bat" (without the quotation marks) in a
  new folder, and then add some DOS commands, such as:

  CD C:\ 
  MD Mybatch

If the batch file executes properly, a folder called Mybatch is created on the C:
drive.

2. Create a Visual FoxPro executable in the same folder as the batch file. The
  .exe can be small; a .prg with a WAIT WINDOW command will do.

3. Run the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard, pointing to the files that are in the
  folder created in step 1. Type the file name "Do_Batch.bat" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Post-Executable text box in step 4.

4. Select Finish in step 6 of the Setup Wizard, allow the setup package to be
  created, and then run Setup.exe to start the installation. If you are doing
  this on a NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 computer, note that the batch file does not
  execute as a Post-Setup Executable.

5. Note that when you are running the setup routine on a Win 9X computer, the
  batch file executes successfully.
