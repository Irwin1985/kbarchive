MORE INFORMATION

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems

guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

clients, and then remove the GroupShield server application.

1. To remove workstations as GroupShield Exchange clients, follow these steps:

  a. Start Registry Editor, and locate and then remove the following registry
     keys and values:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Network
  Associates Exchange AV Client

  c. Delete the following files from the Windows directory:

2. To remove the GroupShield Exchange Server application from the Exchange

guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

  a. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
     typing the following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

  b. In the Exchange Administrator program, expand the Configuration container,
     and then select the server from which you want to remove the GroupShield
     application.

  c. Click the Network Associates Anti-Virus object, and then in the Edit menu
     click Delete Raw Object.

  d. Expand the Addins container, and delete the four Network Associates
     add-ins that are installed.

  e. Expand the Recipients container and click Network Associates Recipients,
     and then on the Edit menu, click Delete Raw Object.

  f. On the Tools menu, click Forms Administrator, and in the dialog box that
     appears, select the folder name Organization(809)uk or
     Organization(409)usa, and then click Delete.

  g. Start the Exchange mail client, and delete the Quarantine folder.

  h. On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
     Control Panel.

     registry keys:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AVExch32Service

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AVUPDService

  NOTE: Do not remove the preceding two keys if you installed a version of Alert
  Manager with other Network Associates software.
