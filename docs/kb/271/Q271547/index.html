The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to move a mailbox by using the Move Mailbox utility in the
Exchange Server Administrator program, if the source server for the mailbox is
running an antivirus program that uses the antivirus application programming
interface (API), the move mailbox operation may not work and you may receive the
following error message:

  The Client Operation Failed
  Microsoft Exchange Information Store
  ID No. 80004005-0501-0000050a

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because, based on the architecture of the antivirus API,
any attachments that a mailbox contains that have not been scanned are submitted
to the antivirus vendor before those attachments are released to the Move
Mailbox utility or to a MAPI client.

The Move Mailbox utility does not recognize this condition when an attachment is
being scanned; therefore the Move Mailbox utility generates the error message in
the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2652.68 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2652.68 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, remove or disable the antivirus programs that are
based on the antivirus API before you attempt to use the Move Mailbox utility in
the Exchange Server Administrator program. For information about disabling your
antivirus program, please contact your antivirus program vendor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After this fix to the Store.exe file is applied, the information store
determines that the mailbox is being moved and releases the attachment without
scanning the attachment. It is recommended that the destination server of the
mailbox also contain an antivirus-based solution, because the attachment is not
scanned before the attachment is moved.
