The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you have previously set up Remote Access Services (RAS) and updated RAS
with the Point-to-Point Server files (WFWPTP.EXE), you get caught in a loop when
you are trying to restore RAS in Network Setup. For example, after removing RAS
and restarting Windows for Workgroups, you try to restore RAS in the Add Network
Adapter dialog box of Network Setup. At this point, you are prompted for files.
When you respond "Yes To All" to replace the files, you receive ten instances of
the following dialog box:

  Windows Setup

  The version of the file &lt;filename&gt; that you are installing conflicts
  with the version that is currently on your system. Do you want to
  replace the file on your system with the one you are installing?

  Yes     Yes to All     No

The filenames that appear in the dialog boxes are as follows:

  RASAPI16.DLL
  RASCAUTH.DLL
  RASEXE.EXE
  RASMAN.DLL
  RASMON.EXE
  RASMXS.DLL
  RASPHONE.EXE
  RASSAUTH.DLL
  RASSER.DLL
  RASSRV.DLL

Responding "No" appears to allow you to complete the setup properly; however,
when you choose OK, you are prompted with the same ten dialog boxes. This loop
continues until you replace the files.

CAUSE
=====

The files for the Point-to-Point Server are newer than those that ship with
Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and Network Setup does not recognize them.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  DownloadDownload Wfwptp.exe now

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To work around this problem, respond "Yes To All" and "Yes" to replace the newer
driver with the older file from the Windows for Workgroups disks. Restart
Windows for Workgroups and then exit and reinstall the Point-to-Point Server
files. Go to the directory or disk in which WFWPTP.EXE is located and run
COPYPTP.BAT &lt;C:\WINDOWS&gt; (where C:\WINDOWS is your Windows for Workgroups
directory). This replaces the Windows for Workgroups files with the updated
files.
