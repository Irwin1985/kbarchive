SUMMARY
=======

With the introduction of the Power Macintosh, Apple has released version 7.1.2
of the system software. System 7.1.2 has some new features and enhancements that
may confuse users unfamiliar with the new operating system when they are
performing standard troubleshooting tests. The purpose of this article is to
document the differences between System 7.1 and System 7.1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below is a list of the new features, enhancements, and modifications found in
System 7.1.2. Note that this list may not be complete.


- In the Memory Control Panel, the option to enable or disable 32-bit
  addressing has been replaced with an option to turn the Modern Memory Manager
  On or Off. Since all Power Macintoshes ship with a minimum of 8 MB of RAM,
  32-bit addressing is always enabled. The Modern Memory Manager must be turned
  On in order to run "native" Power Macintosh applications. The option to turn
  off the Modern Memory Manager is provided in order to maintain compatibility
  with older Macintosh applications.

- Owners of machines with a Motorola 68040 processor can use the Cache Switch
  Control Panel to enable or disable the on-chip caching of the processor in
  order to improve performance with System 7.1. However, the Cache Switch
  Control Panel cannot be used with the Power Macintosh.

- If a Power Macintosh upgrade card is installed in a Motorola 680x0- based
  machine, there will be a Power Macintosh Card Control Panel that can be used
  to enable or disable the card.

- Under System 7.1, a text editor called TeachText is provided. Under System
  7.1.2, the SimpleText editor is provided instead.

- Under System 7.1.2, there is a new Control Panel called PC Exchange, which
  makes it easy to exchange documents between Macintosh and MS-DOS-based or
  Windows-based computers. This Control Panel is superior in many ways to Apple
  File Exchange (AFE) because it can format floppy disks for MS-DOS and can
  associate MS-DOS files that have MS-DOS-style extensions (suffixes) with
  Macintosh applications and document types. Note also that the PC Exchange
  Control Panel is memory resident, unlike AFE, and will be disabled if the
  Macintosh is started without extensions.

- Minor changes have also been made to the Monitors and Sound Control Panels.
