-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows was not designed to support
extended information (custom template information). When RNETWORK.GLB file is
created, it packages all the TPL files. INF files do not get packaged in
RNETWORK.GLB; therefore, extended information is not available for remote users.
However, there is a problem with the way the remote client handles the extended
information when it is present on the postoffice.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. This problem was corrected in MSRMTUI.DLL version
3.2.0.4008. If you do not have version 3.2.0.4008 (or later), you can find
MSRMTUI.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the following services:

- Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet

  On the www.microsoft.com home page, click the Support icon.
  Click Knowledge Base, and select the product.
  Enter kbfile MSRMTUI.EXE, and click GO!
  Open the article, and click the button to download the file.

- Internet (anonymous FTP)

  ftp ftp.microsoft.com
  Change to the Softlib/Mslfiles folder.
  Get MSRMTUI.EXE

- The Microsoft Network

  On the Edit menu, click Go To, and then click Other Location.
  Type "mssupport" (without the quotation marks).
  Double-click the MS Software Library icon.
  Find the appropriate product area.
  Locate and Download MSRMTUI.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If there is an 8DIGIT.TPL file associated with an external postoffice in the
WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\TPL subdirectory, when you get details by picking a user
from the external PO list, the standard fields are displayed. But if you get
details by picking a user from the GAL, in addition to the standard fields, the
default template information is displayed (default information from 8DIGIT
.TPL). Getting details on every user on that postoffice, results in the same
template information because the information is being read from the 8DIGIT.TPL.

The remote client does not read the INFs and so the template information should
NOT be displayed when getting details.

When RNETWORK.GLB is generated, all *.TPLs, (including 8DIGIT.TPLs for other
postoffices) are included in the file. When the remote client is installed with
this data disk, the TPLs are placed in the TPL subdirectory in
WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\TPL. On the remote client, the external postoffices have a
hexid that do not correspond with the hexid on the postoffice.

For example, if you have EXTNET/EXTPO defined on your PO, you may have
00000002.USR and 00000002.TPL and 00000002.INF on the PO whereas on the remote
client, you may have 00000001.USR but the TPL is still is in 00000002.TPL. When
you get details, you end up getting the information from the wrong TPL file.

For example, on the postoffice, if you have 10 8DIGIT.TPL files associated with
10 different external POs. RNETWORK.GLB contains all these 10 8DIGIT.TPL files.
The WINDOWS\MSMAIL\MSRMT\TPL directory contains these 10DIGIT.TPL files. When
the information in the data disk is parsed out at the remote client, the
external POs are associated with different hexids. When you get details on the
user from the GAL, it looks at the wrong 8DIGIT.TPL file as the new hexid
associations have not affected the TPLs.

A similar problem existed with ADMIN.TPL and the problem was resolved by deleting
the ADMIN.TPL file when you parse out RNETWORK.GLB. A similar mechanism is
required to delete all the 8DIGIT.TPL files at the remote client.
