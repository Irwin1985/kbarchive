-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail containing multiple file attachments sent from one Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk Networks server to another through the Mail Connection Gateway and a
PC-only backbone arrives with only the first file attachment intact. The other
attachments appear to be included in the message but actually are copies of the
first attachment.

CAUSE
=====

For example, the problem occurs in a configuration such as:

   AppleTalk                        AppleTalk
  Mail Server                      Mail Server

      One                              Two
       ^                                ^
       |                                |
       v                                v
   Connection                       Connection
   Gateway 3.2                      Gateway 3.2
       ^                                ^
       |                                |
       v                                v
    PC Mail                          PC Mail
   Postoffice   &lt;--&gt; External &lt;--&gt;  Postoffice
      One              MTA             Two

In this configuration, the two Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks servers do
not, in any manner, transmit mail to each other through the AppleTalk network.

For this case, when two dissimilar file attachments (for example, a TeachText
document and a Microsoft Excel document) are sent from one Macintosh server to
the other, the second file attachment is only a copy of the first file
attachment. In this example, the recipient would receive two copies of the
TeachText document and the Excel document would be lost.

WORKAROUND
==========

Send only one attachment with each mail message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks. This problem was corrected in version
3.2.5 of the Mail Connection GW file. If you do not have version 3.2.5 (or
later), you can download GWUPD.HQX or GWUPD.SEA (self-extracting files). The
following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
