SYMPTOMS
========

An Event 25 error occurs when a 3270 print session or a 5250 print session is
configured to use a printer that has DMBIN_UPPER specified as a paper source in
the printer's DEVMODE structure.

This problem occurs only if the 3270 print session or the 5250 print session is
configured to use a Printer Definition Table (PDT) file and the "Printer
Language is Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL" option is selected.

The following is an example of a typical Event 25 error message as it appears in
the log:

  Event ID: 25
  Source: SNA Virtual Print Driver
  Description: If your print output is correct, this warning can be ignored.

  If your session has "Printer Language is Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL" selected,
  then the SNA Virtual Print Driver has not recognised your PaperSize (1) or
  Orientation (1) setting. If your job output has incorrect PaperSize or
  Orientation, use GDI printing or put the definitions in the START_JOB macro
  in your PDT file.

  If your session is not configured for HP PCL, the SNA Virtual Print Driver
  cannot automatically apply PaperSize and Orientation Admin settings. If your
  job output has incorrect PaperSize or Orientation, use GDI printing or put
  the definitions in the START_JOB macro in your PDT file.

  Print Session: &lt;Print Session Name&gt;.
  Printer: &lt;Printer Name&gt;.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Integration Server 2000 print server is designed to recognize specific
paper sources so that it can send HP Printer Control Language (PCL) control
codes to the printer if the print session is using a PDT and the Printer
Language is Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL option is selected.

However, print server does not correctly recognize a paper source of DMBIN_UPPER
when this source is specified in the dwDefaultSource parameter in the printer's
DEVMODE structure. The Event 25 error occurs because the paper source is not
recognized.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DEVMODE structure contains information about the device initialization and
environment of a printer. The print driver that is installed for the printer is
responsible for returning the DEVMODE structure, which includes the
dwDefaultSource value.

The dmDefaultSource parameter specifies the default paper source that the printer
uses. This parameter is an integer value as defined in wingdi.h. The print
driver must return a value that matches one of the values listed in the
following table:

    +---------------------+----------------+
    | Paper Source        | Value          |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_UPPER         | 1              | 
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_ONLYONE       | 1              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_LOWER         | 2              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_MIDDLE        | 3              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_MANUAL        | 4              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_ENVELOPE      | 5              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_ENVMANUAL     | 6              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_AUTO          | 7              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_TRACTOR       | 8              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_SMALLFMT      | 9              |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_LARGEFMT      | 10             |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_LARGECAPACITY | 11             |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_CASSETTE      | 14             |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_FORMSOURCE    | 15             |
    +---------------------+----------------+
    | DMBIN_USER          | 256 and higher |
    +---------------------+----------------+

For example, the available paper sources for a specific printer and its installed
driver may include Tray 1 as a valid paper source. Because Tray 1 is not listed
as a defined paper source, the print driver must return one of the defined
values or a user-defined value. It is not always clear what value a print driver
may return for a particular paper source.

The Host Integration Server 2000 print server recognizes the following paper
sources after you apply the update:

- DMBIN_UPPER
- DMBIN_LOWER
- DMBIN_MIDDLE
- DMBIN_MANUAL
- DMBIN_ENVELOPE
- DMBIN_FORMSOURCE
