SUMMARY
=======


The Melissa Word macro virus has the ability to spread rapidly and, under some
circumstances, to send sensitive documents outside of the organization. If the
volume of generated mail is large enough, the Melissa virus can create a mail
storm that can seriously affect your business systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

What Is It and What Does It Do?
-------------------------------

If an anti-virus solution is not in place when a user opens an infected Word
document using Microsoft Word, and the user then enables macros, the Melissa
macro starts and performs several unwanted actions on the user's computer:

- It lowers macro security settings.

- Adds its own registry setting.

- Infects the Word Normal.dot template file.

- If able, sends e-mail message copies of itself to the first 50 entries of
  every MAPI address book the user has configured.

Originally, the virus was spread in a file attachment called List.doc, which
contained references to pornographic Web sites. However, the users may see their
own documents going out as attachments because the infection can also be passed
on through an infected Normal.dot template.

E-mail is not required to spread the virus, although e-mail accounts for the
largest percentage of the spread. Simply sharing an infected Word document is
enough.

It is important to note that opening an e-mail message containing a document with
the virus does not start the virus. The virus is started when the user opens the
Word document and chooses to enable macros.

For more specific details, see your antivirus vendor's Web site.

Combating the Virus
-------------------

Alert and Educate Your Users:

- Let your users know through whatever methods work best for your company that
  they should delete any messages with a subject line of "Important Message
  From &lt;username&gt;" where "&lt;username&gt;" is a variable based on who
  the virus's last victim was.

- If you open a mail message with the "Important Message From &lt;username&gt;"
  or any other subject and find an attachment and text saying "Here is that
  document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)" you should NOT open
  the attachment, but delete the message immediately.

- Let your users know how to set up rules in their clients to automatically
  delete any incoming mail containing an attachment and "Important Message
  From" in the subject line.

- Tell your users how to verify the virus definition level of whatever
  anti-virus software they are running at the desktop. Clearly communicate
  where and how to get updates that handle the Melissa virus.

Isolate and Clean Up:

Shut down gateways and message transfer agents (MTA) to other sites or
organizations until you can clean up possible infection within your organization
or site, and be sure measures are put in place to intercept any future infected
mail from passing through your systems.

Desktop Strategies:

- Make sure that every desktop in your organization is running anti-virus
  software and has an updated virus definition that contains fixes for the
  Melissa virus. This will have the greatest impact of any step you can take as
  it prevents any further spread whether by e-mail or simple file transfer.
  Most anti-virus vendors posted updates within a half day of the first
  reported Melissa infection.

- Educate your users to disable all macros unless they must run a macro to get
  their work done.

For more details, please see the following address:

  http://office.microsoft.com/assistance/9798/macroalert.aspx

For more details on how macros work and how they can be controlled in the
Microsoft Office environment, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q224567 WD97: Word Macro Virus Alert "Melissa Macro Virus"

Server Strategies:

- Because the virus sends mail to the first 50 users in each address book, 50
  temporary null address book entries should be added to the top of the global
  address list and all other address containers that could be used for name
  resolution.

- All SMTP or other entry points to your messaging system should scan all
  inbound and outbound documents and attachments. If you have not yet
  implemented a solution at this level, you should temporarily drop your
  connections to prevent spreading the virus until a solution can be put into
  place.

Cleaning Up Melissa at the Exchange Server Computers
----------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Product Support Services provides tools and procedures on the issues
listed below. Please note that they are not long-term solutions but have been
provided by Microsoft in the short term to provide temporary relief to systems
until more long-term solutions can be developed and implemented. These solutions
and tools are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. Microsoft strongly
recommends that you fully back up any system before performing these
operations.

To obtain these tools, contact Microsoft Product Support Services. For a complete
list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and information on
support costs, please go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

- Removing Melissa from Information Stores: Remove mail messages that contain
  attachments and a customized subject line from an Exchange Server information
  store by using either the utility Isscan (a variation of Isinteg), or the
  utility ExMerge, or both.

- Removing Melissa from MTA Databases: Remove any Melissa mail that is
  currently in the MTA database if your Exchange Server MTAs are experiencing
  significant backlogs because of a mail storm caused by the Melissa virus.

- Removing E-mail from Internet Mail Connectors: Pull Melissa e-mail messages
  out of various queues within your Internet Mail Connectors. Note that
  Microsoft recommends that you consider a longer term solution as described
  later in the article.

- Intercepting Melissa Mail at Gateways: To prevent further spread of the
  Melissa virus, both internally and externally, you should implement some form
  of protection on all your mail gateways.

  The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) (http://www.cert.org/advisories/)
  has posted sendmail and other solutions. In addition, you should consult your
  anti-virus vendor. Be sure any virus package you run against an Exchange
  Server computer is specifically Exchange Server-aware. Programs or versions
  that are not Exchange Server-aware have been linked to data corruption and
  performance issues on Exchange Server computers.

Cleaning up Melissa at the Desktop
----------------------------------

Your users can use the Microsoft Client Side Scanning Software version 1.0 to set
or reset macro warnings, modify Normal.dot if needed, and scan their local .pst
files.

The utility is used only for scanning and detection purposes for the specific
Melissa virus characteristics. Individual users must run it as the utility
relies on a user messaging profile to access client-side mail stores.

IMPORTANT: This software inspects your client-side mail stores for the
characteristics of the Melissa virus. When run, it sets the registry settings
for macro warning to True. It does not delete, destroy, mark, or otherwise
attempt to identify or alter individual objects in your personal mail store.
This utility either alerts the user to the possible presence of a virus or
provides a measure of confidence that the client mail stores do not contain
attachments with the characteristics of the Melissa virus.

This is not a virus scanning utility. There is still a possibility that a virus
matching the characteristics of Melissa may not be discovered. Microsoft
encourages you to implement or update a commercially tested anti-virus desktop
solution.
