-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Emergency Repair process for Windows NT, the process may seem
to finish very quickly, or you may receive the following error message:

  Setup has determined that drive &lt;X&gt;: is corrupt beyond repair.

  Setup cannot continue. Press F3 to exit.

Rebooting and choosing to repair the boot sector without using the Emergency
Repair Disk generates the following message:

  Windows NT Workstation Setup

  Setup could not find a Windows NT installation to repair. Unless you provide
  the Emergency Repair Disk for the installation which you want to repair,
  Setup will not be able to repair it.

   - If you have the Emergency Repair Disk, or if you want Setup to retry the
  search of existing Windows NT installations, press ENTER.

   - If you want to quit Setup, press F3.

CAUSE
=====

This situation is most likely to occur when the following conditions exist:

- The hard disk is an IDE hard disk that is larger than 8.4 gigabytes (GB).

- The computer dual-boots multiple operating systems.

- Windows NT is installed on a logical MS-DOS drive, in an extended MS-DOS
  partition.

- There is another operating system installed on the first logical MS-DOS drive
  in an extended MS-DOS partition that has an unrecognized file system, such as
  the FAT32 file system.

The Microsoft-supplied generic IDE driver (Atapi.sys) may not be fully compatible
with drives larger than 8 GB. This issue affects only IDE-based drives that are
8 GB in size or larger.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Download the Atapi.exe file from the following Microsoft FTP server:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-unsup-ed/fixes/nt40/atapi/ATAPI.EXE

2. Copy the Atapi.exe file to a blank floppy disk. Run Atapi.exe on the disk.
  The new Atapi.sys file is extracted to the disk.

3. Copy the updated Atapi.sys file to disk 3 of the Windows NT Setup disk,
  choosing Yes to overwrite the existing version of the file.

  NOTE: If you have access to the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 CD-ROM, you can
  copy the updated Atapi.sys file from the appropriate platform folder to disk
  3 of the Windows NT Setup disks.

4. Boot from the Setup disks supplied with the Windows NT installation media.

5. When you reach the following screen just after inserting and running disk 3,
  press ESC:

  Windows NT Workstation Setup

  Setup needs to know if you have the Emergency Repair Disk for the Windows NT
  version 4.0 installation you want to repair. NOTE: Setup can only repair
  Windows NT version 4.0 installation.

Setup should then correctly identify and repair the installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) has a new Atapi.sys file that allows drives
to be formatted during Windows NT Setup. the SP4 versioni of the Atapi.sys file
can also gain access to space beyond 8 GB on these IDE drives.

NOTE: The system partition containing the Ntldr, Boot.ini, Ntdetect.com,
Ntbootdd.sys, and Bootsect.dos files is still limited to 7.8 GB whether or not
the updated version of the Atapi.sys file is installed. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q114841 Windows NT Boot Process and Hard Disk Constraints

Note that the computer's BIOS must support and recognize drives larger than 8 GB
for Windows NT to be able to use entire drive. You can verify this ability by
running the computer's BIOS configuration routine or by contacting your
computer's manufacturer.
