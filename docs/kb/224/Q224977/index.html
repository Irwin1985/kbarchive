SYMPTOMS

The Microsoft Exchange Server information store may not start after restoration
of an online backup. Information store utilities such as Isinteg and Eseutil
also may not start. You may receive some or all of the following error
messages:

  Error -1414 or 0xfffffa7a or 4294965882 (JET_errSecondaryIndexCorrupted)

  Error -1030 or 0xfffffbfa or 4294966266 or c8000406 or 3355444230
  (JET_errAlreadyInitialized)

  Error -1032 or 0xfffffbf8 or 4294966264 (JET_errFileAccessDenied)

You may observe some or all of the following clusters of events in the
Application Log:

CAUSE
=====

When the service pack level for Windows NT changes, Exchange Server rebuilds its
database indexes as a precaution against incompatibilities with the service
pack. This reindexing occurs whether the service pack level is changed upward or
downward.

In most cases, the index rebuild is virtually transparent and goes unnoticed. But
if the computer name has also been changed along with the service pack level,
the above symptoms may appear. The most common case in which this happens is
during restoration of an online backup during single mailbox recovery procedures
undertaken on a laboratory server.

To have consistent success with Exchange online restores, always target the
Exchange restore procedure to a recovery computer running the same Microsoft
Windows NT Service Pack as the computer the backup was taken from. For example,
if the Exchange 5.5 server you backed up was running Windows NT 4.0 SP5, your
recovery server must also run Windows NT 4.0 SP5.

These symptoms may also appear when no service pack revision has occurred, but
computer names have changed, if both computers are running Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4.

RESOLUTION
==========

IMPORTANT: Please read the entire "Resolution" section before proceeding. The
steps to get to the defrag procedure are listed below.

This problem can be resolved by any one of the following three methods:

- Performing an offline defragmentation of the database (ESEUTIL /D
  &lt;DATABASE.EDB&gt;). This may take several hours for a large database.

- Giving the current server the same name as the server from which the backup
  was originally taken. This may be inconvenient, as two servers with the same
  name cannot co-exist on the same network.

- Following the procedure outlined below:

IMPORTANT: Perform the following steps in exact order, omitting none of them.
While some steps may seem redundant, each one plays a vital role in successfully
reindexing and avoiding the necessity to defragment the database or rename the
server.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  1. After online restore, start the information store.

     NOTE: After restoration of an online backup, the first thing you should
     always do, not just in this case, is to start the associated database
     service. Running Eseutil or Isinteg, or otherwise tampering with any of
     the restored files or registry entries before starting the database
     service may make your database permanently unstartable and require another
     restoration of your full backup.

  2. Start Regedt32, and then locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\Restore in
  Progress

     Make sure that the "EDB Database recovered" value is 01, not 00. If this
     value is 01, it means that critical parts of the restore process have
     finished (specifically, the restored .pat files have been applied to the
     database) and it is safe now to remove the Restore in Progress key.

     If the flag is 01, save, and then delete the Restore in Progress key. If it
     is still 00, you must discover the cause before deleting the key.

     In the case of the symptoms described in this article, stopping ALL
     Exchange Server services, including the System Attendant, and then
     restarting the database service sets the flag to 01, unless there are
     complicating unrelated factors present. Verify that all services have
     actually stopped by typing "net start" (without the quotation marks) at a
     command prompt.

     IMPORTANT: If the flag is 00 at this step, you must stop all services,
     restart the database service, and then recheck the key before proceeding
     to the next step, despite the fact that doing so may seem redundant, and
     even though the database service will likely fail the next start attempt
     anyway.

  3. Stop ALL Exchange Server services. Verify that all services have actually
     stopped by typing "net start" (without the quotation marks) at a command
     prompt.

  4. Start the database service. It should fail with a 1011 error, indicating
     that you must patch the database. Patching is a normal operation that does
     not imply or suggest any damage or corruption.

     If you do not receive a 1011 or other event telling you to patch the
     database, you must troubleshoot the failure before proceeding to the next
     step.

  5. Run "Isinteg -patch" (without the quotation marks).

  6. Start the database service.
