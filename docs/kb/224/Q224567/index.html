MORE INFORMATION
================

On March 26, 1999, Microsoft was made aware of a Word macro virus W97M/Melissa.A
(dubbed "Melissa") that has affected a number of users and companies. As with
all security issues, Microsoft takes this very seriously, and because of the
widespread nature of this particular virus, Microsoft is taking steps to
proactively notify our customers to help minimize its impact. By taking the
necessary precautions, you can ensure it does not affect your computer.

Whom can the virus affect?
--------------------------

This virus can affect people who are using Word with Outlook 98 or 2000. If you
do not use this software, this particular virus does not affect your computer.

What is the "Melissa" macro virus?
----------------------------------

It is a Word macro virus delivered via e-mail in an attached Word document. The
e-mail message contains the subject line "Important Message From "UserName"
and/or contains the message body "Here is that document you asked for ... don't
show anyone else ;-)". If the attached Word document is opened and the macro
virus is enabled (that is, it is allowed to run), it can propagate itself by
sending e-mail with the infected document to a number of recipients. The virus
reads the list of members from each Outlook Address Book and sends an e-mail
message to the first 50 recipients programmatically.

The name of the original infected Word document is List.doc, but this could be
changed to any name. After the virus has been enabled and allowed to run, it can
infect your default template (Normal.dot). New documents are based on the
Normal.dot template, so they too can become infected. In this scenario, you
could create a new document, send or give the file to someone, and their
computer could then become infected. The virus would then attempt to send your
document (instead of the original infected List.doc file) out to 50 recipients
from each Outlook Address Book.

This virus does not appear to destroy data. If the current day of the month
equals the minute value of the current time, and the infected document is
opened, the following text is inserted at the current insertion point position:

  Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my
  letters. Game's over. I'm outta here.


Will Office 97 protect my computer from this and other macro viruses?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Word 97 will protect your computer from macro viruses, including this one,
provided the macro virus protection is turned on (this is the default setting).
With the macro virus protection turned on, every time you receive a Word
document that contains macros, a dialog box opens and allows you to choose
whether to enable the macros. You should always disable macros when you are not
certain of their purpose or functionality. By choosing to disable the macros,
you will prevent this and any macro virus from running, rendering them harmless.
The virus is only activated if you open the attached Word document and choose to
enable the macros or if your macro virus protection settings have been turned
off.

How do I ensure the Office macro virus protection is turned on?

---------------------------------------------------------------

In Word 97, do the following:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the General tab, select Macro Virus Protection.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are not able to follow the steps above because you cannot
find the menu items, your computer may already be infected. If so, run
anti-virus software containing the latest update and scan your system often.
Support for this particular virus is already available from a number of
anti-virus vendors. If you are not able to run anti-virus software, it will be
necessary to delete or rename your Normal.dot file. This is the Word global
template that is automatically recreated after Word is started. After this is
done, repeat the steps above.

For additional information about deleting or renaming the Normal.dot template,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q181079 WD97: What to Do If You Have a Macro Virus

How do I ensure my computer will not become infected?
-----------------------------------------------------

Ensure the Office macro virus protection is turned on as described above. Always
choose "disable macros" when asked, if you are unsure of the purpose of the
macro in the document. Doing so will still allow you to open the document and
read its contents. Once you are certain the macro is safe, and only if you need
to run that macro, you can then re-open the document and enable the macro.

Run the latest anti-virus software, and scan often. This is how you can ensure
that the macros in documents are safe. Disinfectors for this particular virus
are already available from a number of anti-virus companies. Also remember to
keep your anti-virus software up to date by installing the latest signature
files for that company. (Most companies creating anti-virus applications release
a new signature file each month.) For additional information about anti-virus
software, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q49500 List of Antivirus Software Vendors

What should I do if my computer has been infected by this virus, or I think it has been infected?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run anti-virus software containing the latest update, and scan your system often.
Support for this particular virus is already available from a number of
anti-virus companies.

Ensure your Office virus protection is turned on. After the virus has been
allowed to run, it will disable the virus protection in Word. Remember to make
sure Office macro virus protection is turned on by performing the steps listed
above.
