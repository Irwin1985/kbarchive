SUMMARY
=======

This article provides tips on upgrading a Web site from Internet Information
Server (IIS) 3.0 to IIS 4.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

CAUTION: When you run the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack (NTOP) Setup program, Do
Not click the Cancel button once it has begun copying files. If you cancel it at
this time, you will have to completely rebuild the Web server.

If you are using PERL in any of your Web pages, refer to the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base articles:

  Q190011 Perl Script Mappings Converted to Uppercase During Upgrade

  Q186801 PERL Scripts Do Not Run

Note: A version of PERL that some IIS users use is provided by ActiveState. For
more information, visit:

  http://www.activestate.com/


If you use the logging features of IIS, read:

  Q183733 Active Log Format Drop-down List Is Not Populated

Although it's not a requirement, it is recommended that you Do Not modify the
Default Web site. If possible, leave it as-is, and instead, create a new Web
site or sites for your pages. Changing the default permissions and other
properties of the Default Web site can cause upgrade complications.

If the system administrator has restricted access or permissions to the Web
server directories, you may have problems when upgrading. To verify that the
NTFS permissions are set up properly, refer to the following Knowledge Base
article:

  Q187506 List of NTFS Permissions Required for IIS Site to Work

IIS 4.0 installation creates two user accounts: IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt; and
IWAM_&lt;machinename&gt;. These two accounts are required during the latter part
of the NTOP installation, specifically by Index Server and the Sample Sites. If
the domain controllers are not synchronized in time for that part of the
installation, the accounts will not be available, and the installation will
fail.

To avoid this situation when you install on a BDC, choose a custom installation,
and deselect Index Server and the Sample Sites. After the installation has
completed and the domain controllers have been synchronized, run the NTOP Setup
again, and selectively install Index Server and the Sample Sites.

When you run the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack Setup program, click the Upgrade Plus
button to perform a custom installation. Leave everything checked that is
already selected by default, and then select additional components that you
want, such as additional samples and documentation.

NOTE: This problem does not occur with the Windows 2000 Indexing Service.
