SUMMARY
=======

You can recover deleted items from a public folder in much the same way that you
recover deleted items from your private mailbox. Even though item recovery may
be enabled and working successfully for your mailbox, it may not be enabled for
any public folders you may have rights to.

When you delete an item in a public folder, the item itself is not "hidden" and
moved to the Deleted items folder as you may expect from the behavior exhibited
by the private mailbox. The item itself is deleted "in place." It is merely
hidden and remains in the public folder for the allotted interval of time set by
the administrator for deleted items.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To recover deleted items from a public folder:

1. The Exchange Server administrator must enable recovery for the public
  information store. This must be enabled separately from the item recovery
  settings on the private information store. To enable recovery for the public
  information store:

  a. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, select the public
     information store to highlight it.

  b. On the File menu, click Properties, and change the Item Recovery settings
     to something other than zero.

2. Recovery must be enabled on the server that hosts the replica you are
  connected to. Recovery may be enabled on one replica server, but not
  necessarily the one to which you are connected.

3. To recover the deleted item you must have full read/write/delete permissions
  on the public folder. To do this, set permissions on the folder to Editor.

4. Select the public folder from which the item was deleted.

5. On the Tools menu in the Outlook client, click Recover Deleted Items.
