-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing
the
registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to
restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA Server computer using the Host Print service configured with a large
number of print sessions on a Windows NT 4.0 Server may experience problems
starting print sessions. When this occurs, print sessions may appear to stop
responding or get stuck in a Spooling status when attempting to start the
session or sessions. This problem may cause other symptoms as well.

NOTE: Due to the factors involved, there are no specifics on exactly how many
print sessions can be defined before this problem may occur.

CAUSE
=====

There is a limit on the number of DCs (Device Contexts) that can exist on a
Windows NT 4.0 system at one time. The number of DCs that can be created depends
on a number of factors; therefore, a specific number cannot be given. After the
limit of DCs has been reached, the problem that occurs when starting print
sessions may become apparent.

NOTE: This problem does not occur on Windows NT 3.51.


RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

The limit on the number of DCs (Device Contexts) that can be created with this
fix is 250.


The updated module is Winvprt.dll.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 SP
1, 3.0 SP 2, 3.0 SP 3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP 1. This problem was first corrected in
SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An update has been made to the Host Print service so that it can be configured
to specify the maximum number of DCs that can be opened. If the maximum number
of DCs is reached, the Host Print service will reject any additional print jobs
it receives. If this occurs, it will log an Event 21 in the Windows NT
Application Event Log. In addition, the SNA Print Server will return IBM Sense
Code 0x0814 (Bracket BID Reject - RTR Forthcoming) to the host when a print job
is rejected for this reason. The host should interpret this error as meaning
that the print job can be re-sent at a later time.

If the update has not been applied the hardcoded limit of 30 will be used if
using Windows NT V4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, or 4.0 SP3. There is no hardcoded limit
using Windows NT 3.51 Operating System.

If the update is applied, there is no hardcoded limit for the Windows NT system.
However, the number of DCs that can exist on a Windows NT 4.0 system is still
limited by the amount of memory that is allocated to GDI resources.

NOTE: The SNA Print service may reject print jobs for reasons other than this,
which would result in the same IBM sense code being returned to the host.

If there is a need to control how many DCs the print server is allowed to create,
follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: This registry entry is case sensitive.

1. Apply the hotfix.

2. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and find the following
  key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaPrint
      \Parameters\ 

  Add the following entry to this key:

      Value Name: MaxGDISessions
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      String: &lt;value&gt;

  where value is the maximum number of DCs that can be created by the Host Print
  service. Since the the number of DCs that can exist is still limited, the
  recommended maximum value for this parameter is 200.

In addition, the DC limitation is not applicable if the host print sessions are
configured to use a PDF file. Print sessions configured to use a PDF file do not
create DCs, and they do not make any other Graphical Device Interface (GDI)
calls.


NOTE: The SNA Print service may reject print jobs for reasons other than this,
which would result in the same IBM sense code being returned to the host.

If there is a need to control how many DCs the print server is allowed to create,
follow these steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Apply the hotfix.

2. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and find the following
  key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaPrint
      \Parameters\ 

  Add the following entry to this key:

      Value Name: MaxGDISessions
      Data Type: REG_DWORD
      String: &lt;value&gt;

  where value is 1 - 250.

In addition, the limit of 250 DCs is not applicable if the host print sessions
are configured to use a PDF file. Print sessions configured to use a PDF file do
not create DCs, and they do not make any other Graphical Device Interface (GDI)
calls.
