SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Jet database engine (the underlying engine used by DAO to write
and read to a Microsoft Access database file) uses a page buffer to improve
write and read performance. Because of this buffering activity, you cannot
accurately predict the time it will take for a write from one process to be
subsequently read by another process.

Every process that uses the Jet database engine maintains a private page buffer,
which makes synchronous write/read activity between two processes difficult to
achieve. For example, suppose you have two processes (Process 1 and Process 2)
using the Jet database engine to write and read data to and from the same
database file. When Process 1 writes to the database, the new data may not
immediately get flushed to the physical database file. When Process 2 reads from
the database, it may be reading a data page in the page buffer, rather that the
new information written by Process 1.

So if Process 1 writes a record to the database and then signals Process 2 to
read the same record, the read may occasionally fail due to the independent
buffers.

This article demonstrates how to optimize a DAO-based program so that writes to a
physical database and reads from a physical database are likely to occur in a
synchronous manner. Use the techniques described here to help you obtain the
best possible synchronous writing and reading performance when using DAO.

Important Notes
---------------

- The techniques described in this article help ensure that writes and reads
  are performed synchronously. However, due to factors beyond the control of
  Jet, such as network and operating system latency, there is no way to
  guarantee such behavior. The Jet Engine was not designed to support ACID
  (Atomic, Concurrent, Independent, Durable) transactions and should not be
  used in any application environment where such transactions are required.

- Because the Microsoft Access ODBC driver does not expose the functionality of
  the DAO SDK's Idle method, it is not possible to optimize ODBC-based programs
  for synchronous writing and reading.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Forcing a Write Using DAO
-------------------------

With the release of the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine, you can force a write
to the physical database file by using the dbForceOSFlush flag in conjunction
with a DAO workspace transaction. This functionality is available to both the
DAO 3.5 SDK and to the MFC DAO classes that ship with Visual C++. Calling the
CommitTrans(dbForceOSFlush) method tells the Microsoft Jet database engine to
write the contents of the page buffer out to the physical database file. All new
information in the page buffer is written out to the physical database file
before the call to CommitTrans returns.

Using DAO 3.5 SDK Code
----------------------

     CdbWorkspace wsDAO;
     ... Open DAO workspace and various
     ... DAO objects needed.
     // Start workspace transaction.
     wsDAO.BeginTrans();
     ... Write data to database using DAO
     ... objects opened under workspace ws.
     // Commit changes and force flush.
     wsDAO.CommitTrans( dbForceOSFlush );
     ... Send signal to Process 2 to READ data.

Using MFC DAO Code
------------------

     CDaoWorkspace wsMFC;
     ... Open DAO workspace and various
     ... DAO objects needed.
     // Start transaction.
     wsMFC.BeginTrans();
     ... Write data to database using DAO
     ... objects opened under workspace ws.
     // Commit changes and force flush.
     wsMFC.m_pDAOWorkspace-&gt;CommitTrans( dbForceOSFlush );
     ... Send signal to Process 2 to READ data.

NOTE: MFC DAO code above uses the underlying DAO workspace pointer to call
CommitTrans because the MFC DAO classes do not allow passing in the
dbForceOSFlush flag to the CDaoWorkspace CommitTrans method.

Forcing a Read Using DAO
------------------------

With the release of the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine, you can force a
synchronous read from the physical database file by using the dbRefreshCache
flag in conjunction with the workspace Idle method. This functionality is
available to both the DAO 3.5 SDK and to the MFC DAO classes that ship with
Visual C++.

Calling the Idle(dbRefreshCache) method tells the Microsoft Jet database engine
to completely refresh the page buffer with the current information from the
physical database file. All updated pages in the physical database is pulled
into the page buffer before the call to Idle returns.

Using DAO 3.5 SDK Code
----------------------

     CdbEngine engDAO;
     CdbWorkspace wsDAO;

     // Note: You must append workspace in order for
     // Idle to work for your workspace.
     wsDAO = engDAO.CreateWorkspace( _T("MyWS"), _T("Admin"),
                                     _T(""), dbUseJet );
     engDAO.Workspaces.Append( wsDAO );
     ... Open DAO database and various
     ... DAO objects using wsDAO workspace.

     ... Wait here for READ signal from Process 1.

     dbEngine.Idle( dbRefreshCache );
     ... Read data from process#1 here.

Using MFC DAO Code
------------------

     CDaoWorkspace wsMFC;
     // Note: You must append workspace in order for
     // Idle to work for your workspace.
     wsMFC.Create( _T("MyWs"), _T("Admin"), _T("") );
     wsMFC.Append();
     ... Open DAO database and various
     ... DAO objects needed using workspace above

     ... Wait here for READ signal from Process 1.

     wsMFC.Idle( dbRefreshCache );
     ... Read data from Process 1 here.
