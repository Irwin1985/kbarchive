SUMMARY
=======

MSVBVM50.exe is a self-extracting file that installs the latest versions of the
Microsoft Visual Basic run-time files that all applications created with Visual
Basic 5.0 need in order to run.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Msvbvm50.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/utility/1/win98/EN-US/Msvbvm50.exe)

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

Msvbvm50.exe installs the following files, which ship with Visual Basic 5.0
Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3:

  FILE            VERSION
  --------------------------
  Msvbvm50.dll    05.00.8244
  Oleaut32.dll    2.20.4118
  Olepro32.dll    5.0.4118
  Stdole2.tlb     2.20.4118
  Asycfilt.dll    2.20.4118
  Comcat.dll      4.71

These files are the base dependencies for any component or application created in
Visual Basic 5.0.

Do I Need Msvbvm50.exe?
-----------------------

Msvbvm50.exe is not intended to replace the Setup Wizard for distributing Visual
Basic applications. For example, if your application includes components, such
as ActiveX controls or DLLs, you should use the Application Setup Wizard or a
third party setup package for distribution. However, if your Visual Basic
application only depends upon the files included in Msvbvm50.exe, you can
distribute your application by providing end users with the executable (.exe)
file and Msvbvm50.exe.

To determine whether your application requires additional files for distribution,
you can use the Setup Wizard to create a set of setup files as a test. If the
[Files] section of the resulting Setup.lst file only lists your .exe file, end
users should be able to run your application after running Msvbvm50.exe to
install the core run-time files. However, if the [Files] section contains
multiple files, you should consider using the Setup Wizard or a third-party
setup package for distribution instead.

In addition to distributing simple executables, you can also use Msvbvm50.exe for
the following:

- To minimize the size of Internet downloads of Visual Basic applications. By
  running Msvbvm50.exe ahead of time, your users can download your application
  from the Web faster.

- As a troubleshooting step when installation of Visual Basic or a Visual Basic
  application fails.

  If Setup fails with an error message that mentions one of the core files, or
  if registration of a component fails during Setup, the core files on the
  target computer may be mismatched. If the versions of the files in
  Msvbvm50.exe are newer than the versions on the target computer, running
  Msvbvm50.exe before running Setup may resolve the problem.
