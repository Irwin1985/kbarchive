  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

A single form feed (FF) that is sent by the host on a LU3 printer session is
ignored by the SNA Print Server.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Print Service is designed to execute a form feed (FF) included in
an LU3 print job when any of the following conditions are met:

- If the FF is inserted as the first character after the WCC in a 3270
  Erase/Write or Erase/Write Alternate command.

- If the FF is located after a valid NL (New Line) order.

- If the FF is located after the last printable character position of any print
  line.

This is by design according to IBM's 3270 Information Display System manual.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack and the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base(without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To include form feeds that are not at the beginning of lines, add the following
registry entry. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and find
this key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaPrint\Parameters\

Add the following entry to this key:

  

  Value Name: DoAllLU3FFs
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String: TRUE

NOTE: If this registry entry exists, it will be used. The only way to disable
this registry entry is to remove it.
