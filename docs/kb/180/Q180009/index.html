-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, you may receive
the following error message:

  An unexpected error has occurred.
  ID No. c106fdda

If you chose a fault-tolerant setup, you will receive an error message similar to
the following:

  Your upgrade did not complete successfully. Please restart your Microsoft
  Exchange services and your system will behave as it did before the upgrade
  was attempted.

If you did not choose a fault-tolerant setup, you must uninstall and reinstall
Exchange Server 5.0 and then restore your databases from a backup copy.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Setup is attempting to upgrade one of the databases
that is inconsistent.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, quit the Setup program and restore the Priv.edb,
Pub.edb, and Dir.edb databases if needed.

If a fault-tolerant upgrade was chosen originally, with the Directory and
Information Store services stopped, run the following commands to verify the
consistency of each database:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\edbeutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\dir.edb
  &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\edbeutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\priv.edb
  &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\edbeutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\pub.edb
  &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\edbeutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\xdir.edb

If a fault-tolerant upgrade was not chosen originally, with the Directory and
Information Store services stopped, run the following commands to verify the
consistency of each database:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt\System32\eseutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\dir.edb
  &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt\System32\eseutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\priv.edb
  &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt\System32\eseutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\pub.edb
  &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt\System32\eseutil /mh &lt;full path&gt;\xdir.edb

For the database that is inconsistent, run the following command to attempt to
force consistency:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Winnt\System32\eseutil /r /ds or /ispriv or /ispub

If the directory, private, or public database does not become consistent, restore
from a good backup, verify consistency, and rerun Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The upgrade process to Exchange Server 5.5 upgrades all Exchange databases
including the Priv.edb, Pub.edb, Dir.edb, and also the Xdir.edb in the DXADATA
directory, which contains directory synchronization information if directory
synchronization has been set up on this server.

If the upgrade process fails on the Xdir.edb, this database may be inconsistent
because of an ungraceful shutdown. To verify the consistency of this database,
run the following command from the Exchsrvr\Bin directory:

  eseutil /mh &lt;path&gt;\dxadata\xdir.edb |more

A portion of the screen output will show the state of the database to be either
consistent or inconsistent.

Check for the Microsoft Exchange Server Directory Synchronization service. If the
service is present and the database is inconsistent, you must attempt to make it
consistent using the appropriate method:

- Start the Directory Synchronization service, which attempts to perform a soft
  recovery and replay its log files.

- In Exchange Server 5.0, run the following command:

  edbutil /d &lt;path&gt;\dxadata\xdir.edb /r

- In Exchange Server 5.5, run the following command:

  eseutil /p &lt;path&gt;\dxadata\xdir.edb

If the Directory Synchronization service is not present, simply delete all the
files from the &lt;path&gt;\dxadata\.directory. NOTE: This database is not
backed up with Online Backup utilities and can only be restored if there is an
offline copy available.
