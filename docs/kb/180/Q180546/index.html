SUMMARY
=======

Batch files can be used to remotely add user accounts to local groups on all
computers running Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation in a domain
environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article demonstrates how to create a batch file system that will add a user
to all local administrators groups located on every computer running Windows NT
Server and Workstation within a domain environment.

The batch file system uses Netdom.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit to
create a list of computers running Windows NT that are operating as member
servers or workstations in a domain. After the list is created, each computer
from the list is pinged to determine if the computer is currently online. If the
computer is online, Addusers.exe will be called to place a new user in the
computer's local administrators group. If a computer was online, its name will
be placed in a temporary file. After all computers have been processed, the
temporary file will be compared to the list of computers from the domain, to
create a new list of computers that have not yet been updated. This batch file
system can be run multiple times to target only the computers that still need to
be processed.

To create these batch files, perform the following steps:

1. Create the following batch files from the listing below:

  INSUSER.BAT, SUB1.BAT, SUB2.BAT, SUB3.BAT, SUB4.BAT,
  SUB5.BAT, and ADDUSERS.DAT.

2. Edit the first line of INSUSER.BAT to reflect the domain name where the
  target computers are located.

3. Change the &lt;domain\user&gt; in the second line in Addusers.dat to reflect
  the name of the user you wish to add to each computer's local administrators
  group. Make sure there is one blank line at the top of the Addusers.dat file.

4. Log on into the network with domain administrator credentials for the domain
  you wish to modify. Make sure the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit has been
  installed, and is accessible through the system path. This system uses
  Netdom.exe and Addusers.exe from the resource kit.

5. Run the INSUSER.BAT. This batch file may take many hours to complete.

6. Examine the contents of Complete.txt and Working.txt. The Complete.txt file
  contains the names of the computers that were updated, the Working.txt file
  contains the names of the computers that still need processing.

Repeat Steps 5 &amp; 6 as necessary.

If you need to start the entire process over from scratch, delete all .txt files,
then start at Step 1.

Additionally, you can configure these batch files to execute the single command
on workstations or servers only, see Specifying Servers or Workstations.

Specifying Servers or Workstations
----------------------------------

By replacing the SUB3.BAT with the following batch file, REG.EXE from the reskit
is used to check the product type in the registry (server, workstation or domain
controller). By changing the goto command in the :server and :workstation
sections, you can control if the command is run against server or workstations
as follows:

GOTO Sub3bot - This product type will be skipped. GOTO Adduser - Commands in
:addusers section will be processed against this product type.

Currently, only workstation is selected. The contents of complete.txt can be
ignored when using this modified sub3.bat. Check LOCAL.LOG to determine which
machines have been updated. Here's a description of the log files that may be
generated.

LOCAL.LOG - Machines that have been updated.

WKS.TXT - Machines that have been identified as workstations.

SERVER.TXT - Machines identified as SERVERS.

UNDETERMINED.TXT - Machines that are identified in server manager as a server or
workstation but do not have the product type defined in the registry. Or the
registry could not be read remotely.

DC.TXT - Machines that are identified in server manager as a server or
workstation but the product type defined in the registry indicates this is a
domain controller. These system will not be processed.

WORKING - Contains a list of machines that are listed in server manager but did
respond to PING. This list is used when running the batch files a second or
third time.
