-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup.exe and attempt to apply Service Pack 2 (SP2), Service Pack 3
(SP3), or Service Pack 4 (SP4) to a Microsoft Systems Management Server version
1.2 site server, you receive the following error message:

  An error was reported while executing the database upgrade script
  UPGRD12.SQL. The error was reported on line 180. Continue with setup? Press
  Okay to skip the upgrade script or Press Cancel to cancel setup.

CAUSE
=====

Line number 180 in the Upgrd12.sql script runs the Dbcnv12a.exe program to
convert tables in the Systems Management Server database through the SqlExec
function. This function may not work in some SQL environments that use
integrated security.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make the following two changes to the Upgrd12.sql
script.

1. Replace line number 180 ("sqlexec dbcnv12a") with the following:

     Exec master..xp_cmdshell "C:\SMS\SITE.SRV\X86.BIN\dbcnv12a.exe"

2. Replace the last line ("sqlexec dbcnv12") with the following:

     EXEC master..xp_cmdshell "C:\SMS\SITE.SRV\X86.BIN\dbcnv12.exe"

Generally, xp_cmdshell runs Windows NT commands in the security context of SQL
Server, which by default is a user account with local administrator authority.
When a non-system administrator runs xp_cmdshell with the new configuration
option set, the requested command runs in the SQLExecutiveCmdExec user account,
which is the same account used by SQL Executive for scheduled tasks entered by
non-system administrators.

The command shell extended stored procedure uses the SQL Server security context
of the user who is logged in, which works well in SQL Server integrated security
environments.

Copy the Systems Management Server service pack you are trying to install (SP2,
SP3, or SP4) to the system's hard disk, copy the new Upgrd12.sql script to this
source, and then run the service pack Setup.exe program again.

Verify that the Dbcnv12a.exe and Dbcnv12.exe which are mentioned in the modified
script's path, actually exist in the directory specified.
