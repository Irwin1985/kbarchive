SUMMARY
=======

This article describes various methods you can use to create a watermark in
Microsoft Word. A watermark, as defined in this article, is any text or graphic
that is printed to overlap existing text in a document, either in the background
or foreground. For example, a logo printed lightly behind a letter or the word
"Confidential" printed lightly on a contract might be considered a watermark.
Some of the most commonly used text type watermarks are:

- Confidential

- Paid

- Draft

The three methods listed in this article will show how you can create a watermark
in Word using the following features:

- Drawing features

- A text box

- WordArt

With each of these methods, to print a watermark on every page of a document, you
will want to insert it into a header or footer. To print a watermark on just one
page of a document, place your insertion point in the body of the document where
you want it printed and then use one of the methods below.

To view a watermark as it will appear on the printed page, click Page Layout on
the View menu or click Print Preview on the File menu.

To format graphic properties or attributes as used throughout this document, see
the "How to Format a Graphic's Properties" section of this article.

If the watermark interferes with the legibility of the text on the page, you can
lighten the object you used to create the watermark. See the "How to Lighten the
Watermark Color" section of this article.

Use the following information to determine which method below would be the best
one that you can use for your watermark needs:

- Use "Method 1: Use the Drawing Features" if you are inserting a graphic or
  picture.

- Use "Method 2: Use a Text Box" if you want to use text as your watermark with
  none or limited rotational ability.

- Use "Method 3: Use WordArt" if you want to use text as your watermark and you
  want to be able to rotate that text at any angle of rotation. This is the
  only method that allows you full rotation of text.

Method 1: Use the Drawing Features
----------------------------------

This method is an example of placing the Watermark in the Header and Footer area
so that it prints on all pages. To print a watermark only on the current page,
start with step 3.

1. On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

2. Click the Show/Hide Document Text button on the Header And Footer toolbar.

  The text and graphics will now be hidden from view.

3. On the Insert menu, point to Picture, click Clip Art or From File, make sure
  the Float Over Text setting is selected, select your graphic, and then click
  Insert.

4. Click once to select the object, on the Format menu, click Picture or Object,
  and then click the Picture tab.

5. Under Image Control, Color, select Watermark.

6. If you want, change the Brightness and Contrast settings.

7. Click the Wrapping tab and under Wrapping Style, click None, and then click
  OK.

8. Position and size the watermark by dragging it to the desired location on the
  document.

9. If the graphic was placed into the Header or Footer, click Close on the
  Header And Footer toolbar. If the graphic was placed on a page of your
  document, to move the graphic and its contents behind the text in the
  document, follow these steps:

  a. Click once to select the graphic.

  b. Right-click the graphic. On the menu that appears, point to Order, and
     then select Send Behind Text.

  NOTE: Once the object has been sent behind the text, to select that object at
  a future time, click the Select Objects button on the Drawing toolbar and
  then click in the area of the object.

Method 2: Use a Text Box
------------------------

To use a text box to create a watermark, follow these steps:

1. Position the insertion point on the page where you want the watermark to be
  placed. If you want the watermark to appear on every page in the document or
  that section, position the insertion point in the header by clicking Header
  and Footer on the View menu.

2. On the Insert menu, click Text Box.

3. Click and drag the mouse pointer to specify the size of the text box needed
  for the text or graphic you'll be using.

4. Type the watermark text.

5. To rotate the text, select the text inside of the Text Box, click Text
  Direction on the Format menu, and then select the option you want. This
  rotation method is limited to 3 rotational positions. To have complete
  rotation flexibility, you will need to use WordArt. For details of how to do
  this, see the "How to Create Rotated Watermark Text" section of this article.

6. To enlarge the font size and lighten the font color, do the following:

  a. Select the text inside the Text Box.

  b. On the Format menu, click Font.

  c. Under size, change it to the appropriate size.

  d. Under Color, select Grey--25%.

  e. Click OK.

7. To move the text box, select the border and drag it to its new location. To
  resize the text box, select the border, and then drag one of the sizing
  handles. You can also move or resize the text box with specific measurements
  by choosing Drawing Object from the Format menu.

8. If the Text Box was placed into the Header or Footer, click Close on the
  Header and Footer toolbar. If the Text Box was placed on a page of your
  document, to move the text box and its contents behind the text in the
  document, do the following:

  a. Click to select the Text Box.

  b. Point to the text box border, right mouse click, and on the menu that
     appears, point to Order, and then select Send Behind Text.

  NOTE: Once the object has been sent behind the text, to select that object at
  a future time, click the Select Objects button on the Drawing toolbar and
  then click in the area of the object.

Method 3: Use WordArt
---------------------

1. If the Drawing toolbar is not on, turn it on by pointing to Toolbars on the
  View menu, and then select Drawing. The toolbar should appear at the bottom
  of your document.

2. On the Drawing Toolbar, click Insert WordArt.

3. Select a WordArt Style and then click OK.

4. In the "Enter Your Text Here" dialog box, type the watermark text and then
  click OK.

5. Position and size the WordArt object by sizing and dragging it to the desired
  location.

6. If the WordArt object was placed into the Header or Footer, click Close on
  the Header and Footer toolbar. If the WordArt object was placed on a page of
  your document, to move the WordArt object behind the text in the document, do
  the following:

  a. Click to select the WordArt object.

  b. Point to the WordArt object, right mouse click, and on the menu that
     appears, point to Order, and then select Send Behind Text.

  NOTE: Once the object has been sent behind the text, to select that object at
  a future time, click the Select Objects button on the Drawing toolbar and
  then click in the area of the object.

How to Create Rotated Watermark Text
------------------------------------

You must use a WordArt object to be able to rotate text at any angle. For details
of how to insert a WordArt object, see the "Method 3: Use WordArt" section of
this article.

Once the WordArt object is in your document, to rotate text at any angle, do the
following:

1. Click once to select the WordArt object. You should now see the WordArt
  toolbar.

  NOTE: Once the object has been sent behind the text, to select that object at
  a future time, click the Select Objects button on the Drawing toolbar and
  then click in the area of the object.

  NOTE: If the WordArt toolbar does not show, on the View menu, point to
  Toolbars and then select WordArt.

2. On the WordArt toolbar, click the Free Rotate icon.

  NOTE: Your mouse pointer will turn to an arrow with a circular arrow and the
  four corners of your WordArt object will turn into green round circles.

3. Move the mouse pointer to one of the corners and with the left mouse button,
  click to rotate to your desired position.

4. Click back into your document when done. Your mouse pointer will return to
  normal.

How to Lighten the Watermark Color
----------------------------------

If the watermark interferes with the legibility of the text on the page, use one
of the following methods to lighten it:

Method 1: Text not in a WordArt or Drawing Object

1. Select the text.

2. On the Format menu, click Font, change the Color option to Gray-25%, and then
  click OK.

Method 2: Text in a Drawing or WordArt Object

1. Click to select the Object, on the Format menu, click either AutoShape, Text
  Box, or WordArt, and then click the Colors and Lines tab.

2. Under Fill, Color: select a light gray color and then click OK.

NOTE: The result of this method may vary depending on what options were chosen
when the object was created.

Method 3: Imported graphics

You may not be able to edit the graphic, depending on where it was created. In
this case you will need to use a graphics program to alter the color of the
graphic.

Depending on the imported graphic, it may be lightened using the Picture Editor
by doing the following:

1. Double-click the picture.

2. If possible, use the Drawing toolbar to change the attributes that you
  desire. If you are unable to change the attributes here, you will need to use
  another graphics program to make the changes.

------------------------------------

To format the graphic, select it, and then on the Format menu, click Picture or
Object. Use the following table to adjust the picture's Format.

                                     will need to use WordArt. For details
