The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to use the Component Object Model (COM) to pass
objects remotely. This process is commonly referred to as cross-process object
marshaling. The article also examines the difference between passing objects by
reference (ByRef) and by value (ByVal), and demonstrates a custom marshaling
approach to remotely pass a Picture object from one machine to another (ByVal)
using COM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can pass objects to a remote machine using COM, but you must pass the
objects ByRef. (Note: An ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) recordset is the current
exception to this rule because a custom proxy was built for this object type.)
However, passing an object by reference requires network traffic for each
subsequent method call because the object resides on the remote machine. You can
work around this limitation using the Variant data type. The following sample
passes a Picture object to a remote machine using a COM callback and the Variant
data type.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

The following sections contain the sample code for the server and client
projects.

The Server Project:

1. Start a new ActiveX EXE project. Class1 is added by default.

2. From Project menu, click Project Properties, and change the Project Name to
  "PicServer" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the Name property of the Class1 module, change the name to clsPassPicture.

4. Paste the following code into clsPassPicture's code section:

  Option Explicit

  Private gbconnected As Boolean
  Private objClient As Object

  ' Receive the callback reference from the client.
  Public Function AddObjectReference(Caller As Object) As Boolean
     On Error GoTo AddObjectReferenceError

     ' Store the remote client reference for later use.
     Set objClient = Caller
     AddObjectReference = True
     gbconnected = True ' Global connected flag.

     Exit Function

  AddObjectReferenceError:
    #If DEBUG_ON Then
     MsgBox Error$, vbOKOnly + vbExclamation, _
         "AddObjectReference - Error " &amp; Err.Number
    #End If
    AddObjectReference = False
    Exit Function

  End Function

  ' Receive the drop request from the client and destroy the
  ' reference.
  Public Function DropObjectReference(Caller As Object) As Boolean
     On Error GoTo DropObjReferenceError

     If objClient Is Caller Then
        Set objClient = Nothing
        gbconnected = False
        DropObjectReference = True
     Else
        ' Debug.Print "Caller not the same as ObjRef. Unable to
        ' quit."
        DropObjectReference = False
     End If
     Exit Function

  DropObjReferenceError:
     #If DEBUG_ON Then
        MsgBox Error$, vbOKOnly + vbExclamation, _
          "DropObjectReference - Error" &amp; Str$(Err)
     #End If
     DropObjectReference = False
     Exit Function

  End Function

  ' Public function that receives the pass picture request from
  ' the client.
  Public Function ServerIcon() As Boolean
     Dim i As Integer
     Dim MyFile As String
     Dim tb() As Byte

     On Error GoTo IconError
     If gbconnected Then     ' Test for existing client reference.
         MyFile = "C:\TestPass.bmp"
         Load MyForm
         SavePicture MyForm.Image1.Picture, MyFile  ' Save to temp
                                                    ' file.
         Open MyFile For Binary As #1   ' Read into byte array.
         i = 0
         i = LOF(1)                     ' Get the file size.
         ReDim tb(i + 1) As Byte        ' Resize the array.
         i = 0
         Do Until EOF(1)
            Get #1, , tb(i)             ' Read data into array.
            i = i + 1
         Loop
         Close #1
         Kill MyFile ' Clean up the temp file.
         Unload MyForm 'Unload the Form
         objClient.ReceivePic tb   ' Pass the array to the client
                                   ' using a reference.
         ServerIcon = True
      End If
   Exit Function

  IconError:
     #If DEBUG_ON Then
     MsgBox Error$, vbOKOnly + vbExclamation, _
          "Get Server Icon - Error" &amp; Str$(Err)
     #End If
     ServerIcon = False
  End Function

5. From Project menu, click Add Form to add a new form, and change the name and
  caption of the Form to "MyForm" (without the quotation marks).

6. Add an Image control to MyForm, Image1 is added by default. Set the Picture
  property to a .bmp file on your computer.

7. Compile the Project into an executable file.

The Client Project:

1. Start a new ActiveX EXE project. Class1 is added by default.

2. From Project menu, click Project Properties, and change the Project Name to
  "PicClient" (without the quotation marks).

3. From the Project menu, click References, and then click PicServer.

4. In the Name property of the Class1 module, change the name to
  "clsReceivePicture" (without the quotation marks).

5. Add the following code to clsReceivePicture's code section:

  Option Explicit

  Public Sub ReceivePic(PassedPic As Variant)
     Dim i As Integer, j As Integer
     Dim MyFile As String
     Dim tb() As Byte
     ' This public sub routine shows how to pass an object using an
     ' icon.

     On Error GoTo BadObj
     i = UBound(PassedPic)
     ' Repack the variant into the byte array for binary write.
     ReDim tb(i) As Byte

     For j = LBound(PassedPic) To UBound(PassedPic)
        tb(j) = PassedPic(j)
     Next j

     ' Write to a local file.
     MyFile = "C:\TestPass.bmp"
     Open MyFile For Binary As #1

     For j = LBound(tb) To UBound(tb)
        Put #1, , tb(j)
     Next j
     Close #1

     ' Recreate the object from a file.
     Set frmDCOMDemoClient.picPassIcon.Picture = LoadPicture(MyFile)
     Kill MyFile
     Exit Sub

  BadObj:
     MsgBox Err.Number &amp; ": " &amp; Err.Description &amp; _
          " - " &amp; "Object Pass    Failed..."
  End Sub

6. From Project menu, click Add Form to add a new form, and change the name and
  caption of the Form to "frmDCOMDemoClient" (without the quotation marks).

7. Add a Command button to frmDCOMDemoClient. Change its name property to
  "cmdGetObject" (without the quotation marks), and change its Caption property
  to "Get Server Icon" (without the quotation marks).

8. Add a PictureBox control to frmDCOMDemoClient, and change its Name property
  to "picPassIcon" (without the quotation marks).

9. Paste the following code into frmDCOMDemoClient's code section:

  Option Explicit

  Public mbIsConnected As Boolean
  Public objMyClassInstance As Object
  Private oServer As PicServer.clsPassPicture

  Private Sub cmdGetObject_Click()
     ' This subroutine calls the server to initiate the icon pass.

     ' Connect to your server, selected in the Project References
     ' dialog box.
     Set oServer = New PicServer.clsPassPicture
     ServerConnect                 'Set up the callback.
     If mbIsConnected Then
        rf = oServer.ServerIcon    'Call remote server method.
        If rf Then
           MsgBox "Icon Passed Successfully..."
        Else
           MsgBox "Icon Pass Failed..."
        End If
        ServerDisconnect           ' Clean up after the callback.
     Else

     If oServer.AddObjectReference(objMyClassInstance) Then
          mbIsConnected = True
     Else
         mbIsConnected = False
     End If
     Screen.MousePointer = vbDefault
     Exit Sub

  cmdButtonError:
  ' When using asynchronous callbacks between two objects, you need
  ' this error checking code to deal with the possibility of a
  ' collision. This collision can occur when a client and server
  ' attempt to call each other at the same time. This error handler
  ' forces the client to wait for a random period of time and retry the
  ' failed operation. During this time, the server should complete its
  ' call to the client, allowing the client to succeed when it retries
  ' the call to the server. You should also include the same error
  ' handling code in the server object.

  If Erl = 100 And Err = &amp;H80010001 Then
     If nCurErrorCount &gt;= MAX_ERROR_COUNT Then
        MsgBox "Unable to obtain server reference.  Retry later.", _
        vbExclamation, "Remote Server Connect Error"
        Resume EndOfError
     Else
        For iCounter = 1 To 2000 * Rnd()
           DoEvents
        Next iCounter
        Resume
     End If
  End If
  Screen.MousePointer = vbDefault
  MsgBox Error$, vbCritical, "cmdButton Error"
  EndOfError:
