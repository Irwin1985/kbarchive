SUMMARY
=======

The article includes earlier material from LinkAge Software Inc. Help files that
are not shipped with the product.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, new with Exchange 5.5, provides a
component that synchronizes one or more Notes Name &amp; Address books with the
Exchange directory. Synchronization is bi-directional and can include custom
recipients as well as mailboxes. The names and addresses of distribution lists
(Notes "groups") can be synchronized; however, the membership of the DL or group
is not carried in the shadow entry, and all mail routing must be done on the
system where the DL or group is maintained.

As delivered, the product synchronizes a useful subset of the many attributes
supported by the two directories. The purpose of this article is to explain how
attributes are synchronized, and how you can customize the process to meet local
requirements. Through customization, you can do either of the following:

- Change the list of attributes that are synchronized between Notes and
  Exchange, adding or removing attributes.

- Change the way attributes are mapped between the systems.

The synchronization process uses four control files, which are located in two
subdirectories of the Connector's root directory. The UNC for the Notes
Connector's root directory is:

  \\&lt;servername&gt;\connect$\exchconn

Important Note: If you edit these files using NotePad or another text editor,
ensure that you save backup copies of the shipped files. In addition, do not use
the [tab] key when making changes. All whitespace characters should be entered
using the space key.

Also, before you edit these files, ensure that directory synchronization is not
active (for example, by shutting down the Notes Connector). If you add
attributes to the synchronized schema or change any mapping rules for existing
attributes, you will most likely need to do a full directory reload in one or
both directions.

Schema definition files determine the subset of the native directory schemas that
are synchronized. Each line in the file that is not blank or a comment defines a
single attribute. The first column is a short name or tag for a directory
attribute used in the mapping rules (see below). The second column has the
maximum field length for the purpose of directory synchronization. The total of
all field lengths must not exceed approximately 9500. The third column contains
the internal name for the attribute in the directory. See Appendix A for how to
determine these names for Exchange and Notes. For the Notes Address Book, the
schema definition includes a fourth column, which should be present but is not
used by the Connector.

The following definition of the Exchange directory schema is shipped in
Dxamex\amap.tbl:

  ACCOUNT     32 Assoc-NT-Account
  COMPANY     64 Company
  DEPARTMENT  64 Department
  FULLNAME   128 Display-Name
  FIRSTNAME   64 Given-Name
  ALIAS       64 Mail-nickname
  OFFICE      64 Physical-Delivery-Office-Name
  LASTNAME    64 Surname
  NOTESADDR  128 Proxy-Addresses(NOTES:)
  USNCreated  12 USN-Created
  Initials     5 Initials
  Title       32 Title
  Phone       20 Telephone-Office1
  MobilePhn   20 Telephone-Mobile
  Fax         20 Telephone-Fax

The following definition of the Notes address book schema is shipped in
Dxanotes\amap.tbl:

  FULLNAME   220 FullName 1
  MAILDOMAIN  31 MailDomain 2
  COMPANY     64 CompanyName NULL
  DEPARTMENT  64 Department NULL
  FIRSTNAME   64 FirstName NULL
  LASTNAME    64 LastName NULL
  LOCATION   128 Location NULL
  SHORTNAME    8 ShortName NULL
  Initials     5 MiddleInitial NULL
  Title       32 JobTitle NULL
  Phone       20 OfficePhoneNumber NULL
  MobilePhn   20 CellPhoneNumber NULL
  Fax         20 OfficeFAXPhoneNumber NULL
  ; do not change the following definitions
  UNID        64 $$UNID NULL
  DN         256 $$DN NULL
  USNCreated  16 $$USN NULL

Mapping rule files define how attributes from one schema are mapped to attributes
in the other schema. Each non-blank, non-comment line is a rule that assigns a
value to a single attribute in an entry in the target directory. The right-hand
side of the rule is a string expression made up of string constants, numeric
constants, references to attributes in the source directory, and built-in string
manipulation functions.

The following rules for mapping Notes attributes to Exchange attributes are
shipped in Dxamex\mapnotes.tbl:

  Alias = ISEQUAL( ShortName, "", SUBSTR( FullName, 1, 64 ), ShortName )
  FullName = X500( FullName, "CN" )
  FirstName = FirstName
  LastName = LastName
  Company = Company
  Department = Department
  Office = Location
  Initials = Initials
  ; change the following rule only with care
  TA = "NOTES:" Strip( FullName, ";", "L", "R" ) "@" MailDomain
  ; do not change the following rule
  DN = UNID

Note that the DN and TA attributes were not defined explicitly in the Exchange
schema. These attributes are required for directory synchronization and are
always synchronized. The TA (Target-Address) attribute is the Notes user's
e-mail address and must be unique within the Exchange directory. Although Notes
does not enforce the uniqueness of this name, for all practical purposes the
name must be unique to allow the Notes router to reliably deliver mail to the
right mailbox. The DN (Distinguished Name) mapping rule actually provides only a
portion of the eventual full DN created for the Notes entry in Exchange. The
full DN is constructed by concatenating the DN of the Import Container where
Notes custom recipient entries are stored, with the DN fragment created by the
mapping rule.

The TA rule provides a good example of how the string expressions work. For
example, if the Notes user's full name and mail domain are "Denise
Graham/Sales/Acme Corp; Denise Graham; Graham" and "Acme-HQ", then this rule
will result in an Exchange TA field containing "NOTES:Denise Graham/Sales/Acme
Corp@Acme-HQ". See below for a full description of the built-in mapping
functions that are available.

The following rules for mapping Exchange attributes to Notes attributes are
shipped in Dxanotes\mapmex.tbl:

  FullName = Trim( Strip( NotesAddr, "@", "R" ), "B" )
  MailDomain = Trim( Strip( NotesAddr, "@", "L" ), "B" )
  ShortName = Alias
  LastName = ISEQUAL( LastName, "", FullName, LastName )
  FirstName = FirstName
  Company = Company
  Department = Department
  Location = Office
  Initials = Initials
  ; do not change the following rules
  UNID = "00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000"
  USN = USNCreated
  DN = DN

Mapping Rules use a simple macro language that allows you to define how to create
entries in different directory systems. An important part of this macro language
is the mapping functions that manipulate a series of arguments you supply and
return a result in the form of a string. Your mapping rules can combine this
result with other constant strings and function calls to build up the overall
result of the rule.

Mapping functions operate on strings and numeric constants. Strings can be either
attribute tags (the short names defined in the schema definition file) from the
source directory, or string literals. A string literal is an actual sequence of
characters enclosed in quotation marks, such as "Star Mart", ".", or even " "
(three spaces). Note that you cannot use the real internal attribute names in
mapping rules. You must use the attribute tags defined in the schema definition
files.

  FUNCTION_NAME( arguments )

For example:

     LEFT (Fullname, 4)

If this function is coded in a mapping rule, it will return the left-most four
characters of the contents of the Fullname field in the source directory.

Functions can be combined with each other or with string literals, allowing you
to create arbitrarily complex result strings. A rule and the resulting string it
returns can be as long as 2,048 characters.

The list below represents all the built-in mapping functions; more complete
explanations and examples are provided later in this document.

Mapping Functions: Detailed Descriptions

  Notational conventions:

  UPPERCASE type

  used for function names

  [ ]

  used to indicate optional arguments. If an optional argument is omitted, its
  default value is assumed.

In the examples, each sample call is followed by the result it produces. Although
the examples use only string literals as arguments, remember that each argument
can itself be an arbitrarily complex string expression, including nested
function calls.

Syntax:

  AND(exp1,exp2)

Description:

Returns the concatenation of two non-null strings, or the null string if either
of the strings involved is null.

Examples:

  AND("A", "B" )  "AB"
  AND ("", "B")  ""
  AND("A", "")  ""

Syntax:

  CFGPARM( exp1[,exp2] )

Description:

CFGPARM returns the value of a parameter in the Exchconn.ini file. Exp1 specifies
the parameter whose value is to be returned; exp2 specifies the section within
the INI file. If the section is omitted, then the DXA's home section is used. If
neither the section nor the parameter is found, the result is an empty string.

Examples:

  CFGPARM( "executable")  "lsdxamex.exe"
  CFGPARM( "locale", "dxm")  "English"

Syntax:

  ISEQUAL( exp1, exp2, val1, val2 )

Description:

ISEQUAL returns the value of val1 if exp1 equals exp2, otherwise it returns the
value of val2. ISEQUAL is not case-sensitive.

Examples:

  ISEQUAL( "remote", "remote", "R", "L")  "R"
  ISEQUAL( "remote", "local", "R", "L")  "L"
  ISEQUAL( "remote", "REMOTE", "R", "L")  "R"

Syntax:

  LEFT ( field, length, [, pad] )

Description:

LEFT returns the left-most length characters of field. If field has fewer than
length characters, the result is padded on the right with the pad character. The
default pad character is a blank.

Examples:

  LEFT ( "416-862-7148", "3" )  "416"
  LEFT ( "triple", "9" )  "triple   "
  LEFT ( "triple", "9", "x" )  "triplexxx"

Syntax:

  LOWER ( field )

Description:

LOWER returns the value of field with any upper-case letters converted to
lower-case.

Examples:

  LOWER ( "LinkAge" )  "linkage"
  LOWER ( "Bonnie" )  "bonnie"

Syntax:

  NAMEF ( field, [, style] )

Description:

If field contains a person's name in a specified format, NAMEF returns the
person's first name or initial. Two styles are supported:

1. The name is in the form "First Middle Last".

2. The name is in the form "Last, First Middle".

The default style is 1 if field does not contain a comma, 2 if it does.

Initials or strings of initials are treated as first or middle names. If a name
has only one part, it is considered both first and last name, regardless of the
style.

Examples:

  NAMEF ( "Sarah Elizabeth Turner" )  "Sarah"
  NAMEF ( "S. E. Turner" )  "S."
  NAMEF ( "SE Turner" )  "SE"
  NAMEF ( "Turner, Sarah E.", "2" )  "Sarah"
  NAMEF ( "Madonna", "2" )  "Madonna"

Syntax:

  NAMEL ( field, [, style] )

Description:

If field contains a person's name in a specified format, NAMEF returns the
person's last name. Two styles are supported:

1. The name is in the form "First Middle Last".

2. The name is in the form "Last, First Middle".

The default style is 1 if field does not contain a comma, 2 if it does.

Initials or strings of initials are treated as first or middle names. If a name
has only one part, it is considered both first and last name, regardless of the
style.

Examples:

  NAMEL ( "Sarah Elizabeth Turner" )  "Turner"
  NAMEL ( "S. E. Turner" )  "Turner"
  NAMEL ( "Sarah Turner" )  "Turner"
  NAMEL ( "Turner, Sarah E.", "2" )  "Turner"
  NAMEL ( "Madonna")  "Madonna"

Syntax:

  NAMEM( field, [, style] )

Description:

If field contains a person's name in a specified format, NAMEF returns the
person's middle name or initial. Two styles are supported:

1. The name is in the form "First Middle Last".

2. The name is in the form "Last, First Middle".

The default style is 1 if field does not contain a comma, 2 if it does.

Initials or strings of initials are treated as first or middle names. If a name
has only one part, it is considered both first and last name, regardless of the
style. Anything that is not identified as a first or last name is considered a
middle name.

Examples:

  NAMEM ( "Sarah Elizabeth Turner" )  "Elizabeth "
  NAMEM ( "S. E. Turner" )  "E. "
  NAMEM ( "Turner, Sarah E." )  "E. "
  NAMEM ( "Turner, Sarah", "2" )  ""
  NAMEM ( "Turner, Sarah E.", "2" )  "E."
  NAMEM ( "Turner, Sarah E. M", "2" )  "E. M."

Syntax:

  POS ( field, target )

Description:

POS returns the position of the string target within field. If the target is not
in the field, POS returns zero.

Examples:

  POS ( "Title: President", "Ti" )  "1"
  POS ( "Title: President", ":" )  "6"
  POS ( "Title: President", "Manager" )  "0"

Syntax:

  PROPER ( field )

Description:

PROPER returns the value of field with lower-case and upper-case letters
converted to mixed-case, as if field were a proper name.

Examples:

  PROPER ( "linkage" )  "Linkage"
  PROPER ( "john")  "John"
  PROPER ( "o'malley" )  "O'Malley"

Syntax:

  REPLACE ( field, what [,with] )

Description:

This mapping function enables you to remove specific characters from an ID or
replace selected characters with substitute characters. It scans field for any
characters in the what string and replaces them with the corresponding character
from the with string. If the with string is shorter or is not provided (meaning
that one or more characters in what have no corresponding characters in with),
those characters are elided (removed) from field.

Examples:

  REPLACE ("James Martin"," ","_")  "James_Martin"

  REPLACE ("Sales &amp; Marketing Email Group"," ",".")
  "Sales.&amp;.Marketing.Email.Group"
  REPLACE ("Constantine Ra[circumflex i]ch'al", " [circumflex i]'", ".i")  "Constantine.Raichal"

Syntax:

  RIGHT ( field, length [,pad] )

Description:

RIGHT returns the right-most length characters of field. If field has fewer than
length characters, the result is padded on the left with the pad character. The
default pad character is a blank.

Examples:

  RIGHT ( "416-862-7148", "7" )  "62-7148"
  RIGHT ( "416-862-7148", "8" )  "862-7148"
  RIGHT ( "node", "5", "@" )  "@node"

Syntax:

  STRIP ( string1, string2, [scan-from-direction] , [strip-toward-
  direction]),

  where
  [scan-from-direction] = "L" | "R"
  [strip-toward-direction] = "L" | "R"

Description:

STRIP locates the left-most or right-most occurrence of string2 in string1 and
removes characters from the right or left, including string2. The value for
scan-from-direction determines whether STRIP looks for the left-most or
right-most occurrence of string 2 in string 1; the value for strip-toward-
direction determines whether characters are removed from the left or right of
where string2 starts.

If the either the scan-from-direction or the strip-toward-direction parameter is
omitted, the value for the missing parameter is assumed to be the same as the
one that is specified. If both these parameters are omitted, the default for
both is assumed to be "R" (right).

Examples:

  STRIP ( "Senior Vice President", "Vice", "L" )  " President"   (Note the
  leading space)
  STRIP ( "Senior Vice President", "Vice", "R" )  "Senior "   (Note the
  trailing space)
  STRIP ( "Senior Vice President", " " , "L")  "Vice President"
  STRIP ( "Senior Vice President", " ", "R" )  "Senior Vice"
  STRIP ( "Senior Vice President", " ", "R", "L" )  "President"

Syntax:

  SUBSTR ( field, start [,length [, pad] ] )

Description:

SUBSTR returns the portion of field starting at position start, with length
characters, padded with the pad character if necessary.

The default for length is (length of string - start + 1). The default pad
character is a blank.

Examples:

  SUBSTR( "Vice-President", "6" )  "President"
  SUBSTR( "Vice-President", "2", "3" )  "ice"
  SUBSTR( "Vice-President", "7", "9", "s" )  "residents"
  SUBSTR( "Vice-President", "11", "4" )  "dent"

Syntax:

  TRIM ( field [,option] )

Description:

TRIM returns field with leading or trailing blanks removed. Option specifies
whether to remove leading blanks (L) trailing blanks (R), or both (B).

Examples:

  TRIM ( "   Title   ", "B" )  "Title"
  TRIM ( "   Title   ", "L" )  "Title   "
  TRIM ( "   Title   ", "R" )  "   Title"

Syntax:

  UPPER ( field )

Description:

UPPER returns the value of field with any lower-case letters converted to
upper-case.

Examples:

  UPPER ( "LinkAge" )  "LINKAGE"
  UPPER ( "Bonnie" )  "BONNIE"

Syntax:

  WORD ( field, n [, m] )

Description:

WORD returns m blank-delimited words starting with the nth word in field. WORD
returns an empty string if field contains fewer than n words. The default value
for m is 1.

Examples:

  WORD ( "one of a kind", "1" )  "one"
  WORD ( "one of a kind", "1", "2" )  "one of"
  WORD ( "one of a kind", "3", "2" )  "a kind"
  WORD ( "one of a kind", "5" )  ""
  WORD ( "Sarah E. Turner", "3" )  "Turner"

Syntax:

  X500 ( address, field name [,index] )

Description:

X500 returns the contents of the named field for the specified address. If the
address has two or more components with the same field name, the index value is
used to specify the correct one.

The following X.500-type addresses are supported:

- Microsoft Exchange Canonical (for example, /o=org/ou=site[/cn=container])

- Lotus Notes Canonical (for example, cn=name/ou=site./o=org/c=country)

- Lotus Notes Abbreviated Canonical (for example, name/site/org/country)

For example, suppose the value of the DN field is that provided in the sample
X500 address below:

  /o=StarMart/ou=Sales Office/cn=Recipients/cn=Notes_Users

The function would provide the following result:

  X500 ( DN, "ou")  "Sales Office"
  X500 ( DN, "o")  "StarMart"
  X500 ( DN, "cn", 2)  "Notes_Users"

Appendix: How to determine the internal name of directory attributes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Both Exchange and Notes allow you to inspect internal names of directory
attributes and inspect detailed schema and content information for specific
attributes of a directory entry.

For the Exchange directory, run the Exchange Administrator with the /raw option.
Use shift-enter to view the attributes of a recipient object. You will be able
to view the detailed schema for recipients, including the internal directory
names for recipient attributes.

For the Notes address book, right-click the mouse on an address book entry that
contains the attributes of interest, and select Document Properties. Select the
Fields tab, and you will see a list box that shows you the internal directory
names for the attributes of the selected entry. You can also display the
contents of each attribute using this tab.
