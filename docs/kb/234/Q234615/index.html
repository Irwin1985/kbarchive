-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Paint, WordPad, and Imaging tools are all running and either Paint or
WordPad is the active program when you shut down or log off your computer, you
may receive the following error message:

  An illegal operation occurred

CAUSE
=====

In Windows 95, Paint and WordPad are Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) version
3 programs, and Imaging is an MFC 4.0 program. There is a conflict in global
memory between versions 3.x and 4.0 of MFC, which may cause the version 4.0
program to lose a handle to a window function during Windows 95 shutdown.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, quit Paint, WordPad, Imaging, and any
other MFC programs before shutting down or logging off your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Windows 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 (retail release) does not include the Imaging tool. However, Windows
95 (retail release) does include MFC 3.0 versions of Paint and WordPad. If you
install an MFC 4.0 program, and you have Paint, WordPad, and the MFC 4.0 program
open during shutdown, the error message listed above may occur.
