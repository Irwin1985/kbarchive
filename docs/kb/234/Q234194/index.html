-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.1, 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0, 5.0sp1, 5.0sp2, 5.0sp3, on platform(s):
      - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) application built with Visual C++ 4.x or
5.0 is run on Windows 95 concurrently with a MFC application built with Visual
C++ 2.x (MFC version 3.x), then when the user logs off or shuts down the
computer, a dialog box stating that "An illegal operation occurred" in the MFC
4.x application may appear. This error only occurs if the MFC version 3.x has
the focus upon shutdown.

CAUSE
=====

The MFC classes version 3.0 adds atoms, by calling the AddAtom function, to the
global atom table by calling the atoms in a different manner than MFC 4.0 and
later. All versions of MFC store the original window procedure of a subclassed
window in the window property list before replacing it. MFC version 3.0 sets the
property by using an atom as the following code sample illustrates:

  static const ATOM _afxOldWndProcAtom = GlobalAddAtom(_T("AfxOldWndProc"));

The SetProp method does not call the GlobalAddAtom function if an atom is passed
to it. Therefore GlobalAddAtom is called only once in the MFC 3.x application
instance (during the initialization of _afxOldWndProcAtom), even if the atom is
used in several subclassed windows. MFC Versions 4.0 and later set this property
using a string as follows:

  static const TCHAR szAfxOldWndProc[] = _T("AfxOldWndProc");

In this case, SetProp calls GlobalAddAtom once for each subclassed window. During
shutdown, if Windows 95 detects that a process is shutting down without
destroying all of its windows, then Windows 95 cleans them up for the
application. Specifically, Windows 95 calls GlobalDeleteAtom for each atom that
is used in a window's property list. When an MFC 3.x application has several
subclassed windows, Windows 95 deletes the AfxOldWndProc atom several times,
even though the application added it only once. In this situation, the atom is
removed from the global atom table before the MFC 4.x application is done using
it. As a result, the MFC 4.x application is not able to access the stored window
procedure when handling the WM_NCDESTROY window in the _AfxActivationWndProc
function, which results in the illegal operation (general protection fault).

RESOLUTION
==========

If the MFC 4.x application adds the atom more times than it is deleted during
the shutdown of any MFC 3.x applications, then the atom is still available when
the MFC 4.x application references it. Making the atom constantly available can
be done by adding the following statement to the MFC 4.x application's
CWinApp::InitInstance function:

  for( int i = 0; i&lt;50; i++)
           GlobalAddAtom(_T("AfxOldWndProc"));

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows global atom table maintains a reference count on each atom that is
added. If the same atom is added more than once, Windows does not add a new
entry in the global atom table; instead, it increments the atom's reference
count. Similarly, Windows decrements an atom's reference count whenever it is
deleted. When the reference count reaches zero, Windows then removes the atom
from the global atom table.

The reference count is maintained in a 16-bit unsigned word. Therefore, the
reference count may reach 2 to the 16th power minus one (65535) before it rolls
over to zero. If a MFC 4.x application implements the code in the suggested
resolution, then it requires over 1300 active instances of the application
before the reference count limit is reached. In addition, calling GlobalAddAtom
for an atom that already exists does not cause any additional consumption of
system resources, other than the processor time used on the function call.
Therefore, the suggested resolution may be safely deployed in a production
environment with no appreciable side effects.

MFC subclasses non-MFC windows and uses the atom with the name AfxOldWndProc as
the key for retrieving the subclassed Window's window procedure. MFC 3.0 and MFC
4.2 uses the same name for the atom. _AfxActivationWndProc uses the atom to
retrieve the subclassed window procedure prior to calling it. Destruction of a
window MFC replaces the window procedure of the non-MFC window with its original
window procedure. This is done in code in the _AfxActivationWndProc procedure
that handles WM_NCDESTROY.

This issue is encountered sporadically but is more common on Japanese, Chinese,
and computers running Korean Windows 95 due to MFC subclassing the Input Method
Editor (IME) window.

This problem may be observed by using certain accessories that ship with Windows
95. The Imaging accessory is a MFC 4.x application, while Paint and WordPad are
both MFC 3.0 applications. If a user starts an instance of Imaging, then Paint,
then WordPad, then leaves the focus on WordPad while shutting down, they may
encounter the illegal operation error message, or the applications may simply
hang, or stop responding. The Windows 98 versions of WordPad and Paint do not
use MFC.

A conflict does not occur between any two applications if one of the applications
is using the version of MFC shipped with Visual C++ 6.0 or later.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Method One:

On a computer running Japanese Windows 95:

1. Create a MFC dialog-based application with AppWizard using Visual C++ 4.2.

2. Run this application.

3. Run WordPad.

4. While the WordPad application window is the topmost window, shut down the
  computer.

Method Two:

1. On a computer running Windows 95, run Imaging for Windows 95 and then run
  WordPad.

2. When the WordPad application window is the topmost window, shut down the
  computer.
