-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Terminal Server clients often discover that they have lost configuration
settings (such as Outlook settings, icons on the desktop, and so forth) when
they log on to a computer running Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the registry key containing the user's SID is not
unloaded when the user logs off and is therefore not being updated correctly. A
process (Csrss.exe) has a handle to the key open, thereby preventing WINLOGON
from unloading the key.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition service pack that
contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English language version of this software update should have the following
file attributes or later:

  07/22/99   01:56p  1,432,320   Ntoskrnl.exe   Alpha

NOTE: This software update affects the Windows NT Kernel. The kernel file has two
different versions; single processor and multiprocessor. The installation files
are named Ntoskrnl.exe and Ntkrnlmp.exe respectively. However, the file must be
named Ntoskrnl.exe before being installed. Therefore, when you install a new
kernel on a multiprocessor system, you must rename Ntkrnlmp.exe to Ntoskrnl.exe
in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The logged-on user's profile is held in the user's SID key under the HKEY_USER
registry hive. This registry key is not unloaded when the user logs off. The
user profile is not being updated correctly because of this.

The following change can also be made to correct the problem:

When a user logs off, CSRSS (Winsrv.dll) issues a shutdown notification to all
the processes running for this user. A change was made such that CSRSS waits 10
seconds for all the processes to close before allowing WINLOGON to unload the
User profile from the registry. This wait interval can be configured using the
following the new registry key. To modify this interval:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and add the following registry value:

  Value Name: ProcessTerminateTimeout:
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  Value: milliseconds (Default: 10000, 10 Sec) (Infinite: -1) (None: 0)

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart the server to cause the change to take effect.

Microsoft does not recommend modifying this value, except in very rare
circumstances where it may need to be tuned.
