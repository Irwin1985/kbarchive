right"


Page 538: Procedure Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

Replace all text on page (below heading but both above and below Figure 23-6)
with the following:

Another way to position a picture (or text) is to turn it into a watermark, which
places it behind the normal text on the page and displays it in a lighter shade
so that text or other objects show over it easily.

To create a watermark, insert a picture or text when working in header and footer
view, as follows:

1. Choose Header and Footer from the View menu to display the Header and Footer
  toolbar.

2. Click the Show/Hide Document Text button on the Header and Footer toolbar to
  hide any text or graphics in the main part of the document, if necessary. For
  more information, see "Using Headers and Footers" on page 320.

3. Insert the graphic or a text box using the Drawing toolbar. See Chapter 19
  for more information.

4. Position and format the graphic or text box so it appears where you want it
  on the page. You're not limited to the header or footer areas - you can place
  the object anywhere on the page.

5. Click the Close button on the Header and Footer toolbar to return to the
  standard document view. The picture or text you inserted will appear in a
  lighter shade, and you'll find that you can insert text or graphics on top of
  it.


Page 555: Typographical Error

Line 14 on page 555 contains a typo:

Change:
"docu-ment"

click the Table Of Contents In Frame button on the Frames toolbar. Word adds the
frame with the hyperlinks inside it."


Page 800: First Procedure Is Incorrect
--------------------------------------

In list item #4 at top of page, change it to read:
"Click OK to insert the sound. (To hear the sound, choose Web Page Preview from
the File menu.)"


Page 821: Information Is Incorrect
----------------------------------

In the paragraph below "Creating an Office Profile," change the text to read:
"Word should automatically create and maintain an Office Profile for you as you

the Office Profile Wizard from your network administrator. Once you have the
Office Profile Wizard, it's easy to create a profile:"
