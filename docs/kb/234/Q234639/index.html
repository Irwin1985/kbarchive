SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the concept of server location in Exchange Server and
explains how to use server location to restrict users on a server or a group of
servers to use only a specified Exchange Server connector.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Server locations in Exchange Server are generally used to control public folder
access in a large Exchange Server organization. However, server locations can
also be used to restrict users on an Exchange Server computer or group of
Exchange Server computers to only use a specified Internet Mail Service or other
Exchange Server connector.

The most common reasons to restrict the use of a connector are to allow only
certain users (such as high-priority or management users) located on a server or
group of servers to use a certain connector, or to restrict use by physical
subnet or geographical location.

This article provides steps to create server locations for the Internet Mail
Service, but you can also use server locations for the X.400 Connector, the Site
Connector, and the Dynamic Remote Access Service (RAS) Connector. You can use
the steps in this article to create server locations for any of these Exchange
Server connectors.

For example, you may have two groups of Exchange Server computers in an Exchange
Server site that are in different physical locations or on different physical
subnets. Each location or subnet has one Exchange Server computer that has an
Internet Mail Service (location 1 and location 2, respectively). Because of
firewall and network issues, you may need the users in location 1 to send and
receive e-mail from the only the Internet Mail Service in location 1, and users
on the Exchange Server computers in location 2 to only send and receive Internet
e-mail from the server that has the Internet Mail Service in location 2.

NOTE: Server locations only apply within a site, not between sites.

To enter a server location for location 1:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, click the server
  name.

2. On the File menu, click Properties, and then click the General tab.

3. In the Server Location box, type "Location 1" (without the quotation marks)
  to replace the default none.

4. Click Apply. When the following question is displayed

  Are you sure you want to create the new location 'Location 1'?

  click Yes.

5. Open the Internet Mail Service properties for each server that you want to
  associate with location 1, and then click the Address Space tab.

6. Double-click the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address to open the
  properties.

7. Click the Restrictions tab, click This Location, and then click Apply.

Use these steps to add location 1 as the server location for the entire group of
servers that you want to include in that server location. Then use the same
steps to add location 2 as the server location for the different group of
servers that you want to include in a separate server location.

After you perform these steps, all of the users on a server in location 1 use the
services of the server in location 1 only, and all of the users on a server in
location 2 use the services of the server in location 2 only. These users do not
use the services of any other server.

When you want to bring a new server into the site, start the Administrator
program, click the new server, click Properties on the File menu, click the
General tab, and then type the name of the location (in this example, either
"Location 1" (without the quotation marks) or "Location 2" (without the
quotation marks)) that you want the new server to join.

You may want to restrict users in other sites from using Internet Mail Service
connectors in a different site. This is a completely separate issue. In this
case, you must keep address spaces from being replicated to other sites, and you
must mark the address space as LOCAL on its originating site. For additional
