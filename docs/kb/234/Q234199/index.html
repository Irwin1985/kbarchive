-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Baseball 2000, you may receive the following error
message:

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

When you click Details, you receive the following error message:

  Baseball 2000 caused an invalid page fault in module Graphics.dll.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- One megabyte (MB) or less of video memory is installed on your primary video
  adapter.

- Your video driver is outdated or does not support DirectDraw.

- Your video adapter does not support DirectDraw.

- The Hardware Acceleration setting on your computer is not set to Full.

- An incorrect or duplicate monitor is installed on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Upgrade Your Video Adapter
--------------------------

To run Baseball 2000, you must have a video adapter with at least 2 megabytes
(MB) of video memory installed in your computer. If your video adapter does not
have 2 MB of video memory, install additional video memory, or upgrade to a
video adapter that has at least 2 MB of video memory.

To estimate the approximate amount of video memory installed in your computer:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks).

3. Click OK.

4. Click the Display tab.

5. Under Device, check the amount of memory listed next to Approx. Total
  Memory.

  NOTE: If a video accelerator card is installed in your computer, a Display 1
  and a Display 2 tab are available. Click either tab to check the approximate
  total memory.

If the approximate total memory is more than 2 MB, and the issue continues to
occur, contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to help determine how to
best resolve this issue.
