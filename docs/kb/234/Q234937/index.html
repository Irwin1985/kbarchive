  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Worm.Explore.Zip is a worm or Trojan horse that uses Messaging Application
Program Interface (MAPI) capable e-mail programs on Windows-based computers to
propagate itself.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The worm uses MAPI commands to propagate itself. An e-mail message is created
with the worm as an attachment using the Zipped_files.exe filename. The body of
the e-mail message may appear to come from a known e-mail correspondent and may
contain the following text:

  Hi &lt;Recipient Name&gt; !
  I received your email and I shall send you a reply ASAP.
  Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs.
  Sincerely
  &lt;Name&gt;.

The worm determines who to send mail to and what names to use based on the
contents of the user's Inbox. You should delete any mail containing an
attachment with the name "Zipped_files.exe" without opening the attachment.

If you run the attachment, you may receive the following error message:

  Cannot open file: it does not appear to be a valid archive. If this file is
  part of a ZIP format backup set, insert the last disk of the backup set and
  try again. Please press F1 for help.

Explore.Zip copies itself to the C:\%SystemRoot%\System folder with the filename
Explore.exe and then modifies the Win.ini file to run itself each time Windows
is started. The worm then uses your e-mail client to collect e-mail addresses to
propagate itself.

Additionally, Explore.Zip also searches all local and network mapped drives of
your computer and arbitrarily selects a series of files to destroy by setting
the file size to 0 bytes. This can result in data loss.

Normal methods of virus protection should be employed to protect your environment
from this virus. Virus scanning programs should be updated with the latest
signature files and any other appropriate steps to prevent the virus from
entering your environment should be employed. Specific questions regarding your
virus software's ability to detect and clean this virus should be directed to
your Anti-Virus software vendor. To remove the worm virus on the client side,
perform the following steps:

For Windows 95 or Windows 98
----------------------------

1. Using a standard text editor such as Notepad, edit the Win.ini file, and
  delete the following lines:

  Run = c:\windows\system\explore.exe
  Run = c:\windows\system\_setup.exe

2. Save the file, exit the text editor, and then restart the computer.

3. Delete the files:

  C:\Windows\System\Explore.exe
  C:\Windows\System\_setup.exe

  NOTE: It is possible that _setup.exe may not be found on all infected systems.

4. Check Task Manager for Zipped-file.exe, and use End Task on it to end it if
  listed.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For Windows NT
--------------

1. The virus may be getting loaded from the following location:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Run

  Use Regedt32.exe to delete data values under this key called Explore.exe or
  _setup.exe.

2. Run Windows NT Task Manager and select the Processes tab. End processes
  called Zipped_f.exe, _setup.exe, or Zipped_files.exe.

3. In the C:\Winnt\System32 directory, delete the Explore.exe and/or _setup.exe
  files.

4. Reboot the system.

5. As an added precaution, use End Task, and delete all Zipped*.exe and
  _setup.exe files from all hard disks on the computer. Note that in the
  Windows NT Task Manager, they may show up as processes and not applications.
