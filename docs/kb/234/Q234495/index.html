Page 84: URL for MSNBC no longer works

The URL, msnbc.microsoft.com no longer works. This affects Steps 5-11 of the

To fix this issue:
Use the folowing URL instead

  http://www.navnet.net/activex/index.htm

and update wording in steps 5, 6, and 11.


Page 89: Missing step in procedure
----------------------------------

After the current step 3, you will need to add a step to click OK. You will also
need to change the name of the alert box in steps 5 and 6 from Content Advisor
alert box to just "the alert box."
Please renumber steps 4 through 7.

The corrected steps should read as follows:

3. Click the Enable button.
  The Content Advisor dialog box is displayed.

4. Click OK.
   The Create Supervisor Password dialog box appears.

5.  Enter a password in the Password text box, press Tab, retype your
   password in the Confirm Password text box, and then click OK.
   The Create Supervisor Password dialog box closes, and an alert box 
   appears, informing you that the Content Advisor has been turned on.

6. Click OK.
  The alert box closes.

7. Click OK.
  The Internet Options dialog box closes.


Pages 93-97: Procedures and screens changed
-------------------------------------------

Page 93: The "Important" note should be removed from its position and moved to
page 94, right above step 1. Also change "the exercises in this section" to
"this exercise" in the "Important" note.

Page 94: In step 3, use "Microsoft Wallet" dialog box instead of "Payment
Options" dialog box.
In step 4, it should be "Properties dialog box," not "Main Identity Properties
dialog box."
In step 5, it should be "Name" tab, not "Personal" tab.

Page 95: Change top screen shot to reflect change to dialog box.
Delete steps 5 and 6 and delete the marginal note.

Page 96: Renumber steps 7 and 8 to 5 and 6
Change bottom screen shot to reflect change to dialog box.
Capitalize "Information" in current step 8.

Page 97: Delete current step 11
Delete current step 10 and replace with new text:
If necessary, click an Address Book entry, and click OK.
The Credit Card Billing Address dialog box displays the billing address you
selected.
Replace all occurrences of "Payment Options" with "Microsoft Wallet"
Renumber steps 9-17 to 7-14


Page 101: Procedure steps changed
---------------------------------

In the "do this" column for "Add and delete your payment information," make these
2 changes:

1. Delete the phrase "click the I Agree button if the license agreement is
displayed,"
2. Replace "Payment Options" with "Microsoft Wallet"


Pages 159-160: Tab and command names changed
--------------------------------------------

The name of the tab and command for Block Senders have changed to Blocked Senders
since the first printing of this book.

Page 159, step 1, first and second lines: Change "Block" to "Blocked"

Page 160: step 2: Change "Block" to "Blocked"


Pages 254-255: Changes in procedure steps
-----------------------------------------

The steps for downloading IE from the Internet have changed since this book was
first printed. To update, make the following corrections:

Page 254:
In step 3, change "Download Today" to just "Download"

In step 4, add "If necessary" at the beginning of the first sentence.

Change the result line of step 5 to read:
The next page appears, asking you to choose a language.

Then replace the remaining steps on page 254 with the following:

  

  6 Click a language, and then click Next. The next page appears, asking you
 to choose a download site.

  7 Click a download site, and click Next. The File Download dialog box
 appears, asking if you would like to run the program from its current
 location or if you would like to save it to your hard disk.

  8 Verify that the Save This Program To Disk option is selected, and click
 OK. The Save As dialog box appears.

  9 Navigate to the folder that you want to save the program file, and click
 the Save button. A progress bar appears as Internet Explorer 5 downloads
 to your hard disk.

  10 After the download has been completed, click Open. The Internet Explorer
  5 license agreement appears.

  11 Read the license rules, click the I Accept The Agreement option, and
  click Next. After a few seconds, the Windows Update window provides the
  option to complete a typical installation or a custom installation.

  Continued on Page 255
  Various changes need to be made to current steps 10-12; renumber steps
  10 through 12; add new step 13 (now step 14). The final steps are:

  12 Verify that the Install Now - Typical Set Of Components option is 
  selected, and then click Next. The Windows Update window might appear,
  asking if you want to choose a download site.

  13 If necessary, click a download site, and then click Next. After a few
  seconds, the Windows Update window appears and shows the progress of the
  download process, as shown in the illustration.

  14 After the process is completed, save and close all other files that are
  open on your computer, and then click Finish in the Windows Update
  window. Your computer restarts and shows a progress bar as the
  installation is completed.


Page 266: Missing procedure step
--------------------------------

There is a step left out in the procedure. It should be new step 8. The steps
should be renumbered accordingly.

The new step should read:
8 Click an option to categorize your information, and click Next. The next wizard
dialog box opens.
