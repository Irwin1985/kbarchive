The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

To change the default Microsoft Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
attributes using a specific X.400 Connector, use the Override tab of the X.400
Connector Properties page. Override options should be used only when necessary
to establish communication with a foreign system.

For example, you can configure an override MTA name or password to be used when
connecting to a foreign system if the local MTA name or password are longer than
the foreign system can accept. This does not affect message transfer over any
other connector.

You also use this property page to configure message transfer to a particular
foreign system manually. This does not affect message transfer over any other
connector.

If you do not specify an override value, the MTA uses the default values when
connecting to a foreign system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- Local MTA Name: The name to be used when the Microsoft Exchange Server name
  is too long or contains characters that the foreign system MTA cannot accept.

- Local MTA Password: The local password that the foreign X.400 MTA uses to
  connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  NOTE: The Local MTA Name and Local MTA Password can be used to override what
  is specified in the MTA General property page under the Servers container.

- RTS Values: Use RTS values to modify values for checkpoint size, recovery
  timeout, and window size. If you do not specify an override value, the MTA
  uses the default values or negotiates a configuration automatically when
  connecting to a foreign system.

   - Checkpoint Size (K): Sets the amount of data to be transferred before a
     checkpoint is inserted. If an error occurs and the message must be re
     transferred, the process restarts from the most recent checkpoint.

     If you specify zero, no checkpoint is set. The default is 30.

     Using a checkpoint slightly reduces transmission speed. You should decrease
     the checkpoint size when the connection is less reliable.

   - Recovery Timeout (sec): Determines the amount of time after an error
     occurs that the MTA waits for a reconnection before deleting checkpointed
     information and restarting the transfer from the beginning. The default is
     60.

   - Window Size: The number of checkpoints that can go unacknowledged before
     data transfer is suspended. The greater the window size, the greater the
     transfer rate. The window size determines the amount of resources set
     aside for the receiving station. Specify window size only if the
     checkpoint size is greater than zero. The default is 5.

- Connection Retry Values: Use the Override tab on the X.400 Connector
  Properties page to specify how many times the MTA should try to establish a
  connection. If you do not specify an override value, the MTA uses the default
  values or negotiates a configuration automatically when connecting to a
  foreign system.

   - Max Open Retries: The maximum number of times that the system tries to
     open a connection before it sends a non-delivery report (NDR). The default
     is 144.

   - Max Transfer Retries: The maximum number of times that the system tries to
     transfer a message across an open connection. The default is 2.

   - Open Interval (sec): The amount of time to wait before attempting to
     reopen a connection after an error. The default is 600.

   - Transfer Interval (sec): The amount of time to wait before resending a
     message across an open connection after a previous attempt failed. The
     default is 120.

- Association Parameters: Use the Override tab on the X.400 Connector
  Properties page to set or modify the association parameters between MTAs. If
  you do not specify an override value, the MTA uses the default values or
  negotiates a configuration automatically when connecting to a foreign system.

   - Lifetime (sec): The amount of time to keep an association open to a remote
     system after a message is sent. The default is 300.

   - Disconnect (sec): The amount of time to wait before terminating a
     connection because of a previously terminated association. The default is
     120.

   - Threshold (msgs): The maximum number of queued messages to a remote
     system. When this is exceeded, the MTA opens another association. The
     default is 50.

     The threshold value is used to avoid messages being submitted to the
     Exchange Server MTA queue faster than they are dispatched. When the
     threshold value is exceeded, the MTA opens another association to the
     remote system MTA.

- Transfer Timeouts: Use the Override tab on the X.400 Connector Properties
  page to set the number of times the MTA tries to transfer urgent, normal, or
  non-urgent messages. If you do not specify an override value, the MTA uses
  the default values or negotiates a configuration automatically when
  connecting to a foreign system.

   - Urgent: The amount of time (in sec/K) to wait before sending an NDR for an
     urgent message. The default is 1,000.

   - Normal: The amount of time (in sec/K) to wait before sending an NDR for a
     normal message. The default is 2,000.

   - Non-urgent: The amount of time (in sec/K) to wait before sending an NDR
     for a non-urgent message. The default is 3,000.

NOTE: These definitions are taken from the Online Help (F1) on the Override tab
and are also available by clicking Help on the Override tab.
