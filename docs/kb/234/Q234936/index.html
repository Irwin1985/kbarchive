SUMMARY
=======

A Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) provider service is used
with MAPI clients such as Outlook (in Corporate/Workgroup mode) or the Exchange
Client Inbox. MAPI provider services are broken down into three basic
categories; transport providers, address book providers, and message store
providers. These categories of provider services are used in combination to make
a MAPI profile. These clients use a MAPI profile to connect to a given
information system.

NOTE: Although you can configure more than one transport provider in a given
profile, this configuration may create unexpected results and is not supported.
However, the use of multiple address book providers or message store providers
with a single transport provider is fully supported.

If you use multiple MAPI profiles with a single installation of one of these
clients, you can gain access to a wide variety of information and messaging
systems. Typically, you gain access to MAPI profiles in Control Panel by
double-clicking either Mail or Mail and Fax, as applicable. There is also a
representation of MAPI on the desktop: the icon for either Outlook or the Inbox.
You can also gain access to your MAPI profiles by opening the properties of this
MAPI icon (Outlook or Inbox). You can configure the client to use a specific
profile by clicking Show Profiles in the MAPI properties. A use this profile
list is displayed at the bottom of the dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article lists all the currently available MAPI provider services from
Microsoft and those MAPI provider services' supported configurations. The
provider services may work if you use any configuration other than the
configuration that is described in this article; however, unsupported
configurations have proven to be problematic.

MAPI Provider Services
----------------------

Microsoft Exchange Server:

- Emsabp32.dll - Microsoft Exchange Server address book provider dynamic-link
  library (DLL)

- Emsmdb32.dll - Microsoft Exchange Server information store service provider

- Emsui32.dll - Microsoft Exchange Server configuration library

The Microsoft Exchange Server service is a unique blend because the Microsoft
Exchange Server service combines a transport provider, an address book provider,
and a message store provider into one service. MAPI clients exclusively use the
Microsoft Exchange Server service to connect to Exchange Server computers. You
do not need to use any other transport provider services in the same profile to
connect to an Exchange Server computer. You can configure delivery for the
Exchange Server information store or a local .pst file.

NOTE: This service is only supported in a profile without any other transport
provider services. Although you can configure this service with some other
transport provider services in the same profile, this configuration may provide
unexpected results and is not supported.

Microsoft Mail:

- Msfs32.dll - MAPI 1.0 service providers for Microsoft Mail

The Microsoft Mail service is a transport provider. The Microsoft Mail service is
used only to connect to Microsoft Mail or workgroup post offices.

IMPORTANT: This provider service requires that the personal folder (.pst) message
store provider service be used for the delivery location. The use of the
Exchange Server information store as this provider's delivery location is not
supported.

Internet E-Mail (Previously the Internet Enhancement Patch for Outlook):

- Inetab32.dll - MAPI 1.0 service providers for Internet mail

- Minet32.dll - Microsoft MAPI service provider for Internet mail (Simple Mail
  Transfer Protocol [SMTP] and Post Office Protocol version 3 [POP3])

The Internet Mail service is a transport provider. You can use the Internet Mail
service to connect to any POP3, Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1
(IMAP4), or SMTP provider, such as an Exchange Server computer or an Internet
service provider (ISP).

IMPORTANT: This provider service requires that the Personal Folders service
message store provider be used for the delivery location. The use of the
Exchange Server information store as this provider's delivery location is not
supported. For additional information, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q245446 XCLN: You Cannot Use the Exchange Server and Internet E-mail Services
  in the Same Profile

NOTE: If you use this service to connect to an Exchange Server computer, you
cannot use all the features that are provided with the Exchange Server service.

Microsoft LDAP Directory:

- Bjablr32.dll - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) support resources

- Emablt32.dll - LDAP support provider

The Microsoft LDAP Directory service is an address book provider. This service
may be used to connect to an LDAP server for directory lookups.

NOTE: You can use this service with any transport provider, and this service does
not require any delivery location.

Microsoft Outlook Support for Lotus cc:Mail:

- Ccmab32.dll - Lotus cc:Mail address book provider

- Ccmxp32.dll - Lotus cc:Mail transport provider

- Mapivm32.dll - Lotus cc:Mail service provider

Microsoft Outlook Support for Lotus cc:Mail combines a transport provider, an
address book provider, and a message store provider into one service. This
service is used exclusively to connect to cc:Mail post offices.

IMPORTANT: This provider service requires that the Personal Folder service
message store provider be used for the delivery location. The use of the
Exchange Server information store as this provider's delivery location is not
supported.

Outlook Address Book:

- Contab32.dll - Outlook Address Book service

The Outlook Address Book service is an address book provider. This service allows
you to use Outlook Contact folders as Exchange Server address books for
addressing purposes. After you add this service, designated Outlook Contact
folders are available in the list of the Exchange Address Book dialog box.

NOTE: You can use this service with any transport provider, and this service does
not require any delivery location.

Personal Address Book:

- Mspst32.dll - Microsoft personal folder and address book service provider

The Personal Address Book service is an address book provider. This service
enables the use of personal address book (.pab) files. After you add this
service, addresses that are contained in the .pab file are available in the list
of the Exchange Address Book dialog box.

NOTE: You can use this service with any transport provider, and this service does
not require any delivery location.

Personal Folders:

- Mspst32.dll - Microsoft personal folder and address book service provider

The Personal Folders service is a message store provider. This service enables
the use of personal folder (.pst) files and creates a delivery location for the
transport provider services that are listed earlier in this article. The .pst
file acts as a local store where you can create folders and store items. This
service is also used for the Outlook auto-archive feature.

NOTE: Any transport provider can use this service, and there can even be multiple
instances of this service in a single profile. However, you can only set
delivery to one .pst file or (if you use Exchange Server) the server's
information store. Any remaining .pst files in the current profile are
available, but delivery only occurs in the selected location.
