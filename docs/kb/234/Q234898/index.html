The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.03, 8.04, on platform(s):

SUMMARY
=======

System policies for Outlook 97 are a powerful mechanism for increasing control
and management of Outlook 97 client computers across a network. System policies
allow network administrators to provide greater consistency among client
computers and to centralize support and maintenance efforts. Defined in a policy
file, system policies can be used to enforce user and computer settings by
overriding default registry values.

NOTE: This article does not discuss how to set up and enforce system policies in
detail. For an in-depth guide to Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 system policies,
please refer to the "Implementing Profiles and Policies for Windows NT 4.0"
white paper located at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/NTServer/management/deployment/planguide/prof_policies.asp

System policies are supported by Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, and
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation only. The Macintosh and Microsoft Windows
NT 3.51 Workstation operating systems do not support system policies.

On Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, the registry settings are copied to the user's
registry hive at logon time. A user who is experienced with editing the registry
can modify the registry manually to avoid any administrator-defined policy for
the current logon session. To prevent this policy hole, the administrator can
set a policy on Registry Editor so that the user cannot run Registry Editor.
This makes the hole smaller but it is still not foolproof because there is no
way to restrict programmatic access to the registry. Windows 98 is a little more
robust in that the registry settings are reset from the server on an
administrator-defined interval (every 10 minutes, for example).

MORE INFORMATION
================

System policies are defined by a system policy template file that associates
each policy with the registry keys used by the application for the option that
the policy represents.

Outlook 97 System Policy Template
---------------------------------

The System Policy Editor settings specific to Outlook 97 are in the Outlk97.adm
file. This template can be obtained from the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit.
For Windows 95 and Windows 98 system policies, copy this template to the
Windows\Inf folder. For Windows NT, copy this template to the Winnt\Inf folder.

NOTE: Outlook 97 clients can also be controlled by using the Outlk98.adm file,
the system policy template file for Outlook 98. This template also contains
Outlook 98-specific policy settings that do not work on Outlook 97 clients. For

How to Create a New Policy File
-------------------------------

When you use System Policy Editor to create system policies, you first choose
which templates you want to use, then create a new policy file, and then you set
policies for your users. You cannot add templates after you have created the
policy file.

NOTE: When you create a system policy file for a client computer, you must run
System Policy Editor on the same operating system that the client computer is
running. For example, to create a policy file for Windows NT 4.0 clients, you
must run System Policy Editor on Windows NT 4.0. This limitation results from
the fact that Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems have different
registries from Windows NT.

To Open the Outlk97.adm Template:

1. Start System Policy Editor, and make sure that all policy files are closed.

2. On the Options menu, click Template for Windows 95 or Windows 98, or Policy
  Template for Windows NT.

3. For Windows 95 or Windows 98, click Open Template. For Windows NT, click Add.

4. Click the Outlk97.adm file, and then click Open.

5. Click Close to return to System Policy Editor.

6. On the File menu, click New Policy to create a new policy file.

To Add Users, Groups, or Computers to the Policy File:

System policies can apply to all users, to a specific user, or to a group of
users. They can also apply to a single computer or to all the computers on your
network.

The Default User icon and the Default Computer icon are included in your policy
file. To apply a system policy to all the users or all the computers on your
network, start System Policy Editor, and then double-click the Default User or
Default Computer icon.

You can also add specific users, computers, or groups to your policy file by
using the Add User, Add Computer, and Add Group commands on the Edit menu in
System Policy Editor. When you add a user, computer, or group, a new icon
appears in System Policy Editor. Use this icon to set policies for the new user,
computer, or group.

NOTE: The group names or computer names that you specify in System Policy Editor
must reference user groups or computers that already exist on the network. You
cannot create new groups or computer names from within System Policy Editor.

After you have selected the users, groups, or computers to whom your policy
applies, set the policy or policies that you want by using the corresponding
Properties dialog box in System Policy Editor. Sometimes a user is a member of
more than one group. To avoid potential conflicts between group policies, you
can set relative priorities so that group policies are applied in a particular
order. To set group priorities, on the Option menu, click Group Priority.

Setting the Policy:

In System Policy Editor, when you double-click one of the user, group, or
computer icons, the Properties dialog box appears, listing the available system
policies. You scroll through the list of categories in the Properties dialog box
to find the policy you want. You expand or collapse categories by clicking the
plus sign (+) or minus sign (-), similar to expanding or collapsing folders in
Windows Explorer. When you find the policy that you want, set the policy by
clicking the check box next to the policy name. After you select the policy that
you want, you must specify additional information under Settings to determine
what is enforced by the policy.

Saving and Distributing the Policy File:

After you set the policy values that you want, you are ready to save and
distribute the policy file. For Windows 95 or Windows 98 clients, save the
policy file as Config.pol. For Windows NT 4.0 clients, save the policy file as
Ntconfig.pol. Then, quit System Policy Editor.

Next, you need to store the policy file on the network, where it can be
downloaded to users' computers when they log on.

For networks running Microsoft Windows NT Server, copy the Config.pol file or the
Ntconfig.pol file to the Netlogon folder of the primary domain controller, as
defined for your client computers. When your users next log on, the system
policies are automatically downloaded to their computers, and their registry
settings are updated with the policy settings.

On Novell NetWare networks, copy the Config.pol file to the Public folder of the
preferred server, as defined for your client computers.

NOTE: For more information about Outlook 97 system policies, see Appendix C,
"Registry Keys and Values" of the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit.
