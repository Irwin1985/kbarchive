SUMMARY
=======

This article describes new installation instructions for installing the Windows
NT Option Pack (NTOP) on a Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) with SQL Server 6.5
(with Windows NT SP4 or SQL Server SP5a) or SQL Server 7.0 installed. This
allows for proper fail-over of the WWW and FTP services.

These instructions are a supplement to the general instructions provided in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q191138 How to Install Windows NT Option Pack on Microsoft Cluster Server

If the Microsoft Cluster Server has had Windows NT Service Pack 4 MSDTC, SQL
Server 6.5 SP5a, or SQL Server 7.0 installed at any time, then it is necessary
to use a new installation sequence to successfully install the NT Option Pack on
the cluster. After following the new installation sequence provided below, you
can use the remainder of article Q191138 to complete the Windows NT Option Pack
installation on Microsoft Cluster Server 1.0.

A slight change to the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC)
files that are upgraded by Windows NT Service Pack 4, SQL Server SP5a and SQL
Server 7.0 prevents the Windows NT Option Pack installation documented in
Q191138 from installing successfully on the second node of a Microsoft Cluster
Server system. This article describes the steps necessary to get the Windows NT
Option Pack successfully installed on both nodes of the Cluster Server with the
updated MSDTC files.

Note: This issue with the newer MSDTC components and the Windows NT Option Pack
Setup program has added some additional complexity to the installation sequence.
Please read this entire article and make sure that you understand the
instructions before beginning your Windows NT Option Pack installation on the
Cluster Server system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have not yet attempted to install the Windows NT Option Pack onto your
Microsoft Cluster Server, then you can use the following steps to determine
whether you should use the standard installation sequence from Q191138 or
whether you will need to use the new installation sequence documented below.

1. The Windows NT Option Pack setup for a cluster requires that setup is run on
  both of the nodes in the cluster. Setup must first complete on one node
  before setup on the second node begins. The first node that setup is run on,
  for the purposes of this document, will be called Node A. The second node of
  the cluster that setup is run will be called Node B.

  The designation of Node A and Node B is arbitrary as long as they are used
  consistently throughout this article and Q191138.

  On whichever node that is chosen to be Node B (the last node on which you run
  the Option Pack Setup program) check the version of the following two files:

  %windir%\system32\msdtc.exe
  %windir%\system32\msdtc.dll

2. If the version of both of these two files is 1997.11.532.0, then you can use
  the installation sequence from Q191138, as it is written.

3. If the version of either of these two files is newer than version
  1997.11.532.0, then you will need to use the new installation sequence
  documented below.

When you attempt to install the NTOP onto your Microsoft Cluster Server system
that has the newer MSDTC files installed, the following error messages occur
during the installation process on Node B:

  The command "C:\Winnt\System32\msdtc.exe" -join failed
  Error Code = 0xffffffff

  An exception occurred while installing MSDTC service.
  Error Code = 0x80004005

  Setup of "Transaction Server Core Components" failed. The specific error code
  is 0x748dd88.
  Setup will continue but the component may not function properly.

(You will receive eight of the following errors in a row.)

  CreateIISPackage or DeleteIISPackage, 0x80040154
  Class not registered.

(If you had chosen to install Index Server you will see the following error.)

  Setup could not set webhits OOP.

(At the end of the NTOP installation you will see the following error.)

  Microsoft Transaction Server Setup was not completed successfully.

These messages mean that the installation of the NTOP on Node B has failed and
IIS, MTS, and MSDTC will not run properly on Node B. To install the NTOP
properly on Node B, remove the NTOP from Node B and reinstall it. Use the
following steps to properly remove the NTOP from Node B:

1. Stop the Cluster Service on Node B.

2. On Node B, click the Add/Remove icon in Control Panel.

3. Choose Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack from the list, and then click the
  Add/Remove button.

4. When the NTOP Setup is started, choose Remove All to uninstall the Option
  Pack.

5. Go to step 6 below and restart the installation process on Node B.

To eliminate the chance of a failed installation of the NTOP on Microsoft Cluster
Server with SQL Server, install the following products in the order they are
listed for a fresh installation:

- Windows NT Server 4.0 Enterprise Edition

- Windows NT Service Pack 3

- Microsoft Cluster Server 1.0

- SQL Server 6.5 Enterprise Edition

- SQL Server Cluster Service

- Internet Explorer 4.01

- Windows NT Option Pack

(OPTIONAL)

- Uncluster the SQL Server Service

- SQL Server Service Pack 5a

- Recluster the SQL Server Service

(RECOMMENDED)

- Windows NT Service Pack 4

(If SQL Server SP5a or Windows NT SP4 is applied before the NTOP installation,
errors will occur.)
Use the following sequence for the Windows NT Option Pack and SQL Server 7.0 on
Microsoft Cluster Server 1.0:

- Windows NT 4.0 Server Enterprise Edition

- Windows NT Service Pack 3

- Microsoft Cluster Server 1.0

- Internet Explorer 4.01

- Windows NT Option Pack

- Windows NT Service Pack 4

- SQL Server 7.0 Enterprise Edition

- SQL Server Cluster Service

Perform the following steps for systems with newer MSDTC files:

Note: Windows NT must reside in the same location on both Node A and Node B. For
example, if you install Windows NT to C:\Winnt on Node A, then you need to have
Windows NT installed to C:\Winnt on Node B as well. If the Windows NT
%SystemRoot% folder is not identical on both Node A and Node B, you will not be
able to perform fail-over of IIS.

1. Move all Cluster Resource Groups to Node A.

2. Start the Windows NT Option Pack installation on Node A. On the "Microsoft
  Internet Information Server" setup screen, accept the default location for
  the WWW, FTP, and the Application Installation Point settings. During the
  installation of Transaction Server, on the "Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0"
  screen, the Windows NT Option Pack Setup program attempts to locate the MSDTC
  transaction log on a cluster disk resource in any resource groups currently
  owned by that node. The MSDTC Resource should reside in the resource group
  that SQL Server is currently located in. When you are prompted for the
  resource group to install the MSDTC log to and the location for the MSDTC log
  file, choose the SQL Server Resource Group Network Name you have created from
  the drop-down list and place the MSDTC Log directory on the Disk Resource
  that belongs to that SQL Server Resource Group. For example, if your SQL
  Server Resource Group Network Name is called "SQLGroup" and the Disk Resource
  assigned to that group is assigned drive letter S:, you would specify
  "SQLGroup" in the Virtual Server drop-down list, and S:\MSDTCLog as the path
  to the MSDTC Log directory.

  DO NOT INSTALL ANYTHING INTO THE DEFAULT CLUSTER GROUP.

3. At the end of the Windows NT Option Pack installation, a dialog box is
  displayed that instructs you to start the installation on Node B and to click
  OK when the setup is complete. Disregard this message and click OK on this
  dialog box to continue running setup.

4. When you are prompted to reboot on Node A, choose No. Do not restart Node A
  at this point.

5. Do not move the Resource Groups from Node A to Node B. Leave the resource
  groups running on Node A.

6. Switch to Node B and stop the Microsoft Cluster Service by opening a command
  prompt and typing the following:

  NET STOP CLUSSVC

7. Start the Windows NT Option Pack installation on Node B. On the "Microsoft
  Internet Information Server" setup screen, accept the default location for
  the WWW, FTP, and the Application Installation Point settings. This
  installation does not prompt for the transaction log location. When this
  installation is complete, restart Node B.

8. If Windows NT Service Pack 4 is installed on Node B, then the Cluster Server
  service will not start after the NTOP is installed and the computer is
  restarted. This is a known issue. Please see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base for details:

  Q218922 Installing NTOP on Cluster Server with SP4 Causes Event IDs 1009 and
  1058

  You must re-apply SP4 on Node B and restart the computer again before the
  Microsoft Cluster Server service will start.

9. Move the Resource Groups from Node A to Node B.

10. Restart Node A.

11. If Windows NT Service Pack 4 is installed on Node A, then the cluster
  service will not start after the NTOP is installed. This is a known issue.
  Please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
  details:

  Q218922 Installing NTOP on Cluster Server with SP4 Causes Event IDs 1009 and
  1058

  You must re-apply SP4 on Node A and restart the computer again before the
  Microsoft Cluster Server service will start.

The following 7 steps are used to ensure that MSDTC is configured properly for
use on a clustered system.

12. Move the resource groups from Node B to Node A. Leave the resource groups
  running on Node A.

13. From a command prompt on Node A, type the following:

  msdtc -remove

14. From a command prompt on Node B, type the following:

  msdtc -remove

15. If there is an MSDTC resource in any of the Cluster Server Resource Groups,
  please delete this resource from the group that it is in. It can be in only
  one resource group if it is installed. If there is no MSDTC resource in any
  resource groups, this is OK.

16. From a command prompt on Node A, type the following:

  msdtc -install -d %windir%\system32 -l &lt;location of DTC log file on SQL
  shared disk&gt; -v &lt;SQL Group Virtual Server Name&gt;

Note: Make sure that the directory you specify for the DTC log file exists on the
shared disk. For example, if you entered S:\MSDTCLog for the -l variable, check
to be sure an MSDTCLog directory exists on the root of the S drive. If it does
not exist, create the directory before running the above command(for example,
for SQLGroup, you would type "msdtc - install -d %windir%\system32 -l
S:\MSDTCLog -v SQLGroup" (without the quotation marks))

17. From a command prompt on Node B, type the following:

  msdtc -join %windir%\system32

At this point, MSDTC will be properly installed on the Cluster and an MSDTC
Resource will now exist in the SQL Server Resource Group in Cluster
Administrator. For fail-over of the SQL Server group to function properly, make
sure to do step 18. Failure to perform step 18 will cause SQL Server Group
fail-over to take up to five minutes to move from one node to the other.

18. In the Cluster Administrator, highlight the MSDTC Resource in the SQL Server
  Resource Group you specified, right-click on it and choose Properties. Click
  the Dependencies tab and click the Modify button. In the left-hand frame of
  the Modify Dependencies Window, highlight the SQL Server Virtual Server
  Network Name resource and double-click on it. This should move the Virtual
  Server Name from the left frame to the right frame and list it as a
  "dependency." Click OK, click Apply, and then click OK.

19. At this point, the Web or FTP fail-over sites need to be created. Internet
  Information Server (IIS) virtual servers in this configuration require a
  resource group with an IP address at minimum; however, it is recommended
  that you also have a disk resource to store the Web pages on as well.

  DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT CLUSTER GROUP.

20. Move the Resource Group that you intend on creating the IIS Instance in to
  Node A, if it is not already running on Node A. If you have not created a
  Resource Group for your World Wide Web sites, create one now and give it a
  disk resource and IP address resource that your WWW site will use (for
  example, if your Resource Group for your Web Sites is called WWWGroup, move
  the WWWGroup to Node A).

21. In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) on Node A, expand the Internet
  Information Server tree, right-click on the computer name, and create a new
  Web (or FTP) site.

22. In the properties for this new site, set the IP address of the site to be
  the same as the IP address resource for the resource group that this Web
  site will reside in (for example, if you have an "IP Address" Resource in
  your WWWGroup, and it is configured as 10.5.5.1, configure the new Web site
  to use this address in the MMC).

23. Select the directory, Universal Naming Convention (UNC) connection, or
  redirection that the site should use as the home directory. If you are
  selecting a drive, it should be a disk resource that is in the same Resource
  Group that the IP address is in.

24. Repeat Steps 21 through 23 for each WWW of FTP site that you want to provide
  fail-over capabilities to.

At this point in the installation process, you can refer back to Q191138 and
proceed through the rest of that article without problems, beginning at
"Synchronize the IIS User Accounts."
