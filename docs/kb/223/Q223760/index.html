-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zone.com 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to the Zone, you may receive the following error message:

  Please wait for page to download completely before performing this task.

You may also be prompted to go to another page to download the Zone software.
When you view the page, the picture of the Spade is not displayed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

- You are not allowing enough time for the Heartbeat ActiveX object to be
  downloaded or initialized on your computer.

- Your browser security settings are set too high.

- Files in your Temporary Internet Files folder point to outdated Zone pages.

- The Heartbeat ActiveX object on your computer is damaged.

- Your Downloaded Program Files folder is marked as read-only.

- You are using a browser that is not compatible with the Zone.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use a browser that is compatible with the Zone. To see
the System Requirements of the Zone visit the following Zone web page:

  http://zone.msn.com/zzzz/help/zonehelpsystem.asp

If the issue still continues use the following methods in the order in which they
are presented. If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Wait for Your Web Browser to Finish Downloading the Page
--------------------------------------------------------

The Zone occasionally requires your browser to finish downloading or initializing
certain components, such as the Heartbeat ActiveX object, before you can proceed
to other pages on the Zone.

You may need to refresh the current page, and then wait for your Web browser to
finish downloading the page before you click on a link.

NOTE: When you download an ActiveX control, the process takes place in the
background. Depending on your browser security settings, you may not be notified
that the download process is taking place.

When your browser is finished downloading the page, a status of "Done" is
displayed on the Microsoft Internet Explorer status bar.
