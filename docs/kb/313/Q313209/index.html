The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove a site from your SMS hierarchy, you may have invalid
assignments in your Copylog.tcf file if you are using Logon Installation or
Logon Discovery. These invalid entries may cause client computers to look to a
site that has been removed when they try to install or upgrade files.

CAUSE
=====

When a site is removed from the hierarchy, SMS removes the references to this
site from the site server and the database. At this time, SMS does not remove
the references to this site from the Copylog.tcf file on the logon points.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can edit the Copylog.tcf file and remove the references to the invalid
sites. See the "More Information" section of this article for details about how
to edit this file correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Making modifications to the Copylog.tcf file requires an understanding of how
the copylog file works and the types of associations that are made in the
copylog. The [FILE SOURCE] section of the Copylog.tcf file contains file-to-site
associations of individual files by using the sitecode to specify the site. This
association specifies which site was the last site to modify this file on the
Logon Point. This provides for the identification of which site can be
referenced to find the most up to date version of each client file. When the
original source file is required, a lookup occurs in the Copylog.tcf file to
identify the site that has this file, and the file can then be obtained from
that site.

When a site is removed from an SMS hierarchy, the Copylog.tcf file may still
contain references to the site that has been removed. These references can be
for shared files or for files that are specific to the site that has been
removed. You can use the following processes to identify and resolve each type
of reference.

- Site specific references refer to files that are maintained in the \SITES
  folder on the Logon Point. These references contain a file name that begins
  with SITES and which has the following format:

  SITES\&lt;XXX&gt;\&lt;ZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ&gt;=&lt;XXX&gt;

  &lt;XXX&gt; is the site code, and &lt;ZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ&gt; is the file name. These
  lines are specific to the site that has been removed and are no longer needed
  after the site is removed. You can delete the lines that refer to files in
  the \SITES\sitecode folder of the removed site and the files they refer to in
  the folder structure.

- Shared references refer to files that are shared by all sites that use the
  logon point. All files that are not in the sites folder on the Logon Point
  are shared and must be modified and not deleted. These files must be
  maintained and the references to these files must be maintained in the
  Copylog.tcf file. To modify these files, identify a site that contains the
  most recent version of this file. If your hierarchy contains sites that are
  running different service packs of hotfixes, you must identify the source of
  the latest version of each file. When you have identified the site that has
  the latest version, you can edit the Copylog.tcf file so that the reference
  for that file specifies the sitecode of the site you identified and not that
  of the site that has been removed.

Example
-------

If you have 3 sites, your Copylog.tcf file should contain lines that are similar
to the following lines:

  [FILE SOURCE]
  X86.bin\smsboot1.exe=REM
  X86.bin\CLICORE.EXE=AAA
  X86.bin\00000409\SMSMAN.EXE=REM
  SITES\AAA\caplist.ini=AAA
  SITES\AAA\NETCONF.TCF=AAA
  SITES\BBB\caplist.ini=BBB
  SITES\BBB\NETCONF.TCF=BBB
  SITES\REM\caplist.ini=REM
  SITES\REM\NETCONF.TCF=REM

NOTE: This file is not a complete Copylog.tcf file, and lines have been left out
to make it more readable.

If you were to remove the site with the REM sitecode, you would be left with two
sites with sitecodes AAA and BBB. You would need to remove the two references to
files in the SITES folder for the site REM and re-associate Smsboot1.exe and
Smsman.exe to other sites. Suppose that you knew that site AAA was your central
site and that it contained the latest versions of all client files. However, you
have just updated site BBB with a hotfix for Smsman.exe that is newer then the
one on site AAA, but you have not yet installed this hotfix on any other sites.
You would want to modify the Copylog.tcf as follows:

  [FILE SOURCE]
  X86.bin\smsboot1.exe=AAA
  X86.bin\CLICORE.EXE=AAA
  X86.bin\00000409\SMSMAN.EXE=BBB
  SITES\AAA\caplist.ini=AAA
  SITES\AAA\NETCONF.TCF=AAA
  SITES\BBB\caplist.ini=BBB
  SITES\BBB\NETCONF.TCF=BBB

NOTE: This file is not a complete Copylog.tcf file, and lines have been left out
to make it more readable.

Note that Smsboot1.exe was pointed at site AAA and Smsman.exe was pointed at site
BBB because site BBB has the newest (hotfix) version of Smsman.exe.
