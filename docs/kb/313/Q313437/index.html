- SUMMARY

   - Enable and Configure IIS Logging

SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to enable Internet Information Server
(IIS) version 5.0 logging. You can use IIS 5.0 to carry out extensive logging of
connections that are made to the server. Logging is a vital part of your IIS 5.0
security plan. You can use the log files to determine if a security event has
taken place and the files can provide information about the source of the
attack.

IIS 5.0 can save log files in a variety of file types. The preferred log type in
a secure environment is the W3C Extended Log File Format. This log format allows
you to configure a large number of extended attributes that are useful in
security analysis.

The following information should be collected in your W3C Extended Log File
Format logs:

- Client IP Address

  This is the IP address of the client that accessed the server. Note that if a
  Web proxy computer is in "front" of the IIS 5.0 computer, the IP address of
  the proxy may show up in the Client IP Address box.

- User Name

  The name of the user that accessed the server. If anonymous authentication is
  configured, a hyphen (-) is logged instead of the user name.

- Method

  The action that the client tried to perform. For example, the GET or POST
  commands.

- URI Stem

  The resource on the IIS 5.0 computer that the user attempted to access. This
  might be an HMTL page, a graphic, a GCI program or script.

- Protocol (HTTP) Status

  This is the status of the action in HTTP terms, as represented by a code
  number.

- Win32 Status

  The status of the action in Win32 code terms. Error numbers are reported, such
  as error 5, which means that access was denied. You can evaluate error
  messages by typing "net helpmsg err" (without the quotation marks) at the
  command prompt, and then pressing ENTER.

- User Agent

  The name of the browser that is accessing the server.

- Server IP Address

  This is the IP address of the virtual server that is receiving the request.
  This is helpful if you host multiple virtual servers on the same computer
  that uses different IP addresses.

- Server Port

  This is the port number of the virtual server that is receiving the request.
  This is helpful if you host multiple virtual servers on the same computer
  that uses different IP addresses.

Enable and Configure IIS Logging
--------------------------------

To configure IIS logging:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  Internet Services Manager.

2. Right-click the virtual server on which you want to enable logging, and then
  click Properties.

3. Click the Web Site tab, and then click to select the Enable Logging check
  box.

4. In the "Active log format" box, click W3C Extended Log File Format.

5. Click Properties. On the General Properties tab, click Daily to cause the
  creation of a new log file each day.

6. Click "Use local time for file naming and rollover" if you want to use local
  time rather than GMT to determine when a new file is created and named.

7. Click the Extended Properties tab, and then select the options that are noted
  in the first part of this article. Click Apply, and then click OK.

8. Click Apply, and then click OK in the "Web site Properties" dialog box.

After you make the preceding changes, restart the virtual server.

NOTE: For more information about the extended log file format, see the W3C
Working Draft WD-logfile-960323 specification at the following Web site:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile)
