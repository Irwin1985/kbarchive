The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a mainframe host application returns a recordset that contains multiple
records to a COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) component that is connected
through TCP/IP to an IBM Information Management System (IMS) region on a
mainframe that uses IBM Open Transaction Management Architecture (OTMA) or IBM
IMS Connect, the following COMTI 102 event may be logged in the Application
Event Log:

  Description: (102) COM Transaction Integrator reported the following
  exception to the client:
  Component: (Prog ID of Component)
  Method: (Method Name)

  Exception description:
  (2135) The TCP transport detected that the socket was closed but has not
  received the Complete-Status Message segment. Therefore, the outcome of the
  IMS transaction is in an unknown state. IP Address: (IP of Host), port: (port
  number), transid: (Trans ID).

CAUSE
=====

The host application sends all rows of the unbounded record set within a single
IMS Insert command (ISRT), and this causes COMTI to return the error message. If
the host application sends an individual ISRT command for each row of the
unbounded recordset, no problem occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+--------------------------------------------+
| File name   | Date        | Time           | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Trantcp.dll | 19-JUN-2001 | 12:00 midnight | 
+--------------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, revise the program on the host so that it uses
individual ISRT statements to send each row of the unbounded recordset.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Network Monitor (NetMon) trace of the failed transaction shows the Extended
Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) data that was returned from the
host application. The last 8 bytes of data are "*CSMOKY*". In EBCDIC characters,
these are as follows:

  5C C3 E2 D4 D6 D2 E8 5C

This data is the "Complete-Status Message segment" that the error message reports
as missing.
