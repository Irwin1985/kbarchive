The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Outlook 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft strongly recommends that you avoid installing Outlook 2000 or later
and Exchange Server 5.5 on the same computer. Unless third party programs are
designed and tested to run in this configuration, those programs may not work
properly and may impair an Exchange Server. These types of Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) programs that may be affected are custom MAPI store
providers, custom gateway and transport providers, and extended MAPI clients.
These behaviors occur because these two products ship versions that produce a
conflict of the MAPI subsystem that may not be cleanly reconciled without
breaking either Exchange Server 5.5 or Outlook.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may want to install Outlook and Exchange Server on the same computer to take
advantage of certain Outlook components in server-side programs. For most
program development needs, it is not necessary to install Outlook on an Exchange
Server. Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange Server 5.5 include Collaboration Data
Objects (CDO), which can provide similar functionality as the Outlook Object
Model. However, CDO is designed for server-side use and you may not experience
the behaviors that can occur by using later versions of Outlook. For additional
information about the types of behaviors a customer may experience, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

You may also want install Outlook and Exchange Server on the same computer to
create MAPI profiles, however, it is not necessary to do so to create MAPI
profiles. For additional information about how to create MAPI profiles without
installing Outlook, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q306962 HOWTO: Create MAPI Profiles Without Installing Outlook

You may want to install Outlook and Exchange Server on the same computer for
demonstration purposes. The following configurations have been tested for
demonstration purposes:

- Exchange Server 5.5 used with Outlook 97

- Exchange Server 5.5 used with Outlook 98

- Exchange Server 5.5 used with Outlook 2000

NOTE: Exchange Server 5.5 used with Outlook 2002 has not been tested.

Symptoms and Explanations:

Exchange Server installs MAPI subsystems in the Winnt\System32 folder. If the
user starts Exchange Server by using Outlook 2000 and later, the MAPI subsystem
moves to the Program Files\Common Files\System\Mapi\1033\NT folder. Typically,
Outlook installs a "stub" version of MAPI in the Winnt\System32 folder, which
routes MAPI calls the Outlook implementation. If Exchange Server is running
Outlook is installed, the Mapi32.dll file is still loaded, and the file is not
replaced by the stub DLL. This behavior is by design so that the Exchange Server
computer is not impaired.

This configuration can break the installation of custom MAPI providers. Each
version of MAPI expects to find the Mapisvc.inf file in a different location.
For example, the IMsgServiceAdmin::CreateMsgService method may stop responding
with MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND if the expected Mapisvc.inf is not updated with the
provider information. To workaround this behavior update both copies of the
Mapisvc.inf file so that both versions of MAPI can distinguish the changes.

Because the MAPI32 stub library is not in place, setting the stub library
registry keys has no effect on the computer. All of the programs except Outlook
can use the Exchange MAPI implementation. Outlook can load the Msmapi32.dll file
from the Program files\Common files\System\Mapi\1033\NT folder.

It is possible to install Exchange Server so that the Exchange MAPI providers are
not installed. If this procedure is completed, Outlook is able to use the MAPI
that it installs in the Program Files\Common Files\System\Mapi\1033\NT folder.
However, other MAPI programs may not read files in Mapisvc.inf, and may not be
able to load them even if Mapisvc.inf is updated to list them. Reinstalling the
Exchange Administrator on the computer corrects this behavior.


If you quit Exchange Server services before you install Outlook, or if you quit
Exchange Server and run the Fixmapi.exe file to overwrite the \Winnt\System32
files with the stub library, this procecudure may force Exchange Server to use
the Outlook version of MAPI. However, Exchange Server does not support this
configuration, and this procedure should not be done in a production
environment. The recommended solution is to install these programs on separate
computers.
