SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to set up Web server farms that contain
multiple Internet Information Services (IIS) Web servers with the same
certificate. When you do so, communications between the Web client computers and
servers are secured by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

How to Obtain and Install a Web Server Certificate for the First Web Server
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform load balancing of a Web server farm with a single certificate:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  Internet Services Manager.

2. Click to expand your server name, right-click the Web site, and then click
  Properties.

3. Click the Directory Security tab.

4. Click Server Certificate.

5. After the Web Server Certificate Wizard starts, click Next.

6. On the Server Certificate page, click the method that you want to use to
  assign the site a new certificate, for example, click "Create a new
  certificate".

7. On the "Delayed or Immediate Request" page, click one of the following
  options, and then click Next.

   - If you have an online certificate server in your organization, click "Send
     the request immediately to the online certification authority".

     -or-

   - If you need to send the request to a third-party provider or to a
     certification authority (CA) that is off the network, click "Prepare the
     request now, but send it later". (The procedure described in this article
     assumes that you click this option.)

8. On the "Name and Security Settings" page, type a name for the new certificate
  in the Name box, click 1024 in the Bit length box, and then click Next.

9. On the Organization Information page, type the name of your organization in
  the Organization box, type the name of your organizational unit in the
  Organizational Unit box, and then click Next.

10. On the "Your Site's Common Name" page, type the fully qualified domain name
  (FQDN) that users use to access the site in the Common name box, and then
  click Next.

  NOTE: If you use the server on the intranet only, you can use the NetBIOS
  name of the server.

11. On the Geographic Information page, click your country in the Country/Region
  box, type the full name of your state or your province in the State/province
  box, type the full name of your city or your locality in the City/locality
  box, and then click Next.

12. On the "Certificate Request File Name" page, type the complete path to the
  certificate request file (a default value is entered for you), and then
  click Next.

13. On the Request File Summary page, review the settings, and then click Next.

14. On the "Completing the Web Server Certificate Wizard" page, click Finish.

15. Retrieve the certificate request, and then either e-mail the request or use
  a floppy disk to deliver the request to your CA provider. The provider
  returns the signed certificate to you.

16. Install the certificate on the Web server.

How to Install a Signed Certificate
-----------------------------------

1. Obtain and install a Web server certificate for the first Web server.

10. Click OK.

11. Stop and restart the Web site.

How to Export a Private Key
---------------------------
