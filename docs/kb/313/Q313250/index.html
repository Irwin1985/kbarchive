SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the best troubleshooting steps to use when you have
problems printing but you are not receiving error messages.

Printing problems may include (but are not limited to):

- Garbled or jumbled output from the printer.

- When you click Print, nothing happens (no print job is sent to the printer).

- The printer only prints part of the document or image.

- The program or computer stops responding (hangs) when you click Print.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To resolve printing problems in the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, use the following methods in the order given.

Verify the Printer Settings and Hardware
----------------------------------------

To verify printer settings and hardware, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the printer cable and power cord are plugged in to the computer and
  power outlets.

2. Make sure the printer is turned on.

3. Verify that the correct printer is installed. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

  b. Verify that the printer listed is the printer that is attached to your
     computer.

     If it is not, right-click the printer listed, and then click Delete.
     Install the correct printer.

For additional information about installing a printer, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

4. Verify that the printer is not set to work offline. To do this, follow these
  steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

  b. Click to highlight the printer that you are using.

  c. On the File menu, click to clear check mark next to Work Offline.

  d. Close the Printer dialog box.

5. Verify that the printer settings are correct. Click Restore on each tab in
  the printers properties if you are not sure of the correct settings. Consult
  your printer's documentation or contact your printer manufacturer to receive
  additional information about how to configure your printer options.

  To open the &lt;Printer&gt; Properties dialog box, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

  b. Click to highlight the printer that you are using.

  c. On the File menu, click Properties.

  d. Close the Printer dialog box after you verify the settings on each tab.

Check Hard Disk Space
---------------------

Do you have enough disk space for spooling? Depending on the size of the file
that you are printing, it is best to have at least 50 to 100 megabytes (MB) of
free space on the hard drive where Microsoft Windows is installed.

To check disk space, follow these steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Right-click the drive where Windows is installed, and then click Properties.

  The free space information is displayed.

Empty the Temporary Files Folder
--------------------------------

Windows uses the Windows\Temp folder to temporarily store files while they are
being printed. If this folder is too full to store the printer and file
information, problems can result.

To empty the Temp folder, use the Disk Cleanup utility. To use Disk Cleanup,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs (in Microsoft Windows XP, point to All
  Programs), point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Disk
  Cleanup.

2. Select the drive Windows is installed (usually C), and then click OK.

3. On the Disk Cleanup tab, click to add a check mark in front of Temporary
  Files.

4. Click OK, and then click Yes.

NOTE: Disk Cleanup displays a status bar during the process, and then quits when
it is finished.

Test the Printing Process
-------------------------

To test the printing process, follow these steps:

1. In the document that you want to print, click Print on the File menu.

2. Under Printer, click the "Print to file" check box, and then click OK.

This will determine whether the spool process is working. If no file is printed,
proceed to the next step.

Update Printer Drivers
----------------------

Update the drivers for your printer.

For information about how to contact your printer manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

If no updated drivers are available from your printer, proceed to the next step.

Use a Different Printer Driver
------------------------------

Some printers can use drivers from different models of the same manufacturer. For
example, Hewlett Packard (HP) PhotoSmart 1000 work with the HP DeskJet 870cSE
driver, although this may reduce some of the functions of the printer. Check
with your printer manufacturer for the best substitute printer driver to use.

If none of the steps above resolved your issue, the following workarounds may
help.

Change the Data Format to Raw:

To change the data format to raw, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

Print Directly to the Printer:

To print directly to the printer, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click your printer icon, and then click Properties.

3. On the Details tab, click Spool Settings, and then click "Print directly to
  printer".

4. Click OK, and then click OK again.

5. Restart the computer.

Reduce Display Settings:

To reduce your display settings, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab, and then write down the settings for Colors and
  "Screen area".

4. In the Colors or Color Palette box, click "High Color (16 bit)".

5. Move the "Screen area" or Desktop area slider to "800 by 600 pixels".

6. Click OK.

7. If you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

NOTE: You can change the display settings to 640 by 480 pixels at a color palette
of 256 colors. Some of the products may not work with these low settings. Check
the system requirements listed on the product box.

Configure the Print Mode:

Some printers can be configured to use a low quality default print mode that does
not print graphics or photographs well. To configure the print mode of your
printer, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click your printer icon, and then click Properties.

3. In the Print Mode (or Print Quality) box, click Photo, Graphic, or Best.

4. On the General tab, click Printing Preferences, and then make the
  configuration changes that you want.
