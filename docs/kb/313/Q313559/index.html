SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to install the Microsoft Web Application
Stress (WAS) tool and how to use WAS to create and run scripts to test your Web
programs.

The WAS tool is a simulation tool that you can use to place your Microsoft
Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 Web server under a simulated load. The
tool is designed to reproduce realistically an environment in which multiple
browsers request pages from a Web site. Use WAS to gather performance data about
your Web programs and to evaluate the performance and stability of your Web
server. WAS uses scripts to simulate a large number of requests by using a
relatively small number of clients; therefore, it creates a scenario that is as
close to a production environment as possible. You can analyze the data that you
collect to understand how your Web program responds under stress and to identify
and eliminate any issues in your program before you deploy it.

How to Install the Web Application Stress Tool
----------------------------------------------

NOTE: You must perform the following procedures on client computers. WAS is
supported on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP 4) and later and
Microsoft Windows 2000. Do not install WAS on the Web server that you are
testing. If you do so, the WAS installation may affect the performance of the
Web server and may interfere with your test results.

1. Log on to your computer as an administrator or as a member of the
  Administrators group.

2. Download WAS. To do so, start your browser and go to the following Microsoft
  Web site:

  Web Application Stress Tool (http://webtool.rte.microsoft.com)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

3. In the left pane of the Web page, click Download.

4. Click "Download Web Application Stress tool, x86 version", click "Save this
  program to disk", and then click OK.

5. Specify a location where you want to save the Setup.exe file, and then click
  Save.

6. Copy the Setup.exe file to each of the client computers from which you want
  to perform the test.

7. On each client computer, start Microsoft Windows Explorer, and then
  double-click the Setup.exe file that you saved in step 5.

8. Click Yes to accept the license agreement, either accept the default
  installation location or specify where you want to install WAS, and then
  click Next.

9. Click OK, and then click Finish.

How to Create Test Scripts
--------------------------

To create scripts to test your Web program, use one of the following methods.

  This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

   - The client computer is not a Windows NT 4.0-based or a Windows 2000-based
     computer. To resolve this behavior, install WAS on a Windows NT-based or a
     Windows 2000-based computer.

     -or-

   - WAS is not installed on the client computer. To resolve this behavior,
     install WAS on the client computers to which you want to connect.

     -or-

   - The WebTool service is not running on the client computer in which WAS is
     installed. To resolve this behavior, start the WebTool service on the
     client computers to which you want to connect.

     -or-

   - You are not a member of the local Administrators group on the client
     computers to which you want to connect. To resolve this behavior, log on
     by using a user account that is a member of the local Administrators group
     on each client computer to which you want to connect.
