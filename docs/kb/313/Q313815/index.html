-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) to access your mailbox, you may
notice the following errors:

- You may receive the following error message when you try to delete e-mail
  messages:

  "Unable to delete item."

- You may receive either of the following error messages when you click the
  Calendar folder:

  "Unable to set default formats and patterns."

  -or-

  "Unable to Render This view 424Object Required."

- You proceed to the Inbox when you click the Contacts folder.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the public folder server is not accessible.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, users must have access to public folders. To do so:

1. Make sure that you can use the ping command to search for the public folder
  server from the OWA server by the public folder server's Internet protocol
  (IP), network basic input and output system (NetBIOS) and fully qualified
  domain name (FQDN). You can add entries in the Lmhosts and Hosts files if it
  is necessary.

2. If NTLM is the authentication method on the OWA server, the public folder
  server specified on the General tab of the properties of the private
  information store must be the Exchange Server computer itself.

  NOTE:To implement NTLM authentication for OWA, it is essential to have
  Internet Information Service and Exchange Server 5.5 on the same computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The public folder server is determined by the Public Folder box on the General
property page for the Private Information Store container in the Exchange Server
5.5 Admininstrator program. This is the server on which all of the top-level
public folders that are created by users who have home mailboxes on this server
are stored. The public folder server is also the server on which the users on
this private information store view the public folder hierarchy.
