  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Services for UNIX may not work or may not be installed correctly if you install
some third-party port mapper services on the same server as Services for UNIX.
The conflict may cause a complete loss of functionality in Services for UNIX, or
may cause some of the programs that are installed by Services for UNIX not to
work correctly.

Some of the symptoms of such a conflict include:

- Some or all of the services that are installed by Service for UNIX do not
  start.

- UNIX NIS clients that use Server for NIS as the NIS master cannot contact the
  NIS master, or cannot run commands to view or change the maps on the NIS
  master.

- If you mount a Server for NFS export, none of the files or folders in the
  export are shown. If you try to modify a file, you receive a "Stale NFS file
  handle" error message.

- While you are installing Services for UNIX, you receive error messages that
  state that some services cannot start.

- All files written by the Gateway for NFS service have anonymous file
  permissions on the UNIX side even when User Name Mapping is properly
  configured.

CAUSE
=====

The conflict occurs because the Services for UNIX port mapper and the
third-party port mapper both try to register with the same port. The Services
for UNIX port mapper must be able to register on UDP and TCP port 111. Some
third-party port mappers also register on UDP and TCP port 111. The third-party
port mapper registers with UDP and TCP port 111. This causes the Services for
UNIX port mapper not to start because it cannot register with port 111. If the
Services for UNIX port mapper cannot start, some or all of the services that are
installed by Services for UNIX may not work because the services depend on the
port mapper.

It does not matter whether you install Services for UNIX or the third-party port
mapper first. The third-party port mapper takes over after you restart the
computer.

The following third-party port mappers are known to cause this conflict:

- The NobleNet port mapper service
- The Legato NetWorker port mapper

The NobleNet port mapper service is installed as part of the Dell OpenManager
Server agent. The NobleNet port mapper service might also be installed by other
programs. The NobleNet port mapper program file is named Portserv.exe. This
program runs when the NobleNet port mapper service starts.

The Legato NetWorker port mapper is installed as part of Legato NetWorker. The
Legato NetWorker port mapper program file is named Nsrexecd.exe. This program
runs when the NetWorker Remote Exec service starts.

The Legato NetWorker port mapper binds a socket to port 7938 first. It then tries
to bind to port 111. If the bind operation does not succeed, it ignores the
error, assumes that another program is already bound to port 111, and continues
without serving port 111.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the program that installs the third-party port
mapper. After you remove the program, restart your computer.

Workaround Methods for Legato NetWorker
---------------------------------------

Note that these resolution methods do not work for NobleNet.

You can use either of the following workarounds to use both Legato NetWorker and
Services for UNIX on the same server.

Method 1
--------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This method takes advantage of the NetWorker behavior of binding to port 7938
first and then binding to port 111. You can configure Services for UNIX to load
before NetWorker. This permits the Services for UNIX port mapper to be able to
bind to port 111. You do this by making the NetWorker Remote Exec service
(Nsrexecd) dependent on the Services for UNIX port mapper. To do this:

1. Start Registry Editor. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the
  quotation marks), and then click OK.

2. Locate and then click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\nsrexecd

3. Add a REG_MULTI_SZ value that is named DependOnService, and then add portmap
  to the list.

4. Click OK to close the dialog box, and then quit Registry Editor.

The next time that you restart the server, Services for UNIX starts before the
NetWorker Remote Exec service. The Services for UNIX port mapper can then bind
to port 111.

Method 2
--------

In this method, you prevent NetWorker from trying to bind to port 111. Edit the
Nsrla.res file in the Program Files\Nsr\Res folder. Find the following entry:

  emulate portmapper: Yes;

Change the entry to:

  emulate portmapper: No;

Note that neither of these methods reduces the functionality of NetWorker. For
lookups, NetWorker tries port 7938 first, and then fails over to 111.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, disable the service that loads the third-party port
mapper, and then restart the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if a third-party port mapper is causing the Services for UNIX port
mapper not to start, check the System event log for an error message with a
source of Portmapper, an event ID of 3001, and this description:

  The Portmap service did not start as it could not register on port UDP 111.
  Please ensure that no other program has registered on UDP port 111.

You might also see an error message that refers to TCP port 111. This event log
error message is typically followed by a number of Service Control Manager error
messages that indicate that many of the Services for UNIX services did not
start.

To verify whether the conflict is causing a particular Services for UNIX program
not to work, run the "rpcinfo -p" command. Determine whether that particular
program is registered with both a TCP and a UDP port. If "portmapper" is not
listed as registered with TCP and UDP port 111, it is likely that a third-party
port mapper is installed. Note that there are some cases in which "portmapper"
will be listed in the Rpcinfo output as being registered with TCP and UDP port
111, but a third-party port mapper may still have taken those ports. You can
tell that this is the case if none of the Services for UNIX programs are shown
in the Rpcinfo output.

Sample Rpcinfo Output
---------------------

This is an example of the Rpcinfo output for a complete Services for UNIX
installation. The ports for some of the programs may vary:

  

  Program     Version  Protocol  Port

  100000      2        udp        111  portmapper
  100000      2        tcp        111  portmapper

  351455      2        tcp        862  mapsvc
  351455      2        udp        867  mapsvc
  100004      2        udp        924  ypserv
  100009      1        udp        929  yppasswdd

  100005      2        tcp       1048  mountd
  100005      3        tcp       1048  mountd

  100021      3        udp       1047  nlockmgr
  100021      4        udp       1047  nlockmgr
  100021      1        tcp       1047  nlockmgr
  100021      2        tcp       1047  nlockmgr
  100021      3        tcp       1047  nlockmgr
  100021      4        tcp       1047  nlockmgr
  100024      1        udp       1039  status
  100024      1        tcp       1039  status
  100003      2        udp       2049  nfs
  100003      3        udp       2049  nfs
  100003      2        tcp       2049  nfs
  100003      3        tcp       2049  nfs

This is an example of the Rpcinfo output if the NobleNet port mapper is installed
on a computer with Services for UNIX:

  

  Program  Version  Protocol  Port
  --------------------------------------------
  100000   2        tcp        111  portmapper
  100000   2        udp        111  portmapper
  300503   1        tcp       1086

This is an example of the Rpcinfo output if the Legato NetWorker port mapper is
installed on a computer with Services for UNIX:

  

  program  Version  Protocol  Port
  --------------------------------------------
  100000   2        tcp       7938  portmapper
  100000   2        udp       7938  portmapper
  390113   1        tcp       7937
  390103   2        tcp       9404
  390109   2        tcp       9404
  390110   1        tcp       9404
  390103   2        udp       9405
  390109   2        udp       9405
  390110   1        udp       9405
  390107   5        tcp       9411
  390107   6        tcp       9411
  390105   5        tcp       9417
