Friendly Name Does Not Change When Updated:

Q86085

Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows stores each user's postoffice alias and
full name in the local and server calendar files. When the user's full name
is modified on the postoffice with the Mail Administrator program, the full
name is not updated in the Schedule+ calendar files.

Margins Off When Printing on HP LaserJet III:

Q86182

Margins can be slightly off when you print from Microsoft Schedule+ for
Windows to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet III printer. The margins can be
as much as 1/8th inch off, depending on the layout and views being printed.

Header Information Is Displayed in Message Body:

Q86378

If a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks user is not using the Windows client,
then the first meeting notice that user receives from Microsoft Schedule+
for Windows will include the header information in the body of the message.
The second and subsequent messages will not have this information in the
body. No information is lost.

Auto-Pick Picks 1-Hour Slot for Appointment:

Q86379

The Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows Auto-Pick command selects 1-hour
appointments if the initial time ends with or continues through midnight.

Moving Appointments Off Line Gives Error Message:

Q86382

In Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, when you move or change a meeting while
you run Schedule+ off line, the following error message will be displayed:

  The attendees could not be notified. You may wish to undo this action and
  make the change when you work on-line.

When you choose Undo from the Edit menu (which is the correct action to
take), the same message is displayed again. You should ignore the second
error message.

Importing Long Appointments Hides Buttons:

Q86383

Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows displays the following error message while
importing appointments if there is a conflicting appointment:

  This appointment will conflict with an existing appointment in your schedule.
  Do you want to add it anyway?

If the imported appointment has more text than can be displayed on one
line, the window size of the alert will be too large for the screen. If
this happens, the Yes and No buttons in the dialog box may be off the
screen.

Importing Calendar File Overwrites Notes:

Q86384

Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows can import Windows Calendar files; however,
if the imported files contain notes, the imported notes will replace any
existing notes.

Cannot Switch to Task List:

Q86603

If a Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows Task list has more than 255 late,
uncompleted tasks and you try to open the Task list or edit a recurring
task in the Edit Recurring Tasks dialog box, the following error message
will be displayed:

  There is not enough memory available to perform this action. Please close
  some windows and try again.

No Error Message When Printers Removed:

Q87990

If you have used a printer with Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, and then
all of the printers installed for Windows are removed using Control Panel,
further reports printed from Schedule+ show the progress indicator and
behave as though the report printed properly. No error message stating that
there are no printers available is generated.

Cannot Choose All When Exporting to a Text File:

Q98784

When you attempt to export information from Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
to a text file, the All option button is not available. Similarly, when you
attempt to export Schedule+ information in the Schedule+ file format, the
only option available is All.

Err Msg: Not Enough Memory to Display Dialog Box:

Q99205

Following a successful installation of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows as a
stand-alone user, if the USER_NAME.CAL file contains a space, the calendar
file may work for a period of time, but an invalid calendar file is
eventually generated (the calendar file becomes corrupt and/or is
unrecognized by Schedule+.

Free/Busy Times Are Not Received:

Q100032

When you run Schedule Distribution (SCHDIST.EXE) among several Microsoft
Mail for PC Networks postoffices from version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+
for Windows, the free and busy times from one or more postoffices will not
transmit or be received by one or more postoffices.

One or more postoffices participating in Schedule Distribution will never
receive updates from other postoffices. For example, the following log file
indicates that a message from RB/SMPO2 is generated; however, the line
immediately following indicates a message received, but without a "From:"
line.

     [16:07:41] - &lt;m:&gt; RB/SMPO: Checking for schedule updates ...
     [16:07:41] - Sending schedule update
     [16:07:41] -          From: RB/SMPO
     [16:07:41] -            To: RB/SMPO2
     [16:07:41] -
     [16:07:41] - &lt;n:&gt; RB/SMPO2: Checking for schedule updates ...
     [16:07:42] - Sending schedule update
     [16:07:42] -          From: RB/SMPO2
     [16:07:42] -            To: RB/SMPO
     [16:07:42] - Received schedule update
     [16:07:42] -            To: RB/SMPO2
     [16:07:42] -

Schedule+ Prints Incomplete Message, Header Info:

Q104030

When you print a message in Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, you get only
the following information:

- User name

- From field

- To field

- Subject field

- When field

- Date Sent field

The following information is not printed:

- Who the message is for (that is, the manager or the assistant)

- Type of message (that is, a response, cancellation, or request)

- Attendance Status label (for responses only)

- Messages marked as Sent On Behalf Of Manager

Date Bold When Viewing Other's Appointment Book:

Q104058

With versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, if a user
has an appointment that is both private and tentative, the appointment date
on the calendar is bold when you view the calendar by choosing Open Other's
Appt. Book from the File menu.

Alarms Pop-Up Dialog Box Is Not Pen Aware:

Q104060

When Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows needs to notify you of an event, it
displays a Reminder pop-up dialog box. This dialog box asks whether you
want to be reminded again. A field is available for entering a new reminder
frequency. This field is not pen-aware (that is, it does not accept
handwritten numeric inputs). Instead, the cursor remains an I-beam and pen
input is disabled.

Edit Gesture Does Not Work with Appointment Book:

Q104061

When you use version 1.0 or 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows with
Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, the edit gesture (a check mark)
displays an empty edit box instead of the edited text when the gesture is
made on a selected (highlighted) appointment inside the appointment book.

IBM Matrix Incorrectly Prints Right Border:

Q104062

In versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, when you print
the standard-size view of a schedule or task list on an IBM Matrix printer,
the right vertical border is sometimes misaligned and the text occasionally
exceeds the right vertical border in the print output.

Subject Field Incorrect for X.400 User:

Q104129

The Subject field of a Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows message destined for
an X.400 loop-around user is not correct. An X.400 loop-around user is one
where the message returns to the user through the X.400 gateway.

Wrong Message When Deleting Meeting:

Q104369

In versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, when you use
another person's (user1) appointment book to create a meeting that includes
yourself, you may receive an incorrect message when you delete the meeting
while in user1's schedule.

If you choose not to book the meeting into your own schedule, when you go
back into user1's appointment book, delete the meeting, and choose to send
a cancellation message, you will receive the following message:

  Do you want to remove this meeting for yourself now?

Since you did not book the meeting in your own schedule, you should not
receive the message.

Archive Progress Indicator Starts at 50 Percent:

Q105433

In versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, when the
allotted Schedule+ storage limit has expired, you are asked to do one of
the following:

- Create archive before deleting

- Delete

- Do Not Delete

When you choose to archive this Schedule+ information, the Progress
Indicator immediately begins at 50 percent.
