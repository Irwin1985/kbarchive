The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Serializer Utility, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Serializer utility is only available from the
Microsoft Select CD. The following is the text of the README.TXT file included
with the Serializer utility.

README
------

Microsoft Mail Version 3.2 Serializer Utility
---------------------------------------------

This README describes the Microsoft Mail version 3.2 Serializer utility and how
you use it. This entire file must be read prior to using the Serializer.

Installation Notes
------------------

The Serializer should NOT be installed to ANY network drive or path. Installation
is supported only on local drives on the machine in which the Serializer
diskette is placed and run from. Attempting to install the Serializer to a
network drive or path will result in incorrect Serializer operation and loss of
serial number range.

The Serializer should not be installed on a RAM drive or virtual drive.

What is the Serializer?
-----------------------

The Serializer utility allows you to create unique Microsoft Mail version 3.2
Setup disks from the disks created by the Select CD process. Serialization
ensures that each postoffice has a unique serial number, which is required for
proper operation of Microsoft. Each Serializer contains a unique set of serial
numbers that it uses to validate the disks you create. Each serial number in the
set is used only once. When all serial numbers have been used, the Serializer
expires.

When Should You Use the Serializer?
-----------------------------------

Microsoft Mail version 3.2 Setup disks created from Select CDs dated August 1993
and later will not install without prior serialization. Only copies of Server
Disk 1 (the Mail Setup disk) require serialization; no other Microsoft Mail
disks require serialization.

Supplied Files
--------------

SERIAL.EXE is the MS-DOS based Serializer program that allows creation of unique
Mail Setup disks. It is the only file supplied.

Using the Serializer
--------------------

1. Before you use the Serializer, first create the Mail Setup disk(s) you will
  need by copying the Server Disk 1 files from the Select CD to a floppy disk
  using the Select CD disk creation utility, SELECT.EXE.

2. Run SERIAL.EXE.

  SERIAL.EXE displays three options:

   - Serialize Setup Diskette

   - View Next Serial Number to Be Used

   - Install/Uninstall Serializer to Another Location

  The three options are described in the following section.

  Serialize Setup Diskette prompts you for the drive that contains the Mail
  Setup disk to be serialized, and then serializes the disk. If the disk has
  already been serialized, you have the option to reserialize the disk with a
  new serial number.

  View Next Serial Number to Be Used displays the next unique serial number that
  will be used by the Serializer the next time a serialization is performed. It
  also displays the last serial number available in the set.

  Install/Uninstall Serializer to Another Location allows you to move the
  Serializer to a specified location. With this option, the Serializer will
  copy itself to the specified location and delete the old copy. The first time
  you run the Serializer, you must run it from the floppy disk. The only option
  available will be to move the Serializer to another location. Once this is
  done, the Serializer may be run from the new location and all options will be
  available.

  * See Installation Notes above.

3. To exit the Serializer utility, from the main menu, press the ESC key.

Maintaining a Unique Copy of the Serializer
-------------------------------------------

  CAUTION: If the Serializer is copied or modified by any means other than the
  menu option described in the preceding section, Microsoft cannot ensure that
  the serial numbers are unique. This includes copies for backup purposes. To
  assist in maintaining uniqueness, the Serializer will run only from the
  directory in which it is installed, and copied versions will not run from
  different directories.

Each Serializer is unique, since the set of serial numbers it contains is unique.
You must make sure that there is only one valid copy of the Serializer and that
this copy is not accidentally deleted. After the Serializer has used each of its
serial numbers, it will expire and will no longer be able to run. At that time,
you can delete the Serializer.

Backing up the Serializer and Mail Setup Disk
---------------------------------------------

You should install the single valid copy of the Serializer on a secure drive that
is backed up daily to ensure ease of recovery in the event of hardware failure
and subsequent data loss.

You should store each serialized Mail Setup disk in a secure location with a
clearly marked serial number to ensure ease of recovery from hardware failure.
