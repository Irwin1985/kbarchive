SUMMARY
=======

The following is the Schubert README.TXT file contained in the X:\SCHUBERT
directory of the Multimedia Schubert CD (where X is the CD-ROM drive letter).

================================================================
MULTIMEDIA SCHUBERT VERSION 1.0 README FILE
Microsoft Corporation
December 7, 1993
=================================================================

This file contains information about Multimedia Schubert not
included in the User's Guide.

To read this file on-screen, use the Page Down and Page Up keys.
You can also print the file by choosing the Print command from
the File menu in any Windows word-processing program.  If you
open this file in Windows Write, Microsoft Word, or another
word-processor, it will be easier to read if you select the
entire document and format the text in 10-point Courier.

This README file contains important information on the following
topics:

Section   Description
-------   -------------------------------------------------------
  1      RUNNING IN LOW MEMORY OR RUNNING SLOWLY

  2      CD-ROM PROBLEMS

  3      VIDEO DISPLAY PROBLEMS

  4      AUDIO PROBLEMS

  5      MEDIAVISION CDPC PROBLEMS

=================================================================
1.  RUNNING IN LOW MEMORY OR RUNNING SLOWLY
=================================================================

Schubert uses your computer's system memory to display
pictures.  If you find that Schubert runs slowly or if
you encounter out-of-memory errors, Schubert probably
doesn't have enough memory.  Consider doing the following to
improve your computer's performance:

* Close all unnecessary applications.

* Determine how much memory your computer has available by
  typing "mem" and pressing ENTER at the DOS prompt.  You need
  a minimum of 4MB (4,194,304 bytes) of total memory to use
  Schubert.  If you do not have at least 4MB of
  memory, you may not be able to run Schubert until
  you add more memory.

* If you are running Windows in Enhanced mode, set up a
  permanent Windows swap file on your hard disk.  See your
  Windows documentation for more information.

* Defragment ("clean up") your hard disk by running a
  defragmentation program.

=================================================================
2.  CD-ROM PROBLEMS
=================================================================

NOTE - Do not remove the Schubert compact disc from
your CD-ROM drive while Schubert is in the process of
playing music or displaying a new picture.

In order to run properly, Schubert requires an
MPC-compatible CD-ROM drive. An MPC-compatible drive
"has an average seek time of less than one second and
can transfer data from the compact disc at 150K per
second while using less than 40% of the CPU bandwidth."
If you are having problems, check the documentation that
came with your CD-ROM drive to make sure it meets these
requirements.  An incompatible CD-ROM drive will slow down
the performance of Schubert.

If the Schubert program cannot find the data files
that it needs from the Schubert compact disc, you'll
see a message that tells you that the correct CD must be
in the drive to continue.  To find the source of the problem,
do the following:

* Make sure the Schubert compact disc is correctly
  inserted into the CD-ROM drive.

* Make sure the CD Audio driver is correctly installed.
  See AUDIO PROBLEMS section below.

* If you have an external CD-ROM drive, make sure the
  drive is connected to your computer, plugged in, and turned
  on.  If you still see the error message after checking the
  points above, check the documentation that came with your
  CD-ROM drive or contact the company that supplied the drive.

=================================================================
3.  VIDEO DISPLAY PROBLEMS
=================================================================

Schubert will run in 16-color or 256-color screen
mode.  The program will automatically detect whether you are
running in 16 or 256-color and display pictures accordingly.  If
your computer is running in 16-color mode, and the video card
will support 256 colors in 640x480 resolution, you can run
Windows Setup to change the screen driver to see Schubert
at its highest image quality.

Some screen drivers which are capable of 256 colors appear to
the Schubert program as if they are in 256 color mode even when
they are running in 16 color mode.  When running with these
drivers in 16 color mode, the product will look very strange,
because the colors will be wrong.  To solve the problem, run
Windows Setup to change to 256 color mode.

------------
ATI PROBLEMS
------------
Multimedia Schubert is incompatible with some advanced features
used by some video cards such as the Mach32 chip set running the
ATI drivers.

For Schubert to run on the ATI driver the "256 color palette"
control in the "Advanced features" of the "ATI Control Panel"
needs to be set to ON.  See your video card documentation for
more information.

--------------------
HAND CURSOR PROBLEMS
--------------------
Whenever the mouse arrow is placed on top of clickable text (i.e.,
glossary words and the text in 'Pocket Audio Guide') the cursor
should turn into a hand to show that the text is clickable.  However,
some display drivers will cause this cursor to display incorrectly.
This may look very strange, but the cursor will still work exactly
as it should.

=================================================================
4.  AUDIO PROBLEMS
=================================================================

All of the music in Multimedia Schubert plays directly
from the CD.  In order for it to play properly on your machine, you
must have the correct driver installed.  If the correct driver is
not installed, you will get the following message:
"Failed to open CD-Audio device driver.  Please check that CD-Audio
is installed." To fix the problem, install the CD-Audio device
driver by following these steps:

1. Open the Control Panel from the Program Manager.
2. Double-click the Drivers icon, or choose Drivers from the
  Settings menu.
3. Choose Add...
4. Choose CD Audio from the list box.
5. Choose OK.

If CD-Audio is installed and you are still not able to hear the
music, but you can hear the voice audio, such as the glossary
pronunciations and "A Word from the Author," it is possible that
your CD-ROM is not properly connected to your sound card.  Your
CD-ROM owner's manual should show you how to check that your
CD-ROM is properly connected.

-------------------------
SOUND DOESN'T PLAY AT ALL
-------------------------

If you don't hear any sounds, make sure that the volume for your
speakers is set to an audible level.

If the volume is set to an audible level and you still hear no
sounds at all, something may be wrong with your sound board
setup.  Check to see that the driver is installed correctly and,
if necessary, reinstall it.  Refer to the documentation that came
with your sound card for more information on installing audio
drivers.

Please note that Schubert requires an MPC-compatible
sound board to be installed and is not intended to run with
drivers which use the PC internal speaker, such as the
unsupported "PC Speaker" driver.  Such a driver will in most
cases not play any sounds, and if the driver setup option
"Enable Interrupts" is not checked, your system may crash.
If you have both a sound board and the PC Speaker driver
installed, it is preferable to un-install the PC Speaker driver.

------------------
MEDIA VISION CARDS
------------------

A small number of Media Vision sound card drivers (Pro Audio
Spectrum cards) may not play glossary pronunciations or "A Word
from the Author" properly.  If you have a Media Vision
card and don't hear glossary pronunciations or "A Word from
the Author," but you do hear music, you may need to upgrade
your driver.  Contact Media Vision Technical Support to find out
how to obtain a new driver.

------------------
SOUND CARD PROBLEM
------------------
A driver which comes with the new Pro Audio Vision Sound card,
version 1.46f, causes problems in Multimedia Schubert.  This
driver does not keep track of the time elapsed when it is playing
CD Audio, which causes the pages not to turn correctly in the Close
Reading and Die Forelle chapters.  Version 1.46 of this driver does
not have this problem, so switching to this driver will allow Schubert
to work properly.

=================================================================
5. MEDIAVISION CDPC PROBLEMS
=================================================================
If you are running Multimedia Schubert using Mediavision CDPC hardware, you
may encounter errors when you successfully make a match in 'The Trout
Game'.
Because these errors specifically involve the CDPC hardware, you should
check to make sure the hardware is correctly installed.  However, it is
still
possible that you will encounter errors when matches are made.  Please note
that this is only a problem in 'The Trout Game' and will not affect any of
the
other chapters in Multimedia Schubert.
