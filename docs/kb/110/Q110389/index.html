Version(s): WINDOWS:3.1d
Operating System(s):

Last Modified: 10-NOV-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When using version 3.1d of the Out of Office (OOF) Server in conjunction with
version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, you may see any of the
following messages or conditions:

- 

  Messages
  --------

  Rejecting request from user@server because server is not version 3.0.

  Your Out of Office request cannot be processed because your Microsoft Mail
  Server is not version 3.0 or later.

  Causes
  ------

  The server sending the request is defined as a 2.0 server.

  The server sending the request is not in the Configured Servers list.

  All servers participating must be listed in the Configuration screen.

- 

  Problem
  -------

  User does not receive confirmation or rejection from OOF Server.

  Causes
  ------

  Mail is not being transferred between servers. Verify mail traffic path
  between the user and the server on which the OOF Server account is defined.
  Sign into the OOF Server account to verify the message has arrived. Verify
  routing is correctly configured if applicable.

  The OOF Server has not been started or is not displaying the log/running
  screen. Ensure the Status Field on the log/running screen is visible and does
  not display "Stopped..."

- 

  Problem
  -------

  System displays address error and forces restart.

  Causes
  ------

  Extension or Control Panel conflict.

  HyperCard memory is set too low. Increase value under Get Info.

- 

  Message
  -------

  Error: MS Mail Server &lt;servername&gt; not available.

  Causes
  ------

  The server listed is not available on the AppleTalk network. The network
  connection may be broken.

  The server listed is performing a backup. When the server is available again,
  the OOF Server will continue processing OOF requests on that server.

- 

  Message
  -------

  Error: Home Server not available, waiting 5 minutes, then trying again...

  Causes
  ------

  The server on which the OOF Server account is defined is not available on the
  AppleTalk network. The network connection may be broken.

  The server listed is performing a backup. When the server is available again,
  the OOF Server will continue processing OOF requests on that server. If the
  home server is not available for two hours, the OOF Server process will stop.

- 

  Message
  -------

  "Unknown User Name" appears in Log file.

  Cause
  -----

  The OOF Server account has not been defined.

- 

  Dialog Box
  ----------

  This account is unable to access its Local Mail file.
  Please enter the password of the last account to use the Local Mail file. To
  work without a Local Mail file, select Cancel.

  Causes
  ------

  Multiple users are registered with the same name, but different passwords,
  for example, network manager. Configure all accounts with identical names to
  have identical passwords.

  A user who is attempting to register has changed their password since the
  last time they registered as Out of Office. To correct this, enter the last
  password used by that user or delete the local data file for the user stored
  in the MS Mail Local folders.

  NOTE: To avoid this message use a Microsoft Mail version 3.0 or later
  workstation. This version may be obtained from AppleLink.

- 

  Problem
  -------

  When a user is configuring an OOF registration, the Send button is disabled
  (grayed out).

  Cause
  -----

  There is more than one account in the All list called "OOF Server" and the
  form has not been altered. See Appendix A of the documentation contained on
  the OOF Server disk for information on configuring multiple OOF Servers.

- 

  Message
  -------

  No Such Card

  Cause
  -----

  The workstation software is being used to access Microsoft Mail. It is
  recommended that the Macintosh that runs the OOF Server not be used by any
  other user than that OOF Server.
