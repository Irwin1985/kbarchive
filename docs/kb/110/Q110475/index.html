SUMMARY
=======

When a Windows DLL is written such that it acts as an intermediary between
several applications and ODBC drivers, it may be necessary to share connections
among the applications. This article discusses the architectural blocks to
sharing ODBC environment, connection, and statement handles among several
applications through a user Windows DLL. It also discusses how a service
provider DLL can be written so that it can access ODBC drivers and provide an
interface to applications without sharing handles between applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ODBC Environment, connection, and statement handles are unique to tasks and
cannot be shared among different tasks because the ODBC Driver Manager and ODBC
drivers, when allocating memory for the connection, do not use the DDE_SHARE
option on the GlobalAlloc(). For instance, in response to a call from an
application, when a user DLL calls SQLAllocConnect() in the driver DLL, the
memory is being allocated by the driver DLL in the context of the calling task,
for example, the task that called the user DLL. In this scenario, another task
that calls this same user DLL cannot then use this recently allocated connection
handle to call ODBC functions.

If an ODBC connection needs to be shared among several applications, the
following equivalent approach may be used. Instead of writing a DLL that shares
various ODBC handles among applications, write an application that provides the
same services as the user DLL would. Such an application would contain the calls
to SQLAllocEnv(), SQLAllocConnect(), SQLAllocStmt(), and various other ODBC
calls, and the other applications that need ODBC access can communicate via DDE
with this DDE Server application. All ODBC function calls would then be
encapsulated in the DDE Server application.

When writing a user DLL (without sharing ODBC handles among applications), it is
important to have a separate ODBC environment for every task/application.
Therefore, each application must make its own calls to SQLAllocEnv(), or have an
initialization routine in the user DLL call SQLAllocEnv() in the ODBC driver in
the context of the calling application/task.
