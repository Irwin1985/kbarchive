The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows Sound System 2.0 ships with drivers for five of the most popular sound
cards. These are:

- Microsoft audio hardware or compatible (Microsoft Windows Sound System Card)

- Media Vision Pro AudioSpectrum 16

- Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro

- Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 or 16 ASP

- ESS AudioDrive (common in Europe)

It is generally possible to install the Windows Sound System for sound cards that
are not on this list by using one of the following scenarios:

1. (Best) The manufacturer of the sound card provides a Windows Sound System
  compatible Windows driver.

2. (Better) The manufacturer of the sound card provides a Windows (but not
  Windows Sound System) driver.

3. (Good) The card provides a very good emulation for one of the cards on the
  above list.

4. (Fair) The card provides a very good emulation for a Creative Labs Sound
  Blaster.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Scenario 1
----------

A Windows Sound System compatible Windows driver is one that supports the
software calls that the Windows Sound System Audio Control makes. If your card
is supplied with a Windows Sound System compatible driver, you can configure
Windows Sound System to use it as follows:

1. Insert the Windows Sound System Disk 1 in your drive, choose Run from the
  Program Manager File menu, type the following, and press ENTER:

  " A:SETUP" (without the quotation marks)

  (Substitute A: with B: if you're loading from drive B.)

2. Choose Continue at the first screen discussing possible hearing damage that
  can occur if you use headphones other than the Windows Sound System
  headphones.

3. At the second screen, use Task Manager to close any other applications that
  may be running, then choose Continue.

4. At the third screen, choose Other from the list of available sound cards. You
  will be prompted for your drivers disk. Insert the disk in the designated
  drive and continue setup.

Scenario 2
----------

If your card is provided with a Windows sound driver (but not a Windows Sound
System driver), you should be able to use Windows Sound System with almost full
functionality. To use your driver with the Windows Sound System, follow these
steps:

1. Install the Windows driver using the instructions that came with your Sound
  Card or with the driver.

2. Insert the Windows Sound System Disk 1 in your drive, choose Run from the
  Program Manager File menu, type the following and press ENTER:

  " A:SETUP" (without the quotation marks)

  (Substitute A: with B: if you're loading from drive B.)

3. The third setup screen will not give you the list of available sound card
  types. Instead, it will give you a message similar to the following:

  Setup has detected the presence of one or more sound drivers. These drivers
  may not be compatible with the Windows Sound System. You may wish to remove
  them from Control Panel before proceeding. Continue to install software
  anyway?

  Choose the Continue button.

4. Provide the rest of the Windows Sound Systems disks when they are requested.

These Windows Sound System utilities should work correctly:

- Quick Recorder

- Sound Finder

- Music Box (if you have a CD-ROM drive)

- Voice Pilot

- Sound Control Panel

- Proofreaders

These Windows Sound System utilities will NOT work under this configuration:

- Audio Control. (You will get a message saying "No Windows Sound System
  compatible mixer driver is installed.") To control the volume or recording
  input settings, you will have to use the mixer utility that came with your
  card.

- Windows Sound System Setup. (You will be unable to configure your hardware or
  perform a sound check.)

Scenario 3
----------

If your card is 100-percent compatible with one of the sound cards for which the
Windows Sound System provides a driver, you can try the following steps:

1. Make backup copies of your SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI, and CONTROL.INI files.

2. Run the Drivers option from Control Panel and remove your current sound
  driver. Restart Windows.

3. Run Windows Sound System setup (see Scenario 1). When you get to the third
  screen, choose the listed sound card that your card emulates.

4. Proceed with setup.

  NOTE: If after restarting your computer, you get error messages stating that
  the audio hardware could not be found, you may have to restore your original
  sound driver by reinstating your backup copies of SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI, and
  CONTROL.INI.

Scenario 4
----------

Many sound cards provide a good Sound Blaster emulation mode. To use one of these
cards with the Windows Sound System, use the following steps:

1. Make sure that your sound card is configured for Sound Blaster emulation,
  according to the directions provided with your card.

2. Run Control Panel and choose Drivers. Choose Add.

3. From the list of drivers, choose Creative Labs Sound Blaster 1.5 and choose
  OK or press ENTER.

4. You will be asked to insert one of your Windows disks.

5. Follow the instructions provided above for installing the Windows Sound
  System with a pre-installed sound driver (see Scenario 2).

These Windows Sound System utilities should work correctly:

- Quick Recorder

- Sound Finder

- Sound Control Panel

- Proofreaders

These Windows Sound System utilities may work with some limitations:

- Music Box. (You will have to connect the headphone jack to the line-out port
  on the back of your sound card. You will also probably only get monophonic
  sound.)

- Voice Pilot. (You will have no way to specify whether voice commands will be
  coming in through the microphone port or the line-in port. If your microphone
  port is not powered, you may not be able to use the Windows Sound System
  microphone unless the card monitors both the mike port and the line-in port
  for voice commands.)

These Windows Sound System utilities will NOT work:

- Audio Control. (You will get a message saying "No Windows Sound System
  compatible mixer driver is installed.") The Windows Sound Blaster driver does
  not come with a mixer utility, so you will have to control the volume by
  using the volume knob on your card (if there is one).

- Windows Sound System Setup. (You will be unable to configure your hardware or
  perform a sound check.)
