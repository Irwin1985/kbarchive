-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine the version number of Systems Management
Server; related service packs, international client packs (ICP), and hotfixes;
the Microsoft Management Console (MMC); and Windows Management Interface (WMI)
dependent components.

Server Components
-----------------

To determine the version number of the server software, right-click the Site Name
in the Site Hierarchy node of the SMS Administrator Console and click
Properties.

Determine the MMC version number by viewing the Version tab of Properties for the
file %windir%\System32\Mmc.exe. Alternatively, view About Help after starting in
author mode.

To determine WMI version number, view the Version tab of Properties for
%windir%\system32\wbem\winmgmt.exe.

Client Components
-----------------

You can determine the client version, also known as "base components," by viewing
Compver.ini, which is located in the ..\SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base directory
on the site server. Or, you can run the Systems Management utility in Control
Panel and select the Components tab on the client computer.

To determine versions of client components on the server, examine the Compver.ini
file located at ..\SMS\inboxes\clicomp.src\comp_dir, where comp_dir is the
directory for the component, such as hinv for hardware inventory. The Components
tab in the Systems Management utility in Control Panel displays the number of
the version running on the client. You can also view the version number of the
Windows Management Interface (WMI) in Control Panel on the client.

Note that the \Clicomp.src directories are replicated at all client access points
and logon points for the site.

To determine the version number of specific files, right-click the file name in
Windows Explorer and click Properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

United States Version Number:
For U.S. Systems Management Server 2.0 version 2.00.1239.0000, the first 2 is the
primary version number and 1239 is the build number.

The WMI version included with Systems Management Server 2.00.1239.0000 is version
1.10.698.0000 (build 698).

The MMC version included with Systems Management Server 2.00.1239.0000 is version
1.1 (build 5.00.1920.1).


Higher version and build numbers are always later and will not be overwritten
with earlier version and build numbers during a Systems Management Server
Service Pack installation or upgrade.

You can also identify service pack, international client pack, and hotfix numbers
from the version number. These minor releases and revisions are reflected in the
last four digits of the Systems Management Server version number, as described
below.

Service Pack:
The leftmost digit, .x000, is the service pack release number (for example,
2.00.1239.2000 denotes Service Pack 2).

International Client Packs:
The ICP version number is represented by the second digit, which can range from 4
to 9 (.0400, .0500, .0600, .0700, .0800, .0900).

Hotfixes:
The last three digits are the hotfix version number (which can range from .0001
to .0399).


NOTE: A service pack version will overwrite the ICP version until the new service
pack ICP build is released.
