SYMPTOMS
========

The information store may stop unexpectedly and the following events may appear
in the event log:

  Event ID: 30
  Source: EDB
  Type: Error
  Category: Logging/Recovery
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((425)) Unable to create the log. The drive may be
  read-only or out of disk space. Error -1032.

  -and-

  Event ID: 1111
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: An error occurred while writing to the database log file.
  Attempting to stop the Microsoft Exchange Information Store.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when another program prevents Exchange Server from
accessing the log files. For example, an anti-virus program or file management
utility may be accessing the log files, which prevents Exchange Server from
accessing them.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, quit all programs that may be accessing the log
files. This includes anti-virus programs, file and disk management utilities,
and other programs that keep files open for an extended period of time.

If you determine that an anti-virus program was accessing the log files, you may
be able to prevent this problem from occurring by configuring the program so
that it does not scan the folders in which the log files are located. By
default, the log files are located in the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata and Exchsrvr\Dsadata
folders. In addition, if the program is not completely compatible with Exchange
Server, you may be able to prevent this problem from occurring by obtaining an
updated version of the program, or a different anti-virus program, that is
completely compatible with Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several other conditions that may prevent Exchange Server from writing
to the log files, including the following:

- There is not enough free disk space on the drive where the log files are
  located.
- The necessary permissions have not been assigned on the drive or folder where
  the log files are located.
- The log files do not exist.

However, the -1032 error (jet_errFileAccessDenied) in the first event typically
indicates that another program has the log files open, which is preventing
Exchange Server from accessing the files.
