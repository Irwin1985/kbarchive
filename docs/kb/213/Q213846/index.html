The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Data Object Libraries may be referenced in your Visual Basic
project. When the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) is used to build the
installation, the PDW scans the project files and determines which dependency
files need to be distributed.

This article provides the general information you need to distribute any of the
following Data Object Libraries with your Visual Basic project:

- Microsoft Data Access Objects (DAO) 3.51 Object Library
- Microsoft Data Access Objects (DAO) 3.6 Object Library
- Microsoft Remote Data Object (RDO) 2.0
- Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) 2.0, 2.1, 2.5, or 2.6 Library

MORE INFORMATION
================

The files are listed in the Setup's file that is created by the PDW for
distribution.

For additional information on how each section in the Setup.lst file is used,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q189743 INFO: Description of Setup.lst Sections

The following sections describe points to be aware of when you distribute any of
the Data Object Libraries.

Microsoft Data Access Objects (DAO) 3.51 Object Library
-------------------------------------------------------

Intrinsic Data Control Incompatibility with Microsoft Access 2000 (Jet 4.0)

If you use the intrinsic data control in your project and you attempt to connect
to a Microsoft Access 2000 database, you may receive the following error
message:

  Unrecognized Database Format

This error message occurs because the DAO generic data control is based on Jet
3.51 and does not recognize Jet 4.0 database formats. Access 2000 is a Jet 4.0
format database. Prior to Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), the
workaround for this problem was to open a recordset with DAO code, and then
assign it to the recordset property of a data control.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q238401 PRB: Unrecognized Database Format Error Message When Upgrading to
  Access 2000

This problem does not exist with the data control that ships with Microsoft
Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4.

Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4 can be obtained at the Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/vs6sp4/default.asp

Jet 3.51 OLE DB Provider Is Not Included in MDAC 2.1 or Later

The Jet OLE DB Provider requires the version number of the provider in order to
connect to an Access database. If your application specifies Version 3.51 of the
Jet OLE DB provider in a connection string or a UDL, and you install ADO by
redistributing MDAC 2.1, you are likely to receive the following error message:

  3706: ADO could not find the specified provider

This error message occurs because MDAC 2.0 installs version 3.51 of the Jet OLE
DB provider while MDAC 2.1 installs version 4.0 of the Jet OLE DB Provider, but
does not install version 3.51.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q197902 PRB: Jet 3.51 OLE DB Provider Is Not Installed With MDAC 2.1 or Later

Microsoft Data Access Objects (DAO) 3.6 Object Library
------------------------------------------------------

DAO version 3.6 is required for applications that use DAO to read and write to
Access 2000 databases. If Access 2000 (or DAO 3.6) is already installed on the
destination computer, then no additional steps are required. If it is not, it is
necessary to distribute DAO 3.6. However, there is currently no redistributable
for DAO 3.6. In order to redistribute DAO 3.6, it is necessary to install DCOM,
redistribute MDAC 2.1(GA) or later, and ensure that the DAO DLL is also
distributed and registered on the destination computer.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q233002 HOWTO: Redistribute DAO 3.6

Microsoft Remote Data Object (RDO) 2.0
--------------------------------------

In order for RDO to be properly distributed and installed, ODBC must already be
installed on the destination computer. ODBC can be installed through the
odbcst32.exe file, which is located in the ODBC Folder under the SQL/i386
directory on Visual Basic 6.0 Disk 2. ODBC can also be installed by including
the MDAC redistributable in the distribution that is outlined in the
"References" section covering distributing ADO/MDAC. To determine all of the
files needed to distribute for RDO to work successfully on a computer that does
not have Visual Basic installed, you can generate a dependency (.dep) file with
the Package and Deployment Wizard. To generate a dependency file that shows the
files needed for RDO when running the PDW, complete the following steps:

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a reference to Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0.

3. Save this project and run the Package and Deployment Wizard on it.

4. Select the Package option.

5. On the Package Type, choose Dependency File, and then proceed through the
  wizard to completion.

When you are finished, you have a file with a .dep extension that can be opened
with Microsoft Notepad. MSRDO20.dll and its dependencies are shown in this
file.

You want to ensure that these files are included with the distribution. If these
files are not listed on the Included Files dialog box when you run the Package
and Deployment Wizard, include them by clicking Add in the dialog box.

Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) 2.0, 2.1 or 2.5 Library
------------------------------------------------------------

The PDW does not distribute mdac_typ unless there is a specific reference to an
ADO Library (any version) in the project.

You can also add mdac_typ.exe manually by clicking Add in the Included Files
dialog box when you run the Package and Deployment Wizard. The wizard uses the
MDAC_Typ.exe file in the ...\Wizards\PDWizard\Redist folder. Obtain the MDAC
Components at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm

For additional information how the PDW distributes MDAC, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q217754 HOWTO: Control Which MDAC Version the Package and Deployment Wizard
  (PDW) Distributes

The installation of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) requires that DCOM be
already installed on the destination computer:

- For Windows 95 computers, install DCOM95.
- For Windows 98 computers, install DCOM98.
- Download the latest version of DCOM from the following Microsoft Web page:

  http://www.microsoft.com/com/resources/downloads.asp

If DCOM is not already installed on the destination computer, you may receive one
of the following error messages:

  Unable to load file 'msdadc.dll' to register it

  -or-

  DLL registration failed
