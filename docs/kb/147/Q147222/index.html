-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Transaction Server 2.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Access Violation in Explorer.exe
--------------------------------


An Access Violation occurs in Windows NT Explorer (Explorer.exe) and other
applications while running Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS).

During server process (package) shutdown, an uninitialized hWnd stack variable
causes a broadcast message with invalid data. This causes currently running
programs (including Explorer.exe) to stop responding (hang) or restart due to an
Access Violation.

DCOM Fails with 80010111 When Client and Server are on Same Node
----------------------------------------------------------------


If a Distributed COM (DCOM) client and server are on the same computer and the
client uses anything other than the computer's NetBIOS name to refer to the
server, the call receives errors about invalid headers on packets.

The specific case that impacts Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) is when a virtual
server name is used. The virtual server name is registered with an IP address
that is bound to a node (computer) in the cluster. This is done so the IP
address can be failed over to another node in the cluster without clients
needing to know of the change.

The problem arises when a server on one of the computers uses the service of
another server in the cluster. If, because of failure or administrator action,
the two servers end up on the same computer, DCOM fails. The virtual server name
and IP address have to be used because the location of the servers may change.

Windows NT 4.0 RPC Binds Hang When the Server Is Restarted
----------------------------------------------------------


When using RPC over TCP/IP, binds may hang if the server is restarted when a bind
is outstanding. It takes about two hours for TCP/IP to recover from this.

IIS/ASP Security Context Becomes Corrupt Under Stress
-----------------------------------------------------


Under stress, a script that is supposed to run under the security context of a
specific user may run as System instead. Running under the wrong security
context can result in incorrect file access, incorrect component availability,
and incorrect component capabilities.

Problem with calling Out-of-Process Applications using Role-based Security
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


If there are out-of-process Transaction Server packages using role-based
security, it is possible for someone who has access to the computer to spoof the
identity that the MTS package believes is calling the package. The scenario
described is extremely rare, but the fix eliminates the possibility completely.

A side effect of this fix is that all out-of-process components configured to
"Activate as Activator" will now run under the context of the System user, where
formerly they would run under a non-deterministic user context.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem (do not install
the Roll-up hotfix if you have previously installed the Cluster hotfix):

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up/

If you use Cluster Services with Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5, you must
also install the Cluster hotfixes.

For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
