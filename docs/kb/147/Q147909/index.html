SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Services for Macintosh (SFM) for Windows NT, there may be
occasional issues creating or re-creating a MacVolume. The following error
message may appear when you create the volume:

  The Device attached to the system is not functioning

In the event log, the following error message is displayed:

  Event ID: 12035
  Description: Volume information for &lt;volume name&gt; could not be loaded.
  Setting defaults.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following methods should be tried individually and in sequential order.
Before each step, stop Services for Macintosh (SFM) in the Services tool in
Control Panel. Before you continue with the next step, restart SFM and test for
success by attempting to re-create the volume on the preferred directory.

Method 1
--------

Run Chkdsk.exe with the /f and /r command-line switches on the partition that is
generating the error message. Running Chkdsk.exe usually requires restarting the
server. If the volume is large in size, it may take several minutes to several
hours to complete and the server may not be available during this time. If time
is a concern and you have a large volume, skip this method and continue to
method 2. At some point when time permits, run Chkdsk.exe on the server.

Method 2
--------

Create a temporary Macintosh volume on a new partition. Copy all files and
folders from the original Macintosh volume into the temporary volume on the new
partition.

NOTE: Existing Macintosh NTFS file system (NTFS) permissions are not retained.
You can use Scopy.exe, which can be found in the Windows NT Resource Kit, to
retain all file and folder permissions if necessary.

Remove the original Macintosh volume from MacFile. Delete the original folder,
and then re-create the volume using the same volume name. If this is successful,
move all files and folders from the temporary volume back into the re-created
volume.

Method 3
--------

Create a temporary Macintosh volume. Move all files and folders from the original
Macintosh volume into the temporary volume on the same drive.

NOTE: This ensures that permissions are retained.

Remove the original Macintosh volume from MacFile, delete the original folder,
and then re-create the volume using the same volume name. If this is successful,
move all files and folders from the temporary volume back into the re-created
volume.

Method 4
--------

Remove the volume in question from Macfile, and then delete the Icon file and
Network trash folder. These files (Hidden/System) exist in the root of the
Macintosh volume (folder).

Method 5
--------

If the issue exists in a volume that is part of a folder (for example,
D:\Public), type the following command at a command prompt:

  dir &gt; d:\public:afp_idindex

If you are rebuilding a root drive share such as C:\ or D:\, type the following
command at a command prompt:

  dir &gt; d:\:afp_idindex

NOTE: This command intentionally damages the index of the Macintosh volume. After
SFM is stopped and restarted, the damage forces Windows NT to rebuild the index
on that volume immediately. If an "access denied" error message occurs, the
volume may be in use by opened files or the folder is being shared for personal
computer access. Disable all programs and file sharing to prevent this error
message.

After SFM is restarted and the index is complete, an event is logged in Event
Viewer. If the volume is large in size, it may take several minutes before all
volumes and files are visible by the Macintosh client. Avoid stopping the SFM
service at this time.

The following error will appear when you corrupt the volume index:

  Event ID: 12042
  Source: MacFile
  Description: Internal server information for file "\&lt;volume
  name&gt;:AFP_AfpInfo" was corrupted.
  Setting default information.

Method 6
--------

Use Disk Administrator to change the drive letter of the partition exhibiting the
problem. For example, if drive D had the original Macintosh volume, change it to
drive E (as long as E is not being used by another device). Restart the computer
running Windows NT and attempt to create the volume. If this is successful, you
can use Disk Administrator to change back to the original drive letter.

NOTE: This procedure damages the NTFS data stream and forces MacFile to
regenerate it. This step is only necessary if you are sharing the root of the
drive.

Method 7
--------

Remove all Macintosh volumes from MacFile. Remove SFM by using the Network tool
in Control Panel. Do not restart the computer. Delete the Icon file and the
Network trash folder from the root of the Macintosh volume. Restart the
computer. Reinstall SFM and apply the necessary service packs.


MORE INFORMATION
================

SFM creates an in-memory index for each Macintosh volume to optimize folder and
file access for Macintosh clients. Along with the appropriate disk structures,
the index is updated for certain events, such as creation or deletion of folders
and files, and for all permission changes. The index, which is stored on disk in
the volume header, is read when SFM is started and written right after startup
and again when SFM is shutdown. Attribute changes, such as folder permissions
made by processes outside of SFM, to Macintosh volumes may not be correctly
reflected until SFM is stopped and restarted.
