  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Prior to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), Windows NT supported two kinds of
challenge/response authentication:

- LanManager (LM) challenge/response

- Windows NT challenge/response (also known as NTLM challenge/response)

Windows NT also supported session security mechanisms that provided for message
confidentiality and integrity.

To allow access to servers that only support LM authentication, Windows NT
clients prior to SP4 always use both, even to Windows NT servers that supported
NTLM authentication.

LM authentication is not as strong as Windows NT authentication so some customers
may want to disable its use, because an attacker eavesdropping on network
traffic will attack the weaker protocol. A successful attack can compromise the
user's password.

Microsoft has developed an enhancement to NTLM called NTLMv2 that significantly
improves both the authentication and session security mechanisms.

In addition, the implementation of the NTLM Security Service Provider (SSP) has
been enhanced to allow clients to control which variants of NTLM are used, and
to allow servers to control which variants they will accept, by setting a new
registry key appropriately. It also allows clients and servers to require the
negotiation of message confidentiality (encryption), message integrity, 128-bit
encryption, and NTLMv2 session security.

These changes affect the following Windows NT components: Any application that
uses Microsoft remote procedure call (RPC) or that uses the NTLM SSP, use the
authentication and session security described herein. The Workstation and Server
services use authentication but support their own session security.

Background
----------

LM authentication is not as strong as NTLM or NTLMv2 because the algorithm allows
passwords longer than 7 characters to be attacked in 7 character chunks. This
limits the effective password strength to 7 characters drawn from the set of
uppercase alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation characters, plus 32 special ALT
characters. Users often do not even avail themselves of anything more than
alphabetic characters.

In contrast, NTLM authentication takes advantage of all 14 characters in the
password and allows lowercase letters. Thus, even though an attacker
eavesdropping on the Windows NT authentication protocol can attack it in the
same way as the LM authentication protocol, it will take far longer for the
attack to succeed. If the password is strong enough, it will take a single 200
MHz Pentium Pro computer an average of 2,200 years to find the keys derived from
it and 5,500 years to find the password itself (or 2.2 years and 5.5 years with
1,000 such computers, and so forth).

NOTE: This estimate is based on the rate at which the recent RSA Labs "DES
Challenge" code tests DES keys on a 200 MHz Pentium Pro: 1,000,000/second; and
the number of DES keys: 2**56 or 7.2*10**16. For more information about the "DES
Challenge", please see the following Web site:

  http://www.rsa.com/des/

On the other hand, if a password is not strong enough, a dictionary lookup can
find it in seconds.

One possible way of getting a "strong enough" password is to have it be at least
11 characters in length, with at least 4 of those characters uppercase, numbers,
or punctuation. Even if the remaining 7 characters are lowercase low randomness
text with (say) 3 bits of randomness per character, this will give more than
DES's key space of 7.2*10**16 possible combinations, and the password will not
be in dictionaries.

However, hardware accelerators costing $250,000 have been built that can find
either the LM or NTLM password-derived key in 3-6 days no matter how long the
password is. These numbers change as technology gets better. For current
statistics and details please see the following Web site:

  http://www.eff.org/descracker.html

Having the password-derived key of a user does not allow an attacker to log on
interactively but, with special software, it is sufficient to access network
resources as that user.

For NTLMv2, the key space for password-derived keys is 128 bits. This makes a
brute force search infeasible, even with hardware accelerators, if the password
is strong enough.

If both client and server are using SP4, the enhanced NTLMv2 session security is
negotiated. It provides separate keys for message integrity and confidentiality,
and client input into the challenge to prevent chosen plain text attacks, and
makes use of the HMAC-MD5 algorithm (see RFC 2104) for message integrity
checking.

Because the datagram variant of NTLM does not have a negotiation step, use of
otherwise negotiated options, such as NTLMv2 session security and 128- bit
encryption for message confidentiality, has to be configured.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Control of NTLM security is through the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\control\LSA

NOTE: On Win9x, the valid registry key is LMCompatibility while on Windows NT it
is LMCompatibilityLevel.

Choice of the authentication protocol variants used and accepted is through the
following value of that key:

  Value: LMCompatibilityLevel
  Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
  Valid Range: 0-5
  Default: 0
  Description: This parameter specifies the type of authentication to be
  used.

  Level 0 - Send LM response and NTLM response; never use NTLMv2 session
            security
  Level 1 - Use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated
  Level 2 - Send NTLM authenication only
  Level 3 - Send NTLMv2 authentication  only
  Level 4 - DC refuses LM authentication
  Level 5 - DC refuses LM and NTLM authenication (accepts only NTLMv2)

NOTE: Authentication is used to establish a session (username/password). Session
security is used once a session is established using the apropriate type of
authenication. Also system times should be within 30 mins of one another.
Authenication can fail because the server will think the challenge from the
client has expired.

Control over the minimum security negotiated for applications using NTLMSSP is
through the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\control\LSA\MSV1_0

The following values are for this key:

  Value: NtlmMinClientSec
  Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
  Valid Range: the logical 'or' of any of the following values:
     0x00000010
     0x00000020
     0x00080000
     0x20000000
  Default: 0

  Value: NtlmMinServerSec
  Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
  Valid Range: same as NtlmMinClientSec
  Default: 0
  Description: This parameter specifies the minimum security to be used.
     0x00000010  Message integrity
     0x00000020  Message confidentiality
     0x00080000  NTLMv2 session security
     0x20000000  128 bit encryption

LMCompatibilityLevel - Clients
------------------------------

IMPORTANT: For an SP4 client to choose level 3 or greater, the domain controllers
for the user's account domains for all users who will use the client (hereafter,
"the users' domain controllers") MUST have been upgraded to SP4.

If an SP4 client chooses level 0, which is the default, it will interoperate with
earlier servers exactly as it did with Service Pack 3 (SP3).

If an SP4 client chooses level 1, it will interoperate with earlier servers
exactly as it did at Service Pack 3 (SP3). In addition, it will negotiate NTLMv2
session security with SP4 servers.

IMPORTANT: When using level 1 or greater, if the last password change came from a
Windows for Workgroups or MS-DOS LanManager 2.x client or earlier, the data
needed for NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication will not be available on the domain
controller, and SP4 clients will not be able to connect to SP4 servers. The
workaround is to use level 0, or always change passwords from a Windows NT,
Windows 95, or Windows 98 client.

If an SP4 client chooses level 2, it will not be able to connect to servers that
only support LM authentication, such as Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows for
Workgroups and earlier (hereafter called "downlevel LM clients/servers"), unless
the users' domain controllers have been upgraded.

If an SP4 client chooses level 3 or greater, it will always send the new NTLMv2
response. This response can pass through downlevel LM servers and SP3 or earlier
Windows NT servers and their domain controllers as long as the users' domain
controllers have been upgraded to SP4. For example, if an SP4 client chooses
level 3 or greater, the users' domain controllers MUST have been upgraded to SP4
as well. However, this response will not work with downlevel LM servers in Share
Level security mode with non-null passwords. The workaround is to configure them
to use User Level security.

LMCompatibilityLevel - Servers/DCs
----------------------------------

If an SP4 server chooses level 4 or greater, a user with a local account on that
server will not be able to connect to it from a downlevel LM client using that
local account.

If an SP4 domain controller chooses level 4 or greater, a user with an account in
that domain will not be able to connect to any member server from a downlevel LM
client using their domain account. Thus, level 4 means that all users with
accounts on a server or domain have to be using Windows NT to connect.

If an SP4 server chooses level 5 or greater, a user with a local account on that
server will not be able to connect to it from an SP3 or earlier Windows NT
client using that local account.

SP4 clients choosing level 0 or 1 will still be able to connect to SP4 servers,
even with levels 1 or 3 configured, but will be using both the Windows NT
protocol and the weaker LM protocol. They will also be able to connect to
downlevel LM servers, even if the users' domain controllers have not been
upgraded.

Deployment
----------

Because of the above considerations, if it is preferred to deploy NTLMv2, the
following steps should be taken:

1. Upgrade the domain controllers where the accounts for all users that are to
  use NTLMv2 are stored.

2. Even before the upgrade of the domain controllers is completed, clients and
  servers can be upgraded to SP4 and will obtain enhanced security when
  connecting SP4 to SP4 by setting level 1.

3. When step 1 is completed, individual systems that have already been upgraded
  to SP4 can start setting level 3 or greater.

4. If users in some account domain never need to access resources from downlevel
  LM clients, that domain's domain controllers can have their level set to 4,
  and after all of those users' systems have been upgraded to SP4, that
  domain's domain controllers can have their level set to 5.

NtlmMinClientSec and NtlmMinServerSec
-------------------------------------

If the bit with value 0x00000010 is set in the NtlmMinClientSec or
NtlmMinServerSec value, the connection will fail if message integrity is not
negotiated.

If the bit with value 0x00000020 is set in the NtlmMinClientSec or
NtlmMinServerSec value, the connection will fail if message confidentiality is
not negotiated.

If the bit with value 0x00080000 is set in the NtlmMinClientSec or
NtlmMinServerSec value, the connection will fail if NTLMv2 session security is
not negotiated.

If the bit with value 0x20000000 is set in the NtlmMinClientSec or
NtlmMinServerSec value, the connection will fail if 128-bit encryption is not
negotiated.

NOTE: These settings will not guarantee that the NTLM SSP is actually used by
every application, or that message integrity or confidentiality will actually be
used by an application even when they are negotiated.
