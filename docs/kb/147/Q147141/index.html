---------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING MUSIC CENTRAL 96
---------------------------------------------------

To install and run Music Central 96 you need:

- Any Macintosh computer that supports a 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch)
  or higher resolution monitor
- System 7.0 or later
- 8 MB of random-access memory (RAM)
- CD-ROM drive (double-speed recommended)

You can run Music Central directly from the CD. However, to play the
movies and hear the sounds, QuickTime 2.0 or later must be installed
in your System Folder. If Music Central can't find these files, it
will prompt you to run the Installer. You can also install QuickTime
manually by dragging the files from the System Files folder on the
Music Central 96 CD onto your System Folder icon.

The Music Central Installer will add all necessary files to your
System Folder. It will also copy the Music Central program to a folder
on your hard disk titled "Music Central 96". Although installing the
application to your hard drive occupies about 6 MB of free space, it
makes the program launch and run noticeably faster. The text, sounds
and images remain on the CD, so you will still need to insert the CD
to run Music Central.

-------------
2. MEMORY USE
-------------

Music Central 96 should run on any Macintosh with 8 MB of RAM.
However, if 4 MB of memory are not free when you launch the
application, a warning message may be displayed indicating there is
insufficient memory available.

Most users with 8 MB of RAM will not experience problems, but if your
system software takes up more than about 4 MB you may need to adjust
memory usage to make Music Central run properly. Some general
suggestions follow:

- Run only one application at a time. If other applications are
  running, close them and then re-launch Music Central.

- Reduce the amount of memory being used by your system software. To
  do this, return to the Finder and select About This Macintosh...
  from the Apple menu at the top left corner of the screen. The
  Largest Unused Block needs to be greater than 4,096K to run Music
  Central. If the only item listed in the About This Macintosh dialog
  is System Software and the Largest Unused Block is less than
  4,096K, you need to reduce the amount of memory consumed by your
  system software. Refer to your Macintosh documentation for details
  on how to do this, but some general suggestions follow:

     a. Open the Memory Control Panel and check the Disk Cache
     setting. To maximize the memory available to Music Central, set
     the cache to 32K.

     b. Fonts and sounds consume system memory. Removing those you
     aren't using will make more memory available.

     c. Third party system extensions such as screen savers, fax
     software, desktop pictures, menu-modifying utilities and other
     system enhancements increase the amount of memory consumed by
     your system software. Removing some or all of these extensions
     will increase the amount of memory available to applications. Be
     sure that you save anything you remove from your System Folder
     and place it in a separate folder on your disk so that you can
     replace it later.

- Remove Music Central monthly update files. Integrating new movie
  reviews and artist information from the monthly updates you
  download from the Internet consumes application memory. Moving
  these files to a temporary location outside the Music Central
  Folder will increase the amount of memory available for other
  features and improve overall performance.

- Turn on Virtual Memory. Virtual Memory allows you to increase the
  amount of available memory by using space on your hard disk to
  simulate RAM. Although using virtual memory will slow down
  performance, the extra available memory may cause applications like
  Music Central to be allocated more memory on launch or allow more
  applications to be run simultaneously. To turn on Virtual Memory,
  open the Memory control panel, switch the Virtual Memory radio
  button to On, and then restart your computer. You may also wish to
  investigate third-party virtual memory utilities, such as RAM
  Doubler from Connectix Corporation.

Note: Be warned that reducing the minimum size for Music Central's
memory requirements may cause the program to perform poorly. For
example, Music Central may not be able to play video clips or enlarge
stills if it runs out of memory. If you allocate less than 4,096K,
these problems are likely to result.

--------------
3. PERFORMANCE
--------------

If Music Central seems to be running slowly or its audio and video are
choppy or interrupted, there are a number of things which may help:

- If you have over 6 MB of available hard drive space, you can
  install the Music Central application to your hard drive rather
  than run it directly off of the CD-ROM. To install the application
  to your hard drive, double-click the Installer icon on the Music
  Central 96 CD and select Easy Install.

- If less than 5 MB of memory are free when you launch Music Central,
  you may also have performance problems. Check the previous section,
  MEMORY USE.

- Increase the preferred size for Music Central's memory allocation.
  Music Central is pre-set to a suggested memory size of 5,120K. If
  you have plenty of additional memory available to run Music
  Central, you can increase the amount of memory Music Central
  requests by clicking the Music Central 96 application icon,
  choosing Get Info from the File menu, and then changing the
  preferred size in the section titled "Memory Requirements".

- If you are using Virtual Memory to expand available memory to more
  than double your physical RAM capacity, you may find that Music
  Central runs slowly. For best performance, turn off Virtual Memory
  or reduce its allocated size in the Memory control panel.

- Music Central is designed to work properly on a CD-ROM drive with a
  150K/sec transfer rate or faster. A double-speed CD-ROM drive or
  one with a faster transfer rate will provide even better
  performance in some areas. If your CD-ROM drive has a sustained
  transfer rate of less than 150K/sec, it may not be able to supply
  audio and video information to the Macintosh at the speed required.
  This problem cannot be fixed short of upgrading to a faster CD-ROM
  drive. If you suspect a problem with your drive, ensure that it is
  properly terminated and that its software is properly installed.
  For details on SCSI termination, see your Macintosh or CD-ROM drive
  documentation or contact your Apple dealer.

- A dirty or scratched CD-ROM disc can cause your drive to perform
  poorly. Make sure the bottom surface of the Music Central 96 disc
  is clean and undamaged.

- If you are using QuickTime 2.0, the video clips in Music Central
  will run more smoothly if you upgrade to QuickTime 2.1. Power
  Macintoshes will also see significant performance improvements with
  installation of the QuickTime PowerPlug extension. To install
  QuickTime 2.1, double-click the Installer icon on the Music Central
  96 CD, select Customize, and install the QuickTime package that is
  appropriate for your Macintosh.

---------------------------------------
4. SCREEN SIZES AND COLOR CONFIGURATION
---------------------------------------

On startup, Music Central checks your monitor and displays the images
as best it can on your Macintosh. If your monitor settings can be
adjusted to make Music Central look better, you will be prompted to
change them.

Music Central will run on any 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch) or higher
resolution Macintosh compatible monitor, although Music Central's
video clips and still images look best in 16-bit color (thousands of
colors) or 24-bit color (millions of colors).

NOTE: Running in 24-bit color (millions of colors) will slow
performance and cause Music Central to consume memory more quickly. If
you normally run in this color mode and experience out-of-memory
conditions, you can increase the amount of memory Music Central
requests by clicking on the Music Central 96 icon, choosing Get Info
from the File menu, and then changing the preferred size in the
section titled "Memory Requirements".

Music Central is not designed to run in black and white, in 16 colors,
or on monitors displaying less than 640x480 pixels (e.g., Color
Classics, most PowerBooks and all 12" Apple monitors).

-----------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
-----------------

If the audio in Music Central is missing or interrupted, check the
following:

- Sounds may be inaudible if the sound level is turned down. To set
the sound level, open the Sound control panel and experiment with the
speaker volume setting until you find a comfortable sound level. If
you set the sound level to maximum, you may get some sound distortion
just as you might on a stereo system. With external speakers, be sure
they are connected properly and turned on; you will generally be able
to adjust sound level with the external speaker volume knob as well as
with the Sound control panel.

- If Virtual Memory is enabled on your Macintosh, you may find that
sounds are choppy. When Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are
sometimes placed on the hard disk rather than in physical RAM. For
optimal performance, Virtual Memory should be turned off. To disable
Virtual Memory, open the Memory control panel, click the Virtual
Memory Off button, and then restart your computer.

- In low-memory situations, you may find that sounds will not load or
play. If you cannot get a sound to play and are sure that your Sound
control panel is set correctly, or you are receiving error messages
when attempting to play sounds, you may need to allocate more memory
for Music Central. Please refer to the MEMORY USE section for
suggestions on how to solve memory problems.

- Some sounds used in Music Central are stored on the CD-ROM in a
compressed format. In order to be played, the sound must be read from
the disc and decompressed. Older or slower Macintoshes (such as the
Macintosh II and Macintosh LC) may experience interruptions in audio
playback.

- In some situations, QuickTime 2.0 and Sound Manager 3.0 may have
insufficient system memory available to play sounds. Upgrading to
QuickTime 2.1, included on the Music Central 96 CD, should improve the
system's ability to play sounds under these conditions.

- Version 1.5.1 of Connectix RAM Doubler has a known bug that
prevents audio and video clips from playing properly on Power
Macintosh models. To obtain upgrade information, contact Connectix
Corporation.

-----------------------
6. PRINTING AND COPYING
-----------------------

You can copy or print any article or List Maker list within Music
Central by choosing the appropriate command from the File or Edit
menu. These commands are also available from the flydown menu directly
above the text. If you select a range of text with the mouse, only the
page header and your selection will be copied or printed. Due to
licensing restrictions, you cannot copy or print images or videos from
the product.

If you find that printed text is improperly formatted or that special
characters are not printed correctly, check the following:

- Turn off Background Printing. In order to support launching
directly from the CD-ROM, Music Central stores the Arial, Times New
Roman and MS Reference TrueType fonts within the application. This
provides Music Central access to these custom fonts without taking up
space on your hard drive. However, because many printer drivers launch
a separate application to manage the printer queue and handle print
jobs in the background, printing errors will result when Background
Printing is enabled. To disable Background Printing, open the Chooser,
select the active printer and switch the Background Printing radio
button to Off.

NOTE: If you install the Arial, Times New Roman and MS Reference
TrueType fonts into your System, Background Printing is fully
supported. You can install these fonts manually by dragging the
suitcases from the Fonts folder on the Music Central 96 CD onto your
System Folder icon.
