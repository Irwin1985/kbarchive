------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING THE ULTIMATE FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT
------------------------------------------------------------------

To run The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright you need:

- Any Macintosh computer that supports a 256-color, 640 x 480 (13-
  inch) or higher resolution monitor
- System 7.0 or later
- 8 MB of random-access memory (RAM)
- At least 2 MB of available hard disk space
- CD-ROM drive (double-speed recommended)

The Installer on the CD will add any necessary files to your System
Folder. It will also copy The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright applications
to a folder titled "Frank Lloyd Wright" on your hard disk; this makes
the programs load a little faster when they're launched. The text,
sounds and images remain on the CD, so you will still need to insert
the CD to run The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright.

You can launch The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright applications directly
from the CD. However, to play the movies and hear the sounds,
QuickTime 2.0 or later must be installed in your System Folder. If The
Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright can't find these critical files, it will
ask you to run the Installer. You can also install QuickTime manually
by dragging the files from the System Files folder on the CD onto your
System Folder icon and then restarting your computer.

-------------
2. MEMORY USE
-------------

The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright should run on any Macintosh with at
least 8 MB of RAM. However, if 2,600K of memory is not free when you
select Modeling Wright from the main menu, a warning message will be
displayed indicating there is insufficient memory available to launch
the Modeling Wright application. Most users with 8 MB of RAM will not
experience problems, but if your system takes up more than 2 MB, you
may need to adjust memory usage using one of the following techniques:

- Run only one application at a time. If other applications are
  running, close them and re-launch The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright.

- Reduce the amount of memory being used by your system software. To
  do this, return to the Finder and select About This Macintosh...
  from the Apple menu at the top left corner of your screen. The
  Largest Unused Block needs to be greater than 6,000K to run The
  Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright and Modeling Wright. If the only item
  listed in the About This Macintosh dialog is System Software, and
  the Largest Unused Block is less than 6,000K, you need to reduce
  the amount of memory consumed by your system software. Refer to
  your Macintosh documentation for detailed instructions on how to
  reduce system RAM usage, but some general suggestions follow:

     a. Open the Memory control panel and check the Disk Cache
     setting. To free up the most memory for The Ultimate Frank Lloyd
     Wright, set the cache to 32K.

     b. Large numbers of fonts and sounds consume excessive amounts
     of system memory. Removing those that you aren't using will make
     more memory available.

     c. Third party system extensions such as screen savers, fax
     software, desktop pictures, menu-modifying utilities and other
     system enhancements increase the amount of memory consumed by
     your system. Removing some or all of these extensions will
     increase the amount of memory available to applications. Be sure
     to save anything you remove from your System Folder and place it
     in a separate folder on your disk so that you can replace it
     later.

- The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright application is pre-set to a
  preferred memory size of 3,400K. You can change the amount of
  memory the program uses by clicking on The Ultimate Frank Lloyd
  Wright icon, choosing Get Info from the File menu, and then typing
  a new value for Preferred Size. If you don't have enough memory to
  launch The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright with the default settings,
  you can set the application to use less memory.

NOTE: Be warned that a low memory setting may cause the program to
perform poorly. For example, The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright may not
play sounds or display pop-up windows if it runs out of memory. If you
allocate less than 3,000K, these problems are likely to result.

- If you find that you do not have enough available memory to run
  Modeling Wright from the main menu, you can quit The Ultimate Frank
  Lloyd Wright and launch Modeling Wright as a stand-alone
  application.

--------------
3. PERFORMANCE
--------------

If The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright seems to run slowly or its sounds
are interrupted, check the following:

- Are you running on a Macintosh with low memory? Check the previous
  section, MEMORY USE.

- Are you using Virtual Memory? You may find that movies and other
  sounds are choppy or interrupted. For best performance, turn off
  Virtual Memory by opening the Memory control panel, disabling the
  Virtual Memory option, and then restarting your computer.

- Is File Sharing enabled? Although File Sharing itself should not
  cause a problem, any network activity may cause The Ultimate Frank
  Lloyd Wright (as well as other applications) to run more slowly.
  For best performance, turn off File Sharing in the Sharing Setup
  control panel.

- The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright is designed to work properly on
  single-speed CD-ROM drives with 150K/sec or faster transfer rates.
  Double-speed CD-ROM drives (or ones with even faster transfer
  rates) will provide much better performance in some sections of the
  product. If your CD-ROM drive has a sustained transfer rate of less
  than 150K/sec, it may be not be able to supply audio and video
  information to the Macintosh at the speed required for smooth
  playback. Contact your CD-ROM vendor for details on your CD-ROM
  drive's transfer rate and information on improving the performance
  of your CD-ROM drive.

--------------------------------------
4. SCREEN SIZE AND COLOR CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------

On startup, The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright checks your monitor
configuration. If your monitor settings can be adjusted to display 256
colors, the program will ask you for permission to switch the
settings.  Your previous configuration will be automatically restored
when you quit the application.

The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright is not designed to run in color modes
other than 256 colors or on monitors displaying less than 640 x 480
pixels (e.g., Color Classics or 12" monitors).

-----------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
-----------------

Sounds may be inaudible if the sound level is turned down. To set the
sound level, open the Sound control panel and experiment with the
speaker volume setting until you find a comfortable sound level. If
you set the sound level to maximum, you may get some sound distortion.
Ensure external speakers are connected properly and turned on; you
will generally be able to adjust sound level with the external speaker
volume knob as well as with the Sound control panel.

If your Macintosh is running with Virtual Memory turned on, you may
find that sounds will break up. For best performance, turn off Virtual
Memory by opening the Memory control panel, disabling the Virtual
Memory option, and then restarting your computer.

If sounds do not play at all and you are running The Ultimate Frank
Lloyd Wright on a PowerPC, check to see if you are running RAM Doubler
version 1.5.1.  If you are, disable RAM Doubler, remove it from the
Extensions Folder in your System Folder, and restart your computer.
Contact the manufacturer of RAM Doubler for information on updated
versions.
