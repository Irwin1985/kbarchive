SUMMARY
=======

It is common to have stored procedures use temporary tables to build a result
set. When using RDO (Remote Data Object) to call this type of stored procedure
it appears as though RDO does not return any results, only an empty result set
and no errors.

Testing this same query with the Microsoft SQL Server version 6.0 ISQL utility
produces the expected results, which leads you to believe RDO is restricted from
reading these temporary tables.

This is not an RDO restriction and RDO CAN retrieve data from a temporary table
created in a stored procedure. However, no data access library can create a
SCROLLABLE CURSOR on a temporary table created within a stored procedure.
Temporary tables that are created within a stored procedure are DESTROYED when
that stored procedure ends. If the table is not there, no data access library
can possibly open a scrollable cursor on it, and go back to it when the next
rowset is needed or when the user tries to update, insert or delete it.

ISQL does not open a cursor, nor use a cursor library, so it just reads data off
the pipe, one row at a time, read-only, forward-only (this is also the default
mode of dblib so many people are used to working this way). The good news is
that RDO can do this as well. You just need to tell SQL Server not to open a
server-side cursor on the temporary table. This is done by setting the
RowsetSize property to 1 and opening the result set as forward-only and
read-only (just like ISQL does). RDO uses 100 as the default for RowsetSize,
since this is the optimal setting for most cursor operations and when it is set
to anything greater than 1, SQL Server' ODBC driver MUST attempt to create a
server-side cursor, since fat rowsets require the ability to scroll and possibly
update.

Remember that using cursors is much different than the read-only, forward-only,
rowset size of 1, approach to getting data back to the client. To support the
operations that cursors do (like scrolling backwards, doing positioned updates,
etc.), the source of the data has to live for the entire time the cursor is
open. RDO can operate in a cursor mode, or a "fire hose" mode, which allows you
to perform whatever functionality you want.

Sample Program
--------------

Step 1: Create the Stored Procedure
-----------------------------------

This stored procedure simply creates a temporary table called "#temptest,"
filling it with all the rows from the Authors table in the Pubs database.

1. Open the SQL Server 6.0 ISQL utility and change the default database to Pubs.

2. Paste the following code into the Query window and click the Execute Query
  button, or press CTRL+E, to execute the Transact-SQL code:

     create proc TempTableTest as
     select * into #testtemp from authors
     select * from #testtemp

3. The following confirmation message displays

  "This command did not return data, and it did not return any rows"

  which indicates that the Transact-SQL code created the stored procedure
  correctly.

Step 2: Create the Visual Basic Code
------------------------------------

The following Visual Basic code opens a connection to the server, creates a
prepared statement for the stored procedure, sets the result set size to 1 and
opens the result set as forward-only, read-only. When you run this code, all the
author IDs and last names appear in the debug window.

This sample code uses a "DSN-less" ODBC connection so you do not need to set up a
DSN (Data Source Name) with the ODBC Admin utility.

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a command button (Command1) and a listbox (list1) to Form1.

3. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1:

     Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Dim cn As rdoConnection
       Dim ps As rdoPreparedStatement
       Dim rs As rdoResultset
       Dim strConnect As String

       strConnect = "driver={SQL Server};server=myserver;" &amp; _
         "database=pubs;uid=sa;pwd="
       rdoEnvironments(0).CursorDriver = rdUseOdbc
       Set cn = rdoEnvironments(0).OpenConnection( _
         dsName:="", _
         Prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, _
         ReadOnly:=False, _
         Connect:=strConnect)

       Set ps = cn.CreatePreparedStatement( _
         Name:="ps1", _
         SqlString:="{call TempTableTest }")
       ps.RowsetSize = 1
       Set rs = ps.OpenResultset( _
         Type:=rdOpenForwardOnly, _
         LockType:=rdConcurReadOnly)

       While Not rs.EOF
         list1.AddItem rs(0) &amp; ", " &amp; rs(1)
         rs.MoveNext
       Wend
     End Sub

4. Note that you need to change your DATABASE, UID, and PWD parameters in the
  OpenConnection method.

5. Start the program or press the F5 key.

6. Click the Command1 button to execute the stored procedure and display the
  results in the list control.
