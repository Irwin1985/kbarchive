SUMMARY
=======

The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment
coupon included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows,
version 2.0. This starter kit installs fonts for Windows-based applications
only; however, it can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for
multiple applications.

This article discusses problems and error messages you may encounter when using
the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Common Problems
---------------

1. When trying to make fonts for Windows- and non-Windows-based applications,
  you may receive an error message stating that Windows fonts are not the same
  as non-Windows fonts made for the same printer.

  In some cases, fonts for Microsoft Windows and non-Windows applications cannot
  be made simultaneously, even though the fonts are for the same laser printer.
  This is because non-Windows-based applications require fonts in a different
  form for that printer. Make the fonts for Microsoft Windows, then make the
  fonts for non-Windows-based applications.

2. When you make fonts with the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit, not all the
  phases can be completed.

  The system may be out of memory. Check the Fontware error log for this "make
  fonts" session to see if this is the case. If it is, there may be
  memory-resident programs or device drivers loaded in the system that you can
  remove temporarily. Make backup copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
  files, edit the original files to increase the amount of free memory, then
  reboot the computer under this new configuration.

3. The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit never asks for disk 2 of the
  Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package.

  Some files in the Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package may not be needed,
  depending on the devices selected when Fontware was set up. If the kit
  doesn't need disk 2 of the Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package, it won't ask
  for it.

4. The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit cannot be used to install Bitstream
  SoftFonts.

  Although SoftFonts and Fontware are both made by Bitstream, they are separate
  products. SoftFonts should be installed using the SoftFont Installer provided
  with the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printer driver.

Error Messages
--------------

1. After you press F10 to make fonts, the following error may occur:

  Time and Space Estimates. Not enough disk space available

  Delete some font requests and check the estimates again. The Bitstream
  Fontware Installation Kit (FIK) has checked the available disk space against
  its space estimates and determined that there is not enough room on the disk.

2. When you are making fonts, the following error may occur:

  Some typeface information missing. Go to Add/Delete Bitstream Fontware
  Typefaces

  You selected a typeface that the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit does not
  find on the system, even though the name is listed in the Make Fonts Windows.
  This may happen if both a PostScript PDL and a non-PostScript PDL printer are
  installed and the typeface was added before setting up Fontware support for
  the PostScript PDL printer. Choose Add/Delete Bitstream Fontware Typefaces,
  and add the typeface again. Then make the fonts.

  If you are attempting to make PostScript PDL fonts from the free Dutch and
  Swiss typefaces, the same error message may occur. Times Roman and Helvetica
  are resident on most PostScript PDL printers; the files needed for Dutch and
  Swiss PostScript PDL fonts are not shipped with the starter kit. Either
  purchase Bitstream Scalable Typeface Packages for Dutch and Swiss, or select
  Times Roman and Helvetica in the Windows application.

3. If you request point sizes for a Symbol typeface, the following message may
  occur:

  This typeface requires a different character set. Go to the Control Panel and
  select a different character set

  Go to the Fontware Control Panel and select one of the symbol character sets
  available to make fonts for the device(s). Symbol typefaces require special
  symbol character sets.

4. When adding typefaces in Fontware the following message may occur:

  Warning: Those typefaces that were copied may not be usable for making
  PostScript PDL Printer fonts

  This means that ESC was pressed before adding the second typeface disk that
  contains information Fontware needs to make fonts for PostScript PDL
  printers. Try adding the typeface again.

5. When setting up Fontware and adding a typeface, the following message may
  occur:

  Unable to copy all typeface information. Errors occurred while copying
  typefaces.

  This message is generated when the Fontware kit is unable to read from the
  disk it is trying to copy. If using a backup of a Fontware Installation Kit
  disk or a Bitstream Scalable Typeface disk, exit the kit, make a new backup
  copy, and try again. If the disk is an original typeface disk, obtain a
  replacement disk.

6. The following message may occur when you enter the Fontware directory name
  while running the Fontware Setup program.

  Unable to make this directory. Choose a different directory

  You have entered a directory name that the kit cannot create on the hard disk.
  Press ESC and enter a different directory name. This may indicate a general
  problem with writing to the hard disk, or may be the name of a file that
  already exists. (Note that Fontware will not accept any directory name that
  MS-DOS does not accept as a directory name.)

7. When exiting Fontware during setup, the following message may occur:

  Warning: Aborting the setup process at this stage may leave your Fontware
  directory in an unusable state, requiring a complete reinstallation of
  Fontware. Do you want to abort setup?

  This message occurs only after Fontware has begun copying files. The Fontware
  Setup program is not completed at the time of exiting Fontware because some
  files may be in an unusable state on the hard disk. Fontware for Microsoft
  Windows may need to be reinstalled. If Fontware for non-Windows-based
  applications is set up in the same Fontware directory, Fontware for those
  applications may also need to be set up.
