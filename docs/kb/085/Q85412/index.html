-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0a Upgrade
README.TXT file.

6. MAKING YOUR NETWORK COMPATIBLE WITH MS-DOS 5.0
-------------------------------------------------

6.1 MS-DOS Shell and Networks
-----------------------------

Most network software won't work correctly if you start it from a MS-DOS Shell
command prompt. Start your network before starting MS-DOS Shell.

6.2 3+Share
-----------

1. You cannot run a server with 3+Share version 1.6 or earlier and MS-DOS 5.0.

2. If you installed 3Com 3+Share with minimal NetBIOS implementation, do one of
  the following:

  1. Reinstall with a complete NetBIOS implementation.

  2. Use the REDIR.400 file to replace the MSREDIR.EXE file on your hard disk.

  3. Call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) and request the LAN Manager
     2.0 supplemental disk; see your registration card for the phone number.

6.3 AT&amp;T StarGroup
------------------

Follow these instructions only if you cannot use the AT&amp;T StarGroup network
after you upgrade to MS-DOS version 5.0 from MS-DOS version 3.x.

1. Install MS-DOS 5 Upgrade.

2. Type the following commands:

  " SETVER SETUP.EXE 4.00
  SETVER ATTSTART.EXE 4.00 " (without the quotation marks)

3. Restart your computer.

4. Use your StarGroup installation disks to remove the existing network software
  from your computer.

5. Reinstall StarGroup. When the StarGroup installation prompts you to indicate
  which version of MS-DOS you are using, choose MS-DOS version 4.0.

6.4 Microsoft LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced
--------------------------------------

If you are running Microsoft LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced or an OEM version of LAN
Manager 2.0 Enhanced, you may want to take advantage of any remaining space in
the upper memory area by loading LAN Manager services such as NETPOPUP in this
area. Call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) to request the LAN Manager
2.0 supplemental disk and technical notes. See your registration card for the
phone number.

If you are running Microsoft LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced and get a "NET3055"
message, do ONE of the following:

- Use the RAM switch in the DEVICE command for EMM386 in your CONFIG.SYS file,
  and the LIM=YES command in the [workstation] section of your LANMAN.INI file.

- Use the NOEMS switch in the DEVICE command for EMM386 in your CONFIG.SYS
  file, and the LIM=NO command in the [workstation] section of your LANMAN.INI
  file.

6.5 Net/One PC
--------------

If Ungermann-Bass Net/One PC does not load with MS-DOS 5.0, do one of the
following:

- Contact your vendor to get an updated LOADNIU.EXE file.

- Put a UBPAUSE command between the LOADNIU and XNSBIOS lines of the MSNET.INI
  file.

- Issue network commands from a batch file that includes a PAUSE command
  between the LOADNIU and XNSBIOS lines.

6.6 Novell Networks
-------------------

NetWare Shell Version (NET5.COM):

  The NetWare workstation shell software is Novell's basic DOS shell and is
  included with MS-DOS 5.0. You may require a different shell for a specific
  application. Contact your authorized Novell reseller if you believe another
  shell may be needed. EMSNET5.EXE and XMSNET5.EXE, alternate shells, are
  available from Novell.

Novell Remote Workstations (RPLFIX.COM):

  If you can't load MS-DOS 5.0 on your remote-boot workstation, contact Novell
  for the RPLFIX.COM file.

Drive Mapping Utilities:

  If you run LOGIN.EXE, MAP.EXE, and SESSION.EXE from MS- DOS Shell or while
  MS-DOS Shell is running, a search path is not added to the existing path. Use
  these programs before starting MS-DOS Shell.

TBMI2.COM and Task Swapper:

If you can't use Task Swapper in MS-DOS Shell when running a Novell network, do
the following:

1. Expand and copy the IPX.OB_ and TBMI2.CO_ files from Disk 2 (5.25" disks) or
  from Disk 3 (3.5" disks) to IPX.OBJ and TBMI.COM on your hard disk.

2. Use the IPX.OBJ file to create a new IPX.COM file. For information about
  creating an IPX.COM file, see your Novell documentation.

3. Start your network, using the new IPX.COM and NET5.COM files.

4. Start TBMI2.COM.

5. Start the application that may be causing problems with Task Swapper. Run the
  application and then exit.

6. Display diagnostic information by typing the following:

  " tbmi2 /d " (without the quotation marks)

7. If the value in the field named Far Call Usage is not 0, you need to run
  TBMI2.COM before using Task Swapper.

  To get help with TBMI2.COM, type the following:

  " tbmi2 /? " (without the quotation marks)

  The default configuration for TBMI2.COM is correct for most applications. If
  you need help configuring the program, contact Novell.

TBMI2.COM and Windows:

  Don't run TBMI2.COM if you are using Windows 3.0.

6.7 PC-NFS 3.0
--------------

If you use PC-NFS 3.0 with MS-DOS Shell, MS-DOS Shell may display more drives
than you have currently enabled. To prevent this, use the PC-NFS /d switch to
specify the number of drives you are using. For more information, see your PC-
NFS documentation.

If you can't use the COPY or XCOPY command on PC-NFS 3.01, contact your vendor to
get an updated version of the PCNFS.SYS device driver.

6.8 TOPS Network
----------------

If your system is a TOPS workstation, the MS-DOS Shell MOVE command may not
work.

Don't use the LOADHIGH command with a TOPS network.

6.9 IBM PC LAN 1.34
-------------------

If you have problems with applications that use record locking or file locking,
you may need an updated REDIR50.EXE file included in ICO 3039. Contact IBM
Support Channel.

6.10 DEC PATHWORKS for DOS
--------------------------

To get support for MS-DOS Task Swapper, use PATHWORKS for DOS version 4.1 or
later.
