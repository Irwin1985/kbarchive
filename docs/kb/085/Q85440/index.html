SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for
operating system version 3.1 MOUSEQA.WRI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Q: What Windows 3.1 mouse type should I select in Custom Setup?

A: Setup offers the following mouse types to choose from:

  Microsoft, or IBM PS/2
  ----------------------

  Select this if you have a genuine Microsoft mouse or BallPoint, or
  an IBM PS/2 mouse.  If your mouse is Microsoft compatible, you
  should select this mouse type if none of the other options apply.

  Logitech
  --------

  Select this if you have any Logitech mouse, serial, bus, or PS/2-
  style. In some cases, Setup may detect Logitech mice as "Microsoft,
  or IBM PS/2." If this happens with your Logitech mouse, you should
  change the mouse type to "Logitech."

  Mouse Systems Serial or Bus Mouse
  ---------------------------------

  Select this if you have a Mouse Systems 2 button serial mouse on
  COM1 or COM2, or a Mouse Systems 3 button serial mouse on COM1.
  Also, select this if you have a Mouse Systems bus mouse.

  If you use a Mouse Systems mouse on a PS/2 style mouse port, you
  should select "Microsoft, or IBM PS/2." These mice are Microsoft
  compatible.

  Mouse Systems Serial Mouse on COM2
  ----------------------------------

  Select this if you have a Mouse Systems 3 button serial mouse on
  COM2.

  Genius serial mouse on COM1
  Genius serial mouse on COM2
  HP Mouse (HP-HIL)
  Olivetti/AT&amp;T Keyboard Mouse

  No Mouse or Other Pointing Device
  ---------------------------------

  Select this option if you have no mouse connected to your PC.

Q: Setup installed my mouse type as "Microsoft, or IBM PS/2," but my
  mouse is neither of these. Why is this?

A: Many third party mice are Microsoft compatible. If Setup detects a
  Microsoft compatible mouse, and none of its other options apply,
  then it selects this mouse type for your Windows 3.1 setup.

  Note: some Logitech mice may be detected as "Microsoft, or IBM
  PS/2." This should be changed to "Logitech."

  Also, Mouse Systems mice connected to PS/2 style ports will be
  detected as "Microsoft, or IBM PS/2." This should not be changed,
  as Windows 3.1's Mouse Systems drivers are for serial and bus mice
  only.

Q: Which MS-DOS mouse driver should I use?

A: If you have a genuine Microsoft mouse or BallPoint, or an IBM PS/2
  mouse, then Setup may have copied a new MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS
  MS-DOS mouse driver to your Windows directory and modified your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file to use this new driver. You should
  use this driver instead of any previous versions supplied by
  Microsoft. This is version 8.20, the latest available from
  Microsoft as of Windows 3.1 release.

Q: If you have a Logitech mouse, and Setup installed your mouse type
  as "Logitech," then the file LMOUSE.COM was copied to your Windows
  directory. This is an updated MS-DOS mouse driver for all Logitech
  mice. You should use this driver instead of any previous versions
  of MOUSE.COM supplied by Logitech.

  If you have a Mouse Systems, Genius, or other third party mouse,
  then you can continue to use your current MS-DOS mouse drivers from
  your manufacturer. However, these drivers may be out of date, and
  might not support the "mouse in a window" feature of Windows 3.1
  for MS-DOS applications. You should contact your mouse manufacturer
  for an MS-DOS mouse driver update.

Q: Should I load my MS-DOS mouse driver before I run Windows 3.1?

A: Yes! The new Windows "mouse in a window" feature for MS-DOS
  applications requires that your MS-DOS mouse driver be loaded
  before Windows is started. Microsoft recommends that you run your
  MS-DOS mouse driver in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, so that it is loaded
  each time you restart your computer

Q: My mouse does not work for MS-DOS applications running in a window.
  Why not?

A: In order to use the mouse with MS-DOS applications running in a
  window, the following are required:

       1. Your MS-DOS application must support the mouse. Does it use
          the mouse when running full-screen or outside of Windows 3.1?

       2. Your MS-DOS mouse driver must support this new Windows 3.1
          feature.

       3. Your MS-DOS mouse driver must be loaded before Windows 3.1 is
          run.

       4. Your Windows display driver (specifically, the enhanced mode
          grabber, or .3GR file) must support this feature.

Q: Should I use my serial mouse on COM1 or COM2?

A: Microsoft recommends that you connect your serial mouse to COM1,
  and other serial peripherals to COM2 and higher. Do not connect
  serial mice to COM3 or COM4.

Q: I have a Microsoft mouse. Should I use MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS?

A: Microsoft recommends that you use MOUSE.COM instead of MOUSE.SYS.
  MOUSE.SYS is still included for compatibility reasons, but does not
  support some of the newer features as well as the MOUSE.COM TSR
  program does.

Q: I have a Microsoft mouse, but Windows 3.1 Setup did not copy a
  MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS file to my Windows directory. What should I
  do?

A: Windows 3.1 Setup only upgrades your MS-DOS mouse driver if your
  have a genuine Microsoft mouse, and it detects a previous version
  of MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS loaded when it installs Windows 3.1.
  Unfortunately, some TSRs can prevent Setup from correctly detecting
  the mouse driver even when it is loaded.

  If you have a Microsoft mouse but Setup did not copy the MOUSE.COM
  or MOUSE.SYS file from Windows 3.1 into your Windows 3.1 directory,
  then you should do this manually as follows:

       1. Use the EXPAND.EXE utility to expand MOUSE.COM from the
          Windows Setup disks to your Windows 3.1 directory on your hard
          disk.

       2. Modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to automatically load "MOUSE.COM
          /Y" when you reboot your PC.

       3. If you were previously loading MOUSE.SYS, remove this line
          from your CONFIG.SYS file.

Q: What is the MOUSE.COM "/Y" option?

A: Some video adapters support a hardware, or "sprite", cursor. Older
  versions of MOUSE.COM and MOUSE.SYS automatically enable the sprite
  cursor in order to provide a smooth arrow pointer instead of a
  block for text mode MS-DOS programs. However, sprite cursors can
  cause serious conflicts with video drivers in Windows, which also
  attempt to use this feature of the video adapter. The "/Y" option
  disables usage of the sprite cursor. Windows Setup automatically
  installs the "/Y" option on your MOUSE.COM line in AUTOEXEC.BAT (or
  MOUSE.SYS line in CONFIG.SYS) in order to prevent conflicts between
  the MS-DOS mouse driver and your Windows video driver.

Q: What happened to the MOUSE.COM "/U" option?

A: Previous versions of the MS-DOS mouse drivers allowed the /U option
  to load the driver in high-memory in order to free conventional
  memory for MS-DOS applications. The "loadhigh" feature of MS-DOS
  5.0 has eliminated the need for this mouse driver option, which has
  also caused some compatibility problems in some configurations.
  For these reasons, the /U option is no longer supported in
  MOUSE.COM/SYS version 8.20.

Q: I have Microsoft mouse software version 8.00 or 8.10.  Should I use
  this software or the Windows 3.1 Control Panel to change my mouse
  settings?

A: Microsoft mouse software 8.00 and 8.10 includes a program
  (POINT.EXE) to change your mouse acceleration and other
  preferences. You should use this program instead of the Windows
  Control Panel to control your mouse. (POINT.EXE is not included
  with Windows 3.1, but is available from MS for Microsoft mouse
  owners.)

Q: Every Time I restart Windows 3.1, my mouse speed is set to the
  slowest setting. What's wrong?

A: This problem may occur if you use the POINT.EXE program included in
  Microsoft mouse software version 8.0 and 8.1 to change your mouse
  settings. The problem is that POINT.EXE is saving your preferences
  in different MOUSE.INI file than the Windows mouse driver
  (MOUSE.DRV) is reading. Make sure that you set your MOUSE
  environment variable to point to your mouse directory. This will
  cause POINT.EXE and MOUSE.DRV to use the same MOUSE.INI file (in
  your \MOUSE directory).

Q: I have a BallPoint mouse. When I suspend and resume my notebook PC,
  the Windows mouse pointer jumps around the screen. What's wrong?

A: Some notebook PCs do not correctly reset the mouse port for
  BallPoint mice after they resume from a power-saving mode.  Your
  PC manufacturer may have a BIOS update available to correct this
  problem. In some cases, running an MS-DOS prompt and running
  MOUSE.COM may alleviate the problem.
