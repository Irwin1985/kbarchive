1. README CONVENTIONS
=====================
If you have questions about procedures or commands mentioned
in this file, you will probably find answers in the
Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference. The following
paragraphs describe frequently mentioned topics that the
guide covers in more detail.

Many sections of the readme discuss changing your CONFIG.SYS
file. For detailed information about modifying a CONFIG.SYS
file, see Chapter 11 of the MS-DOS User's Guide and
Reference.

The readme often refers to DEVICE commands in your
CONFIG.SYS file. For example, one section recommends "adding
a /machine:1 switch to the DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS command in your
CONFIG.SYS file." These DEVICE= statements indicate the type
of command in the CONFIG.SYS file. You need to modify these
statements to reflect the configuration of your system. For
more information, see the DEVICE command in Chapter 14 of
the MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference.

The readme sometimes asks you to use the EXPAND command to
copy files from the distribution disks to your hard disk.
See Chapter 14 of the MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference for
more information about using the EXPAND command.

2. NOTES ON SETUP
=================

2.1 Priam and Everex Disk-Partitioning Software
-----------------------------------------------
For information about Priam and Everex, see the section
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device
driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of Getting Started.

2.2 SyQuest Removable Hard Disk
-------------------------------
For information about SyQuest, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver'
screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.3 Bernoulli Drive
-------------------
If Setup refers you to this section, contact Iomega before
you install MS-DOS 5.0 to get information about an updated
RCD.SYS device driver.

2.4 Disk Manager
----------------
For information about Disk Manager, see the section
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device
driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.5 SpeedStor and Volume Expansion
----------------------------------
If you have a SpeedStor partition on your computer, Setup
probably referred you to this section for one of the following
reasons:

* Setup could not find in your CONFIG.SYS file a command
 for the device driver that supports your SpeedStor partition.
 If this is the case, add the command line to your CONFIG.SYS
 file, restart your computer, and run Setup. For more information
 about adding the command line to your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
 SpeedStor documentation.

* Your CONFIG.SYS file has a DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS line in it.
 If this is the case, carry out the following procedure:
  1. Use the EXPAND command to expand and copy the SSTOR.SYS
     file to your hard disk. See the PACKING.LST file on Setup
     disk 1 for the location of the file and for instructions
     on how to expand and copy it to your hard drive.

  2. Replace the DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS file with a DEVICE=SSTOR.SYS
     command.

  3. Type the following:
        setup /u

If you have a Novell or Xenix partition, see the section
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device
driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

If your system is an IBM PS/2 or has MicroChannel
architecture, contact your software vendor for disk-
partitioning software that is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

2.6 Novell Partitions
---------------------
For information about Novell Partitions, see the section
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device
driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.7 Vfeature Deluxe
-------------------
For information about Vfeature Deluxe, see the section
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device
driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.8 Columbia Data Products Device Driver
----------------------------------------
If you use a Columbia Data Products device driver, do the
following:

  1. Remove the DEVICE=SSTBIOS.SYS and DEVICE=SSTDRIVE.SYS
     commands from your CONFIG.SYS file before running
     Setup.
  2. Restart your system.
  3. Run Setup.
  4. Reinstall the device drivers by returning the DEVICE=
     commands to your CONFIG.SYS file and restarting your
     system.

2.9 Incompatible Primary DOS Partition
--------------------------------------
If Setup referred you to this section, and no other section
in part 2 of this README.TXT file is relevant to your
system, you have a partition that is incompatible with MS-
DOS 5.0. You must delete the partition from your hard disk.
See the section "Setup detected a problem with your primary
DOS partition" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started." Make sure you
back up the files on your hard drive before deleting your partition.

2.10 WYSE Partition
-------------------
If you have partitions created by WYSE DOS 2.11 or 3.1,
you must delete them from your hard disk before running
Setup. See the section "Setup detected a problem with your
primary DOS partition" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."
Make sure you back up the files on your hard drive before
deleting your partition.

2.11 286 Accelerator Card
-------------------------
If your system includes a 286 accelerator card, Setup may
not be able to determine the amount of extended memory you
have and may incorrectly install MS-DOS 5.0. If this occurs,
disable the card before running Setup. If you can't disable
the card, install MS-DOS 5.0 manually. Use the procedure in
the "Priam and Everex" section of "Setup display the
'Incompatible hard disk or device driver' screen" in Chapter 3
of "Getting Start."

2.12 Bernoulli Cache
--------------------
For information about Bernoulli Cache, see the section "Setup
displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device driver'
screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.13 AT&amp;T 6300 Computer
-----------------------
If you use an AT&amp;T 6300 computer and your ROM BIOS is
version 1.20 or earlier, contact your vendor for a ROM BIOS
upgrade. The ROM BIOS version number is displayed when you
start your computer.

2.14 Western Digital SCSI Hard-Disk Controller
----------------------------------------------
If you are using a Western Digital WD 7000 FASST or AT/XT
SCSI controller with hard-disk ROM version 3.35 or earlier,
contact Columbia Data Products Customer Services for an
upgrade before installing Windows and MS-DOS 5.0. The
ROM version number is displayed when you start your computer.

2.15 Machine-Specific HIMEM.SYS Switches
----------------------------------------
For HIMEM.SYS /machine switch values, see "You receive the
'Missing HIMEM.SYS' message" in Chapter 4 of "Getting
Started."

2.16 Toshiba with a Hard RAM Disk
---------------------------------
These instructions apply to Toshiba models T1200, T1600,
T1200XE and T1000LE.

To use the hard RAM disk, do the following before installing
MS-DOS 5.0:
 1. Back up your hard RAM disk.
 2. Using the Toshiba Setup program, delete the hard RAM
    disk by allocating zero kilobytes to it. All data on
    the hard RAM disk will be lost.
 3. Restart your system.
 4. Install Windows and MS-DOS.
 5. Use the Toshiba Setup program to reinstall the hard RAM
    disk.
 6. Run FDISK, change to drive 2, and create a primary DOS
    partition. Quit FDISK.
 7. Use the FORMAT command to format drive D.

2.17 Unix And Xenix Partitions
------------------------------
If you have a Novell or Xenix partition, see the section
"Setup displays the 'Incompatible hard disk or device
driver' screen" in Chapter 3 of "Getting Started."

2.18 Apricot XEN-S Computer
---------------------------
To install Windows and MS-DOS on an Apricot XEN-S
computer:
  1. Remove the DEVICE=AEMM386.SYS command from your
     CONFIG.SYS file.
  2. Restart your system.
  3. Run Setup.
  4. Put the DEVICE=AEMM386.SYS command back in your
     CONFIG.SYS file and restart your system.

2.19 4DOS
---------
Setup replaces the SHELL command in your CONFIG.SYS file
with one that invokes COMMAND.COM. To recover your 4DOS
SHELL command, retrieve it from the original CONFIG.SYS
file, which is saved as CONFIG.DAT on your Uninstall disk.

If external DOS utilities display messages that refer to
error numbers, contact JP Software for an upgrade.

2.20 LapLink
-------------
If you use Traveling Software LapLink, disable the LapLink
device driver before you install Windows and MS-DOS. The
driver conflicts with the Setup program. Once you install
Windows and MS-DOS, re-enable the LapLink driver.

2.21 Stacker
------------

If you are using Stacker data-compression software on your
computer, begin by determining which drives are compressed
and which are uncompressed.

To determine which drives are compressed and which are
uncompressed

*   Type the following at the command prompt:

   [drive]:\stacker\swapmap

   For the [drive] parameter, type the letter of the drive
   that contains your Stacker directory.

   If drive C was drive C at boot time, carry out Procedure
   1.

   Otherwise, the drive that was C at boot time is the
   uncompressed drive. The drive that is now C is compressed.
   Carry out Procedure 2.

Procedure 1

To set up Windows and MS-DOS

1.  Type the following at the command prompt:

   a:setup

2.  When the "A disk-compression program is in use" screen
   appears, choose Continue Setup.

3.  Follow the instructions on your screen.

Procedure 2

You need to determine whether there is enough disk space on
your uncompressed drive to set up MS-DOS 5.0

To determine whether there is enough disk space

*   Type the following at the command prompt:

   chkdsk [drive]:

   For the [drive] parameter, type letter of the uncompressed
   drive.

   Information about your hard disk appears. If the bytes
   available on disk is more than 3,000,000, carry out
   Procedure 1. Otherwise, carry out Procedure 3.

Procedure 3

To set up Windows and MS-DOS on a computer that has Stacker
installed

1.  Quit Setup if you have not already done so.

2.  Set up MS-DOS on floppy disks by typing the
   following at the command prompt:

   a:setup /f

   Follow the instructions on your screen.

   NOTE
   If you run Setup from drive B and have 1.44 MB Setup disks,
   see section 2.27 of the README.TXT file to set up MS-DOS
   on floppy disks.

3.  Restart your computer from the hard disk by removing disks
   from all floppy disk drives, and restarting your computer by
   pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

4.  To determine the path of COMMAND.COM file, type the following
   at the command prompt:

   set

   A list of environment variables appears on your screen.

   The line that begins with COMPSPEC= indicates the
   location of the COMMAND.COM file. For example, the
   following indicates that the COMMAND.COM file is
   in the DOS directory:

   COMSPEC=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM

5.  Type the following at the command prompt:

   c:\stacker\swapmap

   The drive that was C at boot time is the uncompressed
   drive. The drive that is now C is the compressed drive.

6.  Create an OLDDOS directory by typing the following at
   the command prompt:

   md c:\olddos

7.  Copy your old DOS files to the OLDDOS directory. For
   example, if your files are in C:\DOS, type the
   following at the command prompt:

   copy c:\dos\*.* c:\olddos

8.  Delete your original DOS files from your DOS directory. For
   example, if your original files are in the DOS directory on
   drive C, type the following at the command prompt:

   del c:\dos\*.*

9.  Copy all files from the Startup/Support disk to the
   directory that contained your original DOS files.

   For example, if the Startup/Support disk is in drive
   A, and you want to copy the files to the DOS directory
   on drive C, type the following:

   copy a:*.* c:\dos

10. If the COMSPEC variable indicates that the
   COMMAND.COM file is in a directory other than
   the one your original DOS files were in, copy
   the COMMAND.COM file to the directory the
   COMSPEC variable specifies.

11. Copy the COMMAND.COM file to the DOS directory on
   the uncompressed drive. (Refer to Step 5 to determine
   which drive uncompressed.) For example, if the Startup/ 
   Support disk is in drive A and the DOS directory is
   on the uncompressed drive E, type the following at
   the command prompt:

   copy a:command.com e:\dos

12. Insert the Help/BASIC/Edit/Utility disk in drive A,
   and copy all the files from it to your DOS directory.
   Then insert the Supplemental disk in drive A, and copy
   all the files from it to your DOS directory on drive C.

13. On the uncompressed drive, update any drivers
   in your CONFIG.SYS file that load before the STACKER.COM
   file.

   Typically, these files are located in the DOS
   directory on the uncompressed drive. For example,
   if the DOS directory contains the SETVER.EXE,
   EMM386.EXE, and HIMEM.SYS files, copy these files
   from your floppy disks to the DOS directory on the
   uncompressed drive. To determine the location of
   the device driver files on the Startup/Support,
   Help/BASIC/Edit/Utility, and Supplemental disks,
   open the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1 by using
   any text editor.

   If a driver you need is not located on one of
   these disks, expand and copy the driver from the
   Setup disks. To determine the location of the driver
   you need, open the PACKING.LST file on Setup
   Disk 1 by using any text editor. The PACKING.LST
   file also contains instructions on how to expand
   the compressed files on the Setup disks.

   Note: Do not update the SMARTDRV.EXE or SMARTDRV.SYS
   files. Setup will update these file for you.

14. Copy the CHKDSK.EXE file from the DOS directory on
   drive C to the DOS directory on your uncompressed
   drive.

15. Insert the Startup/Support disk in drive A, and
   restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
   Then type the following at the command prompt:

   sys a: c:

16. Remove disks from all floppy disk drives, and
   restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
   If Stacker prompts you to update the COMMAND.COM
   file, choose Yes.

17. To make sure you can access your hard disk, type the
   following at the command prompt:

   c:
   dir

18. Insert the Startup/Support disk in drive A, and
   type the following at the command prompt:

   a:
   sys a: c:

19. Repeat step 16.

   Note: After you have set up Windows and know your system is
   working correctly, you might want to delete the DOS files in
   your OLDDOS directory.

20. Before setting up Windows, read the following information.

If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are
certain steps you need to take before setting up Windows.

*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must
  set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When
  setting up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB)
  of disk space uncompressed for storing system files. To
  leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended
  that you allocate as uncompressed disk space twice the
  amount of your system memory. For example, if your
  system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB
  of disk space uncompressed. For more information about
  swap files, see "Working with Windows Swap Files" in Chapter 14,
  "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

  If Stacker is already set up on your computer and there is not
  enough uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run
  the STAC utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount
  of uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your
  Stacker documentation.

*  If you upgraded from an earlier version of Stacker to
  Stacker 2.0 or later, choose the Custom Setup option
  when you run Setup. When Setup prompts you, don't choose to let
  Setup modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Modify
  these files yourself after Setup is complete, by carrying out
  the following steps:

  * In your AUTOEXEC.BAT, add Windows to your path.

  * Copy the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE files to your
    uncompressed drive, unless you use a different memory
    manager, such as QEMM-386.

  * Add DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to
    your CONFIG.SYS, unless you use a different memory manager
    such as QEMM-386. The command lines that load these drivers
    should appear before the command that loads STACKER.COM.

  * Make sure a copy of SMARTDRV.EXE is on the
    uncompressed drive. In your CONFIG.SYS file, the
    SMARTDRV.EXE command line should include the
    "/double_buffer" switch and should be the path
    of the file at boot time. For example, if SMARTDRV.EXE
    is in the root directory at boot time, you would include
    the following command in your CONFIG.SYS:

    DEVICE=C:\SMARTDRV.EXE DOUBLE_BUFFER

    SMARTDRV.EXE should be loaded before STACKER.COM in the
    CONFIG.SYS file.

  * In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the SMARTDRV.EXE command
    line should be the path of the file after disk drives
    are swapped.

*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, but didn't
  upgrade from Stacker version 1.1, choose the Express Setup
  option when you are prompted. Setup will modify your CONFIG.SYS
  and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for you. When Setup is finished making
  the modifications, it displays a message at the end
  of the Windows portion of Setup that notifies you of the
  modifications that have been made. If you have used Stacker to
  swap your startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
  ask whether you want to update to the new version of the
  CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Choose Yes.

*  If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
  need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
  yourself, using the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files that
  Setup generates. For information about using these files,
  see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself,"
  following this topic.

*  After you have set up MS-DOS manually, type the following at
  the command prompt to set up Windows:

  a:setup /w

Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself
---------------------------------------------------------

If Setup cannot modify your startup files, Setup writes proposed
changes to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN. (These files may also
be named CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x if CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN
already exist). In this case, you must either move
the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files to a drive
that is available when you start your computer, or use a
text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file
so that any references to HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and
EMM386.EXE appear after the DEVICE command that loads
the drivers for your disk drives. Refer to the CONFIG.WIN
and AUTOEXEC.WIN files for the proposed changes.

NOTE
Setup may also create AUTOEXEC.OLD and CONFIG.OLD files
if it cannot modify your startup files. (These files may also
be named AUTOEXEC.00x and CONFIG.00x if AUTOEXEC.OLD and
CONFIG.OLD already exist.) If Setup creates AUTOEXEC.OLD
or CONFIG.OLD files, note the reason that it does so. Then
merge the CONFIG.OLD and CONFIG.WIN files with the CONFIG.SYS
file, and the AUTOEXEC.OLD and AUTOEXEC.WIN files with the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

NOTE
If you use another memory manager such as QEMM-386, do not
copy HIMEM.SYS or EMM386.EXE to a drive that is available when
you start your computer, and do not add commands for these files
to your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file. These files should
already include the correct command lines for your memory manager.

2.22 Dell DOS 3.30
------------------
Some Dell DOS 3.30 installations were done with a utility
called AFORMAT, which creates and formats multiple 32 MB
partitions. These extended partitions become invisible with
Windows an dMS-DOS unless you run a utility called FIXPART
before or after installing Windows and MS-DOS. Contact Dell to
obtain the FIXPART utility.

2.23 Tandy with ROM DOS
-----------------------
Contact your hardware manufacturer for information about
upgrading a Tandy computer with ROM DOS to MS-DOS 5.0. This

2.26 Setup switches for corporate administrators
------------------------------------------------
The following Setup switches can be used when installing
Windows and MS-DOS:

/G              Does not create the Uninstall Disk, does
               not ask if the user is on a network, and does
               not offer the hard disk backup option.
/G /H:filespec  Runs the MS-DOS portion of Setup in Batch-mode
               and uses the default Setup options unless. Also
               runs the Windows portion of Setup according to
               FILESPEC file.
/J              Does not ask if the user is on a network and
               does not offer the hard disk backup option.
/W              Installs Windows only.
/A              Expands and copies files on Setup disks to
               a network server. To run Windows and MS-DOS
               Setup, type "dwsetup" at the command prompt.
               Note: Typing "setup" at the command prompt will
               run Windows-only Setup.

2.27 Setting up MS-DOS on floppy disks if your Setup disks
    are 1.44 MB but your drive A is 1.2 MB
----------------------------------------------------------
To make a setup of floppy disk, carry out the following procedure:

1    Insert Setup disk 1 in drive B and a formatted floppy disk in
    A.

    Specify drive A for the Startup/Support disk.
3    Insert Setup disk 1 in drive B, and type the following at the
    command prompt:
    b:setup /f
    Follow the instructions on your screen.
Use the disk you created in step 2 as your boot disk. Use the disks
you created in step 3 when you want to use an MS-DOS command.

2.28 Your non-Windows application runs out of memory after Setup
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running a non-Windows application that uses a lot of
memory, and it runs out of memory from the command line, try the

5    Restore your data files to the hard drive.

2.31 You receive the "Unable to control the A20 line"
    message
-----------------------------------------------------
If you receive this message during Setup, carry out Procedure 1. If
you receive this message after Setup, your computer is an 80386 or
80486, and you are running QEMM-388, carry out Procedure 2. If you
receive this message after Setup, your computer is an 80386 or
80486, and you are trying to run Windows 3.0, carry out Procedure
3.

Procedure 1

1    Quit Setup if you have not already done so.
2    Run Setup again.
3    Choose the Install MS-DOS only option.
4    When you restart your computer, observe whether this message
    appears on your screen.

    If you receive this message again, you need to add a /MACHINE
    switch to the command that loads the HIMEM.SYS file in your
    CONFIG.SYS file. See the table in "You receive the 'Missing
    HIMEM.SYS' message" in Chapter 4, "Troubleshooting During System
    Startup," in "Getting Started to determine what switch to use.
    After you have added the switch to your CONFIG.SYS file, restart
    your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

5    Run Setup again.
6    Choose the Install Windows only option.

Procedure 2

1    Open your CONFIG.SYS file with any text editor.

running Setup. Carry out the following procedure:

1    Open your AUTOEXEC.BAT with any text editor.
2    Type "REM" and a space in front of the line that loads
    Bootsafe. For example, the line might look something like this:

    rem c:\cpav\bootsafe

3    Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing
CTRL+ALT+DEL.
4    Run Setup again.

3. NOTES ON MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=============================

3.1 386MAX (5.11 or Earlier)
----------------------------
If you have used the SETVER command to report a different
version number to a program you are loading into the upper
memory area with 386LOAD.COM or MAXHI.COM, also use the
SETVER command to report that number to 386LOAD.COM or
MAXHI.COM. For information about the SETVER command, see
Chapter 14 of the MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference.

The new version number is reported to all programs loaded by
386LOAD.COM and MAXHI.COM.

MAXHI.COM programs supplied with versions of 386MAX earlier
than 5.0 are incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

3.2 All Computers Inc. Expanded-Memory Driver (ALLEMM4.SYS)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5 or later of the All Computers expanded-memory
driver (ALLEMM4.SYS) is compatible with MS-DOS 5.0
HIMEM.SYS. Contact All Computers to get an updated driver.

3.3 Problems Loading into the Upper Memory Area
-----------------------------------------------
Some computers with bus master DMA controllers may not be
able to load device drivers or programs into the upper
memory area. Try adding a DEVICE=SMARTDRV.SYS command before
any DEVICEHIGH commands in your CONFIG.SYS file.

3.4 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS)
------------------------------------------
If you use Intel's EMM.SYS driver with Aboveboard, use
EMM.SYS version 4.0 revision D or later. If you have an
earlier version, contact Intel for a free upgrade.

3.5 XMAEM.SYS and XMA2EMS.SYS
-----------------------------
Setup disables the CONFIG.SYS commands that load XMAEM.SYS
and XMA2EMS.SYS. If your system uses both drivers, replace
the commands with a DEVICE=EMM386.EXE command in your
CONFIG.SYS file.

If your system includes an XMA card, remove the REM command
that precedes the DEVICE=XMA2EMS.SYS command in your
CONFIG.SYS file.

3.6 Your third-party memory manager doesn't work after Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you load high your third-party memory manager, such as QEMM-
386, Setup might not update the memory manager's device driver.
If you load your memory manager high, carry out the following
procedure:

1     Open your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file with any text editor,
and
     remove the command or switch that loads the memory manager high.

2     Run Setup again, and choose the Install MS-DOS Only option.

3     When Setup is complete, open your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
     file with any text editor, and insert the command or switch
     that loads your memory manager high.

4     Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing
CTRL+ALT+DEL.
