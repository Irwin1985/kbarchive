1.0  Printing Extended or International Characters
--------------------------------------------------

In addition to the 128 standard ASCII characters you can type using
your keyboard, you can use extended or international characters by
using the Windows Character Map application. For more information
about Character Map, see Chapter 12, "Additional Accessories," in the
Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

When Windows prints a file, each character you typed while using your
application is translated from the Windows character to the
appropriate character on your printer. If your printer supports the
same character, it prints. Otherwise, some other character, such as a
period or other filler character, prints instead. Check your printer
manual and experiment with your printer to determine which extended
characters are supported.

Note: This limitation applies only to the printer's hardware fonts.
Fonts provided by Windows do print the extended characters.

2.0  Upgrading Windows Version 3.0 Laser-Printer Drivers
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading to Windows version 3.1 and have a laser printer
installed, you should upgrade your printer driver to version 3.1.
Earlier versions of laser-printer drivers do not support TrueType
fonts. If you have not yet upgraded your laser-printer driver, you can
do so by using the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer
Setup command in Print Manager. For more information, see Chapter 6,
"Print Manager," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide or see the
information about printing in Chapter 3, "Troubleshooting," in the
Windows and MS-DOS Getting Started manual.

3.0  Configuring Your Printer's DIP-Switch Settings
---------------------------------------------------

The following printer models require certain DIP-switch settings in
order to work properly in Windows version 3.1. Make sure you configure
your printer's DIP-switch settings before you install your printer.

3.1  Canon Bubble-Jet BJ-10e and BJ-130e

All DIP switches should be set to the factory-default position. For
the BJ-10e model, this is the OFF position.

3.2  Epson 9-Pin and 24-Pin Printers Supported by Windows
Version 3.1

The following DIP-switch settings are required for all Epson 9-pin and
24-pin printers:

       Auto LineFeed: OFF
       Skip Over Perf: OFF

3.3  Fujitsu 9-Pin and 24-Pin Printers Supported by Windows
Version 3.1

The following DIP-switch settings are required for all Fujitsu 9-pin
and 24-pin
printers:

       Color:  AUTOSEL
       LF Code:  LF Only
       CR Code:  CR Only
       Emulate:  DPL24/DPL24C

4.0  Notes About PostScript Printers and Cartridges

This section contains information specific to PostScript printers.

4.1  Installing a PostScript Printer

When installing a PostScript printer, make sure you select the name of
your printer model (not PostScript Printer) from the List Of Printers
box in the Printers dialog box. If you select PostScript Printer, you
may encounter problems when printing. However, if you are using Finale
(manufactured by CODA), this is not the case.

4.2  Installing Support for Additional PostScript Printers

If you are using a PostScript printer that is not listed in the List
Of Printers box in the Printers dialog box, you need to install a
Windows PostScript Definition (WPD) file for the printer. To do this,
use the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer Setup command
in Print Manager and select Install Unlisted Or Updated Printer in the
List Of Printers box.

Windows version 3.1 requires an OEMSETUP.INF file to install the WPD
file. Insert the Windows and MS-DOS disk that contains this file into
drive A, and then follow the instructions for setting up a printer.
For more information about installing a printer, see Chapter 6, "Print
Manager," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide. If you have a WPD
file created for Windows version 3.0, you do not need an OEMSETUP.INF
file.

4.3  Printing a PostScript Print File in UNIX

The PostScript printer driver inserts a CTRL+D key combination at the
beginning of every print job to reset the printer. Because UNIX
systems recognize CTRL+D as an end-of-file character, any print files
you create by using the PostScript printer driver do not print in
UNIX. You can correct this problem by removing the CTRL+D key
combination from the print job. To do this, add the following setting
to the [ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName
is the name of your PostScript printer model):

CtrlD=0

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

4.4  Printing TrueType Fonts in Place of Other Fonts on a
PostScript Printer

In most cases, the PostScript printer driver can evaluate the fonts in
your document and determine whether to use the Windows TrueType fonts,
the fonts built into your printer, or downloaded soft fonts.

In some cases, the printer driver can use either the Windows TrueType
fonts or the printer fonts, as in the following examples:

  You are using a True Image printer that includes built-in TrueType
fonts that have the same name as the Windows TrueType fonts, such as
Times New Roman.

   You want to print a document in Windows version 3.1 that was
created by using Windows version 3.0, and the document contains a font
that is no longer supported, such as Tms Rmn. In this case, the
closest matching printer font is Times, and the closest matching
Windows font is Times New Roman, and both are acceptable for printing.

If the driver can use either the Windows TrueType fonts or the printer
fonts, it uses the printer fonts by default. If you want the driver to
use the Windows TrueType fonts instead, add the following setting to
the [ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is
the name of your PostScript printer model):

ttfavor=&lt;1&gt;

To use the printer fonts again, set this value to 0.

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

4.5  Controlling TrueType Font Downloading on PostScript
Printers

When setting printer options for a PostScript printer, you can specify
that TrueType fonts be downloaded as Adobe Type 1 fonts. You do this
by using the Send To Printer As option in the Advanced Options dialog
box for the PostScript printer driver. This setting causes smaller
TrueType fonts to be printed as bitmaps and larger TrueType fonts to
be printed as outline fonts.

By using the MinOutlineEppem setting in the WIN.INI file, you can
specify (in the number of points per em) exactly when TrueType fonts
should be printed as bitmaps and when they should be printed as
outline fonts. To do this, add the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):

minoutlineeppem=&lt;number&gt;

The default value for number of points per em is 101. Fonts whose
points per em are fewer than the number you specify are downloaded as
bitmaps. Fonts whose points per em are greater are downloaded as
outline fonts. To conserve printer memory, decrease the value. To
produce high-quality printed fonts at larger point sizes, increase the
value. Increasing the value also speeds up printing time but requires
more memory.

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

4.6  Setting the Timeout for PostScript Printers

Some PostScript printers require a high timeout value in order to
print complex documents. If you selected the Print PostScript Error
Information check box in the Advanced Options dialog box when you
configured your printer and your printer is printing timeout messages,
try increasing the printer's timeout value. To specify the timeout
value for your printer, add the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section in the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):

  timeout=&lt;number-of-seconds&gt;

For example, if you want to set the printer timeout to 10 minutes on
an Apple LaserWriter IINT connected to LPT1, you would add the
following setting to the [Apple LaserWriter IINT,LPT1] section of the
WIN.INI file:

  timeout=600

Note: The timeout setting and the Timeouts options in the Printer
Connect dialog box are unrelated. The timeout setting specifies the
timeout value for your printer, whereas the Timeouts options in the
Printer Connect dialog box specify the timeouts for Windows.

For more information about configuring your printer and setting
Timeouts options for Windows, see Chapter 6, "Print Manager," in the
Microsoft Windows User's Guide. For more information about editing the
WIN.INI file, see the WININI.WRI online document.

4.7  Rotating EPS Files When Printing in Landscape Mode

If the placement or orientation of imported images (such as EPS files)
is incorrect when printing in landscape mode from an application that
supports imported files, try adding the following setting to the
[ModelName,Port] section of the WIN.INI file (where ModelName is the
name of your PostScript printer model):

LandScapeOrient=270

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

4.8  Using Pheonix PostScript-Compatible Printers or Cartridges

If you are using a Phoenix-compatible PostScript printer or cartridge
you may encounter problems when printing TrueType fonts. For example,
random characters may print in your documents. To correct this
problem, select Bitmap (Type 3) for the Send To Printer As option in
the Advanced Options dialog box for the PostScript printer driver. For
more information about setting printing options, see Chapter 6, "Print
Manager," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

5.0  Notes About Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and PCL Printers and Plotters

This section contains information specific to printing on Hewlett-
Packard, Canon, and PCL printers and plotters.

5.1  Configuring Memory on PCL Printers

If you are using a PCL printer, you may want to configure printer
memory to reserve a portion of it for permanently downloaded fonts or
macros. To do this, you can add two settings to the [HPPCL,Ports]
section of your WIN.INI file:

  MemReserve=&lt;kilobytes&gt; specifies the amount of total printer memory
that is reserved. For example, if you are using permanently downloaded
soft fonts that occupy 300K of memory, you can add MemReserve=300 to
your WIN.INI file. You do not need to add this setting if you use the
Font Installer program provided with Windows to download your fonts.
In this case, the printer driver can automatically detect how much
memory is taken up by the fonts.

 ResetPrinter=&lt;0, 1, 2&gt; specifies when the driver should reset
printer memory. If the value is 0, the driver resets printer memory
when the amount of memory available for printing (the total amount
less the value for MemReserve) is low. If the value is 1, the driver
resets printer memory after printing each page. If the value is 2, the
driver never resets printer memory. In most cases, a value of 0 works,
providing that the value for MemReserve is accurate. If you are
printing a large document that contains complex graphics, you may want
to specify a value of 1.

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

5.2  Simulating Bold Type on PCL Printers

The Windows version 3.1 PCL driver no longer simulates bold for a font
that does not include a bold font style. For example, if you use a
cartridge or soft font in your application that includes only a
regular font style and then format text as bold, the text prints in
the regular font style on a PCL printer.

5.3  Printing from PageMaker Versions 3.x to a PCL Printer

Aldus PageMaker version 3.x expects a text band to be sent if you are
printing to a PCL printer. If you are using a 3.x version of
PageMaker, you need to add the following line to the [HPPCL,Port]
section of your WIN.INI file in order to print successfully:

  ForceTextBand=1

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

5.4  Using the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIIsi in PostScript Mode

If you are using a LaserJet IIIsi printer in PostScript mode, make
sure the PRT PS ERRS option on your printer panel's menu is turned off
(this is the factory-default setting), unless you are writing
PostScript programs and need error information for debugging. If this
option is on, your print jobs pause and a message appears on your
printer's panel each time a PostScript error is encountered. In most
cases, your documents still print, but the printing process is
interrupted.

5.5  Using Intellifont for Windows Version 1.0 with Hewlett- Packard
LaserJet III Printers

If you install Intellifont for Windows version 1.0 after setting up
Windows version 3.1, you must reinstall the LaserJet III printer
driver by using the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer
Setup command in Print Manager. The installation program for
Intellifont for Windows installs an earlier version of the LaserJet
III printer driver. This driver does not work correctly with Windows
version 3.1.

5.6  Using the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 Printer Driver\177

If you are using the HP DeskJet 500 printer driver provided by
Hewlett-Packard with the HP DeskJet 500 printer, you need to adjust
the resolution setting to print at 300 dpi. To do this, first try
adjusting the resolution setting in the printer setup dialog box by
using the Printers option in Control Panel or the Printer Setup
command in Print Manager. If this doesn't work, add the following line
to the [DJ500,Port] section of your WIN.INI file:

  prtresfac=0

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

5.7  Printing Envelopes in Word for Windows Version 2.0  on a Hewlett-
Packard DeskJet 500 Printer

If you are using the DeskJet 500 printer driver provided with Windows,
you may encounter difficulties when using Word for Windows version 2.0
to print envelopes on a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 printer. To
correct the problem, do the following:

1.  In Word for Windows, choose the Options command from the Tools
   menu.

2.  In the Category list, select the Win.ini button.

3.  In the Option box, type hpdskjet

4.  In the Setting box, type +1

5.  Choose the Close button.

You can also add the following line to the [Microsoft Word 2.0]
section of your WIN.INI file:

  hpdskjet=+1

For more information about editing the WIN.INI file, see the
WININI.WRI online document.

5.8  Printing Windows Version 3.0 Documents on Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet III Printers

If you are using a LaserJet III printer and find that the documents
you created when using Windows version 3.0 are printing differently
when you are using Windows version 3.1, change the Resolution option
to 75 dpi in the printer setup dialog box, and then try printing
again.

5.9  Printing TrueType Fonts on Canon Series II and III Laser Printers

The Canon series II and III laser printers do not support incremental
downloading of TrueType fonts. To print TrueType fonts by using one of
these printers, you must select the Enable TrueType Fonts check box in
the printer setup dialog box for the printer. This option supports the
printing of TrueType fonts on these printers by printing them as
graphics. This check box is selected by default when a Canon series II
or III printer is installed.

If the Enable TrueType Fonts check box is not selected, TrueType fonts
cannot be printed on these printers and are not available in your
Windows applications; only printer and plotter fonts are available.
For more information about setting printer options, see Chapter 6,
"Print Manager," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

5.10  Printing Graphics on a Canon Bubble-Jet BJ-10e or BJ-130e

If you are printing in 360x360 dpi graphics mode and part of the
graphics images in your documents are missing, make sure the DIP
switch to control graphics image density is set to HIGH.

5.11  Adjusting Hewlett-Packard Plotter Margins

If you are using one of the plotters in the following list, you can
probably correct margin problems by experimenting with the margin
settings in your application and by turning on the Expand switch on
your plotter:

  HP 7580 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
  HP 7585 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
  HP DraftPro DXL, EXL (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
  DraftMaster I, II (front panel selection)

Turning on the Expand switch increases the plotting area by setting
the outer margins to the area under the grid wheels. However, this
might decrease plot quality.

6.0  Notes About Additional Printers and Font Packages

This section contains information specific to font packages and
printing on dot-matrix, 24-pin, Epson, and IBM printers.

6.1  Feeding Paper on Fujitsu Dot-Matrix Printers

The manual-feed option is not supported on Fujitsu dot-matrix
printers. All paper is automatically fed to the printer from the
roller.

6.2  Printing to an IBM Personal Pageprinter, Using the EPT Port

For best results, use the IBM Personal Pageprinter Adapter Program
version 1.3.1 or later.

If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode and want to print to
an IBM Personal Pageprinter assigned to the EPT port, you must set the
LPT1 device contention to never issue a warning. Standard mode does
not require special settings. For more information about setting
device-contention options, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in
the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

6.3  Printing to an IBM Proprinter X24 or XL24, Epson MX-80, or
Okidata 24-Pin Printer

Because Windows Print Manager sometimes interrupts the flow of data
while printing, you might notice erratic output if you are using an
IBM Proprinter X24 or XL24, an Epson MX-80, or an Okidata 24-pin dot-
matrix printer when Print Manager is active. These printers cannot
accommodate interruptions in data flow. To solve this problem, try
deactivating Print Manager.

If you still have problems after deactivating Print Manager, you can
print to a file and then send that file to your printer. To do so,
follow these steps:

1.  Using the Printer Setup command in Print Manager or the Printers
   option in Control Panel, connect to the port named FILE.

2.  Choose the Print command in your Windows application.

3.  Copy the print file to the port your printer is connected to.

For more information about activating and deactivating Print Manager
and about printing to a file, see Chapter 6, "Print Manager," in the
Microsoft Windows User's Guide. For more information about printing to
a file, see your MS-DOS documentation.

Note: This problem should not occur when printing on an IBM Proprinter
X24e or XL24e.

6.4  Using Fonts with the Epson LQ-510, LQ-850, and LQ-1050 Printers

The Epson LQ-510, LQ-850, and LQ-1050 printer drivers support the full
set of fonts found on the latest versions of these models. Earlier
versions of these printer models only support the Roman and Sans Serif
fonts.

6.5  Printing TrueType Fonts on Kyocera F-Series Printers

To print TrueType Fonts on Kyocera F-Series printers, you must select
the Print TrueType As Graphics check box in the Options dialog box
when configuring your printer. Otherwise, TrueType fonts do not print
correctly. For more information about configuring printers, see
Chapter 6, "Print Manager," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

6.6  Changing Printer Settings When Using Bitstream Facelift 1.0

With some applications, you can change the settings for your printer
on a per-page basis. If you are using the Facelift version 1.0 soft-
font package from Bitstream, you cannot use this feature when printing
multiple-page documents.

6.7  Using the Cut-Sheet Feeder on the NEC Pinwriter P7 Printer

The Paper Source option, Cut Sheet Feeder, does not work properly with
the NEC Pinwriter P7 printer. To use the cut-sheet feeder as the paper
source, you must specify a left margin of about three inches for your
document so that text prints correctly on the page.
