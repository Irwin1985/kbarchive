-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The BELL and SNAP TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) sample programs that ship
with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b are not
correct. Because of the errors in this program, other programs that are executed
after the BELL or SNAP TSR program has been installed may hang the computer.

CAUSE
=====

Because of the segment ordering and the way memory is released when the BELL or
SNAP TSR program goes resident, the BeepCount variable is being freed. Because
this variable is changed in the interrupt service routine (ISR), any program
that is run after the BELL or SNAP TSR program has gone resident may have its
memory corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To keep BeepCount from being released when BELL.EXE or SNAP.EXE terminates and
goes resident, use one of the following solutions:

- Change the class of the installcode segment so the segments are ordered
  correctly. In INSTALL.ASM and HANDLERS.ASM, a segment named installcode is
  declared with class CODE2, and is grouped inside DGROUP. Because both the
  assembler and linker treat class CODE2 the same as class CODE, and BELL.C and
  SNAP.C use .DOSSEG segment ordering, this code segment is placed prior to the
  data segments in DGROUP. If this segment is placed after the _DATA segment,
  where BeepCount is stored, the problem does not occur. To order the segments
  differently, change the class of installcode to class CODE2 in both
  INSTALL.ASM and HANDLERS.ASM. Class CODE2 is not treated the same as class
  CODE so the installcode segment will not be considered a code segment.

-or-

- Move BeepCount so that it isn't released when the BELL or SNAP TSR program
  terminates and goes resident. This can be accomplished by changing the
  declaration of BeepCount in BELL.C or SNAP.C to the following:

     int _based("CODE") BeepCount = 1;

  This will move BeepCount into the code segment where it will not be returned
  to MS-DOS. (Compile this code with Microsoft C version 6.0 or later.)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, and
6.0b. This problem was corrected in MASM for MS-DOS version 6.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In MASM 6.0, this program also generates the run-time error:

  R6001 - null pointer assignment

This particular problem was corrected in MASM 6.0a and 6.0b by stubbing out the
function that checked for null pointer assignments. The R6001 error also occurs
because of segment ordering and can be corrected with the first solution above.
