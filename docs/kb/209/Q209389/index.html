The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Web-based password change utility that is included in
Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, the system may prompt you for a new
password. However, you cannot successfully change your password.

CAUSE
=====

When you install IIS, the passwordchangeflags parameter is set to a default
value of 0. This value causes the system to prompt for a password when you try
to use the Web-based password change utility.

For this utility to work correctly, the passwordchangeflags parameter's default
value must be changed in the metabase.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps.

NOTE: For the following procedure to work, Windows Scripting Host must be
installed on your computer.

1. Change the IIS directory setting to the following:

  \%windir%\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples

2. Type the following:

  cscript adsutil.vbs set w3svc/&lt;1&gt;/passwordchangeflags &lt;value&gt;

NOTE: &lt;1&gt; represents the Web site on which this change is to occur. You may
have to set this parameter multiple times if multiple Web sites are involved.

3. The following values are possible settings for the passwordchangeflags
  parameter:

   - Value 0 (default): Requires that the password change utility reside over a
     Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection.

   - Value 1: Removes the requirement for SSL.

   - Value 2: Disables password change notification.

   - Value 4: Disables advance notification of password change.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IIS online documentation states the following:

  Notifying Clients of Password Status: You can set properties in the metabase,
  which will notify a client when his or her password has expired or is about
  to expire. This feature also gives the client the opportunity to change the
  password at the time of the notification, or to continue with the original
  request. These metabase properties are used to configure the implementation
  of the feature.

  NOTE: Administrators do not have to set any of these properties for this
  feature to work. These properties are automatically set in the metabase
  during IIS setup.

  The following metabase properties control this feature. PasswordChangeFlags
  specifies the flags that control password expiration and password change
  processing between the server and client. The default value of 0 indicates
  that a password change is not permitted on an unsecured (that is, non-SSL)
  channel. A value of 1 indicates that a password change is permitted on an
  unsecured channel. A value of 2 indicates that password change notification
  is disabled. A value of 4 indicates that advance notification of password
  change is disabled.
