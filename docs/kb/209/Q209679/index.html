The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Word 97 to open a Microsoft Word 2000 document [or a version of the
document that has been saved in Rich Text Format (*.rtf)] that contains
different font colors, the font colors do not appear as expected.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of the different way that each program handles
color palettes. Word 2000 supports 24-bit RGB color, but Word 97 supports 16-bit
color and has a limit of 50 RGB colors. Thus, colors that are similar to each
other in Word 2000 are translated to a single color in Word 97.

For example, the font color Dark Green is translated to Green when a Word 2000
document is opened in Word 97. However, when a Rich Text Format version of the
same Word 2000 document is opened in Word 97, the Dark Green font color is
translated to Black.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are sharing your documents with Word 97 users, try using primary colors.

MORE INFORMATION
================
