-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Network programs tend to use a lot of lower memory. If you have sufficient space
for the programs in UMBs (upper memory blocks), you can achieve substantial
memory savings. The following sections describe how to load some of the major
networks into UMBs. If your network is not listed here, please contact your
network vendor for information on how to load the network into a UMB.

NOTE: It is assumed in all of the following sections that you have read the
"Running Programs in the Upper Memory Area" section in the version 5.0
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

MORE INFORMATION
================

MS-NET Based Networks
---------------------

Most MS-NET based redirectors are loaded with the NET command. Look in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file (or other file that you use to start the network) for a
command similar to the following:

     net start &lt;other&gt;

where &lt;other&gt; is other text following START. Add the word LOADHIGH to the
beginning of the line, as follows:

     loadhigh net start &lt;other&gt;

Reboot your computer and check to make sure that the network loads without
problems. You can use the MEM command to see how much memory you now have
available.

LAN Manager 1.x/2.x Based Redirectors
-------------------------------------

These redirectors are of two types: basic and enhanced. If you start the network
with the command "NET START WORKSTATION," you are running the enhanced version.
If you start the redirector with a command similar to "NET START RDR," you are
running the basic version. Look in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file (or other file that
you use to start the network) to see which command is used.

LAN Manager 1.x/2.x Basic Redirectors
-------------------------------------

These redirectors will often fit into a UMB. To load them high, add the word
LOADHIGH before the NET START command:

     loadhigh net start &lt;other&gt;

Reboot your computer and check to make sure that the network loads without
problems. You can use the MEM command to see how much memory you now have
available.

LAN Manager 1.x/2.x Enhanced Redirectors
----------------------------------------

Best memory savings with LAN Manager enhanced redirectors (versions 2.0b and
earlier) is achieved by instructing the network to use LIM memory.

1. Use the RAM option on EMM386 to specify that both UMB and EMS memory be
  provided. For example, if the line to load EMM386.EXE is

        device=c:\dos\emm386.exe 1024

  then change the line to the following:

        device=c:\dos\emm386.exe 1024 ram

2. Locate the LANMAN.INI file by typing the following at the MS-DOS prompt:

  " c:
  cd \
  dir /s /b lanman.ini " (without the quotation marks)

  If more than one LANMAN.INI file is found, use the one that appears first in
  the PATH (use the PATH command to see the path).

3. Edit the LANMAN.INI file. For example, if the file is in C:\LM.DOS, then use
  the following command:

        edit c:\lm.dos\lanman.ini

  This command invokes the MS-DOS Editor.

4. Use the SEARCH command to find the LIM option (ALT+S means hold down the ALT
  key while pressing S):

  " ALT+S F " (without the quotation marks)

  A dialog box asking to "Find What" will be displayed. Type "LIM" (without the
  quotation marks) and press ENTER.

5. If the line has a semicolon (;) at the beginning, remove the semicolon.
  Ensure that the line now reads:

        lim = yes

LAN Manager 2.0c
----------------

Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.0c is the first version of LAN Manager with the
ability to load itself high with Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0. The LAN Manager
2.0c redirector is loaded high automatically if there is enough room in the
upper memory area (UMA). Other network services can be loaded high using the
MS-DOS LOADHIGH (LH) command.

Loading Novell Networks into UMBs
---------------------------------

When you start your network, specify LOADHIGH before the Novell startup command.
For example, if you are using NET5.EXE to start Novell, add LOADHIGH before
NET5.
