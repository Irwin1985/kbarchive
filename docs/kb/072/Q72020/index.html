SUMMARY
=======

There are three stroke (or vector) fonts packaged with Windows versions 3.0 and
3.1 and Windows NT: Roman, Script, and Modern. These fonts are marked as
belonging to the OEM character set when, in fact, they belong to the ANSI
character set.

NOTE: Windows 95 provides only the Modern vector font. The Roman and Script fonts
are included in the True Type fonts shipped with the system.

The OEM character set is the character set used by the hardware device on which
Windows is running (for example, the IBM PC). The IBM PC OEM character set and
ANSI character set are listed in "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
Reference Volume 2" for the Windows SDK version 3.0 and in "Programmer's
Reference, Volume 3: Messages, Structures, and Macros" for the Windows SDK
version 3.1.

The fonts were marked in this manner for two reasons. First, in previous versions
of Windows, the stroke fonts did include non-ANSI characters. Second, mismarking
the character set ensures proper font mapping. The character-set attribute of a
font is assigned a very high penalty weight in the font mapping scheme. If
stroke fonts were not marked as using the OEM character set, a stroke font might
be chosen by the font mapper [during a SelectObject() call] instead of a raster
font when a requested raster font size is not available. This behavior occurs
because most raster fonts belong to the ANSI character set, character size has
much lower penalty weight than character set, and stroke fonts can be scaled to
any desired size. Some raster fonts can be scaled; however, they can be scaled
only to specific sizes.
