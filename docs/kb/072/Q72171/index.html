SUMMARY
=======

All MS-DOS environment variables are limited by the COMMAND.COM input buffer
length of 128 characters, including the PATH. The figure 128 includes an
end-of-variable character, the variable name, and the = (equal) sign. Therefore,
PATH actually has only 122 characters to hold the directories you want
COMMAND.COM to search. This limit cannot be expanded.

The following are some techniques to get the most use out of those 122
characters:

- Use "C:" instead of "C:\".

- Eliminate unneeded directories from your PATH.

- Use short directory names.

- Create batch files that modify the PATH as necessary.

- Create batch files that execute programs.

- Eliminate drive letters in the PATH.

- Reduce the number of directories.

- Substitute drive letters for directories with SUBST.

- Use third party terminate-and-stay-resident "PATH extenders."

- Replace COMMAND.COM with another command interpreter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. If you want MS-DOS to search the root directory of a drive, omit the \
  (backslash) by typing the following command:

  " path c:" (without the quotation marks)

  This causes MS-DOS to search C:\ regardless of the current directory of C.

  NOTE: This does not mean removing the "\" from all directories in the PATH
  command, only from the single reference to the root directory.

2. Eliminate unneeded directories from your PATH. Many applications
  automatically add their directories to the PATH, whether you want them there
  or not. In addition, when a PATH is very long, the search time to find items
  becomes quite lengthy because MS-DOS must search all the directories in the
  PATH.

  You may need to change directories to run applications not in the PATH.

3. Use short directory names. This may require renaming directories, which can
  be done with the MS-DOS Shell and many third-party utility packages.

  Short directory names tend to be more cryptic and difficult to remember. Also,
  some applications (notably menu programs) save directory information for
  future use and may even require reinstallation to be able to use another
  directory.

  NOTE: Do NOT rename a directory when any program is using any files in that
  directory. For this reason, it is best to exit from all applications and/or
  multitasking and task switching software, such as Windows, before renaming
  directories.

4. Set up a series of batch files that set up the path depending on your current
  needs. One way to do this is to have a BASEPATH.BAT file, which sets a
  minimal or basic path, and then to have other batch files that modify this
  basic path. Another way is to have a batch file save the current PATH, set a
  new one, and then restore the previous PATH. For more information, query on
  the following words:

  saving and old and path

  However, you must invest time and effort in making and maintaining the batch
  file system.

5. Batch files can also be used to change to the appropriate subdirectory,
  execute the program desired, and change back. For more information, see the
  descriptions of creating a menu system with batch files as described in
  "Supercharging MS-DOS" by Van Wolverton, and in the Microsoft Quick Reference
  book "MS-DOS Batch Files" by Kris Jamsa. Both of these are published by
  Microsoft Press.

  However, you must invest time and effort in making and maintaining the batch
  file system.

6. If you primarily use only one logical drive for most of your activity, do not
  add the drive specification for each path entry. For example, if you are
  primarily using drive C, and your path used to be the following

      set path=c:\bin;c:\dos;c:\win;c:\util

  you could shorten it to the following:

      set path=\bin;\dos;\win;\util

  NOTES:

  Removing drive letters from your path creates problems with shared
  applications in Windows. (Some shared applications do not run.)

  This method will only work while your active drive is drive C. If you move to
  drive A, MS-DOS will look for the path entry on the A drive. This can cause
  the MS-DOS search to work incorrectly.

  For example, the PATH was edited to include \WIN, instead of C:\WIN, and the
  command WIN was typed at the C prompt:

  " C:\&gt;win" (without the quotation marks)

  MS-DOS would find and run C:\WIN\WIN.COM. But this would not be true if the
  command was typed at the A prompt:

  " A:\&gt;win" (without the quotation marks)

  This would result in a "Bad command or file name error" because MS-DOS would
  be searching for A:\WIN\WIN.COM.

7. Group path entries together, moving executable files from more than one path
  entry into a single directory. For example, if you use several utility
  packages, you might want to group them into C:\UTIL instead of C:\NORTON,
  C:\PCTOOLS, and C:\SK.

  NOTE: This may make it harder to organize your drive.

8. The SUBST command can be used to substitute a drive letter for a directory.
  (If drive letters past E are used, it may be necessary to add or modify the
  LASTDRIVE= statement in CONFIG.SYS.) The following commands demonstrate how
  this is used:

      C:\dos\subst i: c:\util
      C:\dos\subst j: c:\c600a
      path c:\dos;i:;i:\bats;i:\nu;j:\binb;j:\binr;j:\binp;

  These lines could be in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or in a SETPATH.BAT file, which
  could then be called as needed.

  Because SUBST disguises the real directory structure, it can cause problems
  for some applications and some DOS utilities. For example, you cannot remove
  a SUBSTituted directory or FORMAT a SUBSTituted drive.

  NOTE: SUBST should not be active when Microsoft Windows is being installed. To
  display any SUBSTituted directories, type "SUBST" (without the quotation
  marks) at the prompt with no parameters:

      C:\&gt;subst
      I: =&gt; C:\util
      J: =&gt; C:\c600a

  To deactivate the SUBST command for these directories, type the following:

  " C:\&gt;SUBST I: /D
  C:\&gt;SUBST J: /D" (without the quotation marks)

  For more information on SUBST and Windows, query on the following words:

  SUBST and join and Windows and problems

9. There are third party "PATH extenders" that fool COMMAND.COM into using a
  longer PATH. Some are shareware and/or public domain.

  Drawback: These programs may be dependent on particular MS-DOS versions and
  may interfere with applications that expect a maximum PATH of 128 characters.

10. Finally, as the 128-character limit is a limitation of the command
  interpreter, COMMAND.COM, the limit can be bypassed entirely by not using
  COMMAND.COM. MS-DOS version 2.00 introduced support for using an alternate
  command interpreter (or "shell") with the CONFIG.SYS SHELL= command.

  A third-party command interpreter called NDOS is supplied with Norton
  Utilities version 6, along with a NDOS manual. NDOS is compatible with
  MS_DOS 5.0. The path limit for NDOS is 244 characters. For more information,
  contact:

  Symantec, Peter Norton Group
  10201 Torre Avenue
  Cupertino, Ca. 95014-2132
  (408) 253-9600

  A third-party choice is the product 4DOS, by J.P. Software, which has a 256
  character environment variable limit. For more information, contact:

  J.P. Software
  P.O. 1470
  East Arlington, MA 02174
  (617) 646-3975

  Drawback: 4DOS and other command interpreters may not work with all
  applications or all MS-DOS versions.

All MS-DOS environment variables are limited by the COMMAND.COM input buffer
length of 128 characters. The PATH statement and other environment variables
cannot exceed 127 characters, including spaces. The total length of the
statement is 128 bytes; however, the 128th is reserved for an "End-Of-String"
NULL byte.
