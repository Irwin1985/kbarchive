SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows graphical environment creates and stores objects on behalf
of each application in the system. Two places store many of these objects, the
user heap and the graphics device interface (GDI) heap, each one limited to 64K.
This article discusses the objects, their size, and how to maximize the use of
the heaps.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A good way to see what is stored in the heaps is to use the Heap Walker tool
(HEAPWALK.EXE) provided with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK). Heap Walker is documented in Chapter 11 of the SDK Tools manual for
Windows 3.0 and in Chapter 9 of the SDK Programming Tools manual for Windows
3.1. The memory management practices of Windows are documented in Chapters 15
and 16 of the SDK Guide to Programming for Windows 3.0. Further information on
Windows memory management is available in Charles Petzold's "Programming
Windows" (Microsoft Press) and in Peter Norton and Paul Yao's "Windows 3.0 Power
Programming Techniques" (Bantam Computer Books).

The following table lists the objects stored in the user heap and the typical
sizes for these items:

  Object          Size in Bytes
  ------          -------------
  Menu            20 + 20 per menu item
  Window Class    40 to 50
  Window          60 to 70

Note that every running program requires space in the user heap. Every
application must use this shared resource wisely. One technique to reduce heap
requirements is through the judicious use of resources. For example, static
strings should be placed into a string table instead of being stored as string
variables. If a group of applications shares a common set of resources, place
the resources into a dynamic-link library (DLL). Multiple applications can share
one copy of code, data, and resources through a DLL.

Another way to reduce heap requirements is through the use of class extra bytes
and window extra bytes. Although these bytes are stored on the user heap, each
is associated with a particular window or window class. These bytes are
convenient places to store a handle to a data structure that has been allocated
from global memory.

Menus are, by far, the biggest consumer of user heap space. Applications that
have multiple menu bars or create menus with the TrackPopupMenu() API should
load these resources only as needed and destroy them after use, instead of
waiting for program termination. In Windows 3.1, user stores menus in a separate
64K heap.

When an application creates a GDI object, Windows allocates space from the GDI
heap. While most applications create GDI objects, an application should not
create too many objects at one time. Also, each object must be destroyed when it
is no longer required by the application. The following table lists the objects
stored in the GDI heap and their typical sizes:

  Object              Size in Bytes
  ------              -------------
  Brush               32
  Bitmap              28 to 32
  Device Context (DC) 300
  Font                40 to 44
  Pen                 28
  Region              28
  Palette             28

Items are created in the GDI heap whenever an application creates a GDI object.
Most applications create GDI objects, but an application should not create too
many objects at one time. Also, an object must be destroyed when it is no longer
required by the application.

The maximum number of windows that can be open simultaneously is constrained by
the amount of space remaining in the user heap. As noted above, the user and GDI
heaps are each limited to 64K.

Because heap space is shared among all running applications, an application must
check the value returned from each function call to verify that memory
allocations are successful. The debugging version of Windows produces a
FatalExit message when an application uses an invalid handle. This information
is difficult to obtain from any other source.
