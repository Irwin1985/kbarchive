-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 will incorrectly parse a
comment as if it were a conditional-assembly directive if the following
conditions are met:

1. There is a conditional-assembly directive (or word that is the same as a
  conditional directive) inside a comment block that does not directly follow
  the delimiter character and is the first thing on the line.

2. The comment block itself is contained in a conditional-assembly block, which
  will NOT be evaluated by the assembler.

CAUSE
=====

When both of these conditions are true, the conditional-assembly directive is
given precedence over the comment block. The conditional directive is treated as
a keyword although it was not meant to be treated as such.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, make sure that the first word on the line inside the
comment block is not the same as a conditional directive. For example, in the
sample code, one solution is to change the line "If should be ignored in a
comment" to "An if should be ignored in a comment."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 6.0. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 6.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the conditional-assembly directive is either IF, IFE, IFB, IFNB, IFDEF,
IFNDEF, IFIDN, or IFDIF and there is no associated ENDIF at the beginning of
another line, then the following errors will be generated:

  error A2088 : END directive required at end of file
  fatal error : A1010 : unmatched block nesting : if-else

If the conditional-assembly directive is ELSE, then the following error is
generated:

  error A2008 : syntax error : &lt;the text following the ELSE&gt;

If the conditional-assembly directive is ELSEIF, then the following errors are
generated:

  error A2008 : syntax error
  error A2081 : missing operand after unary operator

If the conditional-assembly directive is ENDIF, then the following errors are
generated

  error A2008 : syntax error
  error A2044 : invalid character in file

where the invalid character referred to is the closing delimiter.

The sample code below illustrates this problem. It meets the above conditions, so
it is parsed incorrectly and the following errors are generated:

  error A2088 : END directive required at end of file
  fatal error : A1010 : unmatched block nesting : if-else

Sample Code
-----------

  ; Assemble options needed: none

  .MODEL small

  .STACK 4096
  .CODE
      .startup

  IFDEF   xyz                ; xyz is not defined

  COMMENT ^
          If should be ignored in this comment.
     ^
  ENDIF

      .exit 0
  END
