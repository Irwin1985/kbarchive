The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
- Microsoft Outlook 2002

SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to automate Microsoft Outlook 2002 to
programmatically send e-mail messages from Visual FoxPro (VFP) 7.0 and have
those messages saved in a folder other than the Sent Items folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

VFP developers often write applications that perform bulk e-mail operations.
After the messages are sent, it is sometimes desirable to save the messages to a
folder other than the default Sent Items folder. In this way, the messages sent
by the application are kept separate from other messages sent through the same
client, making them easier to find later.

Although it is possible to programmatically specify a folder in which to save
your sent e-mail messages (by using the CdoPR_SENTMAIL_ENTRYID CDO constant),
the setting is ignored because the CDO (1.x) library hard-codes the value placed
in the PR_SENTMAIL_ENTRYID field to the Sent Items folder. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q192083 PRB: Setting PR_SENTMAIL_ENTRYID in CDO (1.x) Is Not Retained

You can work around this problem by using the COPYTO() method of your e-mail
message object to relocate the message to a folder of your choice before it is
sent.

The sample code below makes a copy of the message before it is sent, as opposed
to moving or copying the message after it is sent. We do this because Outlook
messages are typically not sent instantly; they may sit in the Outlook Outbox
for a short time. As a result, code running in a loop that relies on a message
being located in the default Sent Items folder may fail.

The only drawback to this approach is that you will have a copy of the message in
your alternate Sent Items folder even if the message was not successfully sent.
This is not a major drawback, however, because people most often wish to retain
sent messages for reference, not as proof of delivery.

NOTE: This code was written and tested with VFP 7.0. With slight modification, it
will work with any version of VFP. It was tested with Outlook 2002 from
Microsoft Office XP, but should also work with Office 2000.

The VFP 7.0 code below will:

1. Log on to MAPI.SESSION.

2. Compose a new e-mail message.

3. Scan your message store(s) for the ID of the folder that you specify as your
  alternate Sent Items folder.

4. Copy the in-progress message to your alternate Sent Items folder and then
  send the message.

To use this sample code, follow these steps:

1. Open Outlook, create a new folder, and name it "My Sent Items". You can
  create the folder as a subfolder in any message store that you like.

2. Copy the code below to a new program in VFP 7.0.

3. Save and then run the program.

  * ABSTRACT: This sample code sends an e-mail message to the address
  *           you specify. It then saves this message to a folder other
  *           than the default Sent Items Outlook folder.
  *
  *           To use this code, create a new folder in Outlook named
  *           "My Sent Items". You can later rename this folder to anything
  *           you like, provided that you change the 1st #DEFINE
  *           below accordingly.
