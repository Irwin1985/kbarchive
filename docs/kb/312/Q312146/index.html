MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 154: Changes Regarding Transitive Trusts
---------------------------------------------

On page 154, in the third paragraph, change the second sentence from:

"Transitive trusts are always two-way."

To:
"Transitive trusts are always two-way, and support pass-through authentication."


Page 154: Changes Regarding Transitive Trusts
---------------------------------------------

On page 154, in the third paragraph, change all the text after the third line:
"However, transitive trusts don't enter the picture..." through to the end of the
paragraph.

To:
"Transitive trusts become available once a domain is upgraded to Active
Directory. Despite some confusion over the matter, they do operate in mixed mode
domains, but do not apply to remaining Windows NT domains in your company, or to
clients connected to Windows NT BDC's. Explicit one-way trusts are also
available between Active Directory based domains, but they must be manually
established."


Page 154: Changes Regarding Transitive Trusts
---------------------------------------------

On page 154, in the "Real World: Whom Do You Trust?" box, change all text after
the first sentence, beginning with "The question of transitive trusts arises in
large multidomained enterprises...",

To:
"Windows 2000 DC's automatically make use of transitive trusts when communicating
with other Windows 2000 DC's even in mixed mode. The existing trusts remain in
place for use by Windows NT BDC's until the domain is switched to native mode.
Trusts that you add to or from Windows NT domains will be nontransitive trusts
that you explicitly and deliberately set. This means that if you are creating a
new Windows 2000 domain, you will have to manually create trusts with existing
Windows NT domains."


Page 155: Incorrect Items In Table 7-1
--------------------------------------

On page 155, in Table 7-1, first row, change:

"Windows 2000 Domain (same forest)"
To:
"Active Directory Domain (same forest)"

Change:
"Windows 2000 Domain (different forest)"
To:
"Active Directory Domain (different forest)"

In the 3rd row, change:
"Windows 2000 Domain"
To:
"Active Directory Domain"

Change:
"Two-way transitive trust only"
To:
"Two-way transitive trust"


Page 162: Changes To Single-Master Domain Model Section
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 162, in the second paragraph, third line, change the following sentence:
"If the company has a centralized network structure, you might want to consider
restructuring the domains into a single domain after you?ve upgraded the domain
and switched to native mode."

To:
"If the company has a centralized network structure, you might want to consider
restructuring the domains into a single domain after you?ve upgraded the domains
to Active Directory."


Page 162: Incorrect Statement About OU's
----------------------------------------

On page 162, in the third paragraph, change the third sentence from:
"You can use OU's to create a detailed network structure without the necessity of
dealing with trusts (although switching to native mode will eliminate most of
the hassle of managing trust relationships)."

To:
"You can use OU's to create a detailed network structure without the necessity of
dealing with trusts."


Page 163: Changes Regarding Moving Accounts Between Transitive Trusts
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 163, first paragraph, seventh line down, change the following sentence
from:
"You should wait, however, until the network has been converted to Windows 2000
native mode before moving the accounts because transitive trusts make moving
accounts between domains much easier, and this type of trust is available only
in a native-mode domain."

To:
"You should wait, however, until all relevant domains have been upgraded before
moving the accounts because transitive trusts make moving accounts between
domains much easier, and this type of trust is available only between Active
Directory domains."


Page 163: Changes Regarding Domain Upgrades
-------------------------------------------

Page 163, in the first paragraph of "Multiple-Master Domain Model," change the
following section from:
"If you choose to consolidate the domains, you should first perform the domain
upgrade just as if you were going to preserve the existing domain structure, and
then perform the domain consolidation only after upgrading the network to native
mode. After the domains are in native mode, all accounts can be moved into the
single domain without the need to reassign permissions on the objects."

To:
"If you choose to consolidate the domains, you should first perform the domain
upgrade just as if you were going to preserve the existing domain structure, and
then perform the domain consolidation. After the domains are upgraded, all
accounts can be moved into the single domain without the need to reassign
permissions on the objects."
