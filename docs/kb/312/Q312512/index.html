The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 client is discovered with Network
Discovery and installed by using a Microsoft Windows NT Remote Client
installation, any later discovery by using Network Discovery creates the
following error in the Netdisc.log on the site server:

  ADM: NtBrowser: Failed to create an anonymous connection to device
  &lt;sms-client&gt; , error &lt;0x4c3&gt;.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop, and then restart the SMS_Executive service on
the site server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q323206 SMS: List of Bugs Fixed in the Systems Management Server 2.0 SP4 HRP

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS now uses the existing connection if the anonymous connection does not work,
which is typically either the SMS Service Account or the SMS Client Remote
Installation account. The connection is made during a remote client
installation.

Also, if anonymous connections are turned off on the target computer, SMS uses
the SMS service account to connect during Network Discovery. For additional
information about a related topic, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Off

Hotfix Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Apply the fix in this article to all sites in the SMS hierarchy. After the fix is

where it was created. To install the fix, use one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

  can run the file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

2. Stop the SMS Site Component Manager, SMS Executive, and SMS SQL Monitor
  services on the site server.

3. Replace the Ad_adm.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

4. Replace the Ad_cntrl.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

5. Replace the Ad_sim.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

6. Replace the Ad_utils.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

7. Replace the Netdisc.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version of the
  file that is included with the hotfix.

8. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager, SMS Executive, Windows Management,
  and SMS SQL Monitor services.
