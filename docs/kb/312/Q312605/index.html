-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are playing Flight Simulator 2002, and you want to view the Navigation
Charts while in flight, there is no way to view the charts.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the charts cannot be viewed from within Flight
Simulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Print the Chart
-------------------------

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Browse to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Charts.

3. Double-click the chart that you want to print.

4. On the File menu, click Print.

Method 2: View the Chart in a Seperate Window
---------------------------------------------

1. With Flight Simulator running, start Windows Explorer and browse to
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Charts.

2. Double-click the chart that you want to view.

3. Tile the windows so that you can view the chart and Flight Simulator at the
  same time.

Method 3: Manually Extract Charts 
---------------------------------

The Compact installation does not install Charts. You have to extract them
manually. To do this:

NOTE: These steps assume that you have WinZip installed on your computer. To
obtain WinZip, browse to the following WinZip Computing Inc. Web site:

  http://www.winzip.com

1. Insert the Flight Simulator into the CD-ROM disk 1. Press and hold down SHIFT
  as you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK:

  "&lt;cd-rom&gt;:\Charts.cab" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

4. This opens the cab file in either Windows Compressed Folder or a program like
  WinZip.

5. Extract the charts (JPEG Files) to C:\Program Files\Microsoft
  Games\FS2002\Charts or another folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only navigation charts that are included in Flight Simulator are Jeppesen
SimCharts sample charts. For information about how to obtain the full Jeppesen
product, see the following Jeppesen Web site:

the Flight Simulator 2002 directory or in its manual. To view or download these
charts, please see the back of the Flight Simulator 2002 manual, or visit the
