-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) on a
client that is running Intranetware 4.71 or 4.8, the Spoolsv.exe utility starts
to consume a lot of memory during a hardware inventory cycle. Eventually, you
receive an error message that states that the workstation is running low on
virtual memory.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of a known issue that is caused by the Novell file,
Nwspool.dll.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, obtain and install an updated version of
Nwspool.dll, which you can obtain in following two Novell knowledge base
articles:

  Novell TID 10059191

  Novell TID 10053738

The third-party contact information included in this article is provided to help
you find the technical support you need. This contact information is subject to
change without notice. Microsoft in no way guarantees the accuracy of this
third-party contact information.

The following information is an excerpt from Novell TID 10053738:

  This issue has been addressed in NWSPOOL.DLL build 28NOV2000 or later 
  for the Novell Client 4.8 for Windows NT/2000. Currently the NWSPOOL.DLL
  28NOV2000 build for the Novell Client 4.8 for Windows NT/2000 is available
  as 250903.EXE from the Novell Support Connection file finder. Note this
  file is available as-is and is continuing to receive regression testing.

Note: In SMS SP3, the Sms_def.mof file enumerates the Win32_VideoController class
by default to enable hardware inventory to capture video card information for
all multiple-video card clients. If you need to resolve this issue to upgrade
your Nwspool.dll file, disable the Win32_VideoController class within the
Sms_def.mof file, which you can find on the site server prior to the Nwspool.dll
upgrade.

You can find the Sms_def.mof file in the Sms\Inboxes\Clifiles.src\Hinv folder on
the site server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the Sms_def.mof file, use the Mofman.exe utility that is included in
the Support.exe bundle in SMS SP2, or make the following modifications by using
a text editor, such as NotePad:

To Use Mofman.exe
-----------------

1. Make a backup copy of your present Sms_def.mof file.

2. Run the Mofman utility.

3. Open the Sms_def.mof file, which you can find in the
  Sms\Inboxes\Clifiles.src\Hinv folder on the site server.

4. Expand \\root\\cimv2\\sms.

5. Scroll down to Win32_VideoController and then click it once.

6. After it is selected, click No next to Report.

7. Save the file.

To Make the Changes in NotePad
------------------------------

1. Make a backup copy of your present Sms_def.mof file.

2. In NotePad, open the Sms_def.mof file.

3. Search for Win32_VideoController.

4. Four lines above Win32_VideoController, you see an SMS_REPORT statement;
  change the TRUE value to FALSE.

5. Save the file. The modified section should look like the following sample:

  [SMS_Report(false),
  SMS_Group_Name("Video Controller"),
  ResID(7200),ResDLL("SMS_RXPL.dll"),
  SMS_Class_ID("MICROSOFT|VIDEO_CONTROLLER|1.0")]
  class Win32_VideoController : SMS_Class_Template

6. Run the following command from a command prompt in the
  Sms\Inboxes\Clifiles\Hinv path to check the integrity of the changes:

  mofcomp -check sms_def.mof
