SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to recover data from an online backup of your
Exchange Server computer.

NOTE: When you perform the restore operation to a new or different server other
than the original Exchange Server computer or if the server is being restored to
new hard disk, you must reinstall the operating system. It is also very
important that you configure the new recovery server as close as possible to the
original configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: You may have previously performed some of the steps in the procedure
described in this section; however, it is important to check all steps before
you perform the online restore operation.

If you are performing a total server recovery, all the necessary steps are
included in this procedure. Even if you have previously performed some of these
steps, you must check all steps before you perform the online restore operation
of your Exchange Server computer.

NOTE: This article applies if the Exchange Service Account's Security Identifier
(SID) has not been lost. For additional information about how to proceed if the
primary domain controller has been lost and there are no valid backup domain
controllers, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q170810 XADM: Service Specific Error 4021 Starting Information Store

1. Install the correct version of the operating system (Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
  or Microsoft Windows 2000), including the service packs, so that the
  configuration matches the configuration of the original server.

2. Install Exchange Server 5.5, including any connectors (Internet Mail, x.400,
  and so on), and then apply service packs and any hot fixes so that the
  configuration matches the configuration of the original server.

3. Run Performance Optimizer, and then ensure that all data, log, and working
  files are configured to the same locations as the original server locations.

4. Stop all Exchange Server services except the Microsoft Exchange System
  Attendant (MSExchangeSA).

5. Set the Directory Service service (MSExchangeDS), the Information Store
  service (MSExchangeIS), and the Message Transfer Agent (MSExchangeMTA) to
  Disabled.

6. Rename all copies of Mdbdata folders to "Mdbdataold" on all drives.

7. Create new blank Mdbdata folders to replace the renamed folders.

8. Use your backup software to restore the public information, private
  information, and directory database files from your backup media.

9. After the restore operation is complete, start Registry Editor
  (Regedt32.exe), and then on the Options menu, verify that Read Only Mode is
  selected.

10. Check the Restore in Progress registry key that is located in the following
  registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/MSExchangeIS

For additional information about the Restore in Progress registry key, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q200941 XADM: How the Restore in Progress Registry Key Works

11. Check the settings for the subkeys to ensure the file paths match the paths
  described in step three, for example:

   - BackupLogPath: REG_SZ:\\Server\C$\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata

   - CheckpointFilePath: REG_SZ:\\Server\C$\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata

   - EDB Database recovered: REG_BINARY:00

   - EDB_RstMap:REG_MULTI_SZ:\\Server\C$\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Priv.edb

   - EDB_RstMap:REG_MULTI_SZ:\\Server\C$\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Pub.edb

   - HighLog Number:REG_DWORD:0x2

   - LogPath:REG_SZ\\Server\C$\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata

   - LowLog Number:REG_DWORD:0x1

12. Confirm the value of LowLog Number and HighLog Number:

   - Value Name: HighLog Number
     Data Type: REG_DWORD
     Value: 0x000 (where 0x000 is the highest log file that should have been
     restored)

   - Value Name: LowLog Number
     Data Type: REG_DWORD
     Value: 0x000 (where 0x000 is the lowest log file that should have been
     restored)

13. Check the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder for the Edb&lt; #####&gt;.log files.

  This folder should contain all log files from the value identified in LowLog
  Number value to the log file identified in HighLog Number with no break in
  sequence. In addition, a Priv.pat and a Pub.pat file must be present in this
  folder.

  These logs are replayed as part of the recovery process. For example, if the
  LowLog Number value is "0x2bc" and the HighLog Number value is "0x2c1", then
  logs Edb002bc.log through Edb002c1.log must be available for the recovery to
  succeed.

  NOTE: If consecutive log files are present after the HighLog Number, you can
  add these Edb&lt;#####&gt;.log and Edb.log files to the Mdbdata folder.
  Exchange Server plays the log files identified in the Restore in Progress
  value, and then continues playing all log files as long as there is no break
  in the numerical sequence of these log files.

14. Confirm that an Edb.chk file is not present in any Mdbdata folder. If the
  Edb.chk file is present in this folder, move or delete the file (do not
  delete or move it from an Mdbdataold folder).

15. If you are restoring the directory, you must perform steps six through
  fourteen again, but substitute Dsadata for Mdbdata, and check for the
  Dir.pat file in the Dsadata folder.

16. Set the directory service to Automatic, and then start the service.

17. Open the server properties, click the Advanced tab, verify that the circular
  logging options are the same as the options on the original server, and then
  make changes if necessary.

18. Set the Message Transfer Agent to Manual, and then start the service.

19. Set the Information Store service to Manual, and then start the service.

  If you receive an "-1011" error message ID, open a command prompt window, go
  to the location of the Exchange Server files, (usually C:\Exchsrvr\Bin),
  type " isinteg -patch " (without the quotation marks), and then press
  ENTER.

  When the utility is finished, start the Information Store service again.

  At this point your services should all be running.

20. Set the properties of the Information Store service (MSExchangeIS), and the
  Message Transfer Agent (MSExchangeMTA) back to Automatic.
