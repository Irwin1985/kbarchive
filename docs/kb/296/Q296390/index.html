-----------------------------------------------------

On page 9, in the first sentence under the heading Windows 2000 Professional,
remove the words "and fault tolerance".


Page 11: Remove Reference To Alpha-Based Computers
--------------------------------------------------

Windows 2000 does not support Alpha-based computers. Under Windows 2000
Datacenter Server on page 11, remove:

"32 GB of RAM on Alpha-based computers"


Pages 21 &amp; 375: Change "Alpha Server" To "Intel-Compatible Server"

To:

- Networks 1 and 3 represent two routed networks.

- Network 2 represents the WAN connection between the routers

- Network 2 requires a network ID so that...


Pages 55 &amp; 59: Should Reference Novell Directory Services
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 55, line 9 and the caption for Figure 3.1, as well as page 59, line 11,
incorrectly reference NetWare Domain Services.

Change:
"NetWare Domain Services"

To:
"Novell Directory Services"

Change:
"3. Click Add"

To:
"3. Click Install"


Page 95: Incorrect Title Bar In Figure 4.7
------------------------------------------

Change:
"Windows Interface Name Service (WINS)"

To:
"Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)"


Page 140: Incorrect Information About Host Name And Computer NetBIOS Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 140, in the first paragraph under "Understanding Host Names" and in the
first paragraph under "Purpose of Host Names", it states that the host name does
not have to match the NetBIOS computer name when running Windows 2000. This is
incorrect. In Windows 2000, you cannot specify different host (Directory Naming
Service, or DNS) and computer (NetBIOS) names.

Under "Understanding Host Names" change:
"For computers running Windows 2000, the host name does not have to match the
Windows 2000 computer name."

To:
"For computers running Windows 2000, the host name always matches the Windows
2000 computer name."

Under "Purpose of Host Names" change:
"The host name does not have to match the NetBIOS computer name"

To:
"The host name always matches the NetBIOS computer name in Windows 2000"


Page 155, Incorrect Zone Name In Figure 7.3
-------------------------------------------

Name Server, and step 8 pointing downwards to the DNS Client.


Page 163: Incomplete Description Of Recursive Request
-----------------------------------------------------

On page 163, in Lesson Summary,

Change:
"A DNS server will only return the information it has in cache, including the
potential of an error, when a client makes a recursive request."

To:
"A DNS server will only return the information it has in its zones or cache,
including the potential of an error, when a client makes a recursive request"


Page 166, 168, 170: Incorrect References To Windows 2000 Professional Client Computers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 166 in Table 7.3, on page 168 in Table 7.4, and on page 170 in Table 7.5,
the "Clients" row refers to 386 and 486 computers running Windows 2000
Professional. Windows 2000 Professional does not run on 386 and 486 computers.
Please remove the references to 386 and 486 computers in these tables.

remove the top entry.


Page 246: Incorrect Description of DHCP/DNS Integration Behavior
----------------------------------------------------------------

Change:
"The DHCP server never registers the name-to-address (A-type records) mapping
information for DHCP clients."

To:
"The DHCP server never registers both the forward (A-type records) and reverse
lookups (PTR-type records) with DNS."


Page 247:  Incorrect Steps In "To allow dynamic updates for DHCP clients that do not support Dynamic DNS updates"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 247, in the first bulleted section, there is a list of the steps for
enabling the "dynamic update for DHCP clients that do not support dynamic DNS
updates" option through the DNS management console. This is incorrect, as this
option is enabled through the DHCP, not DNS, management console.

Change:
"1. Click Start, point to Program, point to Administrative Tools, then click
DNS.
2. In the console tree, click the applicable zone."
...

"5. Select Only Secure Updates If Your Zone Type is Active
Directory-Integrated."

To:
"1. Click Start, point to Program, point to Administrative Tools, then click
DHCP.
2. In the console tree, click the applicable server."
...

"5. Click Start, point to Program, point to Administrative Tools, then click
DNS.
6. In the console tree, click the applicable zone.
7. In the General property tab, select Only Secure Updates if your zone type is
Active Directory-integrated."

Monitor)."

Monitor)."


Page 311: Incorrect Wording
---------------------------

On page 311, under "Inbound Internet Traffic",

Change:
"For traffic from the private network that is inbound on the Internet interface"

To:
"For traffic to the private network that is inbound on the Internet interface"


Page 312: Correction To Figure 12.4
-----------------------------------

On page 312, in Figure 12.4, remove the arrow that flows from "Discard packet" to
"Yes".


Page 325: Invalid IP Address In Figure 12.6
-------------------------------------------

On page 325, in Figure 12.6, the Valid External Address Pool lists invalid IP
addresses.

Change:
"17230.188.10
17230.188.11"

To:
"172.30.188.10
172.30.188.11"


Page 332: Remove The Last Sentence In Lesson Summary
----------------------------------------------------

On page 332, under "Lesson Summary", remove the last sentence.

Remove:
"In this lesson, you also learned how to install and configure certificates."

This topic is not covered until the next lesson.


Page 334: CSP stands for "Cryptograhic Service Provider" (CSP)
--------------------------------------------------------------

On page 334, line 3 in the "Key management" section, CSP should be spelled out as
Cryptographic Service Provider. This acronym (CSP) is introduced on this page,
then referenced again on pages 338, 339, and 340, without an explanation of what
it stands for. There is not an entry in the Glossary section for it.

Change:
"(accessible to Certificate Services through a CryptoAPI CSP)"

To:
"(accessible to Certificate Services through a CryptoAPI Cryptographic Service
Provider (CSP))"


Page 337: "Stand-Alone Subordinate CA" Should Be "Stand-Alone Root CA"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 337, "Stand-Alone Subordinate CA" should be "Stand-Alone Root CA".

Change:
"Practice: Installing a Stand-Alone Subordinate CA"

To:
"Practice: Installing a Stand-Alone Root CA"

Also change:
"To install a stand-alone subordinate CA"

To:
"To install a stand-alone root CA"


Page 375, Question 2: Windows 2000 Server Supports 4 GB Of RAM, not 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
