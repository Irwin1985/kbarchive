SYMPTOMS
========

On secondary site servers, the Collid.lkp file in the SMS\Inboxes\Colleval.box
folder may become corrupted. The Collection Evaluator component may report
errors when the Collection Evaluator component attempts to update collections.

The following error message may be logged in the Colleval.log file:

  Cannot allocate collection ID for site ID &lt;collection_ID&gt;
  Could not load collection definition from parent site. Will retry later.

After the corruption to the Collid.lkp file occurs, the Offer Manager component
may also log the following error message in the Offermgr.Log file:

  Cannot find collection &lt;collection_ID&gt; in the collection source, skip
  it.

As a result of this condition, Offer Manager does not make advertisements
available to clients of the secondary site.

In some cases, the Collection Evaluator can recover from the problem and rebuild
the Collid.lkp file. However, at times you may need to delete the corrupted
Collid.lkp file for the Collection Evaluator to rebuild the Collid.lkp.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if both the Collection Evaluator and Offer Manager at the
secondary site are attempting to manipulate the Collid.lkp file simultaneously.
When the Collid.lkp file is updated, a temporary file called Collid.tmp file is
created. The corruption occurs when the Collid.tmp file is deleted by one
component when the Collid.tmp file is in use by the other component.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem generally occurs on servers that are processing a large number of
collections and servers that are operating in a stressed condition, where
excessive disk paging can slow file input/output (I/O) operations.
