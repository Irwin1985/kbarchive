SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the necessary steps to add additional drives to a
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition server cluster when specifically
using an EMC array with multiple paths and PowerPath software.

Additional steps are required if you are using PowerPath with multiple paths to
the drives than are typically necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Verify that the primary node, Node A in this scenario and the node that the
  Cluster Service was first installed on, has control over all the resources.

2. On Node B, the cluster node that joined the cluster:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

     Note: When changing the startup mode on the following devices you will get
     a message "Changing the startup type for XXXXX device may leave the system
     in an unusable state. Do you want to make the change?" Click Yes to
     continue for all devices.

  b. Scroll down the list to Cluster Disk, click Startup, change the settings
     to Manual, and then click OK.

  c. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Module, click Startup, change the
     settings to Manual, and then click OK.

  d. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Driver, click Startup, change the
     settings to Manual, and then click OK.

  e. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  f. Click Cluster Server, click Startup, change the settings to Manual, and
     then click OK.

  g. Scroll down to EMC PowerPath Monitor Service, change the settings to
     Manual, and then click OK.

  h. Shut down the computer, and then power off Node B.

  i. Disconnect all but one connection from Node B to the Symmetrix device.

3. On Node A:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

  b. Scroll down the list to Cluster Disk, click Startup, change the settings
     to Manual, and then click OK.

  c. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Module, click Startup, change the
     settings to Manual, and then click OK.

  d. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Driver, click Startup, change the
     settings to Manual, and then click OK.

  e. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  f. Click Cluster Server, click Startup, change the settings to Manual, and
     then click OK.

  g. Scroll down to EMC PowerPath Monitor Service and change the settings to
     Manual, and then click OK.

  h. Shut down the computer and Power off Node A.

  i. Disconnect all but one connection from Node A to the Symmetrix device.

  j. Boot Node A and log on.

  k. Click OK to the PowerPath Administrator error "Could not connect to
     monitor service on &lt;servername&gt;", and then close the PowerPath
     Administrator if it opened.

     Note: These steps are necessary because the PowerPath Administrator is
     included in the startup process.

  l. Right-click the PowerPath icon, and then click Exit.

  m. Open Disk Administrator: Click Start, point to Programs, and then click
     Administrative Tools.

  n. Select the additional disk, which should show up as Free Space, and then
     click Create on the Partition menu. Confirm the creation of the partition
     by clicking Yes and determine the partition size.

  o. Click Commit Changes Now on the Partition menu and if necessary, change
     the drive letter on the Tools menu by clicking Assign Drive Letter.

  p. Click Format on the Tools menu and change the File System to NTFS in the
     Format window. Also, name your volume in the Volume Label box and then
     click Full Format in the Format Options section.

     Note: Make sure your label of this disk will help to identify it when seen
     on the other node.

  q. Click Start to begin formatting, and then click Close when you are
     finished.

  r. Close the Disk Administrator by clicking Exit on the Partition menu and
     save any configurations.

  s. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

  t. Scroll down the list to Cluster Disk, click Startup, change the settings
     to System, and then click OK.

  u. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  v. Click Cluster Server, click Startup, change the settings to Automatic, and
     then click OK.

  w. Shut down the computer and power off Node A.

4. On Node B:

  a. Boot and log on to Node B.

  b. Click OK to the PowerPath Administrator error "Could not connect to
     monitor service on &lt;servername&gt;", and then close PowerPath
     Administrator if it is open.

  c. Right-click the PowerPath icon, and then click Exit.

  d. Open Disk Administrator: Click Start, point to Programs, and then click
     Administrative Tools.

  e. Select the added disk, go to the Tools menu and choose Assign Drive Letter
     and give it the same drive letter as that which was assigned on Node A.
     Even if the drive letter has been assigned and is correct, you must still
     assign the same drive letter. Close the Disk Administrator by clicking
     Exit on the Partition menu and save any configurations.

  f. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

  g. Scroll down the list to Cluster Disk, click Startup, change the settings
     to System, and then click OK.

  h. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  i. Click Cluster Server, click Startup, change the settings to Automatic, and
     then click OK.

  j. Shut down the computer and power off Node B.

5. On Node A:

  a. Boot and log on to Node A (the cluster service should start).

  b. Click OK to the PowerPath Administrator error "Could not connect to
     monitor service on &lt;servername&gt;", and then close PowerPath
     Administrator if it is open.

  c. Right-click the PowerPath icon, and then click Exit.

  d. Open Cluster Administrator, and then add the new disk as a resource to an
     existing disk group; or, create a new disk group, and then add the disk.

     Note: Do not bring the resource online at this time.

  e. Reboot Node A.

  f. Log on to Node A (the cluster service should start).

  g. Click OK to the PowerPath Administrator error "Could not connect to
     monitor service on &lt;servername&gt;", and then close PowerPath
     Administrator if it is open.

  h. Right-click the PowerPath icon, and then click Exit.

  i. Open Cluster Administrator and bring the disk resource online.

6. On Node B:

  a. Boot and log on to Node B (the server should join cluster).

  b. Click OK to the PowerPath Administrator error "Could not connect to
     monitor service on &lt;servername&gt;", and then close PowerPath
     Administrator if it is open.

  c. Right-click the PowerPath icon, and then click Exit.

  d. Make sure the Disk Resource can fail over to either node.

7. On Node A:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

  b. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Module, click Startup, change the
     settings to Boot, and then click OK.

  c. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Driver, click Startup, change the
     settings to Boot, and then click OK.

  d. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  e. Scroll down to EMC PowerPath Monitor Service and change the settings to
     Automatic, and then click OK.

  f. Shut down the computer, and power off Node A.

8. On Node B:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

  b. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Module, click Startup, change the
     settings to Boot, and then click OK.

  c. Scroll down the list to EMC PowerPath Driver, click Startup, change the

  d. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  e. Scroll down to EMC PowerPath Monitor Service, change the settings to
     Automatic, and then click OK.

  f. Shut down the computer and power off Node B.

9. On Node A:

  a. Reconnect all the connections from Node A to the Symmetrix device.

  b. Boot and log on to Node A (the cluster service should start).

  c. Verify that PowerPath is able to see two paths to each device and that the
     resources are online.

10. On Node B:

  a. Reconnect all the connections from Node B to the Symmetrix device.

  b. Boot and log on to Node B (the server should join the cluster).

  c. Verify that PowerPath can see two paths to each device and that the
