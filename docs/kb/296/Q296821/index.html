-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Host Integration Server 2000 (HIS2000) is installed and running on a
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server system, a Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC)
connection that is using the Sangoma SDLC link service (SANSDLC1) stays pending
when it is configured for external clocking.

CAUSE
=====

Incorrect SDLC drivers are installed for the Sangoma SDLC PCI adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Sangoma and request the drivers for Host Integration Server 2000 running
in Windows NT 4.0 Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

External clocking is configured in the SANSDLC1 link properties when line speed
is set for 0 (zero). External clocking is essentially clocking that is handled
by the Data Communications Equipment (DCE); in this case, it is handled
externally by the Channel Service Unit/Data Service Unit (CSU/DSU) instead of
internally by the SDLC adapter.

If the line speed is configured to 56000 in the SANSDLC1 link properties, the
SDLC connection becomes active. However, with this configuration, clocking is
handled both internally by the SDLC adapter and externally by the CSU/DSU,
causing transmission of data to become out of sync.

When the SDLC connection is pending, an event 23 with an outage code of 25 is
logged in the Windows NT 4.0 Server application log. The following is an example
of the event:

Event Type:	Warning
Event Source:	SNA Server
Event Category:	None
Event ID:	23
Date:		4/12/2001
Time:		1:00:54 PM
User:		S-1-5-21-1915688249-670910532-2033415169-500
Computer:	MYCOMPUTER
Description:
Connection Failure
  Connection   = MYCONNECTION 
  Link Service = SANSDLC1
  Outage Code  = 0025

EXPLANATION
A link service reported a connection failure to the node. See below for more information on the outage code that caused the connection to fail.

SDLC

0025

Idle timeout retry exceeded. The SNA connection has not received an SDLC response from the remote system, causing a connection timeout. 
Common causes include: (1) wrong duplexing (2)  wrong NRZI value, (3) a bad SDLC cable, (4) line is too fast for adapter,(5) a modem 
configuration issue (6) a bad SDLC adapter.

You can obtain the drivers for this adapter for SNA Server and Host Integration
Server 2000 from the following Web site:

  ftp://ftp.sangoma.com/SNA%20Server/S514-S508%20code/
  (ftp://ftp.sangoma.com/SNA%20Server/S514-S508%20code/)

Sangoma's FTP site has drivers for the following configurations:

- SNA Server and Host Integration Server 2000 running in Microsoft Windows 2000
  Server. The following files are listed under the Win2000 folder:

   - Sanglink_w2k.msi

   - Sangsync.inf

   - Sangsync.sys

- SNA Server running in Windows NT 4.0 Server. The following files are listed
  under the Winnt folder:

   - Readme.txt

   - Sanglink.msi

Sangoma's FTP site has not released the SDLC driver for Host Integration Server
2000 running in Windows NT 4.0 Server.
