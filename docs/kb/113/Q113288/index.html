-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a 
- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an envelope from Word 6.0 or 6.0a for Windows to a Canon
Bubble-Jet 300 (BJ300) or 330 (BJ330) printer using the Bubble-Jet printer
driver, the envelope delivery address prints too high on the envelope.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To print the envelope correctly, switch the Bubble-Jet to IBM Proprinter XL24e
emulation mode and use the XL24e driver by following the steps below.

Switching Emulation Modes on the Printer
----------------------------------------

1. Turn the printer around so you are looking at the back of the printer.

2. Open the drop-down door near the center of the back of the printer.

  You should see a row of 18 dip switches. The left 8 switches are labeled SW1.
  The right 10 switches are labeled SW2. By default, when the Bubble-Jet is in
  native Bubble-Jet mode, all 18 switches are in the up position.

3. Using a pen or another pointed object, move the leftmost 2 switches (SW1 #1
  and #2) to the down position. This puts the printer in IBM Proprinter XL24e
  emulation mode. (The remainder of the dip switches set printer default
  settings, such as form length and line spacing. You do not need to change
  these switches.)

Installing the XL24e Printer Driver
-----------------------------------

1. In Windows Control Panel, choose Printers.

2. Choose the Add button.

3. In the Printer box, choose the IBM Proprinter XL24e and choose the Install
  button.

4. Insert the appropriate Windows disk in your floppy disk drive and choose the
  OK button.

5. Once the Proprinter appears in the Installed Printers box, choose the Set As
  Default Printer button and close the Printers dialog box.

Configuring Word for the Proprinter
-----------------------------------

1. From the Tools menu, choose Envelopes And Labels.

2. Choose the Envelope tab.

3. Choose the Options button.

4. Choose the Printing Options tab.

5. Choose the Reset button to return the Envelope feed options to their
  defaults.

6. Choose the landscape feed method (the left envelope feed icon) so that the
  envelope feed method matches the method the printer actually uses.

7. Choose the OK button to close the dialog box.

Printing an Envelope from Word
------------------------------

1. Insert an envelope in the top of the printer so that the top of the envelope
  is facing down, the back flap of the envelope is facing the front of the
  printer, and the left edge of the envelope lines up with the zero (0) mark on
  the printer.

  Do NOT press the Load button on the front control panel of the printer.

2. From the Tools menu in Word, choose Envelopes And Labels.

3. Type the envelope address information in the envelope window.

4. Choose the Print button.

The envelope should be pulled into the printer and printed correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above procedure was tested with the IBM Proprinter driver (PROPM24.DRV)
version 1.0 from the Windows 3.1 disks and version 2.15. Both versions of the
driver printed envelopes correctly when using the above procedure.

Printing envelopes using the Epson LQ-1050 emulation (for the BJ330) produced
garbage characters for the return address, but the delivery address printed in
the correct location. For this reason, the IBM Proprinter is the recommended
emulation.

Printing envelopes from the Write program with the printer in native BJ300 and
BJ330 modes produced the same problem: the delivery address prints too high on
the envelope.


After following the above steps, if the printer does not generate any output,
check Print Manager. If a dialog box appears saying "Insert Paper," choose the
OK button, and the envelope then prints correctly. To disable this message box,
do the following:

1. From Windows Control Panel, choose Printers.

2. Choose the Setup button.

3. Change the Paper Source to Tractor.
