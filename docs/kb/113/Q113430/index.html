-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Slow video frame rate in Flight Simulator may be caused by improper hardware
settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To achieve optimum performance, there are four hardware elements that need to be
configured correctly in Flight Simulator 5.0:

- Mouse
- Joystick
- Sound card
- Video card

If any of these hardware elements are configured incorrectly, Flight Simulator
5.0 may run slowly.

MOUSE
-----

Flight Simulator tries to detect a mouse during Setup. If it cannot find a mouse,
it defaults to the No Mouse setting. Changing the setting to Microsoft
Compatible Mouse forces Flight Simulator 5.0 to look for a mouse. This may cause
poor performance in Flight Simulator. Check to see if the mouse driver is loaded
and if the mouse is performing correctly outside of Flight Simulator.

JOYSTICK
--------

If you are using a joystick, make sure that the joystick preferences are
configured correctly. Joystick configuration may vary slightly from model to
model. General configurations are listed below:

Single Joystick:

Joystick One: Aileron and Elevator
Joystick Two: Off

Single Joystick with Throttle Control (Yoke):

Joystick One: Aileron and Elevator
Joystick Two: Throttle Only

Single Joystick and Rudder Pedals:

Joystick One: Aileron and Elevator
Joystick Two: Rudder Only

Single Joystick with Throttle Control (Yoke) and Rudder Pedals:

Joystick One: Aileron and Elevator
Joystick Two: Throttle &amp; Rudder

Two Joysticks (Second One Configured for Throttle Control Only):

Joystick One: Aileron and Elevator
Joystick Two: Throttle Only

Two Joysticks (Second One Configured for Throttle and Rudder Control):

Joystick One: Aileron and Elevator
Joystick Two: Throttle &amp; Rudder

NOTE: Do not use Throttle and Brakes for any type of joystick. Any joystick with
a Button 1 will be able to use brakes.

SOUND
-----

If you are using a sound card, make sure the settings for Base Address,
Interrupt, and DMA channel in the Options, Preferences, Sound menu match your
sound card's settings exactly. If you are unsure what the settings for your
sound card are, consult the documentation for the card or contact the sound card
manufacturer.

To check for problems caused by the sound card, turn the sound option Off. If the
performance inproves considerably, the sound card is causing a problem. Flight
Simulator was tested with Creative Labs Sound Blaster card; if you are using
another sound card there may be a compatibility problem. Contact your sound card
manufacturer and ask about compatibility with Creative Labs Sound Blaster card.

VIDEO
-----

If you are using SVGA resolution in Flight Simulator 5.0, make sure that you have
specified the proper video chipset for your video card. If you are unsure which
video chipset your card uses, consult the documentation for the card or contact
the video card manufacturer. VGA resolution does not require you to select a
chipset.
