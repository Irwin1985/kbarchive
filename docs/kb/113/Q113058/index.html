SUMMARY
=======

The "MS-DOS Programmer's Reference" (published by Microsoft Press) versions 5
and 6, as well as other MS-DOS programming reference books, state that Interrupt
21h, Function 0Ah (Buffer Keyboard Input) has been superseded by Function 3Fh
(Read File or Device). Function 3Fh is more general purpose and easier to use
for some programming tasks, but may cause some apparently unusual behavior when
used to read from device 0 (stdin--the console or keyboard).

Function 3Fh uses a system buffer when reading from a device and then transfers
the desired number of characters into a memory buffer specified by the calling
program. The buffer used by Function 3Fh is not the same as that used by MS-DOS
or by other functions that read from the keyboard (Functions 01h, 06h, 07h, 08h,
0Ah, and 0Ch). Function 3Fh moves characters from the input buffer to the
program supplied data area either until the requested number of characters have
been read or, if reading from the keyboard, until a carriage return is reached.
When more characters than requested are entered from the keyboard, the requested
number are returned to the program, but the input buffer is not flushed. This
may cause subsequent read operations to return with invalid or undesired data.
This can even occur between separate instances of program execution.

The sample shown below illustrates this, and shows how to clear the buffer by
reading until a linefeed character has been found.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample prompts for input, reads up to 10 characters, and displays the
characters read. If more than 10 characters are entered, only the first 10 will
be displayed. If the program is then executed a second time, the remaining
characters (or the next 10, whichever is less) will be immediately displayed.
The prompt will be given but the program will not wait for input.

If the commented lines following the label clearbuf are added into the program,
the input buffer will be cleared and the program will work as expected. Note
that the code to clear the buffer reads until it finds a linefeed character
(0Ah) rather than a carriage return (0Dh). Experimentation shows that if the
linefeed is left in the buffer, the program will wait for another carriage
return after running the loop, and will not read any data the next time it is
run. Function 3Fh does not return the carriage return/linefeed (CR/LF) pair to
the calling program when reading multiple bytes, but does return them when
reading 1 byte at a time, and therefore both must be cleared as shown.

Also note that possible read and write errors are being ignored by this code.
Refer to "MS-DOS Programmer's Reference" for information on possible errors and
how to detect them.

The "MS-DOS Programmer's Reference" is available through Microsoft Press by
calling 1-(800)-MSPRESS.
