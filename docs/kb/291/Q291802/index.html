MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: \Support Directory Not Included In Training Kit CD-ROMs
---------------------------------------------------------------

In several places in the Microsoft Systems Management Server Training text (e.g.
page 523), the text makes reference to utilities that can be found in the
\Support or the \Support\Debug directories on the Microsoft Systems Management
Server compact disc. However, these directories cannot be found on the CD-ROMs
that are included with the training kit.

The evaluation edition of Microsoft Systems Management Server does not include
the \Support directory.


Page 136: Text Error
--------------------

On page 136, in the table at the top of the page, the inventory agent for Windows
NT Workstation is incorrect.

Change:
"INVCLI32.EXE"

To:
"INV32CLI.EXE"


Page 643: Additional Information
--------------------------------

On page 643, under the section titled "The Client Configuration Manager",
additional information is needed in the third bulleted item.

Change:
"In the domain where the client resides, have an account with the same name and
password as the service account."

To:
"In the domain where the client resides, have an account with the same name and
password as the service account, and make sure it is added to the domain's
Domain Administrator global group."


Page 740: Text Error
--------------------

On page 740, question 1, in the section for Chapter 8 questions, does not match
the original question on page 440 of Chapter 8.

Change:
"What four steps are required to configure a shared application package?"

To:
"What four steps are required to configure a shared application in SMS?"
