SUMMARY
=======

Professional, ISBN 1-57231-838-4.

The following topics are covered:

- Page 86: Incorrect Menu Name

- Page 133: First Bulleted Item Should Say "Except 5 or 0"

- Page 290: Figure 16-6 Is An Incorrect Representation

- Page 448-9: Incorrect Text &amp; Graphic For Internet Directory

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 86: Incorrect Menu Name
----------------------------

On page 86, under the second heading, in the 4th and 7th lines, change "View
menu" to "Tools menu."

Change:
"Then choose the Folder Options command on the View menu, click the View tab, and
click the Like Current Folder button. To return all these display options to
their original settings (those that were in place when you installed Windows),
choose Folder Options from the View menu..."

To:
"Then choose the Folder Options command on the Tools menu, click the View tab,
and click the Like Current Folder button. To return all these display options to
their original settings (those that were in place when you installed Windows),
choose Folder Options from the Tools menu..."


Page 133: First Bulleted Item Should Say "Except 5 or 0"
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 133, in the first bulleted item, change the first sentence to read
"...any number key except 5 or 0."

Change:
"To move the mouse pointer, press any number key except 5."

To:
"To move the mouse pointer, press any number key except 5 or 0."


Page 290: Figure 16-6 Is An Incorrect Representation
----------------------------------------------------

On page 290, Figure 16-6 is incorrect. The correct figure would show the Local
Area Network Internet Configuration page of the Internet Connection Wizard.


Page 448-9: Incorrect Text &amp; Graphic For Internet Directory
-----------------------------------------------------------

Page 448-9 contains incorrect information on Microsoft Internet Directory.

Change the last bulleted item on page 448 to:
"Microsoft Internet Directory displays your MSN Messenger Service contacts and
lets you know which ones are currently online. To use Microsoft Internet
Directory, you and the people you want to contact must have MSN Messenger
Service and a Microsoft Passport. Both are free; visit messenger.msn.com for
details. Unlike ILS directories, Microsoft Internet Directory doesn?t broadcast
your name to everyone who logs on to the directory; only users who have added
you to their list of MSN Messenger Service contacts can see your name and
availability. In addition to guarding your privacy, this shields you from the
all-too-explicit listings that clutter many ILS directories."

Figure 21-2 should show MSN Messenger Service, and the caption at left should
say:
"Microsoft Internet Directory lists only your MSN Messenger Service contacts."


Page 678: 5th Bulleted Item Is Incorrect
----------------------------------------

On page 678, in the 5th bulleted item, the word "Left" should be deleted as
either Shift key will work.

Change:
"Press Ctrl+Left Shift+Esc"

To:
"Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc"
