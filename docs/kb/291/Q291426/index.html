-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) on a computer that runs
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, and that is already set up with
programs and user permissions, various error messages may appear when a user
tries to log on or use a program.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the ZAK lockout script (Zakwtsb2.exe) applies
restrictions on files that programs need to use.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, either give all users Full Control permissions for the
Terminal Server local hard disk, or restore the default Terminal Server
permissions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following list describes the updated ZAK script files that are associated
with the Zakwtsb2.exe file for Terminal Server.

Zakinstall.cmd: This file copies the ZAK files to the system root on the Terminal
Server, in a folder named Zak. The file then calls Zakb1wrk.cmd.

Zakb1wrk.cmd: This file cleans up any files that Office 97 Setup places in the
All Users\Startup folder. The file has many commented-out sections that you can
customize for your environment. The file calls Acls.cmd, which sets the system
access control lists, and Hide.cmd, which hides most of the local file system.

Acls.cmd: This file uses the Cacls command-line utility to set Read-only
permissions for users on all files on the local system. It then goes back and
modifies permissions on specific files or folders so that Office 97 and Windows
NT work properly. This process performs the following actions:

NOTE: Unless specifically listed otherwise, administrators have full permissions
for all files and folders.

- Makes the boot files available only to administrators.

- Gives users Read-only permissions for the Program Files folder.

- Makes Windows NT accessories (Notepad, games, and so on) unavailable to
  users.

- Gives everyone Change permissions for the Office and Office\Templates
  folders.

- Gives everyone Change permissions for the Temp folder but does not allow
  deletion of the folder. To accomplish this, the process places a file in the
  root of the Temp folder and then restricts users from deleting that one file.

- Sets user permissions for the Wtsrv folder and most of its subfolders to
  Read-only. The Help folder, Profiles folder, Spool folder, and folders
  related to Internet Explorer retain regular availability. Some specific files
  (for example, Explorer.exe and Wordpad.exe) require Read permissions so users
  can run them. For a complete list of allowed executable files, refer to the
  command file.

- Denies any access to .inf files, .exe files, and .hlp files in the System
  folders.

- Locks out user access to the Zak folder.

- Allows Read access to specific files that Office needs to write to.

Hide.cmd: This file sets the Hidden attribute for most files on the computer,
effectively hiding them without applying any system policies, so that a user who
explores the local hard disk drive does not see most files or folders. There are
exceptions. For example, it does not hide Microsoft PowerPoint templates (.ppt)
because these files must be visible for PowerPoint to run properly.

Unhide.cmd: This file removes the Hidden attribute tag from all files on the
system drive. It is included for the system administrator's convenience.
