SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the steps to change the default SMTP address space so that
Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes receive mail addressed to the new SMTP
address but also receive mail addressed to their old domains as a secondary SMTP
address.

For example, the same Exchange Server mailbox can receive mail addressed as
username@newcompany.com as well as reply to old messages for
username@oldcompany.com.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you proceed with the Exchange Server configuration, add a new MX record
to reflect the new domain name. This new MX record should be added in the Domain
Name Service (DNS) provider, which might be part of the Internet Service
Provider (ISP).

For additional information and the syntax of the MX record, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q153001 XFOR: DNS MX Records and CNAMEs

The correct addition of this MX record can be verified by performing a Name
Service Lookup, using the new domain name.

You may also want to familiarize yourself with performing directory exports. For
additional information about performing directory exports, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

To configure the Exchange Server computer, follow these steps:

1. Create a CSV header file (User.csv) with the following fields:

   - Obj-Class

   - Directory Name

   - E-mail Addresses

   - Secondary-Proxy-Addresses

  To create the CSV header file, use Header.exe, which is located on the
  Exchange Server CD in the \SERVER\SUPPORT\AUTORUN\RESKIT\HEADER folder.

2. Use the file you made in step 1, User.csv, to export all mailboxes.

3. Use Microsoft Excel to verify that all mailboxes are present in the CSV file.

4. To change the default SMTP address for all users, follow these steps:

  a. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

  b. Click Configuration, click Site Addressing, and then click the Site
     Addressing tab.

  c. Select the SMTP proxy, and then click Edit.

  d. Change this address to @NewCompany.Com.

  e. Click OK twice. The following message appears:

  The Site Addresses of type(s) [SMTP] have been modified.
  Do you want to update all Recipient E-mail addresses to match the new site
  address(es).

  f. Select Yes.

     Another message is displayed, stating that the process has started. If you
     look in the application log you should see the following events:

  Event ID: 2043
  Source: MSExchangeSA
  Type: Informational
  Category: General
  Description: Starting the Bulk e-mail address process

  Event ID: 2044
  Source: MSExchangeSA
  Type: Informational
  Category: General
  Description: Completed the Bulk e-mail address process. 10 recipients scanned,
  10 successfully updated, 0 unsuccessfully updated.

5. Before you manipulate the User.csv file, make a copy. Open the User.csv file
  in Excel and in the "E-mail addresses" field locate "SMTP:
  userA@domain1.com". Move this portion of the "E-mail addresses" field to the
  Secondary-Proxy-Addresses field. Repeat these steps for all mailboxes.

6. Remove the "E-mail Addresses" column, so that there are only Obj-Class,
  Directory Name, and Secondary-Proxy-Addresses columns.

7. Save the CSV file. You are prompted to either keep the format or change the
  format. If you want to keep the format, click Yes.

8. Import the User.csv file into your Exchange Server Directory.

  This should add the secondary-proxy-address to all your users, which was your
  oldcompany.com address so that old mail will not cause a Non-delivery Report.
  The primary SMTP was changed in step 4, so the "reply-to" address from now on
  will be for the newcompany.com.

9. Open the properties for the Internet Mail Service from the Exchange Server
  Administrator program. On the Routing tab, if the Internet Mail Service is
  configured to reroute SMTP, verify that newdomain.com and olddomain.com are
  listed. If they missing, click Add, and specify incoming for the missing
  domain.
