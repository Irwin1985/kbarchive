Page 71 of the "Microsoft Mouse Programmer's Reference Guide" lists
"Key Sequences That Can't Be Simulated" using the menu programming
TYPE statement. These keys cannot be simulated in a mouse menu because
the key or key sequence is suppressed in the ROM BIOS. The list that
is presented in the guide is incomplete, and in certain instances it
is in need of revision.

Each suppressed key mentioned is the lowercase character on the key.
It is understood, but not explicitly stated, that the uppercase
character on these keys will also be suppressed. A number of keys and
key combinations that are suppressed and cannot be emulated are not
mentioned in the guide. Some of the additions and corrections that can
be made to the published list are given below.
