SUMMARY
=======

Notepad, Cardfile, and Calendar do not automatically highlight the default
printer, which was set up from the Control Panel, as the default printer
selection when you select Printer Setup from the File menu. The first printer in
the list of printers is selected, rather than the printer most recently set as
the default printer. From Notepad, Cardfile, and Calendar, if no printer is
selected under Printer Setup, these applications print to the default printer
listed as the Default Printer in the Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once a printer has been selected under Printer Setup from the File menu, it
remains the active printer until another one is chosen or the work session ends.
When you go back into the Printer Setup menu, you see that the first printer on
the list is selected again.

Notepad, Cardfile, and Calendar list all printer devices listed in the WIN.INI
file. As a result, you can select a printer from Printer Setup that is not
connected to a port or is marked as inactive. Attempting to print to a printer
that is not connected or is marked as inactive results in the following error
message:

  Cannot print (filename);
  ensure the printer is connected and properly set up

Select a printer that is connected to a port and is marked active.

When choosing Printer Setup from the File menu, the printer that remains selected
is the printer that was added last through the Control Panel or Setup. The order
of the printers in Notepad's Printer Setup is opposite to the order listed in
the WIN.INI file under [Printer Ports] (the last printer added is first on the
list).

Windows applications such as Word for Windows, Excel, or Terminal select and
change the Windows default printer with Printer Setup.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
