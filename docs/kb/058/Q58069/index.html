Multithreaded programs are linked with LLIBCMT.LIB and include header
files from the \INCLUDE\MT directory. If you link with LLIBCMT, but
include header files from the \INCLUDE directory, you may get the
linker message "L2029, unresolved external" on one or more of the C
run-time routines. You can resolve the problem by including the
multithreaded header files.

The linker must resolve external references based on the names written
to the object file. The explicit format of these names is directly
affected by the prototypes you use in your program, and when you
include the header files, you are specifying function prototypes. The
prototypes for some functions are different between the single and
multithreaded header files. For example, atof() is defined in the
   double _CDECL atof(const char *);

and in \INCLUDE\MT\STDLIB.H as follows:

   double far pascal atof(const char far *);

The keyword _CDECL means to use C language conventions (that is,
preserve case and prepend a leading underscore). The keyword pascal
means to use Pascal language conventions (that is, promote to
uppercase and do not add a leading underscore). When the linker is
looking for _atof, it does not consider ATOF a match.

You can find complete compile and link instructions for multithreaded
programming in MTDYNA.DOC, which is on the C version 5.10 disks.
