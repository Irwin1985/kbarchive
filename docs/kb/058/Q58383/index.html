-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the Microsoft Windows version 3.0
SYSINI.TXT readme file. The Windows Setup program copies this file to the
Windows 3.0 directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

[386Enh] SECTION
----------------

The [386Enh] section contains information specific to running Windows
in 386 enhanced mode, including information used for virtual-memory
page swapping.

The [386Enh] section can contain the following settings:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
AllVMsExclusive=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: If enabled, this setting forces all applications to run in
        exclusive mode, overriding all contrary settings in the
        applications' program information files (PIFs). Enabling this
        setting might prolong the life of network and memory-resident
        software that is incompatible with Windows.
Can change by: Using Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AltPasteDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .025
Purpose: Specifies how much time Windows waits before pasting any
        characters after the ALT key has been pasted. Some
        applications may require more time for recognition of the ALT
        keystroke.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CGANoSnow=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: If enabled, causes Windows to do special handling to avoid
        snow appearing on an IBM CGA display device.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
COM1AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
COM2AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
COM3AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
COM4AutoAssign=&lt;number&gt;
Default: 2
Purpose: Indicate the contention detection values for each connected
        communications port. These values are used by Windows to
        determine how to arbitrate requests for the use of a device
        by more than one application, at least one of which is a
        non-Windows application. If the value is -1, Windows will
        display a warning message that asks the user which
        application should be given control of the port. If the value
        is zero, any application can use the device at any time. If
        the value is a positive integer less than 1,000, this value
        represents the number of seconds after an application stops
        using the device before another application can use the same
        device.
To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
COM1Base=&lt;port&gt;
COM2Base=&lt;port&gt;
COM3Base=&lt;port&gt;
COM4Base=&lt;port&gt;
Default: See purpose.
Purpose: Specifies the base (first) port for the serial port adapter
        you are using. The default values are as follows:

         Port       Default
         ----       -------
         COM1        3F8h
         COM2        2F8h
         COM3        3E8h
         COM4        2E8h

        Check your hardware documentation for the appropriate value.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMBoostTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default: 2
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to allow a
        virtual machine to process a COM interrupt. If an
        communications application is losing keyboard characters on
        the display, you can try increasing this value.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
COM1Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM2Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM3Irq=&lt;number&gt;
COM4Irq=&lt;number&gt;
Default: See purpose.
Purpose: Specifies which interrupt line is being used by the device on
        the specified communications port. The default values are as
        follows:

         Port       Default
         ----       -------
         COM1          4
         COM2          3
         COM3          4
         COM4          3

        Check your hardware documentation for the appropriate value.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Device=&lt;filename-or-*devicename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies which virtual devices are being used with Windows
        in 386 enhanced mode. This value can appear two ways: either
        the filename of a specific device driver, or an asterisk (*)
        followed immediately by the device name. The latter case
        refers to a virtual device that is in the WIN386.EXE file.
        Synonyms for device= are display=, keyboard=, network= and
        mouse=. Multiple device settings are required to run Windows
        in 386 enhanced mode.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Display=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the display device that is being used with Windows
        in 386 enhanced mode. This setting is a synonym to device=
        and exists to tell Setup which display device driver you are
        using.
To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DMABufferIn1MB=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates, if enabled, that the DMA buffer memory should be
        in the first 1 MB of memory in order to be compatible with
        8-bit bus master cards.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DMABufferSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 16
Purpose: Specifies the amount of memory to be reserved for buffered
        direct memory access (DMA). Windows in 386 enhanced mode will
        default to a DMA buffer size that will handle disk access.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DualDisplay=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: See purpose.
Purpose: Normally, when running in 386 enhanced mode, the memory
        between B000:0000 and B7FF:FFFF will be used by the general
        system unless a secondary display is detected. If this
        setting is enabled, this memory will be left unused and
        available for display adapters. If this setting is disabled,
        the address range will available on EGA systems but not under
        VGA systems, since the VGA display device supports monochrome
        modes, which use this address space.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EMMExclude=&lt;range&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies a range of memory that Windows will not consider
        using as an EMM page. This has the side effect of turning off
        the RAM and ROM search code for the range. The range (two
        paragraph values separated by a hyphen) must be between C000
        and EFFF. Windows normally scans this area to find unused
        address space. This scanning can interfere with some adapters
        that use the same memory area. Values are rounded to a
        multiple of 16K. For example, you could set
        EMMExclude=C800-CFFF to prevent Windows from scanning the
        addresses C800:0000 through CFFF:FFFF. You may specify
        multiple memory ranges by using this setting more than once.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EMMInclude=&lt;range&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies a range of memory that Windows will consider using
        as an EMM page regardless of what may be there. EMMInclude
        takes precedence over EMMExclude if you specify ranges that
        overlap. The range (two values separated by a hyphen) must be
        between C000 and EFFF. Values are rounded to the nearest 16K.
        You may specify multiple memory ranges by using this setting
        more than once.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EMMPageFrame=&lt;address&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the starting address where the 64K page frame will
        begin only when Windows in 386 enhanced mode cannot find a
        suitable page frame. Allows an EMM page frame in an area
        containing some unused RAM or ROM.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EMMSize=&lt;number-or-kilobytes&gt;
Default: -1
Purpose: Specifies the total amount of memory to be made available for
        mapping as expanded memory. The default allows all system
        memory to be allocated as EMM. You should specify a value for
        this setting if you run an application that allocates all of
        the available expanded memory. This will be apparent if, when
        you run the application, you can never create any new virtual
        machine. If this value is zero, then no expanded memory will
        be allocated, but the EMM driver will be loaded.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
FileSysChange=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: yes
Purpose: Indicates whether File Manager will automatically receive
        messages anytime a non-Windows application creates, renames,
        or deletes a file. By disabling this setting , a virtual
        machine can be run exclusively even when it manipulates
        files.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
global=&lt;device-name&gt;
Default: (all devices)
Purpose: Used to define DOS devices loaded in CONFIG.SYS that need to
        be global to the system. The default setting for all devices
        is global. But certain virtual devices might specify that a
        DOS device be local (for example, MS$MOUSE). Use this setting
        to override that local specification.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
HighFloppyReads=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: yes
Purpose: Normally, Windows turns a DMA verify to the area
        E000:0000-EFFF:FFFF into a read. In rare cases, this might
        cause the system to fail because some software might, as a
        result, write over the system's shadow RAM if you have it in
        this area. If this happens, disable this setting and set
        EMMExclude to E000-EFFF.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
IgnoreInstalledEMM=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Enabling this setting allows Windows to start in 386 enhanced
        mode even when there is an unknown expanded memory manager
        (EMM) running. This can cause the system to fail if
        memory-resident software was using EMM before Windows
        started. Enable this setting only if no such software is
        installed or you are sure it will not be active when you are
        running Windows. Note: This only applies to expanded memory
        managers servicing physical EMS hardware; Windows will not
        disable 80386 expanded memory emulators.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
InDOSPolling=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Some memory-resident software needs to be in a critical
        section to do operations off an INT21 hook. Enabling this
        setting assures that this will happen by preventing Windows
        from running other virtual machines when the memory-resident
        software has the InDOS flag set.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
IRQ9Global=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: If enabled, this setting converts IRQ9 masks to global.
        Enable if you are using software that leaves IRQ9 masks,
        therefore hanging the system.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Keyboard=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Tells Setup which keyboard driver is being used with Windows
        in 386 enhanced mode. This is a synonym to device=.
To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyBoostTime=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .001
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time an application gets to run with
        increased priority when it receives a keystroke. This setting
        can used to increase the response to keystrokes when several
        background applications are running.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyBufferDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .2
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time to delay processing keyboard
        input after the keyboard buffer is full. Some applications
        may require a larger value than the default.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyPasteDelay=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: .003
Purpose: Specifies how much time to wait before pasting any characters
        after a key has been pasted. Some applications may require
        more time than the default for recognition of a keystroke.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyPasteTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: 1
Purpose: Specifies how much time to allow an application to make the
        necessary BIOS calls after it reads keyboard input before
        Windows will setting from fast paste to slow paste keyboard
        input.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Local=&lt;device-name&gt;
Default: CON
Purpose: Used to define device drivers that need to be local to each
        virtual machine. This means a separate copy of the driver
        will exist in each virtual machine, and each will keep
        different state information. Most device drivers will not
        function properly when this setting is used. An exception is
        CON, the DOS console device, which should be local to avoid
        filling a buffer with input from multiple virtual machines.
To change: Use Notepad to edit SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
LPT1AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
LPT2AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
LPT3AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
LPT4AutoAssign=&lt;integer&gt;
Default: 60
Purpose: Indicates the contention detection value for each connected
        port. These values are used by Windows to determine how to
        arbitrate requests for the use of a device by more than one
        application, at least one of which is a non-Windows
        application. If the value is -1, Windows will display a
        warning message that asks the user which application should
        be given control of the port. If the value is 0, any
        application can use the device at any time. If the value is a
        positive integer less than 1,000, this value represents the
        number of seconds after an application stops using the device
        before another application can use the same device.
To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MapLargeNetTransfers=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Indicates whether to map a NetBIOS request when there is not
        enough buffer space to buffer it. Setting this setting to
        true may be useful if you do not want to use a lot of memory
        for buffers when running a network application that does
        large data transfers.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MapPhysAddress=&lt;range&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the address range (in MB) in which the memory
        manager will preallocate physical mappings. Use this setting
        if you are using a DOS device driver (such as an older
        version of RAMDrive that uses extended memory) that uses the
        INT15 MOVEBLOCK service to access memory allocated before
        Windows in 386 enhanced mode is started. Otherwise, if no
        memory is available, the MOVEBLOCK call may not be made.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MaxPagingFileSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the maximum size for a temporary swap file.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MinTimeSlice=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default: 20
Purpose: Specifies the minimum amount of time a virtual machine will
        be allowed to run before other virtual machines may take
        over. A smaller value (such as 1 millisecond) will make
        multitasking appear smoother, but will diminish the overall
        system performance.
To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MinUserDiskSpace=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 500
Purpose: Tells Windows how much disk space to leave free when creating
        a temporary swap file. You would want to use this setting if
        your system's paging drive has less available space than
        Windows can use for paging. This setting has no effect if a
        permanent swap file exists.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies the virtual device that handles the mouse hardware
        in 386 enhanced mode. This setting is a synonym for device=.
To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NetAsynchFallback=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: When an application issues an asynchronous NetBIOS request,
        Windows will attempt to allocate space in its global network
        buffer to receive the data. If there is insufficient space in
        the global buffer, Windows will normally fail the NetBIOS
        request. If this setting is enabled, Windows will attempt to
        save such a request by allocating a buffer in local memory
        and preventing any other VMs from running until the data is
        received and the timeout period (defined by NetAsynchTimeout)
        expires.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NetAsynchTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default: 5.0
Purpose: Specifies the timeout period (in seconds) when Windows needs
        to enter a critical section in order to service an
        asynchronous NetBIOS request. It is used only when
        NetAsynchFallback is enabled. This value can include a
        decimal (such as 0.5).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NetDMASize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 32 on Micro Channel machines
        0 on non-Micro Channel machines
Purpose: Specifies the DMA buffer size for NetBIOS transport software
        if a network has been installed. In this case, the buffer
        size is the larger value between this value and the value of
        DMABufferSize.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NetHeapSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 12
Purpose: Specifies the size of the buffers that Windows in 386
        enhanced mode allocates in conventional memory for
        transferring data over a network. All values are rounded up
        to the nearest 4K.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Network=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Tells Setup which type of network you are using. This setting
        is a synonym for device=.
To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main Group window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NMIReboot=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: If enabled, causes a reboot to occur when an NMI interrupt is
        received.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NoEMMDriver=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Causes Windows in 386 enhanced mode to not install its
        expanded memory driver. This differs from setting EMMSize to
        zero, which does not prevent the EMM driver from being
        loaded.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Paging=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: yes
Purpose: Enables or disables demand paging (virtual memory). You would
        disable this setting only if you need the disk space normally
        used for a temporary swap file.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PagingDrive=&lt;drive-letter&gt;
Default: (current drive)
Purpose: Specifies the disk drive where Windows in 386 enhanced mode
        will allocate a temporary swap file. If the current drive is
        a network drive, the swap file will be created on the same
        drive as the SYSTEM.INI file. If both are network drives,
        paging will be disabled.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ReflectDosInt2A=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows should consume or reflect DOS INT
        2A signals. The default means Windows will consume these
        signals and therefore run more efficiently.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ReservePageFrame=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: true
Purpose: Tells Windows whether to use up EMS page frame space when it
        allocates DOS transfer buffers below 640K. Leaving this
        setting disabled gives a non-Windows application more memory
        at the expense of EMS page frame space. Enable this setting
        only for an application that uses an EMS page frame.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SGrabLPT=&lt;port-number&gt;
Default: (current virtual machine)
Purpose: Routes all printer input on the specified port to the system
        virtual machine rather than the current virtual machine.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemRomBreakPoint=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: true
Purpose: Windows in 386 enhanced mode normally searches the ROM
        address space between F000 and 1 MB to find a special
        instruction that is used as a system break point. If this
        address space contains something other than permanently
        available ROM, you should disable this setting so that
        Windows will not use this space for a break point.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SystemVMPriority=&lt;number,number&gt;
Default: 100,50
Purpose: This setting contains two numbers. The first number specifies
        the relative amount of processing time (based on the
        MinTimeSlice setting) given to all Windows applications
        running in the foreground relative to the time allocated to
        all non-Windows applications running in the background. The
        second number specifies the relative amount of processing
        time given to all Windows applications running in the
        background when a non-Windows application is running in the
        foreground. The range of numbers that can be entered is 1
        through 10000. The important value is the ratio of these
        settings to the corresponding settings in the program
        information files (PIFs) of the active non-Windows
        applications.
To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMemsLimit=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of expanded memory Windows
        should be permitted to use. Leave this setting at zero to
        prevent Windows from gaining access to any expanded memory.
        Set it to -1 to give Windows all the available expanded
        memory that it requests.
To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
        window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMemsLocked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether to swap Windows' expanded memory to the
        hard disk. Locking EMS memory can improve Windows
        performance, but it slows down the rest of the system.
To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
        window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMemsRequired=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of expanded memory must be free
        in order to start Windows. Leave this setting at zero if no
        Windows application uses expanded memory.
To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
        window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMExclusive=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows always gets all of the computer's
        processing time whenever a Windows application is active. If
        this setting is enabled and a Windows application is in the
        foreground, no non-Windows applications will run.
To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMKBDesired=&lt;number-or-kilobytes&gt;
Default: -1
Purpose: Limits the amount of conventional memory Windows can use for
        itself. The default value indicates that Windows can use as
        much of this space as it needs. You can try entering a
        positive value if there is not enough memory to run Windows
        in 386 enhanced mode.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMKBRequired=&lt;number-or-kilobytes&gt;
Default: 256
Purpose: Specifies how much conventional memory (in KB) must be free
        in order to start Windows. Setting this setting to -1 gives
        Windows all available conventional memory.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMV86Locked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: Enabling this setting will cause the virtual-mode memory
        being used in the system VM to remain locked in memory rather
        that being swappable out to disk. Because Windows handles
        this process, there is no known reason to enable this
        setting.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMxmsLimit=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies the maximum amount of memory the XMS driver will
        allocate to DOS device drivers and memory-resident software
        in the system virtual machine. Set to -1 to give an
        application all the available extended memory that it
        requests.
To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
        window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMxmsLocked=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether to swap the memory allocated by the XMS
        driver to the hard disk. Locking the XMS memory can improve
        an application's performance, but it slows down the rest of
        the system.
To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
        window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMxmsRequired=&lt;kilobytes&gt;
Default: 0
Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of extended memory must be
        reserved by the XMS driver in order to start Windows. Leave
        this setting at zero if there are no XMS users in the system
        virtual machine.
To change: Choose the PIF Editor icon from the Accessories Group
        window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
TokenRingSearch=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: true
Purpose: Tells Windows whether to search for a token ring network
        adapter on AT architecture machines. Disable this setting if
        you are not using a token ring card and the search disables
        another device.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
TranslateScans=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: no
Purpose: Indicates whether Windows will translate a keyboard's scan
        codes to make them compatible with standard IBM scan codes.
        This setting is necessary only for keyboards that generate
        non-standard scan codes. This setting is used only for the
        Switcher Screen and message boxes.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
TrapFloppyFIFO=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: on for Micro Channel machines
        off for other machines
Purpose: Indicates whether to enable port trapping in the VFD. When
        trapping is enabled, the FIFO is never enabled. FIFO can
        interfere with DMA. Normally, you should disable this setting
        if there is a port conflict (port is 03F3h).
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
UniqueDOSPSP=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: false
Purpose: If enabled, this setting tells Windows in 386 enhanced mode
        to reserve some paragraphs of memory in each virtual machine
        (VM) prior to starting an application in the VM. This will
        usually ensure that each application has a unique PSP
        (loading address). Some networks use the PSP to identify a
        process to make sure that two processes do not try to modify
        a file at the same time. On such networks, running with this
        setting disabled may result in corrupted files. However,
        enabling this setting will take memory away from each
        application.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
UseInstFile=&lt;filename&gt;
Default: none
Purpose: Specifies a data file that the DOS Manager device (DOSMGR)
        should use to determine whether data structures within DOS
        need to be local. There are two other methods to do this:
        internal tables within the device, and an INT 2fh call
        documented in the OEM Adaptation Kit. Both methods are
        preferred to using this setting; it is provided only for
        compatibility with Windows/386 Version 2.x.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
VirtualHDIrq=&lt;Boolean&gt;
Default: on
Purpose: Allows Windows in 386 enhanced mode to terminate interrupts
        from hard disk controller, bypassing the ROM routine that
        handles these interrupts. Some hard drives might require that
        this setting be disabled in order for interrupts to be
        processed correctly. If this setting is disabled, the ROM
        routine handles the interrupts, which slows the system's
        performance.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WindowUpdateTime=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default: 50
Purpose: Specifies the amount of time Windows takes between updates of
        the display for a windowed non-Windows application.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
