The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.0 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.0b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.0b, both of which are located in the System Folder of the
Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


Initially, only those Microsoft Mail users registered on the gateway server can
exchange messages with the gateway's external mail service. Creating a
gateway-access server allows users on the access server to exchange messages
with the external mail service as well.

Gateway-access servers are created by using the Gateway Installer to first
extract access-server resources from an existing gateway server and then using
the Gateway Installer to install those resources on Mail servers that you want
to have access to the gateway. These resources include the gateway address
dialog box in the Address Mail window for specifying gateway recipients and can
include the forms to send, read, and print gateway messages. Please note that in
Mail version 3.0, you can make all servers in a site gateway-access servers. For
more information, query on the following words:

  "access" (without the quotation marks) and "gateway" (without the quotation
  marks) and "site" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, suppose you have a company with 10 Microsoft Mail servers and only
one modem, and users on four different Mail servers need access to AppleLink. To
give all these users access to AppleLink, set one of the four Mail servers up as
a gateway server and the other three as gateway-access servers.

When a user on an access server sends a message to a recipient on the external
service, the access server forwards the Mail message to the Mail server that is
its gateway server. The gateway server, depending on its gateway accounts and
connect times, sends the mail message to the external service.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
