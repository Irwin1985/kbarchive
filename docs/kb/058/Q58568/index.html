This article explains how to use the Customize Menu command in the
Utility menu in the QBX.EXE (QuickBASIC Extended) environment. The
Customize Menu command allows you to add your own DOS commands
(internal, external, or batch files) to the Utility menu. This
provides easy access to these commands rather than having to shell out
to DOS and type them in at the command line prompt.

This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

The following is a brief summary of the features of the Customize Menu
dialog box:

Applications List - A list of the DOS commands already included in the
                    Utility menu.

Add button        - Adds a new command to the Applications List. For
                    details, see farther below.

Edit button       - Edits the information associated with a command
                    already in the Applications List.

Delete button     - Deletes a command from the Applications List.

To Begin button   - Puts the currently selected command at the top of
                    the Applications List.

To End button     - Puts the currently selected command at the bottom
                    of the Applications List.

Save button       - Saves all the changes made to the Applications
                    List and closes the Customize Menu dialog box.

Cancel button     - Cancels all the changes made to the Applications
                    List and closes the Customize Menu dialog box.

Help button       - Provides online help for using the Customize
                    Menu command.

The Customize Menu command in the Utility menu is a handy way to
execute DOS-level commands from inside the QBX.EXE environment. It
allows you to execute internal commands, external commands, and batch
files by selecting a menu item with the keyboard or mouse. There is no
need to shell out to DOS. When the command or batch file is finished,
you can be prompted to "press any key to continue" or you can specify
for QBX to reappear automatically.

Adding, deleting, editing, and ordering commands in the Utility menu
is very simple, and the discussion above should be adequate enough for
every feature except the Add button, which is discussed below in
detail.

Add Button
----------

When selected, the Add button brings up another dialog box containing
edit fields that are used to enter information about the command to be
added. The following is a list of the edit fields and buttons of this
dialog box and information about each one:

Menu Text (20 chars) - Enter the name you want displayed in the
                       Utility menu. This name will also appear in the
                       Applications List. This may or may not be the
                       name of the actual command.

Pathname             - Enter the name of the command if it is internal
                       or the full path to the file if it is external
                       or a batch file. For example, "DIR" or
                       "C:\CHKDSK".

Arguments            - Enter the arguments passed to the command. For
                       example, this may be "a:" if the command is
                       "FORMAT" or "/w" if the command is "DIR", etc.

Initial Directory    - Enter the name of the directory you want the
                       command to operate in.

Prompt Before        - Select this option if you want to be prompted
Returning              with "press any key to continue" before control
                       is returned to QBX.

Accelerator Key      - Select the None button if you do not want to
                       use an accelerator key or select the ALT+F
                       button if you do. The values that may be
                       entered into the box following ALT+F range from
                       2 to 10, specifying the function keys F2
                       through F10.

OK button            - Select this button when you are satisfied with
                       the information in the dialog box. The Add
                       dialog box closes and the name of the new
                       command is added to the Applications List.
                       However, none of the changes to the Utility
                       menu are saved unless the Save button is
                       selected.

Cancel button        - This button cancels the information entered in
                       the edit fields and closes the Add dialog box.

Help button          - This button displays more online help.

Below is a step-by-step example illustrating how to use the Customize
Menu command. This example shows how to add the DOS command "DIR" to
the Utility menu. This DIR command operates on the current directory
and uses the "/w" parameter to display the listing in many columns
rather than one. Also, an accelerator key (ALT+F5) is linked to the
command for easy keyboard access and the user is prompted to "press
any key to continue" after the DIR command is finished.

 1. Choose Customize Menu from the Utility menu. This can be done by
    holding down the ALT and U keys together, followed by the C key
    alone.

 2. The Customize Menu dialog box appears. Press the TAB key once to
    highlight the Add button and then press ENTER.

 3. Another dialog box appears, containing edit fields used to enter
    information about the command. The cursor is placed in the top
    edit field, "Menu Text (20 chars)." Type in "DIR" for this field
    and press TAB.

 4. The cursor advances to the next edit field, "Pathname". Since DIR
    is an internal command, it has no path, so you only need to enter
    the name of the command by itself, "DIR". Do this and press TAB
    again.

 5. The next edit field is "Arguments". A common argument to pass to
    the DIR command is "/w".  The "/w" argument (called a switch)
    breaks the directory listing into columns rather than listing them
    in one long column, which frequently scrolls off the screen. Type
    "/w" and press TAB.

 6. For the "Initial Directory" edit field, you can enter any valid
    pathname. Leaving this field blank causes the command to use the
    current pathname. Press TAB to leave it blank.

 7. The cursor is now placed inside the button titled "Prompt Before
    Returning." You can press SPACEBAR to toggle this button on or
    off. Toggle it on and press TAB.

 8. The cursor advances to the button titled "None". By default it is
    also selected, specifying that no accelerator key is to be defined
    for accessing the DOS command from the Utility menu. To enter an
    accelerator key, press the RIGHT ARROW. This toggles the None
    button off and the ALT+F button on. Press TAB to advance the
    cursor to the edit field following the ALT+F button and enter a 5
    (specifying F5). Press ENTER to continue.

 9. The current dialog box closes and the main Customize Menu dialog
    box reappears. You will see that "DIR" has been added to the
    Applications List. Press TAB until the Save button is highlighted,
    then press ENTER.

10. The Customize Menu dialog box closes. You can now choose the DIR
    command from the Utility menu either by pulling down the menu and
    then choosing DIR or you can use the accelerator key sequence,
    ALT+F5. After displaying the contents of the current directory, you
    will be prompted with "press any key to continue" before control is
    returned to QBX.
