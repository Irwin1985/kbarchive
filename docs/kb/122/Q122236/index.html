SYMPTOMS
========

After calling CStringArray::Add() many times, unusually large amounts of memory
become allocated to the application and not freed until the application
terminates. This behaviour may be seen in the other array collection classes
such as CObArray and CPtrArray as well.

CAUSE
=====

Each time a call to Add() is made, the array may grow. Memory needs to be
allocated to accommodate the new size of the array. The array is copied to the
new block of memory and the old memory is freed for re-use. The Visual C++
run-time heap allocator doesn't return freed memory to the system but instead
marks the memory block as unused so that it can re-use the memory later.

For each call to Add() that causes the array to be re-allocated, the old block is
marked as unused. The sections marked as unused won't get re-used by the next
call to Add() because the array is too large to fit into the unused section.
Other allocations (such as the CString) prevent adjacent free unused blocks of
memory from being combined into a bigger block of unused memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

A developer using an array data structure typically knows the size of the array
before allocating memory for it. However, if you don't know the size, you must
re-allocate the array as it grows. This means that a new memory block must be
allocated and the data from the old memory block must be copied to the new block
before the old memory block is freed. This can cost time.

To work around the problem, call the member function SetSize() with the
approximate size of the array. If you are uncertain about the size of the array,
minimize the amount of memory reallocations by specifying a larger size to allow
room to grow. The first parameter to SetSize() allows you to change the size of
the array and the second parameter allows you to change the grow size. For
example:

     CStringArray array;
        array.SetSize(100,100);

Here the array will be allocated an original 100 elements. When the 100 elements
have been used and Add() is called for the 101st element, the array memory block
will be reallocated to handle an additional 100 elements for a total of 200
elements.

Alternatively, SetSize(0, 100) would cause the initial size for the array to be
zero and an Add() would have to be done before any elements could be filled.
This first Add() in this scenario would cause 100 elements to be allocated for
use by the array.
