312    Failed to construct the instruction file.

313    The package source directory cannot be found.

314    Failed to update the job source.

315    The job handler encountered an error attempting to place the send
      request in the unscheduled outbox. Possible causes are: the server
      holding the Scheduler's unscheduled outbox is not reachable (server
      may be off the network); or there may already be a send request with
      the same ID (A) in the unscheduled outbox (should not happen).

316    The job encountered an error while sending data or performing
      operations relating to the destination site. Possible causes are: X
      addresses to the destination site may be invalid (server or account
      information may be incorrect); the destination site server may not
      be running; or there may be communications or other sending-related
      errors.

317    The job encountered an error while sending a remote cancel
      instruction. The job information has already reached the destination
      site, requiring a cancel instruction to be sent to that destination
      site, informing the site to stop processing the job. Possible causes
      are: addresses to the destination site may be invalid (server or
      account information may be incorrect); the destination site server
      may not be running; or there may be communications or other sending-
      related errors.

318    The job cannot access the specified query (A) and therefore cannot
      generate the list of target workstations for the job. Possible
      causes are: SQL server is not responding; a blank queryname was
      specified; or the query was deleted after the job was created.

319    The job encountered an error trying to process the specified machine
      path (A) and therefore cannot generate the list of target
      workstations for the job. Possible causes are: an invalid site name
      or site code was specified (site groups are not allowed); the PC
      architecture has not been defined yet; or a fatal low-memory
      condition was encountered.

320    The job encountered an error trying to execute a query and there
      forecannot generate the list of target workstations for the job.
      Possible causes are: SQL server is not available; or a fatal low-
      memory condition was encountered.

321    The job encountered an error trying to reach the Job Details table
      and therefore cannot generate the list of target workstations for
      the job. Possible causes are: SQL Server is not started; SQL Server
      logon account is invalid; a named-pipe connection to the server
      running SQLServer cannot be established; or the maximum user
      connections for SQL Server has been reached.

322    The job encountered an error trying to insert a record into the Job
      Details table and therefore cannot generate the list of target
      workstations for the job. Possible causes are: SQL server is not
      available.

323    The job has been failed without performing any actions, because the
      generated list of target workstations was empty. The provided query,
      machine group, or machine path, along with any site limiting,
      resulted in zero machines being targeted. Therefore, the job has
      nothing to do.

324    The job encountered an error trying to generate the list of
      destination sites. Possible causes are: SQL server is not available.

325    The job encountered an error trying to reach the Requests table and
      therefore cannot be activated. Possible causes are: SQL Server is
      not started; SQL Server logon account is invalid; a named-pipe
      connection to the server running SQL Server cannot be established;
      or the maximum user connections for SQL Server has been reached.

326    The job encountered an error trying to insert a record into the
      Requests table and therefore cannot be activated. Possible causes
      are: SQL server is not available.

327    The job encountered an error trying to connect to the registry while
      updating job status. Job status updating will be skipped for this
      cycle.

328    The job encountered an error trying to read the registry while
      updating job status. Job status updating will be skipped for this
      cycle.

329    An error occured while trying to compress the contents of the source
      directory specified for the workstation version of the package.
      Possible causes are:  the source directory specified is invalid or
      cannot be accessed by the compression process;  or, there was
      insufficient disk space to compress the contents of the source
      directory.

330    An error occured while trying to compress the contents of the source
      directory specified for the server version of the package. Possible
      causes are: the source directory specified is invalid or cannot be
      accessed by the compression process; or, there was insufficient disk
      space to compress the contents of the source directory.

331    An error occured while trying to compress the source directory or
      file associated with the job. Possible causes are: the source
      directory or file does not exist orcannot be accessed by the
      compression process; or, there was insufficient disk space to
      compress the contents of the source directory or file.

332    The system cannot find any defined addresses by which this site can
      send to a destination site for the job. Possible causes are: no
      addresses have been defined between this site and the destination
      site; the SMS site server registry (which holds the address list) is
      not active and on the network; or, SMS_SCHEDULER does not have
      sufficient rights to access the SMS site server registry.

333    Cannot read registry on Server X. Check for missing SMS keys in
      registry.

334    Cannot update Site Table for site X. Check Sites table and SQL
      Server.

335    First config job created for site X. %5

336    Cannot read Site Control file for site X from database on SQL
      Server Y. Check SQL Server and Site Control table.

337    Cannot write Site Control file for site X to database on SQL Server
      Y. Check SQL Server and Site Control table.

338    Cannot write Site Control file to the SITE.SRV\SITECFG.BOX. Check
      for directory existence.

339    Site Control file X has bad or unknown type. Check for corrupted
      file.

340    Cannot read the Site Control file X. Check for locked or corrupted
      file.

341    Site X had bad or unknown status value in Sites table. Check SQL
      Tables.

342    Cannot change to working directory X. Check for directory existence.

343    Cannot connect to Job Source [SQL]. Check SQL Server and Jobs table.

344    Cannot insert a job into Job Source [SQL]. Check SQLServer and Jobs
      table.

345    Cannot read Job X from SQL tables. Check SQLServer and Jobs table.

346    Cannot generate a new send request for remote site intallation.

347    No address is available to reach site X. Cannot create a job.

348    Remote site install package created. X files copied to make package.
