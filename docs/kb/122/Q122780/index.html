SUMMARY

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains Out of Office Server (OOF Server), a replacement for the

  the OOF Server.

- The error "No such card" will not stop the processing of the OOF Server.

- Mail server names that include commas can now be registered in the Configured
  Servers list.

To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Ofupd.hqx

Release Date: Oct-17-1994

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


To update your OOF Server file
------------------------------

  NOTE: Currently, no automated solution is available to migrate users from one
  OOF Server stack to another.

Before you replace your OOF Server, you should notify users that they will need
to re-register with the OOF Server after the update is complete. Or, you can
follow the instructions under the heading, "Manually Migrating Users' Accounts
Between OOF Servers," to migrate users to the new stack.

NOTE: The OOF Server file is in a self-extracting archive (.SEA) format as well
as in Bin-Hex (.HQX) format to allow you to use an MS-DOS- formatted disk. To
access the workstation software, you need to decode the file using a decoding
utility, such as StuffIt or Compact Pro. These utilities can be found on most
major bulletin boards, such as America Online and AppleLink.

1. If you download MACLIENT.SEA, go to step 2.

  If you download the .HQX file, use one of the decoding utilities, such as
  StuffIt or Compact Pro, to decode the file into its original format by doing
  the following:

   - To use StuffIt: From the Other menu, choose Bin-Hex. Then select Decode
     Bin-Hex File.

  -or-

   - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM BinHex4.

  The utility will generate a Macintosh file called OOFUPD.SEA in the same
  location as the original file.

2. Double-click the OOFUPD.SEA to extract the updated OOF Server file.

3. Locate your current Out of Office Server stack. If the stack is running, stop
  processing, and quit HyperCard.

4. Rename the existing Out of Office Server to Out of Office Server.old.

5. Drag the Out of Office Server file from where you ran the self- extracting
  file to the desired location on your hard disk.

6. Double-click the new Out of Office Server file and reconfigure.

For more information about how to configure the Out of Office Server, see the Out
of Office Server documentation.

Manually Migrating Users' Accounts Between OOF Servers
------------------------------------------------------

Because each user's account is stored on a separate card in the OOF Server
database, you can move the accounts by copying and pasting cards from one stack
to another.

1. Open the old OOF Server in HyperCard.

2. From the File menu, choose Open Stack. Select the Open Stack In New Window
  check box. Locate the new copy of the OOF Server stack and click Open.

3. From the Main screen on the New stack, click the DataBase button to move to
  the blank database card.

4. Switch back to the old copy of the stack. Click the DataBase button to move
  to the blank database card. Use the Next button to move to the first user in
  the database.

5. From the Edit menu, choose Copy Card.

6. Switch to the new stack, confirm that the first database card is still
  showing, and choose Paste Card from the Edit menu.

7. Complete steps 4-6 for each user in the database.

8. Reconfigure the stack using the Configuration screen.
