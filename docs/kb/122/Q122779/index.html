The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the GW file that is included with version
3.2 of Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the GW file, see the
following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your GW file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the GW file, a replacement for the GW file included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks. This
update includes the following modifications:


- The GW file will handle *Special messages. The *Special messages are
  generated when the Mail administrator exports a downstream postoffice address
  list (PAL) to the Connection gateway by selecting External-Admin, Export, All
  in the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) included with Microsoft Mail
  for PC Networks.


  NOTE: Previously these messages were not recognized by the Connection gateway
  and would be returned to the originating postoffice. As a result, the
  postoffice address list would be added to the MACNET\MACPO address list on
  the originating postoffice. When the global address list (GAL) was rebuilt,
  the local users would appear in the GAL twice. One address would reference
  the local postoffice, and the other address would reference the MACNET\MACPO
  proxy postoffice. The Connection GW will no longer return these messages to
  the originating postoffice.

- The GW file will successfully transfer multiple attachments when you use Mail
  for PC Networks to connect two Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks servers
  and one of the attachments has a filename greater than 13 characters.


- The GW file will successfully transfer multiple attachments when you use Mail
  for PC Networks to connect two Mail for AppleTalk Networks servers and one of
  the attachments has a space embedded in the attachment's name (for example,
  Read Me).

- The GW file will generate a non-delivery report (NDR) notifying mail users
  that the recipient at an unknown or invalid address did not receive their
  message. Also, if a message is sent to the Bad Mail folder due to an invalid
  address, the message will not be deleted; the sender will receive an NDR.

- If you use a modified 80-column form where the only modification is the Form
  ID, your message will be corrupt when you send it to a Mail for PC Networks
  user. The updated GW will no longer corrupt the message.


- When a Mail for PC Networks user sends a message to several Mail for
  AppleTalk Networks users via the Mail Connection Gateway and one or more of
  the native AppleTalk Mail addresses are invalid (for example, baduser@macmail
  is not a valid address), the message is not delivered to any AppleTalk user,
  and a non-delivery report is sent to the sender.


- If your Mail for AppleTalk Servers are using a Mail for PC Networks backbone
  to communicate and a message is sent from one Macintosh server to another
  with an attachment that has a name ending in a hyphen (for example,
  TEST.DOC-), the receiving Macintosh will crash upon receipt of the message.
  The updated GW will no longer crash the receiving Macintosh.


- On a Windows client for HP Open Mail, replying to or forwarding a message
  from the Macintosh causes Mail Connection Gateway to hang. The updated GW no
  longer hangs the gateway.


To download the updated file
----------------------------

You should receive the following files:

  GW (137,097 bytes, dated 06-06-95, 4:48 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your GW file
----------------------

NOTE: The GW file is in a self-extracting archive (.SEA) format as well as in
Bin-Hex (.HQX) format to allow you to use an MS-DOS-formatted disk. To access
the workstation software, you need to decode the file using a decoding utility,
such as StuffIt or Compact Pro. These utilities can be found on most major
bulletin boards.

From an IBM or compatible computer
----------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\gwupd.hqx &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive and directory where you downloaded the
  GWUPD.HQX file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
  postoffice currently resides. For example, if you downloaded the file to the
  TEST directory on drive D and the postoffice is located in the MAILDATA
  directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\gwupd.hqx c:\maildata " (without the quotation marks)

2. From the gateway server Macintosh, mount the postoffice volume (the volume
  may already be mounted for gateway access) and copy the GWUPD.HQX file to the
  Macintosh's hard disk.

3. From the gateway server Macintosh, use one of the decoding utilities, such as
  StuffIt or Compact Pro, to decode the file into its original format by doing
  the following:

   - To use StuffIt or StuffIt Expander: From the Other menu, choose Bin- Hex.
     Then select Decode Bin-Hex File.

     -or-

   - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM BinHex4.

  NOTE: Both utilities will generate a Macintosh-formatted file called GWUPD.SEA
  in the same location as the original file.

4. The GWUPD.SEA file is a self-extracting archive file. Double-click the icon
  to extract the updated GW file.

  See the "To update the gateway on the AppleTalk Mail gateway server" section
  below.

From an Apple Macintosh
-----------------------

1. If you download GWUPD.SEA, go to step 2.

  If you download the .HQX file, use one of the decoding utilities, such as
  StuffIt or Compact Pro, to decode the file into its original format by doing
  the following:

   - To use StuffIt: From the Other menu, choose Bin-Hex. Then select Decode
     Bin-Hex File.

     -or-

   - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM BinHex4.

  NOTE: Both utilities will generate a Macintosh file called GWUPD.SEA in the
  same location as the original file.

2. Copy the file to the AppleTalk Mail gateway server. Double-click the icon to
  extract the updated GW file.

  See the "To update the gateway on the AppleTalk Mail gateway server" section
  below.

To update the gateway on the AppleTalk Mail gateway server
----------------------------------------------------------

1. From the Apple menu, choose Microsoft Mail, and then sign in as the Network
  Manager. If you are already signed in as Network Manager, you can skip this
  step.

2. On the gateway server hard disk, open the MS Mail Connection 3.2 folder.

3. Open the Connection Installer folder and double-click the Connection
  Installer icon.

4. In the Gateways Installed On This Server box, select the MS Mail Connection
  gateway.

5. From the Gateway menu, choose Update Gateway.

6. When the Select A Gateway Update File dialog box appears, select the GW file
  extracted in the procedure above and choose the Update button.

7. When the Please Pick The Gateway Templates To Install dialog box appears,
  select the templates for any Mail for PC Networks gateways you want to
  exchange mail, and then choose the OK button.

8. From the File menu, choose Quit to exit the Connection Installer.

9. Return to Mail for AppleTalk Networks, still signed in as the Network
  Manager, and choose Gateway Configuration from the Mail menu. If you have
  more than one gateway installed, select the Connection icon from the left
  side of the Gateway Configuration dialog box.

10. When the Please Locate The Connection Store (MacGate) Directory dialog box
  appears, choose the OK button.

11. When the Directory dialog box appears, locate the folder containing the Mail
  data files on the Mail for PC Networks gateway postoffice and double-click
  the MacGate folder.

12. When the Gateway Configuration dialog box appears, choose the Update button.
  A message will appear on the screen to indicate "Writing the MACGATE.INI
  File to the Connection Store." Click the close box or press ESC to close the
  dialog box.

  NOTE: You will not lose Gateway Recipients, and it is not necessary to update
  the access servers. Only the gateway server update is required.
