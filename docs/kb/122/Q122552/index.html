Product(s): Microsoft SNA Server
Version(s): WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1,3.0
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): kbnetwork
Last Modified: 12-JUN-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the SNA Server Windows 3.x client software configured to use the
SNA Server Microsoft Networking (Named Pipes) Interface, the SNA client
component (WNAP.EXE) may fail to start and the following error messages may
appear (using both the 5250 emulator and 3270 emulator):

Using 5250 Emulator
-------------------

  SNA Server Error: 629 No SNA Server configuration broadcast received

  -or-

  SNA Server Error: 546 Cannot establish connection with SNA Server
  &lt;servername&gt;.

Using 3270 Emulator
-------------------

  SNA Server Error: 629 No SNA Server configuration broadcast received

  -or-

  SNA Server Error: 546 Cannot establish connection with SNA Server
  &lt;servername&gt;.

  Error: The NAP is not started.

NOTE: When these error messages appear, the SNA Server client icon (WNAP.EXE) is
gray when it loads at the bottom of the screen, and it disappears when the error
messages appear.

CAUSE
=====

Error 629 occurs when the client cannot find an SNA Server in the local domain.
Apart from networking problems, this error may occur if the Local Domain option
is selected, and the Workgroup field of the Control Panel Network applet
displays a value other than the intended Domain name.

Each of the following can cause error 546:

- You are using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and the computer is configured to
  use Microsoft IPX/SPX compatible transport (the default).

- The client cannot open a session to the server.

- You do not have access rights on the Windows NT server.

- You are running SNA Server 2.11 and you have only one seat configured in the
  License Server.

Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Microsoft IPX/SPX Compatible

Transport to Access a Windows NT Server
---------------------------------------

For complete details about the problem using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and
IPX/SPX compatible transport to access a Windows NT 3.5 server, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  SNA and 546 and NWLINK

Client Cannot Open a Session to the Server
------------------------------------------

If you select the Remote Domain option while installing the SNA Server client,
you are prompted to enter the primary or backup SNA Server name. If the client
cannot open a session to one of these SNA Servers (for example, if the server
name was not entered correctly, or if an underlying network connection problem
exists), the SNA client displays error 546.

The Client Does Not Find an SNA Server in the Domain
----------------------------------------------------

When the SNA Server client software is configured to use the Local Domain option,
the client software sends a NetBIOS broadcast message to the domain and listens
for a broadcast response from any server in the domain. If the client's
workgroup name and/or domain name is different than the domain name of the SNA
Server, the server will not see this message. On a Windows for Workgroups
client, ensure that the Enterprise Network option to Log on to Windows NT or LAN
Manager Domain is selected in the Networks option in Control Panel, and that the
Domain name is correct. In addition, if the client and server are separated by a
router, and this router does not pass NetBIOS broadcasts (such as with an IP
router), this will also fail.

The User Does Not Have Access Rights on the Windows NT Server
-------------------------------------------------------------

Once the client computer locates the server, the SNA Server client software
attempts to open a named pipe session with the server. If the user does not have
rights to open a session to the server, the open request fails.

NOTE: The cause of the error messages above is different when the system runs on
NetWare IPX/SPX, Banyan IP, or TCP/IP. Refer to the appropriate documentation
describing possible causes of this error when you are using these other SNA
Server client connection options.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

- Make sure that the Workgroup entry in the Control Panel Network applet dialog
  box contains the local domain name if the Local Domain option is selected.

- If the client does not find an SNA Server in the local domain, run the SNA
  Server client setup program and configure the client for the Remote Domain
  option, and provide the name of an SNA Server in the domain you want to
  connect to.

  NOTE: When connecting over TCP/IP and there is a router separating the SNA
  Server and the client, the Windows for Workgroups computer requires a method
  of resolving NetBIOS names to an IP address. If you are using the real mode
  TCP/IP stack, an LMHOSTS file or a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
  server may be used. (To use the WINS server with the real mode stack, you
  must be using the real mode TCP/IP stack shipped with Windows NT version
  3.5.)

- If the user does not have access rights on the Windows NT server, grant the
  user access to the Windows NT computer where SNA Server is running. You can
  do this either through a specific user account or by enabling the Guest
  account.

- If Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is being used and the Microsoft IPX/SPX
  compatible transport is installed, add "Directhost=no" (without the quotation
  marks) to the [network] section of SYSTEM.INI file on the Windows for
  Workgroups 3.11 client computer, and then reboot the computer.

- If you are running SNA Server 2.11 and you have only one seat configured in
  the License Server, increase the number of seats to the number of clients you
  will have plus one seat.
