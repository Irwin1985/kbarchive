SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the Internal Administrative Alerts messages, its threshold
values, and the explanations that the Windows NT Server version 3.5 generates
when there are problems with the Server and the network. These are different

add computers to receive these alerts, go to the Control Panel, choose the
Server icon and select Alerts.

  error log. The server and/or network hardware may need service.

- There is a problem with a configuration of user specified shut down command
  file. The UPS service started anyway.

  request.

- A disk error occurred on the HPFS volume in drive %1. The error occurred
  while processing a remote request.

  is replacing the corrupted NET.ACC with the backup made on %1 at %2. Any
  updates made to the database after this time are lost.

- The user accounts database (NET.ACC) is missing. The local security system is
  restoring the backup database made on %1 at %2. Any updates made to the
  database after this time are lost.

- Local security could not be started because the user accounts database
  (NET.ACC) was missing or corrupted, and no usable backup database was
  present. THE SYSTEM IS NOT SECURE.

- The server cannot export directory %1, to client %2. It is exported from
  another server.

- The replication server could not update directory %2 from the source on %3
  due to error %1.

- Master %1 did not send an update notice for directory %2 at the expected
  time.

- User %1 has exceeded account limitation %2 on server %3.

  is not retrieving the updates.

- The update log on %1 is full, and no further updates can be added until the
  primary domain controller %2 retrieves the updates.

- The time difference with the primary domain controller %1 exceeds the maximum
  allowed skew of %2 seconds.

  A previous working configuration was used instead.

- The exception 0x%1 occurred in the application %2 at location 0x%3.

- The servers %1 and %3 both claim to be an NT Domain Controller for the %2
  domain. One of the servers should be removed from the domain because the
  servers have different security identifiers (SID).

- The server %1 and %2 both claim to be the primary domain controller for the
  %3 domain. One of the servers should be demoted or removed from the domain.
