SYMPTOMS
========

When allocating and deleting an object of a class that is exported from a DLL,
you may find that the new operator in the EXE is called to allocate the memory
but the delete operator in the DLL is called to delete the memory. Therefore,
there is a new/delete mismatching problem, which may cause run-time errors.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is a result of the way objects are allocated, constructed,
destructed and deallocated. The following things occur when allocating and
deallocating objects that have constructors and destructors:

Allocating:

  A1. The memory that the object will reside in is allocated.
  A2. The appropriate constructor for that object is called.

Deallocating:

  D1. The destructor for the object is called.
  D2. If the object is being deallocated via delete, call delete.

Step D2 is where the problem arises for objects created from classes exported
from a DLL. Steps D1 and D2 are often carried out by a scalar or vector deleting
destructor, which are a compiler generated helper functions. When this helper
function is created in the DLL, any calls it makes to the delete operator will
be in the context of the DLL. Therefore the delete operator overridden in the
EXE will not be called as expected.

Note that the scalar deleting destructor is called when deallocating single
objects, and the vector deleting destructor is called when deallocating arrays
of one or more objects.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use one of the following workarounds:

1. If your code does not use virtual destructors, make the constructor and
  destructor for the object inline, and put the actual work into your own
  helper functions. If the destructor is inline, the code and the compiler
  generated helper functions (if present) are in the EXE and so the proper
  operator delete is called.

  If the destructor is virtual, this work-around won't work. This is because
  virtual functions can be called through base class pointers, usually known as
  run-time binding or dynamic binding. Which function is called is determined
  at runtime through the v-table. Since inlining is generated at compile time,
  runtime binding is not possible if the functions are actually inlined.

  - or -

2. Override the operators new and delete for the DLL classes so that the
  new/delete calls usage will be made within the DLL. A class with its own
  version of new and delete will override any global version of new and delete
  defined in either the EXE or the DLL. Therefore the proper new and delete
  will always be called. Please see the sample code below in the MORE
  INFORMATION section.

  - or -

3. If you are using Visual C++ 2.0 or later, try using a template wrapper class.
  By using this templated class, you are deriving a class "on the fly" from the
  imported class. The constructor and the destructor for the new class are in
  the context of the EXE and not in the context of the DLL and the problem will
  be avoided. Please see the sample code below in the MORE INFORMATION
  section.

  If you are using Visual C++ 16-bit editions, you can derive a class from the
  DLL exported class in the EXE file, so the constructor and the destructor for
  the new class are in the context of the EXE and not in the context of the DLL
  and the problem also will be avoided.

  - or -

4. If you use Visual C++ 5.0 or later, a new implementation of new/delete is
  available which is virtually transparent. To invoke this new implementation
  you must:

  a. Specify _declspec(dllexport) in the class declaration when you implement
     the class.

  b. Specify _declspec(dllimport) in the class declaration when you use the
     class.

  c. Use a virtual destructor.

  If these requirements aren't met, the compiler generates code using the same
  new/delete implementation that was present in the previous version of the
  product.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code demonstrates the problem and provides the workarounds
mentioned above in the RESOLUTION section.

1. Sample Code Illustrates the Problem and Workaround #2
--------------------------------------------------------

Use the following files to build two projects, one for DLL and one for EXE. In
the DLL project, include file testdll.cpp and define preprocessor identifier
_DLL. In the EXE project, include file testapp.cpp. testdll.h is the shared
header file for both DLL and EXE.

Make sure to define preprocessor identifier _WORKAROUND in both the EXE and the
DLL projects if you want to work around the problem. For example, using the
compiler switch /D_WORKAROUND.

The problem code produces the following output:

  In EXE global new
  In DLL class constructor
  In DLL class destructor
  In DLL global delete

The workaround code produces the following output:

  In DLL class new
  In DLL class constructor
  In DLL class destructor
  In DLL class delete

  /* Compile options needed:
   *    testapp - /MD  and default settings for Console application.
   *    testdll - /MD, /D_DLL, and default setting for DLL project.
   *    Use /D_WORKAROUND in both the EXE and DLL projects to see the
   *    work-around.
   */ 

testdll.h
---------

     #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
     #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

     #ifdef _DLL
     #define DLLEXP __declspec(dllexport)
     #else
     #define DLLEXP __declspec(dllimport)
     #endif

     // For use with the 16-bit versions, you need to use the following code
     // to define DLLEXP. Also start by using a QuickWin application for
     // testapp and a DLL project for testdll

     //#ifdef _DLL
     //#define DLLEXP __export
     //#else
     //#define DLLEXP
     //#endif

     class DLLEXP testdll
     {
       public:

        testdll();
        virtual ~testdll();

     #ifdef _WORKAROUND
        void* operator new( size_t tSize );
        void  operator delete( void* p );
     #endif

     };

testapp.cpp
-----------

     #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
     #include "testdll.h"

     void* operator new(size_t nSize)
     {
        void* p=malloc(nSize);
        cout &lt;&lt; "In EXE global new\n";
        return p;
     }

     void operator delete( void *p )
     {
        free(p);
        cout &lt;&lt; "In EXE global delete\n";
     }

     void main()
     {

        testdll *p = new testdll;
        delete p;
     }

testdll.cpp
-----------

     #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
     #include "testdll.h"

     DLLEXP testdll::testdll()
     {
       cout &lt;&lt; "In class DLL constructor\n";
     }

     DLLEXP testdll::~testdll()
     {
       cout &lt;&lt; "In class DLL destructor\n";
     }

     void* operator new( size_t tSize )
     {
        void* p=malloc(tSize);
        cout &lt;&lt; "In DLL global new\n";
        return p;
     }

     void operator delete( void* p )
     {
        free(p);
        cout &lt;&lt; "In DLL global delete\n";
     }

     #ifdef _WORKAROUND
     DLLEXP void* testdll :: operator new( size_t tSize )
     {
        void* p=malloc(tSize);
        cout &lt;&lt; "In DLL class new\n";
        return p;
     }

     DLLEXP void testdll :: operator delete( void* p )
     {
        free(p);
        cout &lt;&lt; "In DLL class delete\n";
     }
     #endif

2. Sample Code for Workaround #3
--------------------------------

The following code fragment demonstrates how you might implement a template
wrapper class in the EXE to work around this problem:

     template &lt;class T&gt;
     class DLLFix: public T
     {
     public:
         DLLFix();
         virtual ~DLLFix();
     };

Assuming that ExportedClass is a class that is exported from a DLL, make the
following change:

     //Old code
        ExportedClass * p = new ExportedClass;
        delete p; // wrong delete may be called here;

     //new code
        DLLFix&lt;ExportedClass&gt; * p = new DLLFix&lt;ExportedClass&gt;;
        delete p;
