The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, versions 2.0, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may be generated when disconnecting from a network
drive after running SETUP.EXE:

  The device is being accessed by an active process.

  More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2404.

CAUSE
=====

SETUP.EXE is a 16-bit Windows-based application that spawns VCSETUP.EXE, a
32-bit Windows-based application. It was included so that error checking could
be done if it was running under 16-bit Windows, or under a different processor
under Windows NT.

To run a 16-bit application under Windows NT, the Windows-on-Windows (WOW) layer
is used. Once WOW, a 32-bit Windows NT-based application, is started, it
maintains a current directory. If the current directory is the network drive,
you can get the previous error message after setup has finished executing.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can disconnect from the network by either running another 16-bit application
that changes WOW's current directory, or by closing down WOW, using PVIEW.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information can be found by typing NET HELPMSG 2404:

- The device is being accessed by an active process.

  EXPLANATION

- The drive letter you specified is the current drive of a session. You tried
  to delete a drive redirection (x:) while it is in use, possibly as your
  current drive.

  ACTION

  Be sure the drive you are trying to delete is not the current drive in any of
  your sessions.
