1.0  Introduction
-----------------

The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 version 3.11b is the latest update to the TCP/IP-32 stack
for Windows for Workgroups 3.11. It has been updated since version 3.11a and
includes a number of fixes, primarily to provide compatibility with several
third-party WinSock applications, and to correct problems with using DNS to
resolve NetBIOS names. This also has updated code related to Windows 95. This
update is a complete refresh of TCP/IP-32 and contains all components of the
product.

This product is compatible with and supported exclusively on Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. If you are running a different TCP/IP product on your
computer, you must remove it before installing Microsoft TCP/IP-32. If you
experience difficulties with another vendor's product, remove the existing
TCP/IP stack, exit Network Setup completely, reboot your system, and then
proceed to add the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 drivers by following the instructions
given in the documentation.

NOTE: When you upgrade to TCP/IP-32 3.11b, you should also update your Windows
for Workgroups operating system with the files found on the Windows NT version
3.51 CD-ROM. This update is necessary to logon to a Windows NT domain over
routers when using TCP/IP-32 3.11b. These files are also available on various
electronic services in the self-extracting file, WFWFILES.EXE. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q133255 README.TXT: Windows for Workgroups Update Files

2.0  Installation Instructions for TCP/IP-32 3.11b
--------------------------------------------------

There are two ways you can install the TCP/IP-32 version 3.11b upgrade on your
computer. You can completely reinstall your TCP/IP-32 network protocol stack
with TCP/IP-32 3.11b, which will overwrite your previous TCP/IP settings with
default settings. Alternatively, advanced users can manually copy just the
updated binary files to the proper directories. This will retain your TCP/IP-32
settings, but will not update the TCP/IP-32 version number.

Complete Reinstall:

1. From the Network group, choose the Network Setup icon.

2. Choose the Drivers button (Under Network Drivers, you will see your Network
  Interface Card (NIC) and the network protocols used on that NIC).

3. Select TCP/IP-32 3.11.

4. Choose the Setup button, review and write down all of your TCP/IP-32
  configuration information.

5. Choose the Cancel button to return to the Network Drivers dialog box.

6. If TCP/IP-32 3.11 is your only network protocol, then temporarily add the
  NetBEUI network protocol by following these steps:

  a. Choose the Add Protocol button.

  b. Select Microsoft NetBEUI.

  c. Choose the OK button (Microsoft NetBEUI will appear under Network
     Drivers).

7. Select TCP/IP-32 3.11.

8. Choose the Remove button and then the Yes button to confirm.

9. Choose the Add Protocol button.

10. Select Unlisted or Updated Protocol and Choose the OK button.

11. In the Install Driver dialog box, enter the path to the updated TCP/IP-32
  3.11b files (You should then see Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11b in the Unlisted
  or Updated Protocol dialog).

12. Choose the OK button (You should then see Microsoft TCP/IP-32 3.11b in the
  Network Drivers dialog box).

13. Choose the Setup button and configure TCP/IP-32 3.11b based on the
  information you wrote down in step 4.

14. If you added Microsoft NetBEUI as a network protocol in step 6 and do not
  want to keep it, select Microsoft NetBEUI, choose the Remove button and then
  the Yes button to confirm.

15. Choose the Close button to exit the Network Divers dialog box.

16. Choose the OK button to exit the Network Setup dialog box (Setup will modify
  system files).

17. Choose the OK button (Network Setup prompts you to reboot).

18. Choose the Restart Computer button (The TCP/IP-32 3.11b upgrade is now
  complete).

Manual Installation for Advanced Users:

1. Copy the following files to the C:\&lt;win_root&gt; directory:

  NOTE: By default, the Windows root directory referred to above is C:\WINDOWS.
  If you installed Windows into a directory other than C:\WINDOWS, copy these
  files to that directory.

2.2  Description of Bugs Fixed in TCP/IP-32 3.11b
-------------------------------------------------

TCP/IP-32 version 3.11 Does Not Include Terminal Font:

  Beta versions of Microsoft TCP/IP-32 included a font named "Terminal" in the
  Telnet application. This font is not included in the released version of the
  TCP/IP-32 Telnet application.

DNS Reverse Name Resolution Requests Are Incorrect:

  TCP/IP-32 does not return the correct IP name when it queries the Domain Name
  Service (DNS) because it sends an improperly formatted query to the DNS.

NBT Query Can Hang Computer or Drop Back To MS-DOS:

  Your computer running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with TCP/IP-32
  network protocol stops responding (hangs) or drops back to MS-DOS when the
  32-bit NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) makes a query to the Domain Name Service
  (DNS).

LMHOSTS Lookup Can Cause Intermittent System Pauses:

  Your computer running Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with TCP/IP-32
  intermittently stops responding (hangs) for about 20 seconds at a time. This
  occurs if TCP/IP-32 is installed as a non-default network protocol and the
  Enable LMHOSTS Lookup option in Network Setup is checked.

TCP/IP-32 Winsock Stops FD_READ Notification:

  FD_READ notification in a Winsock application may stop while the application
  is running. This may cause data to be left in the input buffer, or, it may
  cause the application to hang. This occurs when the application disables and
  then re-enables FD_READ notification during a period of time while the
  Windows message queue is full.

Winsock: Accept() Sockets Are Unexpectedly Aborted:

  Occasionally, when you execute a PUT command from an FTP client, your session
  to the FTP server is aborted.


Winsock calls return WSAEINPROGRESS

  Windows Sockets applications running on Microsoft TCP/IP-32 may receive error
  10036 (WSAEINPROGRESS). This problem occurs when applications process a large
  number of Windows Sockets calls.

ARP Cache Commands May Not Work Correctly

  ARP -S commands may not function correctly under Microsoft TCP/IP-32 when the
  arp cache is empty.

IPCONFIG Shows Leftover DHCP Parameters On Non-DHCP Clients

  If TCP/IP-32 client is configured to use DHCP and then is re-configured to
  not use DHCP, when the command "IPCONFIG /ALL" is executed, it will show old
  (DHCP supplied) values for certain parameters.

Domain Name Ignored by Windows for Workgroups with TCP/IP-32

  When a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP) client running TCP/IP-32
  version 3.11 requests an IP address from a DHCP server, the IP address is
  received but the domain name is not recognized by the Windows for Workgroups
  client computer.
