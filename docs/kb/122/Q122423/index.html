To run the patch program
------------------------

NOTE: The Remote Server Connection--ARA 2.0 patch program is in a self-
extracting archive (.SEA) format as well as in Bin-Hex (.HQX) format to allow
you to use an MS-DOS-formatted disk. To access the workstation software, you
need to decode the file using a decoding utility, such as StuffIt or Compact
Pro. These utilities can be found on most major bulletin boards, such as America
Online and AppleLink.

This patch was designed to update version 3.1d of the Mail server. If you have an
earlier version of Mail, you must upgrade to 3.1d before you run this patch.

1. If you download RSCPAT.SEA, go to step 2.

  If you download the .HQX file, use one of the decoding utilities, such as
  StuffIt or Compact Pro, to decode the file into its original format by doing
  the following:

   - To use StuffIt: From the Other menu, choose Bin-Hex. Then select Decode
     Bin-Hex File.

  -or-

   - To use Compact Pro: From the Misc menu, choose Convert FROM BinHex4.

  The utility will generate a Macintosh file called RSCPAT.SEA in the same
  location as the original file.

2. Double-click the RSCPAT.SEA to extract the Macintosh file.

3. While holding down the M key, restart the Mail server.

  NOTE: This prevents the Mail server from loading.

4. If you are running your server as an Application, double-click the Mail 3.1d
  Application Patch icon. If your server is running as an INIT, double-click
  the Mail 3.1d INIT Patch icon.

  NOTE: The default for the Mail server is to run as an INIT. If you have not
  converted your server to an Application using Mail Tools, then it is running
  as an INIT.

5. Read the information displayed and click OK.

6. When you are prompted to "Please Locate the Microsoft Mail Server," select
  the Mail server and choose Patch. The patch will run and update the Mail
  server. It will not affect any other parts of the server or the Microsoft
  Mail Data file.

7. Restart the Macintosh to enable the Mail server.

  NOTE: Although this patch addresses compatibility issues with ARA 2.0, version
  3.1d of Mail for AppleTalk Networks is not designed to take advantage of the
  new DialAssist feature in ARA 2.0. Any additional information entered in the
  DialAssist Control Panel will be ignored when Remote Server Connection
  connects to a remote site.
