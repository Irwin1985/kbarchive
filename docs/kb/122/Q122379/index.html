SYMPTOMS
========

When you are working over a network and you save a document in Word, the
following error message may appear:

  There has been a network or file permission error. The network connection may
  be lost. &lt;Filename.doc&gt;

NOTE: The following error message may also be displayed:

  Make sure that the drive is closed and contains the proper disk or CD.

For additional information about resolving this second error message, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

CAUSE
=====

Case 1
------

This error message appears when the document is open on two or more computers
that are running different operating platforms. For example, if the document is
open on a Macintosh computer and you open it on a second computer running
Windows or Windows NT, the error occurs when either user tries to save the
document.

This problem stems from a difference between the ways Macintosh OLE and Windows
OLE open files. As a result, you cannot save a file on two different operating
platforms at the same time.

Case 2
------

This error can occur with Microsoft Word 97 if the Always Create Backup Copy
option is activated with server or operating systems that do not support long
file names. This option copies the previous version of a document as a backup
copy with the name of "Backup of &lt;filename&gt;". As a result, Word cannot
create a backup copy on server or operating systems that only support 8.3 file
names (file names with eight characters and a three letter extension).

Case 3
------

This error occurs in Word 97 for Windows if you save to a MAPROOT type network
drive connection on a NetWare server where spaces exist in the file or folder
name.


Case 4
------

This problem may occur if an anti-virus program running on a network has the
ability to scan for macro viruses in documents in shared network folders.

For example, if you have the following:

- a shared folder on a network server

-and-

- an anti-virus program is running on the network server that is set to monitor
  the shared folder,

when you attempt to save a document (across the network) to the shared folder,
the anti-virus checker may cause the error to occur.

Case 5
------

This problem may occur on Novell networks when the AutoRecover files path is
either blank or set to a network drive.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods appropriate to
your situation.

Case 1
------

Method 1:

Move the document to your local hard disk for editing. Move it back to the server
after you finish.

Method 2:

Save a copy of the file with a different file name, and work on the copy, either
on your hard disk or on the server.

Case 2
------

Turn off the Always Create Backup Copy option by doing the following:

1. Click Options on the Tools Menu.

2. Click the Save tab.

3. Click to clear the Always Create Backup Copy check box.


Case 3
------

Method 1:

Move the document to your local hard disk for editing. Move it back to the server
after you finish.

Method 2:

Do not use spaces in the directory or document names.

Method 3:

Do not use MAPROOT-drive connections. Map your drive connections to the
volume-level only.

NOTE: The problem in Case 3 was corrected in Microsoft Office 97 Service Release
2 (SR-2).

For additional information about SR-2, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q151261 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-2


Case 4
------

Turn off the anti-virus protection on the network server and then try to save the
document. Contact your anti-virus protection software company for additional
details and/or updates to their programs.

Case 5
------

Set the AutoRecover files path to your local drive. To change the AutoRecover
path, use the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the File Locations tab, select AutoRecover files and then click Modify.

3. Change the Modify Location dialog box to a folder on your local drive and
  then click OK.

4. Click OK to close the Options dialog box.
