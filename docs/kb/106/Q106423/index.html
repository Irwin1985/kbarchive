The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to determine whether you need to repartition your
hard disk before you install MS-DOS 6 or 6.2 Upgrade and how to complete the
procedure if it is necessary.

DO YOU NEED TO REPARTITION?
---------------------------

In most cases, you don't need to repartition your hard disk to install MS-DOS
version 6.0 or 6.2. You need to repartition your hard disk only if:

- The primary DOS partition on your hard disk is too small (less than 2
  megabytes [MB]).

- The size of the clusters or sectors on your hard disk is incompatible with
  MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2.

- There are more than four primary partitions on your hard disk.

- The primary DOS partition is inaccessible.

- A disk-partitioning program that is not compatible with the Setup program for
  MS-DOS was used to partition your hard disk.

- Your primary DOS partition is incompatible with the Setup program for MS-DOS.
  (This may be the case if you receive an error message when trying to run
  Setup.)

If you don't need to repartition your hard disk for any of the preceding reasons,
but you still would like to, see "Optionally Repartitioning Your Hard Disk" at
the end of this document. If you have determined that you cannot install MS-DOS
version 6.0 or 6.2 without repartitioning your hard disk, use the procedures in
the "Preparing to Repartition" section.

Warning: Once you repartition your hard disk, you can no longer use the Uninstall
disk to return to your previous version of MS-DOS.

PREPARING TO REPARTITION
------------------------

Before you partition your hard disk, you need the following:

- Enough floppy disks to back up your hard disk. Make sure your floppy disks
  are newly formatted.

- A single floppy disk on which to install MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2.

Repartitioning your hard disk involves:

- Creating an MS-DOS Startup disk

- Backing up your hard disk

- Repartitioning your hard disk by using the Fdisk program

- Formatting your hard disk

- Restoring your backed-up files

- Upgrading your system to MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2

  Warning: If you are using software such as Disk Manager, SpeedStor(R),
  Priam(R), or Everex to replace the BIOS in interactions between MS-DOS and
  the hard disk controller, do not repartition your hard disk with the MS-DOS
  Fdisk program. Instead, use the disk-partitioning program you originally used
  to partition your hard disk.

  To determine whether you have one of these disk-partitioning programs on your
  computer, search for the following files: DMDRVR.BIN (Disk Manager),
  SSTOR.SYS (SpeedStor), HARDRIVE.SYS (Priam), and EVDISK.SYS (Everex). If you
  need help in repartitioning your hard disk or are unsure whether the BIOS is
  being replaced, contact the manufacturer of your original disk- partitioning
  software.

Creating a Startup Disk:

Begin by creating an MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2 Startup disk. To do so:

1. Start your computer with your current version of MS-DOS.

2. Insert MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 Setup Disk 1 in drive A.

3. Type "A:SETUP /F" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt,
  press ENTER, and then follow the instructions on your screen.

  Setup expands key MS-DOS files onto your floppy disk. You'll use this floppy
  disk with the expanded files to temporarily run MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2.

Backing Up Your Files:

You should back up files on every partition and each logical drive of your hard
disk.

Warning: Make sure you back up your files before using the Fdisk program. When
you delete or modify a partition, all files on that partition are deleted.

Use the MS-DOS BACKUP command to back up all the files on your hard disk to a
floppy disk by typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing
ENTER

  " backup &lt;drive&gt;:\*.* &lt;floppy&gt;: /s" (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive and &lt;floppy&gt; is your floppy
disk drive. The /S switch specifies that every file in every directory will be
backed up. For example, to back up every file in every directory on hard disk
drive C onto disks in floppy disk drive A, type the following command and press
ENTER:

  " backup c:\*.* a: /s" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: Use the backup command to back up files on every partition and each logical
drive of your hard disk.

You can use your current version of the MS-DOS BACKUP command because it should
be compatible with the RESTORE command provided with MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2. Because
MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 include the full-screen version of Microsoft Backup for
MS-DOS and Microsoft Backup for Windows, the MS-DOS command prompt version of
BACKUP is not included with the product. However, the RESTORE command is still
provided.

NOTE: Before using your current version of the backup command and repartitioning,
you should back up a few files and use the restore command provided with MS-DOS
6 Upgrade or MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade to restore the files. This should be done as a
safety precaution to ensure you are not using an original equipment manufacturer
(OEM) version of backup that is not compatible with the MS-DOS restore command.

If you do not want to use BACKUP and RESTORE, you can use a third- party backup
program such as Fastback, Norton Utilities(R) Backup, PC Tools Backup, and so
forth.

Repartitioning Your Hard Disk:

Repartitioning your hard disk involves:

- Deleting any non-DOS partitions

- Deleting the logical drives in the extended DOS partition, if your system has
  any

- Deleting the extended DOS partition, if your system has one

- Deleting any primary DOS partitions

- Creating a new primary DOS partition

- Specifying the maximum disk size for the partition, and making the partition
  active

Before you repartition your hard disk, make sure you write down the volume label
for each partition. You will need this information later. To find the volume
label for your hard disk drive, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt
and press ENTER

  " vol &lt;drive&gt;:" (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if you want to
determine the volume label for drive C, type the following command:

  " vol c:" (without the quotation marks)

To repartition your hard disk:

1. If you are not already running MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, insert your Startup disk in
  drive A, and then restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

2. If you have not already done so, insert the Startup disk (which you created
  using the procedure in the "Creating a Startup Disk" section) in drive A.

3. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "FDISK" (without the quotation marks) and
  press ENTER. The FDISK Options screen appears.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------

30. Press ENTER to specify the maximum size for the partition and make the
  partition active.

31. Make sure your Startup disk is in drive A and press any key.

Formatting Your Hard Disk:

You cannot use your hard disk until you format it.

To format your hard disk:

1. Make sure you are running MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2 from your Startup disk.

2. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER

  " format &lt;drive&gt;: /s" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if your hard disk
  drive is drive C, type the following command:

  " format c: /s" (without the quotation marks)

3. Press Y and press ENTER to proceed with formatting.

4. Once formatting is complete, type a volume label if you want one and press
  ENTER.

Restoring Your Files:

Now you can restore the files you backed up previously. If you used a third-party
program such as Fastback to back up your files, use the same program to restore
your files. If you used the MS-DOS BACKUP command, use the MS-DOS RESTORE
command to restore them.

To restore your files using the MS-DOS RESTORE command:

1. Insert the Startup disk in drive A.

2. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER

  " restore &lt;drive1&gt;: &lt;drive2&gt;:\*.* /s" (without the quotation
  marks)

  where&lt; drive1&gt; specifies the drive on which the backed-up files are
  stored and &lt;drive2&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if you insert
  your backup disk in drive A and your hard disk drive is drive C, type the
  following command:

  " restore a: c:\*.* /s" (without the quotation marks)

  The /S switch restores every file in every subdirectory you backed up.

3. Insert your Startup disk if you are prompted with the following message:

  Insert disk with \COMMAND.COM in drive A

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 if you have other backup disks. For example, you might
  have a set of backup disks for drive D.

Upgrading to MS-DOS 6.0 or MS-DOS 6.2:

Now you can upgrade your system to MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2. To upgrade:

1. Insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "A:SETUP" (without the quotation marks)
  and press ENTER.

3. Continue following the instructions on the screen to install MS-DOS.

  NOTE: Before you restart your system, make sure drive A is empty.

Optionally Repartitioning Your Hard Disk:

If you don't need to repartition your hard disk in order to install MS- DOS
version 6.0 or 6.2, follow the steps outlined here. You have two choices when
optionally repartitioning your hard disk:

- Use your current version of the MS-DOS BACKUP and RESTORE commands to back up
  your hard disk when preparing to partition.

-or-

- First install MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2 in order to use the Microsoft Backup
  program (MSBACKUP) when preparing to partition.

  While this option requires that you install MS-DOS twice (once before and once
  after you partition), using the Microsoft Backup program provides you with
  many more options when backing up your data.

To partition your hard disk by using MS-DOS version 6.0 or 6.2:

1. Insert Setup Disk 1 (the first of your installation disks) in drive A.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "A:SETUP" (without the quotation marks),
  press ENTER, and then follow the instructions in the first few screens. At
  the screen that begins with "The following programs can be installed on your
  computer," note the default setting for "Backup." This setting will be either
  Windows Only or MS-DOS Only.

3. If you have Microsoft Windows installed on your personal computer, change the
  Backup setting to include MS-DOS. You can choose either the Backup: MS-DOS
  Only option or the Backup: Windows And MS-DOS option.

4. Continue following the instructions to install MS-DOS.

5. Before you restart your system, make sure drive A is empty.

6. Insert Setup Disk 1 (the first of your installation disks) in drive A.

7. To create a startup floppy disk called Startup, type "A:SETUP /F" (without
  the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER. Follow the
  instructions on the screen.

8. Run the Microsoft Backup program by typing MSBACKUP at the MS-DOS command
  prompt and pressing ENTER. Create full backups of all the partitions on your
  hard disk.

9. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type "FDISK" (without the quotation marks) and
  press ENTER. This initiates the procedure to partition your hard disk. Refer
  to "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" in Chapter 8 of the Microsoft
  MS-DOS 6 "User's Guide".

10. Insert the Startup disk (which you created in step 7) in drive A and format
  all of your partitions. When formatting your hard disk drive, use the /S
  switch (this transfers system files to your hard disk drive, making it the
  startup drive). For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt
  and press ENTER

  " format &lt;drive&gt;: /s" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive. For example, if your hard disk
  drive is drive C, type the following command:

  " format c: /s" (without the quotation marks)

11. Install MS-DOS on your newly partitioned hard disk. Be sure to install the
  MS-DOS version of the Microsoft Backup program.

12. Run Microsoft Backup to restore your data by typing MSBACKUP at the MS-DOS
  command prompt and pressing ENTER. If you used the MS-DOS Backup program to
  back up your data, use the MS-DOS RESTORE command to restore it.
