-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when
you create a new user using the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), the
following error message may appear:

  Notice 58 Postoffice address list already has an alias with this name

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur for one or more of the following reasons:

1. One or more of the following files is locked open, marked as Read Only, or
  (with Novell networks) ownerless:

  ACCESS.GLB
  ACCESS2.GLB
  ACCESS3.GLB
  ADMIN.NME
  ADMINSHD.NME
  ADMIN.INF
  ADMIN.TPL

  The ADMIN.INF and ADMIN.TPL files will only be present if a template has been
  defined. By default, these files are not present.

2. One or more files on the Microsoft Mail postoffice is corrupt. You can
  determine major corruption of files by checking the file sizes.

  If any of the following calculations results in a remainder, the corresponding
  file is corrupt:

  (size of ACCESS.GLB) / 586
  (size of ACCESS2.GLB) / 69
  (size of ACCESS3.GLB) / 512
  (size of ADMIN.NME) / 45
  (size of ADMINSHD.NME) / 45

3. The alias being added exists in the postoffice address list but not in the
  access files (ACCESS*.GLB), which contain user information.

  You can verify this situation using the ADMIN.EXE program by selecting
  Local-Admin, Modify. This should display the list of all users defined in the
  three access files. Selecting Local-Admin, Group, Create displays the
  postoffice address list.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following are corresponding workarounds for the above causes. These steps
are geared for the Mail administrator:

1. If you find any of the files to be marked read only, use the MS-DOS ATTRIB
  command to change the attribute on the file to read-write.

  If any of the above files are locked open on the server, close the files. The
  easiest way to do this is to reboot the server. If rebooting the server is
  not feasible, the network operating system should provide a means of closing
  files left open on the server.

  On a Novell network, if any of the above files are ownerless, use the Novell
  FILER command to assign ownership of the file to SUPERVISOR.

2. If you find a corrupted file, please contact Microsoft Product Support
  Services.

  NOTE: Restoring files from backup may have negative repercussions.


1. If the user alias is present in the Postoffice Address List (POL) but not in
  the access files, copy the POL to the Personal Address List (PAL), delete the
  user, and then copy the PAL over the POL.

  The following procedure assumes that the administrator mailbox still exists
  and the 8-digit hexadecimal ID (hexid) is 00000000. If you are using an
  account other than 00000000, substitute the 8-digit hexid of that account for
  00000000.

  a. Obtain the user's mailbox name. From the Administrator program Config
     menu, choose Password. Note the postoffice and network names.

  b. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME subdirectory of the Mail
     database.

  c. Make a backup of the POL by typing the following command:

  "copy admin.nme admin.old" (without the quotation marks)

  d. Make a backup of your PAL by typing the following command:

  "copy 00000000.nme 00000000.old" (without the quotation marks)

     If 00000000.NME is a zero-byte file, copying may not work. You can safely
     skip this step.

  e. Copy the POL to the PAL by typing the following command:

  "copy admin.nme 00000000.nme" (without the quotation marks)

  f. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing CD..).

  g. Start the MS-DOS Mail client and sign in using the admin mailbox by typing
     the following command:

  "mail admin -p&lt;password&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  h. From the Address menu, choose Delete. (If you have the version 2.1e MS-DOS
     client, choose Remove from the Address menu.) This should bring up a list
     of users. Select the user you want to delete and press the ENTER key. You
     will now be prompted for confirmation to delete the user. Press the ENTER
     key again.

  i. Quit out of the Mail client.

  j. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the NME directory of the Mail
     database.

  k. Copy the PAL to the POL by typing the following command:

  "copy 00000000.nme admin.nme
  copy 00000000.nme adminshd.nme" (without the quotation marks)

  l. Move up one directory level from the NME subdirectory (by typing CD..).

  m. Start the Administrator program. You should now be able to add the problem
     user account.

  Once you have successfully added the user account, delete the ADMIN.OLD file
  and copy 00000000.OLD to 00000000.NME. (If you skipped step D above, you do
  not need to copy 00000000.OLD to 00000000.NME.)
