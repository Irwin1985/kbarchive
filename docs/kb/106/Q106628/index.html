This article contains information about the documentation errors in the book
"Microsoft MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade for Dummies."


The following topics are covered:

- Page 18: This Number Tells You How Much Room Is Left...

- Page 23: That's EDIT, a Space, C, Colon, Backslash, and then...

- Page 37: Make Sure That the Drive Light Is Not on...

- Page 177: Edit Works Like a Word Processor, but It Lacks...

- Page 252: To Obtain This New Information, You Can...

- Page 309: All About the Double Buffering Nonsense

Page 18: This Number Tells You How Much Room Is Left...
-------------------------------------------------------

"Microsoft MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade for Dummies" contains the following text under the
first bulleted point on page 18:

  An important value to note on Figure 1-3 is the "Space available on drive C:"
  number. This number tells you how much room is left on your hard drive after
  you upgrade to MS-DOS 6.2, given the MS-DOS/Windows programs you select.

This value actually represents the space available on your hard disk before you
upgrade to MS-DOS 6.2.

Page 23: That's EDIT, a Space, C, Colon, Backslash, and then...
---------------------------------------------------------------

"Microsoft MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade for Dummies" contains the following text on page
18:

  That's EDIT, a space, C, colon, backslash, and then README.TXT. Press Enter
  and you'll see the readme file in the Editor.

The above command results in MS-DOS Editor creating a new file called README.TXT,
which is saved in the root directory by default (that is, C:\README.TXT).

The correct text should be:

  That's EDIT, a space, C, colon, backslash, DOS, backslash, and then
  README.TXT. Press Enter and you'll see the readme file in the Editor.

Page 37: Make Sure That the Drive Light Is Not on...
----------------------------------------------------

Page 37 incorrectly state the following:

  Make sure that the drive light is not on. You should never remove a disk from
  the drive when the light is on.

NOTE: Similar text is included in the list of "Ten Things You Should Never Do" on
page 284.

While this is true under most circumstances, it is not true when you are running
advanced backup programs such as Microsoft Backup and Microsoft Backup for
Windows. During a backup or restore with Microsoft Backup, the floppy drive
light never turns off. When you are prompted to change floppy disks, you can
safely do so even though the drive light is on.

WARNING: If you wait for the drive light to go out before swapping floppy disks
in Microsoft Backup or Microsoft Backup for Windows, Backup generates a
time-out, resulting in the second and subsequent backup disks being blank. For
more information on this problem, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  "backup" (without the quotation marks) and "subsequent" (without the
  quotation marks) and "6.20" (without the quotation marks)

Page 177: Edit Works Like a Word Processor, but It Lacks
--------------------------------------------------------

The first sentence in the last paragraph on page 177 states the following:

  Edit works like a word processor, but it lacks many of the fancier features
  -- like the capability to print, apply fancy formatting, spellcheck, create
  graphics, and so on.

MS-DOS Editor (Edit) does have the ability to print text files.

Page 252: To Obtain This New Information, You Can...
----------------------------------------------------

The last sentence of page 252 states the following:

  To obtain this new information, you can fill out and return the Anti-Virus
  update coupon in the back of this book.

The initial copies of "Microsoft MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade for Dummies" do not include
an Anti-Virus update coupon in the back of the book. If your book does not
contain the Anti-Virus update coupon, contact Microsoft Sales Information Center
at (800) 426-9400; ask for the MS DOS 6.2 Anti-Virus Coupon from DOS for
Dummies: part number 098-54321.

Page 309: All About the Double Buffering Nonsense
-------------------------------------------------

The example for the SMARTDRV DOUBLE_BUFFERING command contains an incorrect
backslash (\) reference.

The following command

  DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE\DOUBLE_BUFFER

should be:

  DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER
