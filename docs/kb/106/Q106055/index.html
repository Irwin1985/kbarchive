SUMMARY
=======

The Multimedia PC (MPC) Specification was published by the Multimedia PC
Marketing Council in 1990 to encourage the adoption of a standard multimedia
computing platform. In May 1993, the MPC Marketing Council published a new
specification called MPC2 (or Level 2 Specification) as an enhanced multimedia
computer standard. The original MPC specification, now also known as the MPC
Level 1 Specification, continues in full effect.

The appearance of the MPC or MPC2 certification mark on a computer system or
upgrade kit indicates that the hardware meets the corresponding (Level 1 or
Level 2) MPC Marketing Council specification. Software bearing the Multimedia PC
mark has been designed to work on Multimedia PC licensed hardware.

By establishing a standardized platform, certifying hardware compliance, and
providing interoperability between software and hardware for the consumer, the
MPC Marketing Council is encouraging widespread use of multimedia applications
and hardware.

The following chart compares key requirements and recommendations of the
Multimedia PC Level 1 and Level 2 Specifications.

constitute a recommendation by the Multimedia PC Marketing Council for a
particular system configuration.

                      is optional.

Full Functional MPC (Level 1) Specification
-------------------------------------------

CPU
---

Minimum requirement: 386SX (or compatible) microprocessor

RAM
---

Minimum requirement: 2 megabytes of RAM

Magnetic Storage
----------------

Requirement: 3.5-inch, high density (1.44-MB) floppy disk drive.

Minimum requirement: 30-MB hard disk drive.

Optical Storage
---------------

Requirement: CD-ROM drive with sustained 150kB/second transfer rate; average seek
time of 1 second or less; 10,000 hours MTBF; mode 1 capability (mode 2 and form
1 &amp; 2 optional); MSCDEX 2.2 driver that implements the extended audio APIs;
subchannel Q (subchannels P and R-W optional--if R-W subchannel support is
provided, additional APIs must be implemented in MSCDEX driver; specifications
for these additional APIs are available from Microsoft).

The drive must be capable of maintaining a sustained transfer rate of 150kB/sec.
without consuming more than 40 percent of the CPU bandwidth in the process. It
is recommended that this capability be achieved for read block sizes no less
than 16K and lead time of no more than is required to load the CD-ROM buffer
with 1 read block of data.

It is recommended that the drive have on-board buffers of 64K and implement
read-ahead buffering.

Audio
-----

Requirement: CD-ROM drive with CD-DA (Red Book) outputs and a front panel volume
control.

Requirement: 8-bit (16-bit recommended) digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with
linear PCM sampling; DMA or FIFO buffered transfer capability with interrupt on
buffer empty; 22.05 and 11.025 kHz sample rate mandatory.

44.1 kHz sampling rate desirable; optional stereo channels; no more than 10
percent of the CPU bandwidth required to output 11.025 or 22.05 kHz; no more
than 15 percent for 44.1 kHz.

Requirement: 8-bit (16-bit recommended) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with
linear PCM sampling, 11.025 kHz mandatory, (22.01 kHz, or 44.1 kHz sampling rate
optional); DMA or FIFO buffered transfer capability with interrupt on buffer
full; microphone input.

Requirement: Internal synthesizer hardware with multi-voice, multi-timbral
capabilities, six simultaneous melody notes plus two simultaneous percussive
notes.

Requirement: Internal mixing capabilities to combine input from three
(recommended four) sources and present the output as a stereo, line-level audio
signal at the back panel. The four sources are: CD Red Book, synthesizer, DAC
(waveform), and (recommended but not required) an auxiliary input source. Each
input must have at least a 3-bit volume control (eight steps) with a logarithmic
taper.

A 4-bit or greater volume control is strongly recommended. If all sources are
sourced with -10dB (consumer line level: 1 milliwatt into 700 ohms=0dB) without
attenuation, the mixer will not clip and will output between 0 dB and +3 dB.
Individual audio source and master digital volume control registers and extra
line-level audio sources are highly recommended.

Video
-----

Requirement: VGA-compatible display adapter, and a color VGA- compatible monitor.
A basic Multimedia PC uses mode 12h (640 x 480, 16 colors).

An enhanced configuration referred to as VGA+ is recommended with 640 x 480, 256
colors.

The recommended performance goal for VGA+ adapters is to be able to blit 1, 4,
and 8 bit-per-pixel DIBs (device independent bitmaps) at 350K pixels/second
given 100 percent of the CPU, and at 140K pixels/second given 40 percent of the
CPU. This recommendation applies to run-length encoded images and non-encoded
images. The recommended performance is needed to fully support high-performance
applications, such as synchronized audio-visual presentations.

User Input
----------

Requirement: Standard 101-key IBM-style keyboard with standard DIN connector, or
keyboard that delivers identical functionality utilizing key-combinations.

Requirement: Two-button mouse with bus or serial connector, with at least one
additional communication port remaining free.

I/O
---

Requirement: Standard 9-pin or 25-pin asynchronous serial port, programmable up
to 9600 bits per second (BPS), switchable interrupt channel.

Requirement: Standard 25-pin bidirectional parallel port with interrupt
capability.

Requirement: 1 MIDI port with In, Out, and Thru must have interrupt support for
input and FIFO transfer.

Requirement: IBM-style analog or digital joystick port.

System Software
---------------

Multimedia PC system software must offer binary compatibility with Microsoft
Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions or Windows 3.1.

Minimum Full System MPC2 (Level 2) Configuration
------------------------------------------------

Same configuration as Level 1 with all elements and components meeting MPC2
(Level 2) full functional requirements outlined below.

Unless all the new MPC2 or Level 2 requirements are included, a system is
considered a Level 1 machine.

Minimum MPC2 (Level 2) Upgrade Kit Configuration
------------------------------------------------

Same configuration as Level 1 with all elements and components meeting MPC2
(Level 2) full functional requirements outlined below.

Full Functional MPC2 (Level 2) Specification
--------------------------------------------

The following elements are specific to the Level 2 specification; only changes
and additions from the Level 1 specification are listed. All other elements from
the Level 1 specification are in effect as well for the Level 2 specification.

CPU
---

Minimum requirement: 25 MHz 486SX (or compatible) microprocessor.

RAM
---

Minimum requirement: 4 megabytes of RAM (8 megabytes recommended).

Magnetic Storage
----------------

Requirement: 160-MB or larger hard disk drive.

Optical Storage
---------------

Requirements: CD-ROM drive capable of sustained 300 KB/sec. transfer rate,
average seek time of 400 milliseconds or less, CD-ROM XA ready (mode 1 capable,
mode 2 form 1 capable, mode 2 form 2 capable), multisession capable.

At 300 KB/sec. sustained transfer rate it is recommended that no more than 60
percent of the CPU bandwidth be consumed. It is recommended that the CPU
utilization recommendation be achieved for read block sizes no less than 16K and
lead time of no more than is required to load the CD-ROM buffer with 1 read
block of data.

Audio
-----

Requirement: 16-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), 44.1 kHz sample rate
mandatory, stereo channels; no more than 15 percent of the CPU bandwidth be
required to output 44.1 kHz.

Requirement: 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with Linear PCM sampling;
44.1 kHz sample rate mandatory.

CD-ROM XA audio capability is recommended.

Support for the IMA adopted ADPCM software algorithm is recommended.

Video
-----

Requirement: Color monitor with display resolution of 640 x 480 with 65,536 (64K)
colors. The recommended performance goal for VGA+ adapters is to be able to blit
1, 4, and 8 bit-per-pixel DIBs (device independent bitmaps) at 1.2
megapixels/second given 40 percent of the CPU. This recommendation applies to
run-length encoded images and non-encoded images. The recommended performance is
needed to fully support demanding multimedia applications including the delivery
of video with 320 x 240 resolution at 16 frames/second and 256 colors.

User Input
----------

No changes from Level 1.

I/O
---

No changes from Level 1.
