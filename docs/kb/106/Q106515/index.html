-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to import some graphic files into Creative Writer or Fine
Artist. When you try to import the file, you may receive the following error
message:

  Hey!
  Sorry, I can't get that picture. I can't open that picture for some
  reason--there's a problem with the picture file. Try a different picture
  file.

This error occurs if you try to import graphic files that are not in a format
that Creative Writer or Fine Artist supports. This may also occur with graphics
that are in an older version of a supported format. WMF files, for example, must
be in the format of Windows version 3.0 or later.

Creative Writer and Fine Artist for Windows support the following graphic
formats:

- .BMP (bitmaps)

- .WMF (Windows metafiles)

- .DIB (device-independent bitmaps)

RESOLUTION
==========

If you can import the graphic into another application, such as Paintbrush, you
may be able to save the picture in a newer graphic format and then import it
into Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In Creative Writer or Fine Artist, go to the Studio.

2. Click on the Sticker Picker "Mona Weasel" (an orange icon of a big-nosed
  character, just to the right of the "A".)

3. Ratdog appears, just to the right of the rolls of stickers. Click on Ratdog.

4. In the Portfolio, choose a graphic file that is in an old and/or unsupported
  format. When you click on it, no thumbnail appears. Choose "Go."

The error message described above appears, and the picture is not imported.
