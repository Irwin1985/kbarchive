-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.

SYMPTOMS
========

When MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up is unable to update a file, the following message is
displayed:

  Cannot Update File

  Setup could not update the following file to MS-DOS 6.2:

  &lt;filename&gt;

  Although Setup can continue without updating this file, your MS-DOS 6.2
  installation will be incomplete.

  For more information, see the README.NOW file, which is located in the same
  drive and directory as your Step-Up files.

  To continue, press ENTER.

CAUSE
=====

Setup displays this message when the listed file does not exactly match the
Microsoft MS-DOS 6.0 Upgrade version of the file.

MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up uses binary patch files to patch the MS-DOS 6.0 files into the
MS-DOS 6.2 version. Each binary patch file &lt;filename.xx#&gt; contains a
checksum for the original MS-DOS 6.0 file and information on how to patch the
file.

If the checksum for the file on the hard disk does not match the checksum
contained in the binary patch file, SETUP cannot patch the file and displays the
"Cannot Update File" message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this situation:

1. Restore the MS-DOS 6.0 file by expanding it from one of the original MS-DOS 6
  Upgrade disks.

2. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up again.

If there are a lot of files that can't be updated by MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up, you
might find it easier to reinstall the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade and then run MS-DOS 6.2
Step-Up again. To do this:

1. Confirm that the DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE command is in your CONFIG.SYS file.

2. Use SETVER to set the version number for SETUP.EXE to 4.00 by typing the
  following at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER.

  " setver setup.exe 4.00" (without the quotation marks)

3. Restart your computer so that the SETVER change takes effect.

4. Run MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Setup.

5. After MS-DOS 6 Setup completes, delete SETUP.EXE from the SETVER table by
  typing the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER:

  " setver setup.exe /d" (without the quotation marks)

6. Restart your computer so that the SETVER change takes effect.

7. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up Setup.

If you have a version of MS-DOS 6.0 that was modified by an original equipment
manufacturer (OEM), MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up cannot update the MS-DOS 6.0 files. You
must obtain an update from your OEM or purchase the Microsoft MS-DOS 6.2
Upgrade.

NOTE: There is no way to expand or update the .xx# files manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Symantec Norton Utilities versions 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x will replace your
FORMAT.COM file if you choose that option during installation. Other software
programs may replace MS-DOS components as well.


The following information is available in the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up README.NOW
file:

2.3  If Setup cannot update a file
----------------------------------

If Setup cannot update one of your MS-DOS files, it displays a message with the
title "Cannot Update File." If you continued Setup, your MS-DOS 6.2 installation
is incomplete because the specified file was not updated to version 6.2. If the
file is one you know you don't need, don't worry about it. However, if you are
not sure, update the file using the following procedure.

1. Insert MS-DOS 6 Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B, and then use MS-DOS
  Editor (EDIT) to view the contents of the PACKING.LST file. This file tells
  you where each file is located on your MS-DOS 6 disks. Determine which MS-DOS
  6 disk contains the file you need.

2. Insert the appropriate MS-DOS 6 disk in drive A or drive B, and then use the
  EXPAND command to expand the file. For example, to expand the file
  DBLSPACE.HL_ from the disk in drive A to the directory C:\DOS, you would type
  the following command:

  " expand a:\dblspace.hl_ c:\dos\dblspace.hlp " (without the quotation marks)

  For more information, see the comments at the beginning of the PACKING.LST
  file, or see the MS-DOS 6.0 "User's Guide."

3. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup again. This time, Setup should be able to update the
  file.

If you follow this procedure and Setup still cannot update the file, there may be
a problem with your MS-DOS 6.2 disks. You may be able to correct the problem by
running SCANDISK or CHKDSK /F on the MS-DOS 6.2 disk that was in the drive when
the error occurred.
