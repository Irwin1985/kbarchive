SUMMARY
=======

LAN Manager servers may fail or "sleep" under extreme operating stress, refusing
to initiate new sessions while allowing active sessions to continue for a while.
Three problems cause the following stress-related symptoms:

- SCSI bid time-out failures

- Kernel failures

- NETAPI.DLL or SCSI bid time-out problems

This article discusses these three problems and several other topics in this
order:


- Causes of Server Stress

- Server-Stress-Related Problems

- Non-Server-Stress-Related Problems

- Problem 1: SCSI Bid Time-out Failures

- Problem 2: Kernel Failures

- Problem 3: NETAPI.DLL or SCSI Bid Time-out Problems

- Procedures for Installing the Fixes

- Configuration (of servers prone to these problems)

- Tuning Recommendations

- Utilities and Diagnostics

Each problem section is organized in the standard style: Symptoms, Cause,
Resolution/Workaround.

You can obtain Microsoft OS/2 LAN Manager updates from Microsoft PSS, Corporate
Network Systems. Fixes are scheduled for inclusion in the LAN Manager 2.2b
Patch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CAUSES OF SERVER STRESS
-----------------------

Several system conditions can create server stress: a large number of
workstations with active sessions accessing the file server, or problems with
foreground processes such as ring 3 services (SQL Server, the NetLogon service,
and backup operations).

  SERVER-STRESS-RELATED PROBLEMS
------------------------------

Stress failures can disrupt some server processes while other OS/2 processes
continue unaffected. Even when critical ring 0 or kernel-level failures affect
the server, trap error messages are not always displayed on the server monitor
or through an OS/2 kernel debugger, and some OS/2 processes can continue to
operate for a while (for instance, the HPFS386 cache and operations serviced by
it) although the Program Manager cannot be accessed and keyboard input is not
responded to.

          NON-SERVER-STRESS-RELATED PROBLEMS
----------------------------------

Complete server hangs are often caused by something other than sleeping servers:

- System CPU hardware failures that hang the server and require a cold boot.

- A system device or ring 0 device driver that shuts down interrupts and does
  not re-enable them, locking the server and stoppping response to keyboard I/O

- Network adapters that halt all server processing.

- A tight I/O-bound application loop such as a process that continuously writes
  to the screen, starving other processes on the server. If a process remains
  at high priority in a PM screen group, it blocks other processes. It is a
  good idea to avoid running local processes involving continuous screen or
  other device I/O on an OS/2 LAN Manager file server. Run only specifically
  designed server applications, and avoid running applications such as tape
  backup software during peak hours.

PROBLEM 1: SCSI BID TIME-OUT FAILURES
-------------------------------------

Sleeping or comatose server; disk access blocked.


SYMPTOMS
========

There are many possible symptoms. When a SCSI bid time-out occurs for disk drive
requests, drive access is blocked even though network I/O does not stop and
users can connect to the server by the NET USE or NET ADMIN commands. If primary
disk drive access is blocked and SWAPPER.DAT is located there, local OS/2
foreground processes may become inaccessible, the system may not respond to
keyboard input, and Task Manager may fail. No operation can write to the blocked
disk drive. Only operations serviced by HPFS386 cache continue to operate. A
PSTAT listing reveals all processes blocked except those serviced by cache.

If server performance falls, access to CD-ROM drives may fail if time-outs occur.
Attempting to access a logical drive letter from the server console associated
with a CD-ROM hangs that OS/2 screen group. Also, if multiple CD-ROM devices
containing large amounts of data are attached to the server, this failure can
result in a sleeping server hang:

  Net start server
  The server is starting.....................................

The server slows or halts. CPU utilization increases and workstations receive
poor server response.

Servers with a NETAPI.DLL failure respond to console keyboard commands. Using the
servers' workstation service allows network access to other servers by means of
NET USE for users logged on at the server. Because a NETAPI.DLL failure leads to
a NetLogon service failure, users cannot log on if the server is a domain
controller. PSTAT may also reveal a NetLogon announcer thread failure if it
becomes stuck in a critical section.

If the server is experiencing SCSI bid time-outs and disk access is blocked, the
server service degrades gradually. As long as an HPFS386 server is servicing
requests from cache, it maintains existing sessions. For new sessions, NetBIOS
session-alive traffic remains active but workstations cannot connect to the
server. Before long, the only continuing traffic is LLC, NetBEUI low-level
transport operations.

Both NETAPI.DLL and SCSI bid time-out failures can cause the ring 3 server
scavenger thread to fail. Workstations attempting new connections receive error
51. Error 53 is sometimes returned, but this actually is error 51 erroneously
reported by LAN Manager. Likewise, error net3779, sometimes returned to users
attempting to log on to a sleeping primary domain controller (PDC), is incorrect
and should be reported as error 51. No new listens are posted by the ring 3
server, Netservr Scavenger thread. Net session at the server reports existing
sessions, but the ring 3 server revokes new requests.

Possible error messages:

  Error 51: The remote computer is not available.
  Error 53: The network path was not found.
  Error 240: The network connection is disconnected.
  Net3779: Your logon attempt has failed due to an incorrect user name or
  password.

Attempting to shut down the server may return the following messages:

  Net Stop Server
  Net2190: The service ended abnormally

  Net Stop Workstation
  Net2189: The service cannot be controlled in its present state
  OS/2 shutdown may cause the server to hang.

CAUSE
=====

This often is caused by a lack of time-out handling code in the OS/2 bid, which
in turn causes disk requests to time-out due to server stress and slow responses
from I/O devices. Requests (called RCBs) are passed through the file system to
the SCSI bid through IOS$, which provides I/O access to the bid from file
systems. The requests include time-out values. For SCSI bids, this value is
passed as a SCSI request block (SRB) parameter for time-out. Time-outs cannot be
handled properly unless the bid monitors the SRB time-out value for all I/O
queues. If a request expires, you should reset the SCSI bus and I/O queue
time-outs, and let operations retry. If operations are not allowed to retry,
threads involved with the I/O process hang.

Certain hardware components and data transfer quantities can cause or contribute
to these problems:

- Slow SCSI devices

- Multiple devices

- Multiple large hard-disk drives

- Multiple tape drives

- CD-ROM drives

Some kernel memory-management routines for CSD5050 and subsequent revisions have
been updated from 286-specific code to 386-specific code. Memory compaction on a
386 does not take advantage of the 386 processor double word capability,
resulting in poor performance, especially with memory- intensive operations.


Primary domain controller ring 3 server threads can hang if a backup domain
controller causes a semaphore deadlock by calling NetAccountSync(). The symptoms
indicate that the ring 3 server Scavenger thread has failed. If the ring 3
server fails, active sessions continue operating but new connections are
refused. The scavenger thread also checks disk drives for free space, and hangs
if a SCSI bid time-out failure occurs while the check is in progress.


The ring 3 server (Netservr) provides all file services for FAT partitions only.
On an OS/2 LAN Manager HPFS386 server, only new server connection requests are
handled by the ring 3 server. The ring 0 HPFS386 server is optimized for
performance, and it--not the ring 3 server--handles file service. As a result,
if the ring 3 server fails, HPFS386 continues to service requests although new
connections are refused and the server appears to sleep.

RESOLUTION
==========

Update SCSI bids to address the lack of time-out code. Following are
instructions for current SCSI bids divided into four classes.

  A. SCSI controller bids for which updates are available
  B. SCSI controller bids without time-out handling code that can be replaced
  with monolithic drivers
  C. SCSI controller bids without time-out handling code or currently available
  monolithic drivers
  D. SCSI bids with time-out code and shipped in OS/2 1.301 LAN Manager 2.2.

A. SCSI controller bids for which updates are available:

- COMPAQ Cpq710 bid *

- UltraStor Ultra24 bid *

- Adaptec 174x bid

  * installed as BOOTBID.BID, not preinstalled with OS/2 LAN Manager; these will
  not be included in LAN Manager 2.2b

Updates are available from Microsoft PSS, and on the PSS internet server in
Bussys\LANMAN\UNSUP-ED (see GOWINNT.MICROSOFT.COM). Use FTP to get the files.


B. SCSI controller bids without time-out handling code which can be replaced with
monolithic drivers:

- IBM PS/2 ABIOS.BID (Replace with OS/2 1.3 CSD5050 or later drivers)

- COMPAQ CPQARRAY BID (Replace with OS/2 1.21 or later drivers)

To work around the problem, replace these with monolithic drivers. Monolithic
drivers do not support LADDR-specific features such as FT or CdRomIfs, but
proper time-out code is available for hard disk drives.


NOTE: Monolithic drivers have not been certified or exhaustively tested with OS/2
1.301 CSD5015 LAN Manager 2.2.

C. SCSI controller bids without time-out handling code or currently available
monolithic drivers:

- Adaptec 154X and 164X

- Future Domain WD7000EX and FD16-700 bids

- Dell001 bid

To work around the problem, install an adapter and driver that support time-outs
until the manufacturer provides a fix.

D. SCSI bids with time-out code and shipped in OS/2 1.301 LAN Manager 2.2:

- ESDI-506 bid used for IDE, ESDI, and WD ST-506 compatible controllers

- DPT201X bid

- NCRC700, NCRC710 and NCRC90

 PROBLEM 2: KERNEL FAILURES
--------------------------

Server slows down (OS2KRNL).


Update the OS/2 kernel and redirector using the following:

  OS2KRNL           OS2 1.301 CSD01.001
  NETWKSTA.SYS      LM22 CSD00.013

PROBLEM 3: NETAPI.DLL OR SCSI BID TIME-OUT PROBLEMS
---------------------------------------------------

Server rejects new sessions. (NETAPI.DLL, SCSI bid, or resource problems).


Update NETAPI.DLL and NETLOGON.EXE CSD00.036. Following are procedures for
installing the fixes on a LAN Manager 2.2 OS/2 1.301 server:

PROCEDURES FOR INSTALLING THE FIXES
-----------------------------------

NOTE: The fixes provided have not yet been released as part of an OS/2 LAN
Manager update. As a result, they have not been subjected to exhaustive release
testing. Please test the fixes prior to implementing them on a production server
to assure that the fixes operate properly.

Procedure 1: Installing OS2KRNL:

1. From the OS/2 File Manager, do the following:

  a. Select these options:

      - View

      - Include

      - All File Flags (Hidden)

      - Set View

      - Select OS2KRNL

      - File

      - Change Flags

  b. Cancel the selection of these options:

      - System

      - Hidden

      - Read Only

2. Issue a NET STOP command on the workstation.

3. Shut down the server from the OS/2 desktop.

4. Use an HPFS386 recovery disk to boot the server.

5. Use OS/2 Disk 1 to perform the following command:

  chkdsk c: /f:386

6. Issue the following commands:

  rename c:\OS2KRNL c:\OS2KRNL.old
  copy a:\OS2KRNL c:\OS2KRNL (USE CAPITAL LETTERS ONLY)
  rename c:\lanman\netprog\netwksta.sys *.old
  copy a:\netwksta.sys c:\lanman\netprog

7. Restart the server.

Procedure 2: Installing monolithic drivers
on a LAN Manager 2.2 OS/2 1.301 server:

1. In the root directory, issue the following commands:

  md laddr
  copy *.sys laddr (EXCEPT CONFIG.SYS)
  copy *.bid laddr
  copy *.tsd laddr
  copy *.vsd laddr

2. Copy the following files from OS/2 1.21 or 1.3 installation Disk 1 (ISA
  computers) or Disk 2 (PS/2--Micro Channel computers) to the root directory

  BASEDD0X.SYS
  DISK0X.SYS

  where X = 1 for ISA computers and 2 for PS/2--Micro Channel.

3. Rem out the lines in the CONFIG.SYS file from DEVICE=DENON.VSD to
  IFS=CDROM.IFS.

4. Reboot the machine.

Procedure 3: Installing updated NETAPI.DLL and NETLOGON.EXE:

1. Type the following and press ENTER:

  " copy c:\config.sys c:\config.sav" (without the quotation marks)

2. Make this TEMPORARY change to the CONFIG.SYS file:

  E Config.sys
  Libpath=c:\lanman\netlib;...
  (remove c:\lanman\netlib)
  Libpath=...

3. Shut down the server.

4. Restart the server.

5. Issue the following commands:

  rename c:\lanman\netlib\netapi.dll c:\lanman\netlib\netapi.old
  copy a:\netapi.dll c:\lanman\netlib
  rename c:\lanman\services\netlogon.exe c:\lanman\services\netlogon.old
  copy a:\netlogon.exe c:\lanman\services
  copy c:\config.sav c:\config.sys

       CONFIGURATION
-------------

Common configuration for servers exhibiting "sleeping" problems:

- 486 (&gt; 33 mhz) PC server

- SCSI controller or IDE controller (16-bit ISA or 32-bit EISA or MCA)

- LAN Manager 2.1, 2.1a, 2.2

- Microsoft OS/2 1.301

- HPFS386 partitions

- Primary domain controller operation NetLogon service

- Ifs ...... /cache:4096 or larger cache size

- OS/2 ring 3 applications such as NetLogon or SQL Server

  TUNING RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------

Check the server error log for the following error

  Net3101: The system ran out of a resource controlled by the *** option

where *** is the numbigbuf or numreqbuf parameter.

  LANMAN.INI
  [Server]
  Numbigbuf = x    (1-80)
  Numreqbuf = x    (1-300)

If you find this error, edit LANMAN.INI and increase the corresponding parameters
to correct the problem and prevent future server failures. LAN Manager allocates
request and big buffers statically at server startup. Under high-stress
operating conditions, these resources can be depleted, causing the ring 3 server
threads (including the Scavenger) to fail.

UTILITIES AND DIAGNOSTICS
-------------------------

PSTAT: PSTAT reports made before or after the failure verify that one or more
NetLogon threads became stuck in a critical section, or Netservr threads,
including the Scavenger thread, have been terminated.

Process and Thread Information on a sample PSTAT screen:

Process   Thread
Name       ID    Priority   Block ID   State
NETLOGON   04      06FF     00000000  CritSec

Sniffer protocol analyzer traces will reveal that the server has no listen
commands outstanding. As the workstation repeatedly fails to connect, it
receives this packet and returns error 51 to the user.

Sample detail of a Sniffer screen:

                       - Frame 1 -
  SUMMARY  Delta T     Destination   Source        Summary
  M        1           Workstation   Server  NETB Name Server
  Recognized
  NETB: ----- NETBIOS Name Recognized -----
  NETB:
  NETB: Header length = 44, Data length = 0
  NETB: Delimiter = EFFF (NETBIOS)
  NETB: Command = 0E
  NETB: No LISTEN command outstanding for this name.
  NETB: Caller's name type = 00 (Unique name)
  NETB: Transmit correlator = 000D
  NETB: Response correlator = 0000
  NETB: Receiver's name = Workstation&lt;00&gt;
  NETB: Sender's name = Server
  NETB:

If the SCSI bid time-out failures occur, then HPFS386 will stop providing SMB
service if the request cannot be serviced from cache. Sessions are eventually
dropped and only LLC and NETB traffic remain active. The NETB traffic may
eventually end as well.

Sample from a Sniffer summary report:

   98    0.0369  SERVER        WORKSTATION   SMB C Open  \test.cmd
   99    0.0429  WORKSTATION   SERVER        NETB D=68 S=05 Data ACK
