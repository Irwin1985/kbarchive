The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are three different Riched32.dll files that have the version number
5.0.1458.47, and one of them is not redistributable. This article describes the
differences between these files and includes additional distribution
information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each of the three Riched32.dll files with the version number 5.0.1458.47, and
has a different size. These versions are:

- A 169KB version (general release).

- A 176KB version that is optimized for loading on Windows 98, but is identical
  in code to the general release version.

- A 225KB version that was released by the Microsoft Exchange group. It is
  intended to cover all localized versions and is dependent upon GAPI32.dll.

Of these three versions of Riched32.dll 5.0.1458.47, you can only distribute the
169KB or 176KB versions. If the target computer is already using the 225KB
version, do not replace it with another Riched32.dll with the same version
number or older.

Also, keep the following in mind when distributing Riched32.dll using third-party
setup programs:

- If the target computer is running NT 4.0, your setup program should not
  replace Riched32.dll.

- Riched32.dll is a part of the operation system installation of Windows 2000.
  Setup programs installing to Windows 2000 should not install Riched32.dll.

Which Version Is Distributed by the Setup Wizard and PDW?
---------------------------------------------------------

If you use the Setup Wizard in Visual Basic 5.0 or the Package and Deployment
Wizard (PDW) in Visual Basic 6.0, you will not have to concern yourself with the
issue of which version to distribute. By default, the Setup Wizard and PDW are
set up to distribute Riched32.dll version 4.00.993.4, if your application
requires this file. Both wizards create setup programs that only replace files
on target systems if they are older than the file being distributed.

Visual Basic 5.0 places a copy of Riched32.dll version 4.00.993.4 in the
following folder:

  Program Files\DevStudio\VB\Setupkit\Kitfil32\Sys32

This is the folder that the Setup Wizard searches first when pulling in the files
that need to be distributed. If your application uses Riched32.dll, the Setup
Wizard will pick it up from this location.

Visual Basic 6.0 places a copy of Riched32.dll version 4.00.993.4 in the
following folder:

  Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Wizards\PDWizard\Redist

This is the folder that the PDW searches first when pulling in the files that
need to be distributed. If your application uses Riched32.dll, the PDW will pick
it up from this location.

Riched32.dll is included in the redistributable file list (Redist.txt) for Visual
Basic 5.0. While the file is not included in the Redist.txt file for Visual
Basic 6.0, the PDW may include Riched32.dll in the distribution set. However, it
will not install the file on a computer running Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000.

NOTE: There are several localized versions of Riched32.dll, which should be
identifiable by their language ID. These versions are specific to the language
being developed for, but should follow the same rules as described previously.
