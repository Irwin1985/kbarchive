SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit includes a utility called Uptomp.exe.
This utility allows users to upgrade from a single processor system to a
multiprocessor system without reinstalling the base Windows NT operating
system.

An updated .inf file (Uptomp.inf) for Uptomp.exe has been posted to Microsoft's
FTP site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/uptomp

This updated Uptomp.inf file needs to replace the one that ships with the
Resource Kit. Copy the updated Uptomp.inf file from the FTP server to the same
directory as the Uptomp.exe program. The Uptomp.exe program also requires access
to a file called Txtsetup.sif. This article describes steps to properly
configure a computer to run Uptomp.exe so that all files are in the correct
directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After placing the updated Uptomp.inf file in the same directory as the
Uptomp.exe program, it is necessary to find and copy the Txtsetup.sif file to
the same directory as well.

The Txtsetup.sif file is needed to display the names and descriptions of the
different hardware abstraction layers (HALs) available under Windows NT Server.
This file is accessed when Uptomp.exe searches for a list of HALs prior to
upgrading the computer.

The Txtsetup.sif file is located under the I386 folder or the Alpha folder on the
Windows NT installation media. This file needs to be copied to both the folder
containing Service Pack 3 files (for the appropriate platform) and the directory
containing the Uptommp.exe program.

After this file is copied, you can proceed to run Uptomp.exe to upgrade from a
single processor to multiprocessor system.

Uptomp.exe will produce the following dialog box:

  Verify the path to the new Multiprocessor HAL DLL files and select the
  correct HAL for this machine, then collect OK to continue.

Point the Uptomp.exe application to the folder of the latest service pack you are
running. For example, if you are running Windows NT Server 4.0, Service Pack 4,
point the UPTOMP utility to read the list of HALs from the Service Pack 4
installation folder. This folder will need to be copied to a hard drive to place
the Txtsetup.sif file in the installation folder.

After this is completed, Uptomp.exe will copy the necessary files and prompt the
user to restart.

Please note that Microsoft does not directly support the development of the
Windows NT Resource Kit utilities. It is highly recommended that a complete
backup of the system be performed prior to attempting the steps outlined in this
article.
