-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) may fail unexpectedly with an Access
Violation error message in function snpugeti() or snpuputi().

CAUSE
=====

The Access Violation error message is caused when SNA Server receives an invalid
RU from the mainframe. In this case, the invalid RU was sent by the mainframe to
indicate an -RSP to an RU it had previously received for a particular LU-LU
(Logical Unit) session. The RU indicated that it included Sense Data (SD) since
the SD flag was set in its Response Header (RH). The RU was invalid since it did
not contain the 4 bytes of sense data that is supposed to be included when the
SD flag is set.

When the SNA Server service receives this data, it attempts to extract the sense
data from the host response to include it in a Function Management Interface
(FMI) Status Acknowledgement that has to be sent to the client emulator to
inform the emulator of the detected error. The access violation occurs because
the message is too short. It only has 9 bytes of data (6 bytes for the
Transmission Header plus 3 bytes for the RH) when it should be 13 bytes in
length. The SNA Server service then accesses data beyond the end of the actual
message because the last 4 bytes of data are not there. It is the attempt to
access memory beyond the end of the message that results in the access
violation. The access violation causes the SNA Server service to terminate.


RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


SNA Server 3.0
--------------

Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for the SNA Server version 3.0
post-SP4 fix.

For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0.
This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is one of the invalid RUs that can cause the access violation
described in this article as shown in a SNA Server Data Link Control message
trace:

  ----------------------------------------------- 08:52:26.0440
  04160009-&gt;01021301 DLC DATA

  DAF:52 OAF:01 ODAI:off Normal -RSP FMD SD BC EC DR1

  ---- Header  at address 01456E24, 1 elements ----
  00000000 00032C00 52010001 01006100     &lt;......,.R.....a.&gt;

  ---- Element at address 01955688, start 10, end 12 ----
  879000                                  &lt;g..             &gt;

This is an RU from the mainframe that indicates an -RSP message. The RH in this
case indicates that this RU contains Sense Data as noted by the SD flag in the
message above. An RU that contains sense data is supposed to include 4 bytes of
data that specifies the actual sense code as defined by IBM's SNA protocol. The
sense data is used to determine exactly what error condition was detected in the
preceding SNA data flow.

In this case, this RU is invalid because it does not contain the 4 bytes of sense
data. The only data contained in this RU is the TH (Transmission Header) that is
included in the Header portion of the trace message shown above and the RH. In
this case, the TH is 0x'2C0052010001' and the RH is 0x'879000'. A valid frame
with sense data includes 4 additional bytes of data for the sense code after the
RH.

Please refer to the IBM SNA Formats Guide (GA27-3136) for more details on the
format of various SNA RUs.
