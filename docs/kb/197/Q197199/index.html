SYMPTOMS
========

Embedded Word 6.0 for Windows document objects have default margins of 0 inches
and page sizes of 6 by 9 inches or smaller. As a result, when you embed a Word
document object in another Word document or in another program (such as
Microsoft Publisher or Microsoft PowerPoint), one side of the object may appear
cropped. This happens if the page width of the object is greater than 6 inches.

WORKAROUND
==========

To preserve margins and page sizes for document objects, you must insert a Word
6.0 document object and then paste the text you want into the open object. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. Select the text that you want for the object.

  NOTE: Be sure to include all trailing section breaks for text in the section
  and the last paragraph mark for text of the last section of a document. Page
  sizes and margins of sections are stored in trailing section breaks and in
  the last paragraph mark for the last section of a document.

2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

3. Using the client program's Insert Object command, insert a Word 6.0 document
  object. The object by default has margins of 0 inches and a page size of
  approximately 6 inches by 9 inches.

4. Put the insertion point in the open document object.

5. On the Edit menu, click Paste or Paste Special to insert the previously
  copied or cut text.

The object now reflects the margins and page sizes of the original text, which
may be too wide to be viewed fully in the client program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Document text that is copied has a page size of 6 inches by 9 inches or less and
margins of 0 inches when pasted as a Word version 6.0 document object into a
client program. These settings are applied to every section of the document
object. A Word 6.0 document object created with the Object command on the Insert
menu also has the same page and margin settings specified above.

NOTE: Paragraphs that are indented from either the left or right margin may
appear strange when pasted as an object due to the changed page width for the
object. For example, a paragraph that is indented 3 inches from the right on an
8.5-inch-wide page appears extremely narrow when pasted as an object (which has
a 6-inch-wide page). Paragraphs or tables that contain border formatting may
appear to be missing the left or right side borders. Borders normally extend to
the left and right of indentations. This is so that the text of the bordered
paragraph will align with other text in the document that contains no bordering
(assuming the same indentation settings). Therefore, with margins for the object
at 0 inches, paragraphs with no indentations have borders that extend off the
left and right side of the document.

Word 6.0 for Windows sets these page specifications for objects so that each
document object can be represented at full scale visually within a standard Word
document. Default Word documents have left and right margins of 1.25 inches,
which leaves 6 inches of horizontal printable space. If you copy and paste text
wider than 6 inches as an object, the object will extend past the area of the
containing program (object page length may also vary).

Text narrower than 6 inches pasted as an object has a page width approximately
equal to the original width. For example, if you copy text 3- inches wide, it
pastes as an object of approximately the same width.
