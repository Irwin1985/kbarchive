SYMPTOMS
========

When the Mail Merge Helper dialog box is activated by a macro command, some of
the options either are unavailable or are already activated with the use of
defaults rather than offering you choices.

For example, when you run the following macro example while you are in a mail
merge main document

  Sub MyMailMergeHelper()
     Set mydialog = Dialogs(wdDialogMailMergeHelper)
     With mydialog
        .Show
     End With
  End Sub

the following problems may occur:

- The Create Document Type option does not allow you to select a new main
  document. The macro automatically changes the active window to the new mail
  merge main document that you selected.

- The Restore to Normal Word Document option does not offer a confirmation
  dialog box. The macro immediately removes all data file and header file
  information.

- The Edit Data Source button opens the data source in View Source mode rather
  than the Data Form dialog box. To open the file in the Data Form dialog box,
  click the Data Form button on the Mail Merge toolbar.

WORKAROUND
==========

To show the Mail Merge Helper while you are in a mail merge main document, do
one of the following:

- On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

  -or-

- On the Mail Merge toolbar, click Mail Merge Helper.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are descriptions of what Microsoft Word normally does when you
click in the Mail Merge Helper. The Mail Merge Helper does not respond normally
when you use a macro to display it, and the problems described in the "Symptoms"
section of this article may occur.

- When you click Create in the Mail Merge Helper dialog box and click to select
  a different type main document, Word prompts you with a message similar to
  the following to verify the change of document type:

  You can change filename from form letters to mailing labels or you can create
  a new main document.

- When you click Create and click Restore to Normal Word Document in the Mail
  Merge Helper dialog box, Word prompts you with a message similar to the
  following to verify that you want to revert the existing document back to a
  normal Word file and break the link to its data source:

  By restoring filename to a normal Word document, the text from the document
  will not change. However, filename will no longer be a mail merge main
  document.

  Do you want to continue?

- When you click Edit (under Data Source) in the Mail Merge Helper and click to
  select the attached data file, Word displays the Data Form dialog box.
