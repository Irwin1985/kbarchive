IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may generate Event ID 9301 when
receiving an incoming connection from a multihomed server.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the MTA allows the transport to make the selection of the virtual
server IP address for an outgoing connection. The transport uses all of the
available virtual server IP addresses. The Exchange Server MTA that is being
contacted can only have one IP address or one server name defined on the Stack
property page for each X.400 Connector object. Any incoming connections from an
X.400 MTA with an IP address or server name that is not configured on the Stack
property page for any locally installed connectors causes an Event ID 9301, and
the connection will not work.

The Event ID 9301 occurs in the event log of the receiving server approximately
half of the times that a connection is attempted from a multihomed server where
two virtual server IP addresses are available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, click the following article number to

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 1. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 allows you to define which virtual IP address
to use for outbound X.400 connections on multihomed servers. To implement this
feature, perform the following procedures on the multihomed Exchange Server
computers that are involved.

First, you must identify the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) of the X.400
Connector to implement the necessary registry modifications on the server:

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Double-click Site, double-click Configuration, double-click Connectors, and
  then in the right pane, click the X.400 Connector.

3. On the File menu, click Raw Properties to open the X.400 Connector raw
  properties.

4. In the Object Attribute column, click Obj-Dist-Name, and in the Attribute
  Value box, scroll to the right until you locate the last "\cn=" value. This
  is the RDN that you use to create the registry key name.

  For example, for an X.400 Connector object named "TCP to MTA B," the value for
  the Obj-Dist-Name object attribute is displayed similar to the following:

  /o=&lt;Organization&gt;/ou=&lt;Site&gt;/cn=&lt;Configuration&gt;/cn=&lt;Connection&gt;s/cn=TCP
  to MTA B

  In this example, the RDN value is "TCP to MTA B."

Using the above example of RDN is "TCP to MTA B," create a registry key name by
using the RDN of "TCP to MTA B" as follows:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  a. Start Registry Editor.

  b. Find the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and add the following registry key value,
     with no entry for class:

  TCP to MTA B

5. Under the new registry key name, on the Edit menu, click Add Value, and
  create a new key value with a class of REG_SZ called Stack IP Address
  Override. This must be configured under the registry key named after the Link
  RDN. If you continue to use the example RDN, this definition appears as:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\TCP
  to MTA B\Stack IP Address Override

  The string value (REG_SZ) of the defined key is the IP address that the MTA
  uses when it creates outgoing connections, and is configured in standard dot
  notation, for example: 1.23.45.67. This IP address is used as the From IP
  address when sending outbound connections, and therefore allows only one
  particular IP address on the multi-homed host to be used for the given
  connector.

  After you make these changes on the multihomed server, you must restart the
  Exchange MTA Service for the modifications to take effect.

6. You must then configure the connector that receives inbound connections from
  the multihomed server to use this address.

Note that the above changes are required only for X.400 connections that are
outbound from the multihomed server. The MTA on the multihomed server still
listens with the bind set to any incoming socket, so inbound connections to
either IP address on the multihomed server are recognized and no modifications
are required for inbound connections.
