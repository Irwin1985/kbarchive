SUMMARY
=======

ADOCtl.Exe is a sample that contains ADOControls, a class library containing
controls that can be "bound" to an ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) recordset. Using
these controls, a developer can create forms that can access and update ADO
recordsets.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

Though the controls can be used with plain ADO data, the purpose of the controls
is to allow data access using Active Documents and Remote Data Services (RDS).
The following controls are included in the Adocontrols.vcx file:

  ADOCheckBox
  ADOComboBox
  ADODataControl
  ADOEditBox
  ADOGrid
  ADOLabel
  ADOListBox
  ADOOptionButton
  ADOOptionGroup
  ADOSpinner
  ADOTextBox
  DataControl (base class for ADODataControl and RDSDataControl)
  RDSDataControl

The ADO controls need either a Remote Data Service (RDS) Data Control or an ADO
Data Control for their data source. To connect a RDS Data Control to a server,
set the following properties:

- Server - Server name, usually in the format of http://MyServer

- Connect - String used to connect to the server, such as "DSN=MyDSN"

- SQL - SQL Select statement.

Once the properties are set, call the BindControls method of the data control to
bind the ADO controls to the data control. You can now use the controls as if
they are normal Visual FoxPro controls.

To send updates to the server, call the data control's UpdateRecordset method. To
cancel changes, call the data control's RefreshRecordset. This has the effect of
canceling changes since the RefreshRecordset method requeries the server and
refreshes the controls with data that is unchanged.

The ADO Data Control works in a manner similar to the RDS Data Control. The main
difference is the properties that must be set:

- ConnectionString - Character string used to connect to the server.
- SQL - SQL Select statement.

For instance, to connect to a SQL Server, the ConnectionString property might be
as follows:

  Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=MySQLServer;Initial Catalog=pubs;User
  ID=John;Password=password

After setting these properties, call the data control's BindControls method to
populate the ADO controls on the form.

Once a data control is added to the form, you can now add ADO controls to the
form. The following two custom properties need to be set in order to bind the
control to a data control:

- DataControl - Name of the data control to bind to.
- DataControlField - Field of the data control to bind to.

Note that the DataControl and DataControlField properties are similar to the
control's ControlSource property. In fact, do not change the control's
ControlSource property, as the data control's BindControls method will change
the ControlSource based on the DataControl and DataControlField properties.

The Rdssimple.pjx file is a sample Active Document project that demonstrates
using the ADO controls for Internet data access. To use the application, create
a system data source name (DSN) on the Internet Information Server that points
to a SQL Server. Set the database to the Pubs sample database.

Run the Rdssimple.app file either by typing "DO rdssimple.app" in the Command
window or by selecting Tools from the main menu, then clicking Run Active
Document and selecting Rdssimple.app. Enter the server name and connect string
in the appropriate text boxes. The server name will be in the format
"http://MyServer" (without the quotes). The connect string will be in the format
"dsn=MyDSN;uid=John;password=password;database=pubs" (without the quotes). For
the SQL statement, enter "select * from authors", then click the Run button. If
the server name, connect string and SQL statement are correct, the ADO controls
will be populated with data.

If no SQL Server is available, it is a trivial task to change the DataControl and
DataControlField properties as needed to access a different type of data.

The Adosimple.scx file is a sample form demonstrating usage of the
ADODatacontrol. To use the form, enter a connection string (such as "provider =
sqloledb;data source=MyServer;initial catalog=pubs;user
id=John;password=password", without the quotes) and a SQL statement. Click Run
and the ADO grid populates with data from the server.
