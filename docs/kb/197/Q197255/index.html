- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========


Mail addressed from Lotus cc:Mail post office "A" to Exchange Server SITE2 may
never be picked up after you change the site proxy address for cc:Mail on the
Exchange Server site (SITE1) that has a cc:Mail Connector to "A". Site1 and
Site2 have a replication connector between them, and you ran dirsync with "A"
after you changed the site proxy address for cc:Mail. You will find that the old
Exchange Server addresses were deleted from the cc:Mail directory on Site2, but
the new ones are not added by dirsync. Also, the post office entry for SITE1,
and the post office address indirection for SITE2 are not deleted from the
cc:Mail directory.

CAUSE
=====

There are two issues that are causing this problem.

- Changing the Exchange Server site proxy cc:Mail address requires two dirsync
  cycles to resynchronize. This is by design because cc:Mail requires unique
  names in its directory, and "name at PO" is not unique to cc:Mail. So the
  cc:Mail connector's dirsync process must first delete the old proxy Exchange
  Server addresses and then re-add the new proxy addresses.

- The post office address indirection for SITE2 in the cc:Mail directory will
  not be changed by the cc:Mail connector's dirsync process. This is by design
  as the dirsync process will not update post office addresses or post office
  indirection in cc:Mail if it already exists. The reason for this is if
  cc:Mail Administrators customize their post office indirection, dirsync
  should not be overwriting it. The only solution for this is to manually
  change post office definitions.

This is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========


MORE INFORMATION
================


Running dirsync again between SITE1 and the cc:Mail post office will re-add the
Exchange Server proxy cc:Mail addresses to the cc:Mail directory with their new
addresses. The post office address indirection for SITE2 in the cc:Mail
directory, however will still be directing message traffic through SITE1, which
now should be SITE_NEW. This will result in mail addressed to SITE2 never
getting picked up.
