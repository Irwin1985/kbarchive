not included in the User's Guide.

=================================================================
1. MODEM INITIALIZATION STRINGS
=================================================================

Baseball Daily registration uses an initialization string when
setting up your modem for Baseball Daily service. Most modems can
accept the standard, Hayes-compatible, string that Baseball Daily
provides for you automatically. However, some modems require a
specific string that you must enter manually.

When registering for Baseball Daily, first try using the Hayes-
compatible string provided by Complete Baseball. If you experience
connectivity problems, try the following:

1. Return to the Complete Baseball Contents screen and click the
  Daily button to begin the registration process again. Fill out
  all the information as before until you reach the Modem Settings
  dialog.

2. In the Modem Settings dialog, click Other. In the edit field
  under the Other radio button, enter the following:

     AT&amp;FQOV1EOX4SO=O

3. When you're done, click OK and complete the remaining
  registration information.

If you continue to experience connectivity problems, call
(800) 638-8730 for Baseball Daily on-line service product support.

=================================================================
2. SPECIFIC MODEM INFORMATION
=================================================================

For information regarding your particular modem, you can
call the product support phone number listed in your modem's
documentation.

=================================================================
3. COPYING FROM BASEBALL DAILY
=================================================================

To copy information from a Baseball Daily screen, press
CTRL+C. The information on the active screen is copied to
the Windows clipboard. You can now copy this information into
any word processing or spreadsheet application by switching to
that application and choosing the application's Copy command.

=================================================================
4. CHANGING YOUR PHONE PREFIX
=================================================================

If your phone uses a different prefix from the one Baseball Daily
registration offers, you can set your own phone prefix in the
[online] section of your MSSPORTS.INI file. To set your own
phone prefix:

1. Exit Complete Baseball and Baseball Daily if you are currently
  viewing them.

2. In your Windows directory, open your MSSPORTS.INI file.

3. Under the [on-line] section, add the following:

       PhonePrefix=&lt;your phone prefix&gt;

4. Choose Save from the File menu.

5. Run Complete Baseball and try downloading an issue of Baseball
  Daily again.

=================================================================
5. DISPLAY PROBLEMS
=================================================================

---------------------------------------------
8514/a AND SUPER VGA LARGE FONT VIDEO DRIVERS
---------------------------------------------

If you are using either the 8514/a or Super VGA, 256 color, Large
Font driver and a 1024 x 768 resolution, some statistics in Baseball
Daily may appear clipped or will overlap each other. Switching to
the Small Font version of either driver will fix this problem.

=================================================================
6. GENERAL PROBLEMS
=================================================================

---------------------------
CORRUPT BASEBALL DAILY FILE
---------------------------

If you receive the following error message while attempting to
view a Baseball Daily file you've already downloaded, your
Baseball Daily file may be corrupt:

  "Multimedia Viewer:
  This file is not a Viewer file and cannot be opened in this
  application."

To download another issue of the current day's Daily, first, in File
Manager, switch to the \DAILY subdirectory of your \BASEBALL directory
and delete the Baseball Daily file bearing the current day's date.
For example, if today's date is 7\8\94, you would delete the file
named 19940708.MVB. You can now download the current day's file again
by choosing the Daily button on the Complete Baseball Contents screen.

-----------------------
VIEWING PREVIOUS ISSUES
-----------------------

To view a previous issue of Baseball Daily:

1. Choose the Daily button on the Complete Baseball Contents screen.

2. In the Microsoft Baseball Daily dialog box, choose the View Old
  Issue button.

3. In the File Name list box, select the name of the file that
  corresponds with the date of the issue you want to view. For
  example, if you want to view an issue from June 15, 1994, choose
  the file named 19940615.MVB.

=================================================================
7. BILLING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT INFORMATION
=================================================================

For assistance with Baseball Daily billing questions, call
(800) 806-6587. For problems with connectivity using Baseball
Daily, call (800) 638-8730.
