Problem:

I have a file FOO, which is 21733 bytes long and contains 850 lines.
When I perform the following steps the compiler appears to hang. In
fact, however, the compiler is being forced to go to disk for its own
memory management.

When performing the steps described below with the README.DOC from C
Version 5.10 (which is 64964 bytes) and running on a 16mHz machine,
after Arg Refresh, it took almost 30 seconds for MEP to return
control.

This problem is due to the fact that MEP does its own memory
management. When you do Arg Refresh, MEP must reread the buffer
containing the modified file from disk. In addition, MEP must store
back to disk the buffer containing the last block of text pasted to
the file. This swapping of two large files is what causes the delay.

Microsoft has confirmed this lack of speed to be a limitation with
Version 1.00 and 1.02 of the Microsoft Editor. We are researching this
problem  and will post new information as it becomes available.

To duplicate this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Invoke the following to run the editor:

      [C:\]m foo

2. Make some changes to modify the buffer.

3. Issue the following command to the editor:

      arg "bar" setfile

   The editor responds "File c:\bar does not exist, create?"

4. Respond "y" for yes. You are now in bar's buffer.

5. Issue the following command to read in the original contents of the
   file:

      arg arg "foo" paste

   This process should work correctly.

6. If you now want to get rid of the new buffer, issue the following
   command:

      arg refresh

   The editor responds with something similar to the following:

      "Do you really want to delete the buffer?"

7. Respond "y" for yes.

   The editor appears to hang.
