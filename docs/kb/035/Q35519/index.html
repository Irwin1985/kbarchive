Multiple video pages are not supported in the protected mode of MS
OS/2. As stated on Page 40 of the "Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.0:
User's Guide" and on Page 522 of the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0:
Programmer's Guide," the SCREEN function ignores the active and visual
page parameters.

Since multiple pages are not supported, the PCOPY function is not
allowed in MS OS/2 protected mode. This fact needs to be added to the
section on BASIC language changes for MS OS/2 protected mode.

Through BASIC, there is no way to manipulate the video buffer directly
in MS OS/2 protected mode. However, it can be done through the use of
OS/2 API calls. The following API calls can be used to modify the
video buffer:

   VioGetBuf
   VioShowBuf
   VioGetPhysBuf
   VioScrLock
   VioScrUnLock

The VioGetBuf function retrieves the address and length of the logical
video buffer (LVB). The address of the buffer is returned in a long.
The high 2 bytes are the segment and the low 2 bytes are the offset,
as in the following example:

   x = VioGetBuf(pointer, length, 0)
   segment&amp; = pointer / &amp;H10000
   offset&amp; = pointer MOD &amp;H10000

To modify the buffer, change the segment to the segment value returned
and use PEEK and POKE to read and modify the information. Once the
information is changed, VioShowBuf is used to display the changes.

The VioGetPhysBuf function retrieves the selector of the physical
video buffer. The physical video buffer contains the current screen
image. To modify the screen, change the segment to the selector
returned and use PEEK and POKE to read and modify the screen. This
method is faster than using VioGetBuf/VioShowBuf because you are
directly modifying the screen.

For more information about these VIO API calls, please refer to your
OS/2 documentation. Listed below are two sample programs that use the
methods discussed above.

Code Examples
