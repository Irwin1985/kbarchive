Develop my Own Macros

Developing a macro is similar to programming in a high-level language.
Each macro represents a command. Instead of a collection of library
routines, you have a collection of editor functions. You begin with an
idea of a process that you would like to be performed by simply
pressing one keystroke.

Suppose you would like to be able to move the cursor to the lower-left
corner of the editing window. You know you can do this "manually" with
the arrow keys that are assigned to the "Left" and "Down" editor
functions. However, it can be simplified more. "Meta Down" moves the
cursor to the bottom of the window; "Meta Begline" moves the cursor to
the first column of the line. Together, these functions will do the
job.

This macro must now be given a unique name, for example, "Bottom". The
TOOLS.INI statement would look as follows:

   Bottom:=Meta Begline Meta Down

A macro also can be a combination of other macros. The following is an
example:

   Waydown:=Meta Down
   Wayleft:=Meta Begline
   Bottom:=Waydown Wayleft

Suppose that the "Meta Begline" command did not exist. You would need
to find some way to know that the cursor is in the first column.
Almost all of the editor functions have boolean (TRUE/FALSE) Return
Values that can be useful in developing macros.

For the "Bottom" macro, you know that "Begline" will at least move the
cursor to the first nonblank character on the line. Any further cursor
movement would have to be done using "Left". "Left" returns TRUE when
the cursor moves and FALSE when the cursor does not move.

You would want to move left until the cursor does not move anymore,
i.e., move left until "Left" returns FALSE. The editor allows you to
do this with Macro Conditionals. The following is an example:

   Bottom:=Begline :&gt;LT Left +&gt;LT Meta Down

   :&gt;LT   defines a label LT
   +&gt;LT   if Left returns TRUE, go to label LT
          if Left returns FALSE, continue

Macro Conditionals and a table of Return Values can be found in the
"Microsoft Editor User's Guide."

The final step is to assign the macro to a keystroke, as follows:

   Bottom:CTRL+END
