<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q35664
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
Operating System(s): MS-DOS

Last Modified: 16-DEC-1989

The program below demonstrates how to create your own non-ASCII
characters for use in CGA screens 1 and 2. This way you can make
characters such as 1/3, or foreign letters and symbols not found in
the ASCII or extended-ASCII character set.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00 4.00b
and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for
MS-DOS, and to Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

In graphics mode, the bit patterns for ASCII character codes 128
through 255 are obtained from a table located in RAM. The address of
this table is located in the Interrupt Vector Table at location
0000:007C (the vector for interrupt 1F). This location can be modified
to install modified character sets. Note, that on a standard IBM PC or
compatible, ASCII characters 0 through 127 are contained in the ROM
BIOS and cannot be replaced. (The IBM PCjr, which is not supported by
QuickBASIC, handles these characters differently.)

To create your own character set, you would create a table of
characters and replace the current address in the Interrupt Vector
Table with the address of your table. Keep in mind that the segment
and offset are stored "backwards" in the table. The following example

   F000: FF54

would be stored as follows:

   54 FF 00 F0

The information stored in the table should be an 8 x 8 bitmap for each
character desired. For example, the following character would be
represented by the following eight decimal values:

Character         Decimal Value
---------         -------------

11110000              240
10010000              144
10010000              144
11111110              254
10010010              146
10010010              146
10011110              158
00000000                0

The decimal value is the binary value for each line converted to
decimal.

Code Example:
------------

The three DATA statements hold the binary coding for the characters to
be represented. They are a small triangle, a sigma, and a 1/3. In
binary, the data looks like the following:

Triangle          Sigma             1/3
--------          -----             ---

00000010        11111110          10000100
00000110        00100000          10001000
00001110        00010000          10011110
00011110        00001000          10100010
00111110        00010000          01000110
01111110        00100000          10000010
11111110        11111110          00001110
