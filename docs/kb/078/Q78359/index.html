SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to successfully load and start Remote Access Server
(RAS) on a LAN Manager version 2.1 enhanced DOS workstation from two 720K floppy
disks. This procedure is primarily intended for use with older laptop machines
with dual 720K floppy disk drives and no hard drive. This configuration should
also run successfully from a machine with a single floppy disk, although it will
involve some disk swapping.

This configuration requires that LAN Manager 2.1 and RAS be successfully
installed on a DOS workstation before copying to dual 720K disks. This must be
accomplished by installing an enhanced LAN Manager 2.1 DOS workstation and the
DOS RAS service. Additionally, the RAS service on the workstation must be
correctly configured for the modem on the machine with the 720K disk drives
because the Setup program for RAS will not be included on these floppy disks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

To begin the installation, format one 720K floppy disk as a system disk (FORMAT
/S) and label it appropriately (for example, RAS Startup). Format a second
floppy disk and label it appropriately (for example, RAS Work). The following
discussion assumes that the LAN Manager enhanced workstation has been installed
to the C:\LANMAN.DOS directory. If not, make the necessary substitution in the
following discussions.

The files will be copied from the appropriate LAN Manager directory on the hard
disk to the same directory on the appropriate floppy disk. For example:

  copy c:\lanman.dos\comdev.ini a:\lanman.dos\comdev.ini

The format of the directory structure and associated files on the floppy disk
drives is listed below. Copy the listed files from the appropriate directory on
the hard disk drive to the same directory on the floppy disk drive. It is not
necessary to copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the hard disk drive
because they will need to be created in a specific format. All unnecessary files
have been removed. The main purpose of these floppy disks is to allow access to
a network via RAS on a machine that does not have a high-density disk drive or a
hard disk. There is sufficient space on each of the disks to add in necessary
DOS commands and any other desired utilities disk space will allow.

RAS Startup Disk (Disk 1):

Directory of A:\

A:\ 
  COMMAND  COM
  AUTOEXEC BAT
  CONFIG   SYS
A:\LANMAN.DOS\ 
              PROTOCOL INI
              MODEMS   INF

                  MESSAGES LOG

RAS Work Disk (Disk 2):

The following files listed in the first column must be included on this disk. The
second column lists the location of the file from the hard drive. The LANROOT
directory is assumed to be C:\LANMAN.DOS; substitute as appropriate.

B:\ 
   LANMAN   INI        C:\LANMAN.DOS
   ENCRYPT  EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES
   NETPOPUP EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES
   MSRV     EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES
   RASLOAD  BAT        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   NETWKSTA EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   CHKNET   EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   MINSES   EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   VCOMMIOD EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   WANTSR   EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   NETBIND  COM        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   NET      EXE        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
   NET      MSG        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG

MODIFICATIONS TO SYSTEM FILES
-----------------------------

The CONFIG.SYS file, shown below, resides on disk 1 and is the minimum
configuration required to run RAS and LAN Manager 2.1 from two 720K disks. Other
devices can be added as space permits.

  FILES=30
  BUFFERS=10
  LASTDRIVE=Z
  SHELL=A:\COMMAND.COM /P /E:512
  DEVICE=A:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /i:A:\LANMAN.DOS
  DEVICE=A:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ASYNC\ASYMAC.DOS

Construct the AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows. It also resides on the root of disk 1
and represents the minimum configuration needed. Other features may be added.

  @ECHO OFF
  PATH A:\;B:\;A:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG;
  PROMPT $P$G
  SET COMSPEC=A:\COMMAND.COM
  B:
  NET START WORKSTATION
  CALL RASLOAD
  A:
  RASPHONE
  B:

Edit the LANMAN.INI file on disk 2 as follows:

1. In the [workstation] section, the lanroot entry should read:

        lanroot = A:\LANMAN.DOS

2. In the [services] section, specify the new location of the LAN Manager
  services as follows:

        chknet        = B:\chknet.exe
        minses        = B:\minses.exe /n
        workstation   = B:\netwksta.exe
        messenger     = B:\msrv.exe
        netpopup      = B:\netpopup.exe
        encrypt       = B:\encrypt.exe

NOTES
-----

There are several disadvantages of running this particular configuration. All
invocations of RASPHONE must be done from drive A. All net commands (NET LOGON,
NET USE, NET SEND, and so forth) must be done from drive B. If these commands
are run from the incorrect drive, an error message similar to "unable to open
message file xxxxx.msg" will be displayed. This is not a harmful error; it means
only that it is necessary to switch to the root of the other floppy disk and
retry the command.

If any modification to the configuration of this setup is required (such as
switching modem configurations), it will be necessary to modify a fully
installed DOS LAN Manager enhanced workstation from a hard disk, and copy the
modified files to the appropriate floppy disk.
