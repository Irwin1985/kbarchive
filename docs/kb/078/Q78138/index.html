The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 3.0, 4.0 
- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 2.0, 2.01, 3.0, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation on a color printer, the
colors on the screen may not exactly match the colors on the printout. This is
also true for other programs that produce color output.

CAUSE
=====

This discrepancy in color results from the fundamental differences between how
color is produced on a video monitor and how it is produced on a color printer.

The discrepancy is particularly noticeable when you print the colors blue and
yellow. Blue usually prints darker than it appears on the screen and has a
purple tint. Yellow usually prints with a golden-brown tint. In both cases, you
can attain the desired color by increasing the brightness of the color as it
appears on the screen.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid undesirable results in color printing requires experience. Identifying
and using colors that print reliably is the best way to achieve predictable and
desirable results.

To test how colors render on your device, print the PowerPoint color palette to
your color printer. Keep this printout near your printer, and refer to it when
applying color to your PowerPoint presentations.

You can obtain the Printme.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center. This file
is a self-extracting archive that contains the Printme.ppt file. The first slide
contains instructions on how to use the presentation.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Printme.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/powerpoint95/sample1/1/WIN98/EN-US/printme.exe)
  Contains: Printme.ppt; Release Date: September 11, 1997

servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

PowerPoint 95
-------------

Open the Printme.ppt file located in the ValuPack\PPSample folder on the
PowerPoint compact disc.

NOTE: The Printme.ppt presentation included with PowerPoint 95 is an updated
version of the file included with PowerPoint 4.0. However, the slides in
Printme.ppt do not have direct correspondence with any of the PowerPoint 95
dialog boxes. The Genigraphics Color Palette is available as the Other Color
dialog box in PowerPoint 4.0.

PowerPoint 4.0 for the Macintosh and Windows
--------------------------------------------

Open the "Printme.ppt - Colors &amp; Patterns" file (Macintosh) or the
Printme.ppt file (Windows). This file is located in the Microsoft PowerPoint
4.0:Samples folder (Macintosh) or the Powerpnt\Samples folder (Windows). Print
the Genigraphics Color Palette (slide 2).

The Genigraphics Color Palette slide corresponds with the Other Color dialog box.
Use the following steps to open the Other Color dialog box:

1. Draw a box on the slide and select it.

2. On the Format menu, click Colors And Lines.

3. From the Fill or Line list, select Other Color.

PowerPoint 3 for Macintosh
--------------------------

Open the "Drawcolr.ppt - Color Palettes" file located in the Samples folder.

PowerPoint 3 for Windows
------------------------

Open the Drawcolr.ppt file located in the Samples folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Your video display is based on a process that combines various amounts of red-,
green-, and blue-emitted light to produce the various colors that you see on the
screen. This is known as an additive color process. With this process, combining
all three colors produces white; combining none of the colors produces black.

In contrast, almost all color printers produce color by combining various amounts
of cyan, magenta, and yellow pigment (and sometimes black). This is known as a
subtractive color process. With this process, combining all three colors
produces black; combining none of the colors produces white (assuming you are
printing on white paper).
