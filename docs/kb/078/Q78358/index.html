SYMPTOMS
========

Logon scripts that are set up and run properly under MS-DOS versions 4.0 and
earlier may run out of environment space after the system is upgraded to MS-DOS
5.0. This problem occurs even after attempting to increase the environment space
with the /E switch on the SHELL=\command.com /E:1024 /P command.

For example, even the /E:32786 setting results in the logon scripts running out
of space almost immediately.

CAUSE
=====

MS-DOS 5.0 does not manage the environment space in the same way earlier
versions did. When logon scripts are enabled, a second copy of the command shell
(COMMAND.COM) is started to run them, and a new COMMAND.COM uses the lower
default environment space allocation. Thus, no matter what is set in the SHELL=
command line, the low environment space allocation is always used. In addition
to environment variables, most logon scripts contain NET USE commands (which
require memory) so the environment space is rapidly exhausted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To retain this functionality in the logon scripts under MS-DOS 5.0, use the
following workaround:

1. In the current logon script, echo all NET USEs and SETs to a batch file. For
  example:

     echo set s_user=KATHY &gt; c:\user.bat
     echo set s_mbox=kathy, J1 &gt;&gt; c:\user.bat
     echo net use v: \\traveler\public &gt;&gt; c:\user.bat

  This creates the batch file USER.BAT, customized for each user when they log
  on. Note that the first echo line contains a single angle bracket (&gt;),
  which creates the file USER.BAT. Subsequent echo lines contain double angle
  brackets (&gt;&gt;), which append the lines to the end of the newly created
  batch file.

2. Create a generic logon batch file for the user to run instead of issuing a
  NET LOGON command. For example:

     net logon %1 %2
     call c:\uses.bat
     del c:\uses.bat

  Typing "logon &lt;user&gt; &lt;password&gt;" (without the quotation marks) now
  logs on the user. The logon script creates the USES.BAT file, customized for
  the user. Once the logon has completed, the USES.BAT file is called and all
  NET USEs (and SET commands) are performed. The USES.BAT file is then removed.

To ease the administration of having additional batch files, the LOGON.BAT file
can be created on the primary domain controller (PDC)then replicated with the
logon scripts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in LAN Manager version 2.0. This
problem was corrected in LAN Manager version 2.1.
