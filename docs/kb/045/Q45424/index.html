Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50

Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS, and Microsoft BASIC PDS
Version 7.00 for MS-DOS support up to SCREEN 13, depending on the
video card installed in your machine. Using the COLOR statement, in
all color modes you can simultaneously display all foreground colors
available in that particular mode.

However, simultaneously displaying multiple background colors is
supported only in SCREEN mode 0 (zero) (character mode). SCREEN 0 is
the only SCREEN mode that supports displaying all 16 foreground colors
and all 8 background colors simultaneously. When you invoke the COLOR
statement with a background color argument in any SCREEN mode other
than 0, you get only one background color, and the entire screen
background is affected.

The QuickBASIC program below contains routines that, if used in place
of PRINT and COLOR when in SCREEN 9, provide the ability to display 16
foreground colors and 16 "background" colors simultaneously. This
program uses foreground colors with bit masking to draw inverse-video
characters with multiple background colors simultaneously on the
screen in graphics mode. The routines could easily be modified to
support SCREEN 12. The support module, without any modification, can
be converted into a .LIB library or left as an .OBJ object file and
linked into your program.

This support module operates correctly if compiled using QuickBASIC
Versions 4.00, 4.00b, or 4.50, Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 6.00
or 6.00b for MS-DOS, or Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

For information on a similar technique for Hercules SCREEN 3, query on
the word INVERSEPRINT.

The module below contains two SUBprograms that can be CALLed in the
same way as the PRINT or COLOR statements when the following $INCLUDE
file is included, or can be used with the CALL statement. The INCLUDE
file contains the DECLARE statements for the S9COLOR and S9PRINT and
CONST declarations for all 16 colors so the colors can be referenced
by name. The two routines are as follows:

1. S9COLOR: Takes two parameters: foreground color and background
   color, respectively. Unlike the COLOR statement, the parameters are
   not optional. If you want to change only the foreground color, both
   parameters must be provided. The COLOR statement can still be used,
   but it will not affect strings printed using S9PRINT. The following
   is an example:

      S9COLOR Green, BrRed
      CALL S9COLOR (BrBlue, Cyan)

2. S9PRINT: Takes only one parameter, the STRING to be printed. The
   parameter can be a simple STRING literal or a STRING expression. No
   special formatting characters are supported, but they could easily
   be added. Placing a pipe character (|) at the end of the STRING
   causes a carriage return-linefeed to be executed after the STRING
   is printed. The following is an example:

      S9PRINT "This is the text to be printed"
      S9PRINT A$+B$
      S9PRINT STRING$(50,"X")
      S9PRINT "The PIPE causes a CRLF|"  'the PIPE is not printed
      CALL S9PRINT "CALL statement used"

Code (Example of Main Program)
------------------------------

The program below demonstrates the use of the S9COLOR and S9PRINT
routines. It simultaneously displays all the possible combinations of
foreground and background colors.

To compile the program, do the following:

1. To create S9LIB.OBJ, issue the following command:

      BC S9LIB;

   To create S9LIB.LIB, issue the following command:

      LIB S9LIB S9LIB.OBJ;

2. If using S9LIB.OBJ, issue the following command:

      BC S9DEMO;
      LINK S9DEMO S9LIB;

   If using S9LIB.LIB, issue the following command:

      BC S9DEMO;
      LINK S9DEMO,,,S9LIB
