If you'd like to install your C compiler so that you can create both
DOS and OS/2 applications, you have three options. The option you
select affects the compiler options you must set when you compile for
the two operating systems.

The three options are as follows:

1. Rename none of the libraries.

2. Rename the protected-mode libraries to the default names.

3. Rename the real-mode libraries to the default names. This
   renaming can also be done while setting up the product.

To install for both OS/2 and DOS, select both operating systems when
using SETUP to install the product. If you've already installed the
product for only one operating system, the easiest method is to
reinstall again from the beginning.

Once the dual installation is done, you have the following two sets of
libraries (unless you tell SETUP to rename libraries for you when it
asks):

1. Those whose names are of the form xLIBCyR.LIB (where x is S, M, C,
   or L for the memory model and y is E, 7, or A for the math option --
   see the Version 5.10 "Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler for the MS-DOS
   Operating System User's Guide" for more information) for "R"eal mode.

2. Those whose names are of the form xLIBCyP.LIB for "P"rotected mode.

If you install medium model emulator math only, and don't tell SETUP
to rename libraries, the libraries will be named "MLIBCEP.LIB" and
"MLIBCER.LIB". There will be no library named with the default name,
which is "MLIBCE.LIB".

You can leave the libraries named in this way; however, if you do, you
must always compile with one of the /Lr (link real mode), /Lc (link
compatibility mode -- a synonym for real mode), or /Lp (link protected
mode) compiler options.

None of the /Lp, /Lc, or /Lp options affects the compilation process;
they only affect what libraries the linker is asked to link in.
Whether the final executable program is a real-mode executable or a
protected-mode executable is determined solely by the library with
which you link.

The /Lp option tells the linker to ignore the default library and to
use xLIBCyP.LIB instead (x and y depend on the memory model and math
option selected by the /Ax and /FP switches). The /Lr and /Lc options
tell the linker to use xLIBCyR.LIB rather than the default. xLIBCy is
the library generated if none of these options is used. This is shown
in the following table:

   Compiler Flags                          Library Used
   --------------                          ------------

      -AS                                     SLIBCE
      -AL -FPi87                              LLIBC7
      -AM -FPa -Lp                            MLIBCAP
      -AH -FPc -Lr                            LLIBCER

If you do most of your programming for one operating system or the
other, you can rename the appropriate libraries (xLIBCyR or xLIBCyP)
to xLIBCy and avoid having to use /Lp or /Lr. You still must use /Lp
or /Lr when compiling for the other mode. For instance, if you rename
the xLIBCyP libraries to xLIBCy, then when you compile without a /Lc
or /Lr option, your executable will be a protected-mode executable.
To generate a DOS executable, you must use /Lr or /Lc. Instead, if you
rename the xLIBCyR libraries to xLIBCy, the default mode will be DOS
-- you must use /Lp to produce an OS/2 program.
