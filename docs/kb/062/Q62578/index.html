-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.00 (shipped with C version 6.00)
includes a "Set Dependencies" option in the "Set Program List" window. This
option automatically sets up build dependencies for all include files used in
the current project. This option will fail with a message that the include file
does not exist if there are embedded spaces between the left angle bracket
(&lt;) and the include-file name in an include directive line.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Set Dependencies option will work correctly if the space(s) are removed or
if a new build option is added to the TOOLS.INI file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Programmer's WorkBench
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the Programmer's WorkBench version
1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although embedded spaces are legal in C programming syntax, the Programmer's
WorkBench fails to parse the include line correctly if spaces exist before the
filename. The following line of code shows the situation where the "Set
Dependencies" error will occur:

     #include &lt; stdio.h &gt;

The space before the "s" in stdio.h prevents PWB from finding the STDIO.H include
file. (The trailing space after stdio.h does not affect the behavior of "Set
Dependencies".)

The full text of the error message window for the line above is as follows:

  stdio.h does not exist

  Cannot build its dependency tree. Abort dependency lists generation?

  &lt;Yes&gt; &lt;No&gt; &lt;Help&gt;

Selecting &lt;Help&gt; displays a help screen that describes the problem as being
either a mistyped filename or a nonexistent file, but the actual file DOES
exist. Removing the embedded space will correct the problem.

You can also add two new "build" lines to the TOOLS.INI file to make the PWB
recognize include directives that contain spaces. These lines should be included
under the section with the [PWB] tag, and should have the following syntax:

  build: include .c \

  "^[ \t]*#[ \t]*include[ \t]*\"[ \t]*\\([^\"]+[ \t]*\\)\"" \ case

  build: include .c \

  "^[ \t]*#[ \t]*include[ \t]*&lt;[ \t]*\\([^&gt;]+\\)[ \t]*&gt;" \ case system

(Note: These build switch statements are broken down into multiple lines with the
line continuation character (\) because of space limitations; you may enter each
of them into the TOOLS.INI file on a single line, rather than multiple lines.)

There is one drawback to this workaround; you will still get the error message
shown above because the "old" build switch is applied before the new one. To
have the new build switch take effect, you need to select "No" when prompted to
abort the dependency list generation. Once you have selected "No" for each file
with spaces in the include directive, the dependencies will then be generated
correctly.
