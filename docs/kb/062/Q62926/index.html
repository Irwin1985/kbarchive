The following information describes stack checking and the use of the
Microsoft C Compiler /Gs switch.

To address stack checking and the /Gs compile switch, we must first
build a model that describes why and where stack checking occurs.

This article assumes a basic knowledge of OS/2 multitasking,
processes, and threads. Processes are essentially a unit of ownership
under OS/2. As the loader reads a program (an .EXE file) into memory,
it builds an LDT (Local Descriptor Table) with entries that point to
all the memory allocated for the process. At a minimum, a process will
have two memory segments, a code segment and a data segment. The data
segment has three major areas including a heap, a stack, and static
areas, respectively:

   Physical Memory Areas   Virtual Memory

     Data Segment              LDT
   +-----------------+     +---------+
   |   heap area     |   -&lt;|         | &lt;=-  DS: SS:
   +-----------------+  |  +---------+
   |  stack area     |  |  |         |
   +-----------------+  |  +---------+
   | static area     |  |  |         |
   +-----------------+&lt;-   +---------+
                           |         |
                           +---------|
                         -&lt;|         | &lt;=-  CS:
                        |  +---------+
       Code Segment     |  |         |
   +-----------------+  |  +---------+
   |                 |  |  |         |
   +-----------------+&lt;-   +---------+

On the other hand, "execution" requires a processor, state
information, status, priority, and a stack area for arguments,
parameters, and addresses. The stack area produced by the loader is
used by thread 1 of the process.

Depending on the application's dependency on C library routines, the
programmer may choose to either use DosCreateThread() or _beginthread
to create threads. The API calls used to create and terminate threads
are DosCreateThread() and DosExit(EXIT_THREAD, 0), whereas the C
run-time calls are _beginthead and _endthread.

Under OS/2 version 1.20 and the C Compiler version 5.10, we present
three alternative areas that may be used as stack areas for threads
(allocated segments, heap, and static). The stack parameter in either
call should point to the stack area to be used by the new thread. This
new stack area can be allocated by doing the following:

   Method 1: You can use the DosAllocSeg() function to create a new
             segment in memory, and a new LDT entry, and allows the 286
             to monitor faults when the thread exceeds the stack area.

   Method 2: You can use the malloc(...) C function to extend the
             processes heap area, which results in the creation of an
             allocation area that the new thread will use as it's stack
             area. This new area is within the same memory segment as
             the area used by thread 1.

   Method 3: You can use a global array. A variable declaration such as
             static CHAR area[4096]; creates a 4K area in the static
             area of the process's data segment that may be used by the
             new thread for it's execution. This area is also within the
             same memory segment as the area used by thread 1.

It is important to understand where these allocations are placed in
memory before considering stack checking (/Gs). Looking at each
method, they appear to the process as described below:

     **Method 1                LDT
   +-----------------+
   | New Seg from    |
   | DosAllocSeg()   |
   +-----------------+&lt;-
                        |  +---------+
     Data Segment        -&lt;|         | New LDT Entry (Method 1)
   +-----------------+     +---------+
   |   heap area     |   -&lt;|         | &lt;=-  DS: SS:
   | **Method 2      |  |  +---------+
   +-----------------+  |  |         |
   |  stack area     |  |  +---------+
   +-----------------+  |  |         |
   | static area     |  |  +---------+
   | **Method 3      |  |  |         |
   +-----------------+&lt;-   +---------+
                         -&lt;|         | &lt;=-  CS:
                        |  +---------+
       Code Segment     |  |         |
   +-----------------+  |  +---------+
   |                 |  |  |         |
   +-----------------+&lt;-   +---------+

The address (pointer to the new area) is specified by the pbThrdStack
parameter in either the DosCreateThread() or _beginthread call. See
the documentation on these functions for details as to where the
pointer should actually point within the allocation and remember that
stacks grow down in memory towards lower addresses.

Finally, we address stack checking and the /Gs switch used in the C
Compiler. Stack checking is a protective mechanism built into ALL
computer languages to ensure that during a thread's execution, as
values are added and removed from the stack area (using PUSH and POP
instructions respectively), the thread does not accidentally exceed the
stack area and destroy other data.

In the C Compiler version 5.10 and other languages, the default stack
checking algorithm has historically only needed to watch one area and
one execution element. Consequently, the stack checking problem
arises. The basic assumption is that attempts to add and remove data
from the stack area using PUSH and POP instructions will only occur in
the stack area setup for thread 1 in the process's data segment.

Under OS/2, there will typically be multiple threads and multiple
stack areas, and the basic assumption for the stack is no longer
valid. Also, SS != DS in most DLLs (Dynamic Linked Libraries) since
the data segment is changed as the DLL is entered. Once the initial
assumption is broken, the C Compiler stack checking will start
reporting false stack overflow errors.

Consequently, you should use the /Gs switch to turn off stack
checking. Without stack checking, the C Compiler will not include the
algorithm depicted above. The code generated in the compile step will
be smaller and faster. It is up to the programmer to ensure that the
stack area for the new thread is large enough to accommodate all the
PUSH and POP operations.

As an additional note, even in the single-threaded case where stack
checking can work, the output will be lost in a Presentation Manager
(PM) application since standard output is redirected to null. It can be
recovered by redirecting output with "&gt;" or "|" on the command line.

And finally, ALL the above problems do not occur when using the C
Compiler version 6.00 and OS/2 version 2.00 because the programmer
does NOT have to allocate stack areas. OS/2 version 2.00 will do it
automatically and if a process or thread ever exceeds the stack area,
OS/2 version 2.00 will expand it on the fly.
