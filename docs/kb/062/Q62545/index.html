The following information is taken from the Windows/286 and /386
version 2.11 RAMDRIVE.TXT document:

Using RAMDrive with Windows
---------------------------

First, follow the installation instructions provided by your extended
memory board manufacturer. Next, copy the file RAMDRIVE.SYS from the
Utilities 2 disk to your fixed disk. Then, add the following command
line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=[drive:][path]RAMDRIVE.SYS [bbbb] [ssss] [dddd] [/E or /U]

Note that either /E or /U may be specified, but not both. If you do
not specify one of these two, then RAMDrive will use system memory for
RAMDrives. It is almost always a bad idea to use conventional memory
for a RAMDrive, as it will significantly reduce the performance of
Windows. Running RAMDrive in extended (/E) memory, or on an AT&amp;T 6300
Plus (/U), is much preferred. The following is an explanation of the
parameters:

Note: Information in a RAMDrive is lost when you reboot or restart
your computer.

   [bbbb]  The first numeric argument, if present, is the amount of
           memory in kilobytes to be used as your RAMDrive. If no
           numeric arguments are specified, then the default value is
           64K. The minimum amount of memory needed is 16K; the
           maximum amount of memory possible is 4096K.

   [ssss]  The second numeric argument, if present, is the sector size
           in bytes. If a second numeric argument is not specified,
           the default is 512 bytes. The four possible values are 128,
           256, 512, and 1024 bytes.

           Note: With IBM PC-DOS or Olivetti DOS the maximum value
           allowed is 512 bytes. With MS-DOS 1024 bytes is the maximum
           value.

           Values are rounded up to the nearest sector size boundary.

   [dddd]  The third numeric argument, if present, is the number of
           root directory entries. If no third numeric argument is
           specified, then the default is 64. The minimum number of
           entries needed is 2; the maximum number allowed is 1024.

           Note: If there is too little memory to create the number of
           root directory entries specified, then RAMDrive attempts to
           create a RAMDrive with fewer root directory entries.

   /E      Specifies that extended memory is to be used for the
           RAMDrive.

   /U      Specifies that some or all of the 384K of upper extended
           memory on the AT&amp;T 6300 PLUS motherboard is to be used as
           an extra RAMDrive. You may only specify this parameter with
           an AT&amp;T 6300 PLUS.

           Note: There is 1K of RAMDrive overhead. Only 383K is
           available for RAMDrives. This overhead is constant; it does
           not depend on the number of RAMDrives installed.

Error Messages
--------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: Computer must be PC-AT, or PC-AT compatible

Explanation:  There is no extended memory available on your PC-AT or
              compatible for RAMDrives.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Remove the /E parameter. Try installing RAMDrive in
              system memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: No extended memory available

Explanation:  Your computer has no memory available for RAMDrives.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Free some extended memory or obtain more memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: Insufficient memory

Explanation:  Your computer has some memory available, but not enough
              to set up a RAMDrive.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Free some extended memory or obtain more memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: Invalid parameter

Explanation:  The parameters you specified in your CONFIG.SYS entry
              for RAMDRIVE.SYS are not correct.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Check to see if you specified too many parameters if one
              of your numeric parameters is not valid, if you
              specified conflicting switches (i.e., only one of /E or
              /U may be specified), or if you specified too many
              switches. Change the RAMDRIVE.SYS command line in your
              CONFIG.SYS file to conform to the usage described above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: Incorrect DOS version

Explanation:  RAMDrive requires DOS 2.x or DOS 3.x. Windows 2.10
              requires DOS 3.00 or higher.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Upgrade to DOS 3.0 or higher.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: I/O error accessing drive memory

Explanation:  During the set up of the RAMDrive, an error was detected
              in the memory being accessed for RAMDrive.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Run the memory test for the memory on which you were
              attempting to install a RAMDrive.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Messages
--------------

    Message:  Microsoft RAMDrive version Y.YY virtual disk [drive:]

Explanation:  RAMDrive Header message. Y.YY is the version of
              RAMDrive; [drive:] is the DOS drive letter assigned to
              this RAMDrive.

              Note: On DOS 2.x the "virtual disk d:" part of this
              message will not be printed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  Disk size: x k
              Sector size: x bytes
              Allocation unit: x sectors
              Directory entries: x

Explanation:  This message tells how many kilobytes of memory were
              assigned to the RAMDrive, how many bytes there are in a
              sector, how many sectors there are in an allocation
              unit, and how many root directory entries there are
              (including the volume label).
