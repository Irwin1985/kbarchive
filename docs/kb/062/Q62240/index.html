-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface allows the power of Microsoft Mail to be
used to meet your custom needs.

Since the HyperCard Application Programming Interface (HAPI) makes all of the
functions of Mail fully available for programming and use, there are many
possibilities for streamlining and customizing the use of Mail. Below is a list
of some possible utilities and stacks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Utility or Stack Description
----------------------------

Archive messages        Using the DisplayMessageCenter, a user could
                       pick which messages should be archived. These
                       could be stored in the stack, or saved to a
                       file for importation into a database.

Auto Replies            Similar to the Out of Office stack shipped with
                       the functions. Waits for incoming messages,
                       and auto-replies to the Sender with a preset
                       message, such as "I am gone to xxx, will be
                       back at y:yy."

Anonymous Suggestion
Program                 Logs into a "Suggestion" account and reads
                       each message. Puts the body of each message
                       into the body of a new message and sends the
                       new message to the suggestion reviewer. The
                       original sender is then anonymous to the
                       reviewer.

Garbage Collector       Deletes all read files that are older in days
                       than the number in an "Aged" field.

Space Saver             Downloads and deletes all read messages with
                       enclosures.

Order Automation        Using a custom form, the order taker can fill
                       in the blanks while on the telephone. When the
                       form is completed, the message is automatically
                       sent to the "Order Taker." This stack creates
                       the data document for Word with the address,
                       prints a packing list, sends the accounts
                       payable department a notice of the order, and
                       the warehouse an itemized list of what items to
                       pull from stock. At the end of the day, it
                       totals and prints a report that summarizes the
                       number of orders and gives an inventory update,
                       bookings, the number of labels to print.

Active Bulletin Board
System News Center.     A user can send in a subscription
                       to various topics. When an article is sent,
                       the News Center forwards the message to the
                       people interested in that topic.

Mail Forwarding         When moving a user is moved from one account
                       on one server to a different server, the user
                       could forward all their mail with the touch
                       of a button.

Mail Retrieval          For large networks with multiple servers,
                       a stack could be made in Mail 3.00 that
                       logs into each server as network manager
                       and forwards all mail to one account.

Server Report           The stack reads the server usage report saved
                       in Word format from the Network Administrator
                       and sends a message to all those users that
                       exceed limits in too much space used,
                       old unread messages, or large enclosures,
                       asking them to save and delete the messages.

Tension Relief          Play-By-Mail games. You make a move and the
                       stack sends the move to your opponent. When
                       the opponent has some spare time, she or he
                       can run the stack, which downloads the move,
                       and waits for the opponent to respond. Chess,
                       checkers, and tic-tac-toe are simple
                       possibilities. For use at low-traffic times
                       only.

Training tools          A stack could monitor a student's progress
                       through it and mail the instructor when the
                       student is stuck on the same part for a long
                       time. In addition, the stack could forward
                       completed tests.

Teacher's tools         Upon receipt of test results, it can grade
                       multiple choice tests, compute the class
                       average, and send the results (text and
                       graphs) to the class participants.

Because the HyperCard Application Programming Interface supports virtually all
calls to the Mail server, the possible uses of the SDK for creating utilities
and applications that employ Mail as a communications backbone are almost
unlimited. The above suggestions are only a sample of the possibilities.
