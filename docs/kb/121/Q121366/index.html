SUMMARY
=======

The .PDB extension stands for "program database." It holds the new format for
storing debugging information that was introduced in Visual C++ version 1.0. In
the future, the .PDB file will also hold other project state information. One of
the most important motivations for the change in format was to allow incremental
linking of debug versions of programs, a change first introduced in Visual C++
version 2.0.

The .DBG extension stands for "debug." The .DBG files created with the 32-bit NT
toolset are in the Portable Executable (PE) file format. They contain sections
with COFF, FPO, and in some cases Codeview information. The Visual C++
integrated debugger can read .DBG files in this format, however it ignores the
COFF symbol sections and looks for Codeview information.

If you need to determine what symbol information is contained in a .DBG file, you
can type the following at the command prompt:

Dumpbin sample.dbg/symbol.

Note: The path might need to include directories for Dumpbin.exe and
MSdis100.dll:

Path=%Path%;C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\bin;C:\Msssdk\bin

MORE INFORMATION
================

The .PDB Files
--------------

While earlier, 16-bit versions of Visual C++ used .PDB files, the debugging
information stored in them was appended to the end of the .EXE or .DLL file by
the linker. In the versions of Visual C++ mentioned above, both the linker and
the integrated debugger were modified to allow .PDB files to be used directly
during the debugging process, thereby eliminating substantial amounts of work
for the linker and also bypassing the cumbersome CVPACK limit of 64K types.

For more information on CVPACK limitations, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q112335 BUG: CK1020 or CK4009 Encountered When Type Info Exceeds 64K

By default, when you build projects generated by the Visual Workbench, the
compiler switch /Fd is used to rename the .PDB file to &lt;project&gt;.PDB.
Therefore, you will have only one .PDB file for the entire project.

When you run makefiles that were not generated by the Visual Workbench, and the
/Fd is not used with /Zi, you will end up with two .PDB files:

- VCx0.PDB (where "x" refers to the major version of the corresponding Visual
  C++, either "2" or "4"), which stores all debugging information for the
  individual .OBJ files. It resides in the directory where the project makefile
  resides.

- &lt;project&gt;.PDB, which stores all debugging information for the resulting
  .EXE file. It resides in the \WINDEBUG subdirectory.

Why two files? When the compiler is run, it doesn't know the name of the .EXE
file into which the .OBJ files will be linked, so the compiler can't put the
information into &lt;project&gt;.PDB. The two files store different information.
Each time you compile an .OBJ file, the compiler merges the debugging
information into VCX0.PDB. It does not put in symbol information such as
function definitions. It only puts in information concerning types. One benefit
of this is that when every source file includes common header files such as
&lt;windows.h&gt;, all the typedefs from these headers are only stored once,
rather than in every .OBJ file.

When you run the linker, it creates &lt;project&gt;.PDB, which holds the
debugging information for the project's .EXE file. All debugging information,
including function prototypes and everything else, is placed into
&lt;project&gt;.PDB, not just the type information found in VCX0.PDB. The two
kinds of .PDB files share the same extension because they are architecturally
similar; they both allow incremental updates. Nevertheless, they actually store
different information.

The new Visual C++ debugger uses the &lt;project&gt;.PDB file created by the
linker directly, and embeds the absolute path to the .PDB in the .EXE or .DLL
file. If the debugger can't find the .PDB file at that location or if the path
is invalid (if, for example, the project was moved to another computer), the
debugger looks for it in the current directory.

The .DBG Files
--------------

The Visual C++ integrated debugger can also use .DBG files as long as they are
made from a binary containing Codeview format debugging output. These are useful
for debugging when the source code is not available. Even without the source,
.DBG files allow you to set breakpoints on functions, watch variables, and see
the functions in the callstack. They are also required for OLE RPC debugging.

One caveat needs to be pointed out: when working with symbols from a .DBG file,
you must use the fully decorated names. For example, to set a breakpoint on a
call to the Windows sndPlaySound function, you would specify _sndPlaySoundA@8 as
the location.

There are actually two .DBG file formats. The old format has existed for quite a
while in the 16-bit world. For example, because the format of .COM files is a
simple binary image loaded into memory, the Codeview debugging information could
not be appended to the end of the file because the file size might exceed the
64K limit for a .COM file. Therefore the symbolic information was instead put
into a separate .DBG file, which had only Codeview information in it. The .DBG
files could also be generated by running CVPACK on an .EXE file using the /strip
option.

For 32-bit .EXEs, the Visual C++ version 2.x and 4.x debugger's symbol handler
does not read the old format. Instead, it reads the format used in the Windows
NT .DBG files, supplied for use with its system .DLL files. These .DBG files are
in the Portable Executable (PE) file format and contain sections with COFF, FPO,
and in some cases Codeview symbolic information. The new Visual C++ debugger
reads .DBG files in this format only. Furthermore, it only uses the Codeview
information, ignoring the other symbol sections.

It is possible to strip debug information from a PE file and store it in a .DBG
file for use by debuggers. For this to work, the debugger needs to know whether
to find the debug information in a separate file or not and whether the
information has been stripped from the file or not. One method would be for the
debugger to search through the executable file looking for debug information.
However, to save the debugger from having to search the file, a file
characteristic field (IMAGE_FILE_DEBUG_STRIPPED) was invented that indicates
that the file has been stripped. Debuggers can look for this field in the PE
file header to quickly determine whether the debug information is present in the
file or not.

To generate a .DBG file in this format, you can use REBASE.EXE, which is provided
with the Win32 SDK. Please see the Win32 SDK documentation for more details.

During the Windows NT retail builds, debug symbols are stripped from the system
binaries and drivers and stored in separate .DBG files. This is done because the
Windows NT kernel debugger can use these .DBG files and provide debugging
symbols even for optimized drivers. Remember, however, that the Visual C++
integrated debugger is not designed to debug protected mode kernel code.

The Windows NT symbol files can be found in a debug subdirectory of the \SUPPORT
directory on the Windows NT retail CD-ROM. These files must be copied from the
CD-ROM to your hard drive. For user mode debugging on the target debugger
machine, .DBG symbols must be present in the Windows NT \&lt;winnt&gt;\SYMBOLS
directory of the target system (&lt;winnt&gt; is the directory where Windows NT
is installed). The new Visual C++ setup program installs an "NT System Symbols
Setup" icon in your program group. You can use it to automatically copy the .DBG
files from your Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM disk to the correct directory
structure on your hard drive. This method does not work for the Windows NT
Server 4.0 CD-ROM because the .DBG files are stored in compressed format.

For kernel debugging, place .DBG files into a symbols tree underneath the
directory specified by the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH environment variable (for example,
C:\DEBUG\SYMBOLS). Kernel debugging is possible with a minimal set of symbols
consisting of symbols for all the drivers (*.SYS) in the SYMBOLS\SYS directory,
and symbols for NTOSKRNL.EXE and HAL.DLL in the SYMBOLS\EXE and SYMBOLS\DLL
directories, respectively. For more information on kernel debugging, refer to
the discussion regarding kernel debugging in the Windows NT DDK Programmer's
Guide.

While it is theoretically possible to convert from a .PDB file back to a .DBG
file, it is not a trivial task. At this time, we know of no such tool. If we
hear of such a tool, we will update this article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base.
