-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access a file on a NTFS partition, a message appears saying
that file(s) are corrupt and that you should run CHKDSK.EXE to repair the
problem. After running CHKDSK.EXE, the problem reoccurs.

-or-

An application performing a write operation to the NTFS disk hang and other
applications may subsequently hang when they attempt to perform disk
operations.

NOTE: The file(s) indicated are NOT corrupted. Running CHKDSK.EXE is not
successful because CHKDSK.EXE has nothing to repair.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is in the way that NTFS.SYS handles certain internal files
structures when multiple attributes are present.

While the problem is extremely difficult to reproduce, it is most likely to
affect files with 'extra' data attributes that are located in directories with
'extra' data attributes. Files and directories in Services for Macintosh (SFM)
volumes have such extra data attributes, so the problem is more likely to occur
on these files. Files with long names in addition to 8.3 names and files
manipulated with the POSIX subsystem which may have additional named data
streams are more likely to trigger the problem than other NTFS files.

WORKAROUND
==========

When the error message appears, it is usually possible to retry the operation
successfully. It may be helpful to give the file a different name, or to copy
the file using a different technique.

If your computer hangs due to the application attempting to write to a file,
there is no option except to restart the operating system. Although file system
corruption is not likely, as with any improper (dirty) system shutdown, user
data may be lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem has been corrected in the latest
service pack for Windows NT 3.1 and in Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT
Server version 3.5.
