-----------------------------------------------
1.  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING ART GALLERY
-----------------------------------------------

To install and run Art Gallery you need:

-  a Macintosh computer with a Macintosh-compatible color monitor
-  System 6.0.7 or later
-  4 MB of memory
-  at least 1 MB of available hard disk space
-  a CD-ROM drive

You can choose to run Art Gallery directly from the compact disc or
install it on your hard disk. Installing the program makes it load a
little faster, but uses space on the hard disk.  Since the sounds and
pictures remain on the CD, you will still need to insert the compact
disc to use Art Gallery.

If you run the Installer, it will add any necessary files to your
System Folder. It will also copy the Art Gallery program files to a new
folder on your hard disk.

System 6.07 and System 6.08 users who want to run Art Gallery directly
from the CD need to have the file '32-Bit QuickDraw' in their System
Folder.  If it is not already there,  you will need to do the
following: drag the file called '32-Bit QuickDraw' from the System
Files folder on the CD into your System Folder.  For System 7 users,
this file is already incorporated into the system file itself so you
won't need to copy anything to your System Folder. If it can't find
this file when you run Art Gallery from the CD, it will prompt you to
run the Installer.

--------------
2.  MEMORY USE
--------------
Art Gallery needs a reasonably large amount of your computer's system
memory (RAM) to display pictures and play sounds. It should run on any
Macintosh with 4 MB (4,096K) of memory.  Most users will not have
problems, but if you have only 4MB of memory and your system software
is large (you have a lot of files in your System Folder), you may need
to adjust memory usage to make Art Gallery run properly. Here are more
details on doing this:

Art Gallery is pre-set to a preferred memory size of 2,200K and a
minimum memory size of 1,800K. The program will take up to 2,200K
memory if it is available, but use less if it is not.

If there  is less than 1,800K available, the system may give you a
message like

The application "Microsoft Art Gallery" could
not be opened (2,200K needed, 1,230 available)...

You will be returned to the Finder. You can do two things to fix this:
A) Free up more system memory for it, or B) set Art Gallery to use even
less memory. Try to free up system memory first.  See below for further
details on A) and B).

NOTE:  To System 6.07 and System 6.08 users:

If there is not 2,200K of memory available, you may see a message like

There is not enough memory to open "Microsoft Musical
Instruments" (2,200K needed, 1,960K available). Do you
want to open it using the available memory?
Click OK, and Art Gallery will run using the available memory.

A) TRY TO FREE UP SYSTEM MEMORY
Here are some suggestions:

-   Run only one application at a time. If others are
    running, close them and start Art Gallery again.

-   Check the amount of memory being used by your system
    software. System software and accessories can occupy
    memory and slow performance. The "About this Macintosh..."
    box shows how much memory your computer has and how much
    is being used by the system. (To see this, return to the desktop,
    select the Apple menu at top left of the menu bar, and choose
    the first menu item, "About This Macintosh...". In System 6,
    this box is called "About the Finder..."). If, for example, the
    dialog box displays
       Total Memory         4,096K
       System Software      3,500K

   this indicates that you have 4,096K of RAM, but the Macintosh
   is using nearly all of it for its operating system. In this case,
   a number of applications will have problems running. Any
   applications that are currently running will be listed.

   You may be able to reduce the amount of memory used by the
   system. The process for doing this differs depending on
   whether you are running System 7 or System 6; refer to your
   Macintosh documentation if you are not familiar with how to
   do this. (The upper-right corner of the "About..." box, described
   above, tells you which version of the system you are running).

Three ways to reduce System Memory:

1. You may be able to reduce the Disk Cache setting.  If you are
running under System 7, select Control Panel under the apple menu and
launch the Memory control panel.  You can reduce the Cache Size to as
low as 32K.  Reducing the Cache Size will reduce system memory.  If you
are running under System 6.07 or System 6.08, select Control Panel
under the apple menu and click on General in the left hand column.
Reduce the RAM Cache setting to 32K or turn RAM Cache off.  This will
reduce system memory.

2. You may have system files that you do not need, such as printer
drivers for printers you don't have. Taking these files out of your
System Folder will save memory.  If you remove any files to free
memory, make sure to store them somewhere else on your hard disk or on
a backup disk in case you need them later.

3. You may have many fonts or Desk Accessories (Apple menu items or
DAs) installed that you are not using--removing these will also save
memory. A number of desktop accessories such as animated screen savers,
desk pictures, startup sounds and other INITs occupy memory and slow
the system down. If you have any of these, experiment with moving them
out of the System Folder. Always save anything you take out of the
System Folder! Then restart the computer and check the "About This
Macintosh..." box to see if system memory is reduced.

   NOTE: Be sure to restart your Macintosh after you make any of
         these changes to the System.

B) ASK ART GALLERY TO USE LESS MEMORY
If you still have problems, you can try to operate Art Gallery using
less memory than the minimum 1800K specified, setting it as low as
1560K. Art Gallery will never run with less than about 1560K of memory.
Performance problems may result from doing this. For example,
animations may not run and blow-ups of pictures may not display.

To set Art Gallery to use less memory, you must install the program on
your hard disk. After running the Installer from the CD-ROM disc,
return to the desktop, select the Art Gallery icon in the Art Gallery
folder, and choose Get Info from the File menu in the Finder.  The
exact form of the information is different in Systems 6 and 7, but all
versions have a box at the bottom right in which you can change the
preferred amount of memory Art Gallery should use.

--------------
3. PERFORMANCE
--------------
If Art Gallery seems to be running slowly or gives you interrupted
sounds, there are a number of things which may help. Here are the main
things to check.

If you are running on a Macintosh with low memory you may have
problems--check the previous section, MEMORY USE.

If your Macintosh is running in Virtual Memory mode, you may find that
Art Gallery runs slowly. For best performance, turn off Virtual Memory.
To do this in System 7, bring up the Memory control panel, choose the
Virtual Memory Off option, and then restart the computer. Virtual
Memory is not available in System 6.

If you are using an old or slow CD-ROM drive, it may be not be able to
supply information to the Macintosh at the speed required by the
software. This problem cannot be fixed. If you suspect a problem with
your CD drive, ensure that it is properly terminated. If you do not
understand SCSI termination, read your Macintosh or CD-ROM drive
documentation, or ask your Apple dealer. Drives must be internally
terminated or have a SCSI terminator plugged in.

----------------------------------------
4.  COLOR CONFIGURATION AND SCREEN SIZES
----------------------------------------
Art Gallery is designed to run with your monitor set to 256 colors.
When Art Gallery starts, it checks what color mode your monitor is set
to. If it is not displaying in 256 colors, but your setup can be
adjusted to do so, Art Gallery will offer to change it for you.  A
dialog box will come up asking if you want to change to 256 colors,
click 'switch now'.

Art Gallery can run in other color modes but it is not designed to do
so.  If you do run in other color modes (16-colors, 16-bit or 24-bit),
the animations included with some of the paintings will not play and
image quality may suffer.  Using more than 256 colors (16-bit or 24-bit
mode) will not improve the images and will slightly slow down display.
If you are using one of these modes, Art Gallery will prompt you to
switch to 256 colors. Running Art Gallery in another mode will cause no
damage, but will not provide the best performance.

Art Gallery will run on a 13" monitor, as found on a Performa; it will
also run on all larger monitors. However, Art Gallery is not designed
to run on 12" monitors or PowerBook screens.  If you are using a
PowerBook, you may be able to run Art Gallery using a second monitor.
Check your PowerBook manual for hooking up a second monitor.

------------------
5.  SOUND PROBLEMS
------------------
If you do not hear any sound at all, first make sure that you have the
sound level on your Macintosh set correctly. To set the sound level,
use the Sound control panel, and experiment with the speaker volume
setting until you get a comfortable sound level. If you set the sound
level to maximum, you may get sound distortion just as you would on a
stereo system.

If your Macintosh is running in Virtual Memory mode, you may find that
sounds are interrupted. When Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are
sometimes placed on the hard disk rather than into real RAM. For best
performance, turn off Virtual Memory. To do this in System 7, bring up
the Memory control panel, choose the Virtual Memory Off option, and
then restart the computer. Virtual Memory is not available in System 6.

Macintosh computers have built-in speakers. The speakers vary in
quality and loudness depending on which Macintosh you have. The quality
has improved in later models, so a Quadra will give you better sound
quality than an early Mac II.

You may hear a clicking noise when playing sounds on Art Gallery.  On
some machines installing Sound Manager 3.0 will lessen this problem.
For people running on Systems older than System 7.1, such as System
6.07, System 6.08 or System 7.01, you must have QuickTime installed on
your machine; Sound Manager 3.0 will only work if you have QuickTime
installed.  For people running System 7.1 or later, simply install
Sound Manager 3.0 as detailed below.

To install Sound Manager 3.0, open the System Files folder on the Art
Gallery CD.  Drag the two files, Sound and Sound Manager, into the
System Folder on your hard disk.  Then restart your Macintosh.

------------------------
6.  PRINTING AND COPYING
------------------------
The large color pictures in Art Gallery, which are optimized for best
screen reproduction rather than for print reproduction. You can,
however, print screen images which will be of the same quality as a
screen shot made with a screen-capture function.

If you have a black-and-white printer, Art Gallery will not print very
well. Art Gallery prints better grayscale images.  If you have a laser
printer, choose the Color/grayscale option for better quality. You can
also print in color if you have a color printer. Depending on the type
of printer you have, printing a picture may take several minutes.
Because the pictures can be quite large, you may have difficulty
copying or printing in low-memory conditions.  In this case, close all
other applications and then try again.

The Print and Copy commands affect only the active window. So if you
are looking at a blow-up of a picture and select Print or Copy, you
will only print or copy that blow-up.

----------------------
7.  DEMONSTRATION MODE
----------------------
Art Gallery has a demonstration mode which plays a random "slide show"
of the paintings in the collection.

To activate demonstration mode, select Random from the Go menu or type
command-R. To stop the slide show and use Art Gallery at any time, just
click on the mouse.
