-------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING CINEMANIA 94
-------------------------------------------------

To install and run Cinemania 94 you need:

-  Any Apple Macintosh Computer that supports a13-inch or larger
  monitor (640x480 display area or larger) running 256 or more colors
-  System 7.0 or later
-  4 MB of random-access memory (RAM)
-  4 MB of available hard disk space
-  CD-ROM drive

In order to use Cinemania 94, you must install it to your hard disk.
The installer program on the CD-ROM installs the Cinemania program to a
new folder on your hard disk. In addition, it adds any necessary files
and resources to your System Folder.

[ NOTE: The installation process may require more than 4MB hard drive
space on machines running System 7.0 or 7.0.1. This space is only
required during installation: once you restart, Cinemania 94 will only
take 4 MB on your hard drive. Under System 7 or 7.0.1, the installation
program must make a copy of your System file in order to install the
fonts required for Cinemania 94. The extra copy of the System file is
removed when you restart your computer. If you encounter this problem,
see the section on Manual Installation.]

-------------
2. MEMORY USE
-------------
Cinemania 94 needs a relatively large amount of your computers system
memory (RAM) to display pictures and play sounds. It should run on
systems with 4 MB (4,096K) of memory. Most users will not have
problems, but if you have only 4MB of memory and your system software
uses a large portion of your RAM, you may need to adjust memory usage
to make Cinemania 94 run properly. To do this:

-  Run only one application at a time. If other applications are
  running, close them before re-launching Cinemania 94.

-  Check the amount of memory being used by your system
  software. To see this, return to the desktop, select the Apple
  menu at top left of the menu bar, and choose the first menu item,
  "About This Macintosh...." The "Largest Unused Block" needs to be
  greater than 2500K to run Cinemania 94. If the only item listed in
  the About This Macintosh dialog is System Software, and the
  Largest Unused Block is less than 2500K, you need to reduce the
  amount of memory consumed by your system software. Refer to
  your Macintosh documentation to do this, but some general
  suggestions follow:

    - Open the Memory Control Panel and check the Disk Cache
       setting. To make the greatest amount of memory available, set
       the cache to 32K.

    - Large numbers of fonts and sounds consume system memory.
       Removing those that you aren't using will make more memory
       available.

    - Third party system extensions such as screen savers, fax
       software, desktop pictures, menu-modifying utilities and other
       system enhancements increase the amount of memory consumed
       by your system. Removing some or all of these extensions will
       increase the amount of memory available to applications. Be
       sure that you save anything you remove from your System
       folder in a separate folder on your disk so that you can
       replace it later.

NOTE: Be sure to restart your Macintosh after making any of these
changes to your system.

---------------
3. PERFORMANCE
---------------
If Cinemania 94 seems to be running slowly or gives you interrupted
sounds or film clips, there are a number of things which may help. Here
are the main things to check.

- Install the Performance Module file to your hard drive. The
 Performance Module file optimizes Cinemania 94s performance and
 offers significant speed improvements whenever you work with lists
 or filters (a very common action in Cinemania). The easiest way to
 do this is to perform a Custom Install from the Cinemania 94
 Installer see the section on Custom Install for details. If you
 would like to Manual Install, the Performance Module should be in
 the same folder as the Cinemania 94 application on your hard drive.

- If you are running on a Macintosh with low memory you may experience
 performance problems check the previous section, MEMORY USE.

- If your Macintosh is using Virtual Memory, you may find that
 Cinemania 94 runs slowly. For best performance, turn off Virtual
 Memory. To do this, open the Memory control panel, choose the
 Virtual Memory Off option, and then restart your computer.

- If you are using an old or slow CD-ROM drive, it may be not be able
 to supply information to the Macintosh at the speed required by the
 software. This problem cannot be fixed. If you suspect a problem
 with your CD drive, ensure that it is properly terminated and that
 its software is properly installed. If you do not understand SCSI
 termination, read your Macintosh or CD-ROM drive documentation, or
 ask your Apple dealer.

----------------------------------------
4. COLOR CONFIGURATION AND SCREEN SIZES
----------------------------------------
Cinemania 94 requires that your monitor be set to 256 colors or higher.
Cinemania 94 will run 16-bit mode (thousands of colors) and 24-bit mode
(millions of colors). These video modes will improve the appearance of
Cinemania's film clips; however, they have no impact on the appearance
of other images, and, on some systems, using 16-bit or 24-bit video may
slow Cinemania's performance.

On systems running in fewer than 256 colors, you will either be
prompted to switch to 256 colors, or if that capability is not
available, to quit the application.

Cinemania 94 is designed to be used on a 13-inch or larger monitor (640
x 480 display area or larger). Cinemania is not designed to run on
monitors with smaller display areas, such as the Apple 12" monitor, the
Macintosh Color Classic, or most PowerBook screens. Depending on your
system, you may be able to use Cinemania 94 with a second monitor.
Check your Macintosh documentation for information on connecting a
second monitor.

------------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
------------------
If you do not hear any sound at all, first make sure that you have the
sound level on your Macintosh set correctly. To set the sound level,
use the Sound control panel, and experiment with the speaker volume
setting until you get a comfortable sound level. If you set the sound
level to maximum, you may hear sound distortion just as you would on a
stereo system.

If your Macintosh is using Virtual Memory, you may find that sounds are
interrupted. When Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are sometimes
placed on the hard disk rather than in real RAM. For best performance,
turn off Virtual Memory. To do this, open the Memory control panel,
choose the Virtual Memory Off option, and then restart the computer.

Macintosh computers have built-in speakers. These speakers vary in
quality and loudness depending on which Macintosh you have. The quality
has generally improved in later models.

The sounds used in Cinemania 94 are stored on the CD-ROM in a
compressed format. In order to be played, the sound must be read from
disk, de-compressed, then sent to your Macintosh to be played. Best
results are achieved using Sound Manager 3.0 (installed with Cinemania
94); however, older, slower Macintoshes such as the Macintosh II and
original Macintosh LC may experience interruptions in audio playback.

-----------------------------
6. MANUAL AND CUSTOM INSTALL
-----------------------------
For the majority of users, using the Easy Install provided in the
Installer will be the best way to install Cinemania 94. You may wish to
perform a manual or custom install when the following has occurred:

 - You are running System 7.0 or 7.0.1 and don't have the extra hard
   drive space needed to install over and beyond the hard drive
   requirements for running the application. (See Section 1 for
   details.)

 - You would like to install or re-install only a portion of the
   files, such as QuickTime or the Performance Module file.

To perform a manual install of Cinemania 94:

 - Create a new folder on your hard drive titled "Cinemania 94".

 - On the Cinemania 94 CD-ROM disc, open the "Installer files"
   folder. (You may need to scroll down or click the zoom box in the
   title bar to find it.)

 - Copy all the files from "Installer files" into the "Cinemania 94"
   folder you just created on your hard drive.

 - Open the "Cinemania 94" folder on your hard drive. Open the
   "System Files" folder. Move all the files from that folder to your
   System Folder on your hard drive. Click OK when asked whether you
   wish to put the files in the appropriate places in the System
   Folder.

[Note: If you have previously installed Sound Manager 3.0 with a
version of QuickTime older than 1.6.2 and are told that you can not
copy QuickTime over because it is in use, we suggest doing the
following: (1) move the old version of QuickTime from your Extensions
folder to the Trash, (2) restart your machine, (3) copy the new version
of QuickTime from the "System Files" folder to your Extensions Folder
on your hard drive.]

 - Restart your Macintosh before running Cinemania 94.

To perform a custom install of Cinemania 94:

 - Double-click on the "Install Cinemania" icon on the Cinemania 94
   CD-ROM disc.

 - Click the Customize button in the Installer dialog.

 - Click on the files you would like installed.

[To run Cinemania 94, you must install or have previously installed the
Cinemania 94 application, Sound Manager 3.0 and QuickTime 1.6.2, and
either System 7.0 fonts or System 7.1 fonts, depending on your system.
To find out what system you are running, go to the Finder and select
"About This Macintosh..." from your Apple menu.]

-------------------
7. KNOWN PROBLEMS
-------------------
- Not ejecting non-Cinemania discs
 On some systems, when you launch Cinemania 94 with a non-Cinemania
 94 disc in the CD-ROM drive, the drive will not eject that disc for
 you. To get around this problem: (1) eject the disc from the Finder
 by dragging it to the Trash, (2) insert the Cinemania 94 disc into
 the CD-ROM drive.

- Restarting from the Installer may hang on some Macintosh Performa
 models. Clicking the Restart button in the "Installation Successful"
 dialog may occasionally hang some Performas. This is a known bug in
 System 7.1P5 and earlier. Apple recommends upgrading to 7.1P6 or
 higher. To work around this problem: (1) turn your computer off by
 its power switch and wait 10 to 15 seconds,  (2) restart your
 computer.

- Dialog warning you have the incorrect version of QuickTime or Sound
 Manager installed. The installer checks your machine for QuickTime
 and Sound Manager, installing them or replacing them with newer
 versions if applicable. The installer is unable to replace these
 extensions if you have renamed a version currently loaded on your
 machine. As a result, it will install the extensions from the
 Cinemania 94 disc without removing the renamed versions on your
 system. When you restart your machine, the extension which comes
 first in alphabetical ordering will be loaded. (For example, if you
 renamed an old extension "My QuickTime", that extension will load
 before "QuickTime", which Cinemania installs.) This can create a
 problem if "My QuickTime" is an older version than the "QuickTime"
 Cinemania needs to run. To avoid this problem, remove any renamed,
 outdated versions of these extensions from your System Folder, then
 restart.

- V-series Lucida Sans fonts appearing in font menus
 If you use an application with a font menu, such as Microsoft Word
 or Microsoft Works, you may notice the addition of V-series Lucida
 Sans fonts in those menus after installing Cinemania. These fonts
 are for use with Cinemania 94, and it is necessary to have them
 installed for Cinemania 94 to run. If you choose to delete these
 fonts when Cinemania 94 is not in use, you can easily install them
 by re-running the Installer on the Cinemania 94 disc.

- Special or international characters getting copied incorrectly to
 the Clipboard. As a custom bitmap font, the V-series Lucida Sans
 fonts do not map special or international characters correctly to
 the Macintosh character set. These characters will appear as
 inappropriate or non-printing characters when copied to an
 application such as TeachText. [Note: They will format and appear
 and print correctly in V-series Lucida fonts.]

- Use of PopChar control panel while running Cinemania 94
 There is a conflict between Gunther Blaschek's PopChar control panel
 (versions 2.3 through 2.6.2) and Cinemania 94 which can lead to the
 machine crashing when you select characters in the "More..." feature
 of PopChar while Cinemania is running. This problem is not present
 in PopChar version 2.7. We recommend you either try installing
 PopChar 2.7 or avoid this feature of PopChar while using Cinemania.

- Use of QuicKeys while running Cinemania 94.
 In situations where intensive keystroking is performed, there can be
 conflict between Cinemania 94 and QuicKeys. If this becomes a
 problem for you, we recommend running Cinemania 94 without QuicKeys
 installed.

- The NexusFX accelerator card for the Macintosh IIfx is incompatible
 with Sound Manager 3.0. Any sound made in a system running Sound
 Manager 3.0 will conclude with a choppy, reverberating echo. Since we
 require Sound Manager 3.0, sound on these systems will be of poor
 quality. The rest of the application will run as expected.

- Needing more memory to run the Cinemania 94 Demo
 The Demo runs using the Macromedia Player. Because of the
 requirements of the Macromedia Player in certain configurations
 (especially under millions of colors), the Demo will occasionally
 need more memory to run. If you get a dialog notifying you that the
 Demo needs more memory, or if sound cuts out intermittently while
 the Demo is running, you can help solve this problem by: (1) running
 the Demo in 256 colors, and (2) quitting Cinemania 94 and running
 the Demo from the Cinemania 94 Demo alias installed in the Cinemania
 94 folder on your hard drive.

- Crashing while loading Demo
 If you click on Cinemania or in the Finder while loading the Demo,
 there is a chance you can load the wrong palette. An unreadable
 graphic will display while audio for the demo plays. In rare cases,
 the Demo may crash. To work around this, please wait until the Demo
 is fully loaded.
