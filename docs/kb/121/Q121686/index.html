SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Space Simulator v1.0

                ==============================
                  R E L E A S E    N O T E S

This document contains important information to help you configure your
computer so that you get the best performance from Space Simulator.

* Memory Requirements - Conventional Memory (RAM)
 Space Simulator requires at least 550K conventional memory.
 For best results, provide as much conventional memory as possible.
 For example:  When 560K or more conventional memory is available
 for Space Simulator, the level of image detail for spacecraft and
 other models can be set to Complex instead of Sparse (in the
 Rendering Preferences dialog box), providing more realistic images
 in the simulation.  When conventional memory is low and you set
 image detail to Complex, Space Simulator informs you that the
 simulator needs to change from Complex to Sparse rendering. If you
 provide at least 560K RAM, you will enjoy continuous display of
 complex images.

 Note: Although Space Simulator has a minimum requirement of at least
 550K free conventional memory, it will run with as little as 500K
 free. When running Space Simulator with less than 560K free memory,
 you will encounter the "Switching to Sparse Rendering" message more
 frequently.

* Memory Requirements - Expanded Memory (EMS)
 Space Simulator requires at least 512K of expanded memory.
 Providing more than 768K of expanded memory offers minimal
 additional benefit. To provide expanded memory for Space Simulator,
 please refer to the instructions noted on the inside back cover of
 the Star-Pilot's Guide.

* Using the System Startup Disk (Boot Disk)
 If you don't want to change your existing memory configurations,
 you can use Space Simulator's MAKEBOOT.COM to create a system
 startup disk (or boot disk) that provides the memory configuration
 you need while running Space Simulator. To create a system startup
 disk, at the MS-DOS prompt (while still within the Space Simulator
 directory, for example, C:\SPACESIM), type MAKEBOOT and follow the
 on-screen instructions. To use the system startup disk, simply place
 the disk into your disk drive (usually drive A), and restart your
 computer. Space Simulator will use the system startup disk for its
 memory configuration.

* Running Space Simulator with Microsoft Windows
 Space Simulator achieves maximum video performance when you run it
 from MS-DOS. If you choose to run Space Simulator from Microsoft
 Windows, please note the following:
 - Prior to starting Space Simulator, run Space Simulator Setup and
   choose the 320x400 graphics resolution option.
 - Prior to running Windows, ensure that your computer has at least
   768K of EMS memory.
 - Run Space Simulator as an exclusive, full-screen application.
 - If you switch to another application, and then return to Space
   Simulator, the simulation display may be corrupted.  To restore
   the simulation display, press the W key twice to toggle the Full
   Screen View option and refresh the screen.

* Video Issues
 Space Simulator supports 320x400, 640x400, and 800x600 graphics
 resolutions.
 - To display resolutions greater than 320x400, you need to know the
   chipset of your video card.  To determine the chipset of your
   video card, refer to the documentation provided with your video
   card, or run Microsoft Diagnostics by typing "msd" at MS-DOS
   prompt.
 - Some SuperVGA video cards may not run Space Simulator in 640x400
   and/or 800x600 resolution. This is often due to the video card
   manufacturer attempting to maximize video performance in Windows,
   while compromising MS-DOS-application compatibility.  If you have
   a SVGA card and have problems with higher resolutions, try the
   VESA 1.2 video option.  If that does not work, you will have to
   run Space Simulator in 320x400 resolution.
 - Pentium users:  If your video card does not run Space Simulator in
   SVGA resolutions and you must run it in 320x400 resolution, the
   fast frame-refresh rate may cause undesirable flickering on your
   screen. To slow the frame rate, adjust the following items in the
   Preferences dialog box: Set Milky Way check box on, Star Limiting
   Magnitude to 7, Precision to 8.
 - Diamond Viper video users:
   To run Space Simulator in 640x400 resolution:
   1. Acquire VPRMODE.EXE v2.04 from the manufacturer.
   2. Type "vprmode vesa" at the MS-DOS prompt to install VESA 1.2
      compatibility.
   3. Run Space Simulator Setup, choose 640x400 resolution, and then
      choose the VESA 1.2 video option.

* ThrustMaster Joystick Support
 If you have a ThrustMaster Mark II Weapons Control System (WCS), you
 can use the SPACESIM.ADV file found in your Space Simulator
 directory to configure your hardware for use with Space Simulator.
 Using this file with your Weapons Control System enhances your Space
 Simulator experience by assigning many frequently-used features to
 controls on the WCS. Note that use of this file requires the new
 chip and microcode from ThrustMaster.  Consult the SPACESIM.ADV file
 for details.

* Learning How to Control your Spacecraft
 Space Simulator has a concise on-screen Help menu. To see which keys
 control your spacecraft, choose Keyboard Guide from the Help menu,
 or see the back cover of the Star-Pilot's Guide. Be sure to review
 the other areas of the Help menu, including Menu Commands and
 Basic Skills.

* Read the Star-Pilot's Guide
 In space, knowledge is power! The Star-Pilot's Guide provides a
 complete journey through Space Simulator, as well as some great
 flying adventures.

* Fly the Missions
 Space Simulator has missions that score you on your piloting skills.
 From the Options menu, choose Missions, and then take off!

* Accept a Challenge
 A great gateway into the heart of Space Simulator is available
 with the Open Situation command on the Options menu. Just choose
 a situation and find yourself in a new area of space. For extra
 adventure, look for situations that include the word CHALLENGE
 in their description. Read the challenge and then give it a try.

                 Welcome to Space Simulator!
