-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the steps necessary to install an NDIS 2 network interface
card (NIC) driver that is not listed as a choice in the Select Device dialog box
and does not have an Oemsetup.inf file. If you have any questions regarding
these steps, consult the manufacturer of your network card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To complete these steps, you must first have the NDIS 2 network card driver. If
Microsoft does not provide a driver for your card, contact the card
manufacturer.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. Click Add, click Adapter, then click Add.

4. Insert the manufacturer-supplied driver disk, and click the Have Disk button.

5. Select the correct NDIS 2 driver, click OK, click the driver in the list of
  installed network components, and click Properties.

  NOTE: If the driver cannot be found, browse in the NDIS or LanMan folders and
  look for files with a .dos extension.

6. Click the Driver Type tab, click "Real mode (16-bit) NDIS driver," then click
  OK.

7. After you click OK a second time, you are prompted with the following
  message:

  Please shut down and restart the computer for your changes to take effect.

  Click OK a third time, but do not restart your system.

After you complete the above steps, a Protocol.ini file is created in your
Windows 95 directory. The configuration settings (IRQ, I/O address, and so on)
for your network card must be manually set in this Protocol.ini file. The
Protocol.ini file that is created contains the following blank section:

  []
  DriverName=

To successfully use the network, you must manually insert the proper section
heading, driver name, and any other necessary lines to configure your network
card (such as the IRQ, I/O address, and so on). An example for an Intel
EtherExpress 16 set for real mode is:

  [EXP16$]
  DriverName=EXP16$
  transceiver=Twisted-Pair (TPE)
  iochrdy=Late
  ioaddress=0x300
  irq=10

After you fill out the Protocol.ini file, you must add the name of the network
card driver (&lt;DriverName&gt;.DOS) to the registry. To add the driver name to
the registry, add the string value

  netcard

to the following entry in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ 
  Network\Real Mode Net

Set the new value to your network card driver name (with the .DOS extension).

For example, for the Intel EtherExpress card, the value is:

  exp16.dos

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

Finally, make sure the Autoexec.bat file contains the command NET START. This
line (C:\WINDOWS\NET START) loads the NDIS 2 network card driver and protocol
drivers, then it binds them together.
