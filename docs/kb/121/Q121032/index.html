-------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING BOOKSHELF 1994
-------------------------------------------------

To install and run Bookshelf 1994 you need:

-  Any Apple Macintosh Computer that supports a10-inch or larger
  monitor (512 x 384 display area or larger) running 256 or more
  colors
-  System 7.0 or later
-  4 MB of random-access memory (RAM)
-  2 MB of available hard-disk space
-  CD-ROM drive

In order to use Bookshelf 1994, you must install it to your hard disk.
The installer program on the CD-ROM installs the Bookshelf program to a
new folder on your hard disk called "Bookshelf 1994." In addition, it
adds any necessary files and resources to your System Folder.

[ NOTE: The installation process may require more than 2 MB hard-drive
space on machines running System 7.0 or 7.0.1. This space is only
required during installation: once you restart, Bookshelf 1994 will
only take 2 MB on your hard drive. Under System 7 or 7.0.1, the
installation program must make a copy of your System file in order to
install the fonts required for Bookshelf 1994. The extra copy of the
System file is removed when you restart your computer. If you encounter
this problem, see the section on Manual Installation.]

-------------
2. MEMORY USE
-------------
Bookshelf 1994 needs a relatively large amount of your computer's
system memory (RAM) to display pictures and play sounds. It should run
on systems with 4 MB (4,096K) of memory. Most users will not have
problems, but if you have only 4 MB of memory and your system software
uses a large portion of your RAM, you may need to adjust memory usage
to make Bookshelf 1994 run properly. To do this:

Run only one application at a time. If other applications are
running, close them before re-launching Bookshelf 1994.

-  Check the amount of memory being used by your system
  software. To see this, return to the desktop, select the Apple
  menu at top left of the menu bar, and choose the first menu item,
  "About This Macintosh...." The "Largest Unused Block" needs to be
  greater than 1800K to run Bookshelf 1994. If the only item listed
  in the About This Macintosh dialog is System Software, and the
  Largest Unused Block is less than 1800K, you need to reduce the
  amount of memory consumed by your system software. Refer to
  your Macintosh documentation to do this, but some general
  suggestions follow:

    - Open the Memory Control Panel and check the Disk Cache
       setting. To make the greatest amount of memory available, set
       the cache to 32K.

    - Large numbers of fonts and sounds consume system memory.
       Removing those that you are not using will make more memory
       available.

    - Third party system extensions such as screen savers, fax
       software, desktop pictures, menu-modifying utilities and other
       system enhancements increase the amount of memory consumed
       by your system. Removing some or all of these extensions will
       increase the amount of memory available to applications. Be
       sure that you save anything you remove from your System
       folder in a separate folder on your disk so that you can
       replace it later.

NOTE: Be sure to restart your Macintosh after making any of these
changes to your system.

---------------
3. PERFORMANCE
---------------
If Bookshelf 1994 seems to be running slowly or gives you interrupted
sounds or film clips, there are a number of things which may help. Here
are the main things to check.

- If you are running on a Macintosh with low memory you may experience
performance problems (such as slow video playback, loss of audio in
Bookshelf 1994, or other slowing of Bookshelf 1994)-check the previous
section, MEMORY USE.

- If your Macintosh is using Virtual Memory, you may find that
Bookshelf 1994 runs slowly. For best performance, turn off Virtual
Memory. To do this, open the Memory control panel, choose the Virtual
Memory Off option, and then restart your computer.

- If you are using an old or slow CD-ROM drive, it may be not be able
to supply information to the Macintosh at the speed required by the
software. This problem cannot be fixed. If you suspect a problem with
your CD drive, ensure that it is properly terminated and that its
software is properly installed. If you do not understand SCSI
termination, read your Macintosh or CD-ROM drive documentation, or ask
your Apple dealer.

----------------------------------------
4. COLOR CONFIGURATION AND SCREEN SIZES
----------------------------------------
Bookshelf 1994 recommends that your monitor be set to 256 colors or
higher.   Bookshelf 1994 will run 16-bit mode (thousands of colors) and
24-bit mode (millions of colors). These video modes will improve the
appearance of Bookshelf's film clips; however, they have no impact on
the appearance of other images, and, on some systems, using 16-bit or
24-bit video may slow Bookshelf's performance.

On systems running in fewer than 256 colors, you will be prompted to
switch to 256 colors.  Bookshelf will run in fewer than 256 colors, but
the image and media quality will not be as high as when it is running
in 256-color mode.

------------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
------------------
If you do not hear any sound at all, first make sure that you have the
sound level on your Macintosh set correctly. To set the sound level,
use the Sound control panel, and experiment with the speaker volume
setting until you get a comfortable sound level. If you set the sound
level to maximum, you may hear sound distortion just as you would on a
stereo system.

If your Macintosh is using Virtual Memory, you may find that sounds are
interrupted. When Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are sometimes
placed on the hard disk rather than in real RAM. For best performance,
turn off Virtual Memory. To do this, open the Memory control panel,
choose the Virtual Memory Off option, and then restart the computer.

Macintosh computers have built-in speakers. These speakers vary in
quality and loudness depending on which Macintosh you have. The quality
has generally improved in later models.

The sounds used in Bookshelf 1994 are stored on the CD-ROM in a
compressed format. In order to be played, the sound must be read from
disk, de-compressed, then sent to your Macintosh to be played. Best
results are achieved using Sound Manager 3.0 (installed with Bookshelf
1994); however, older, slower Macintoshes such as the Macintosh II and
original Macintosh LC may experience interruptions in audio playback.

-----------------------------
6. MANUAL AND CUSTOM INSTALL
-----------------------------
For the majority of users, using the Easy Install provided in the
Installer will be the best way to install Bookshelf 1994. You may wish
to perform a manual or custom install when the following has occurred:

 - You are running System 7.0 or 7.0.1 and don't have the extra hard
   drive space needed to install over and beyond the hard drive
   requirements for running the application. (See Section 1 for
   details.)

 - You would like to install or re-install onto a non-Startup Drive.

 - You would like to install or re-install only a portion of the
   files, such as QuickTime.

   To perform a manual install of Bookshelf 1994:

 - Create a new folder on your hard drive titled "Bookshelf 1994."

 - On the Bookshelf 1994 CD-ROM disc, open the "Bookshelf Files"
   folder. (You may need to scroll down or click the zoom box in the
   title bar to find it.)

 - Copy the "Bookshelf 1994" file into the "Bookshelf 1994" folder
   you just created on your hard drive.

 - Open the "System Files" folder on your CD-ROM. Move all the
   files from that folder to your System Folder on your hard drive.
   Click OK when asked whether you wish to put the files in the
   appropriate places in the System Folder.

[Note: If you have previously installed Sound Manager 3.0 with a
version of QuickTime older than 1.6.2 and are told that you can not
copy QuickTime over because it is in use, we suggest doing the
following: (1) move the old version of QuickTime from your Extensions
folder to the Trash, (2) restart your machine, (3) copy the new version
of QuickTime from the "System Files" folder to your Extensions Folder
on your hard drive.]

 - Restart your Macintosh before running Bookshelf 1994.

To perform a custom install of Bookshelf 1994:

 - Double-click the "Install Bookshelf 1994" icon on the Bookshelf
   1994 CD-ROM disc.

 - Click the Customize button in the Installer dialog.

 - Click on the files you would like installed.

[To run Bookshelf 1994, you must install or have previously installed
the Bookshelf 1994 application, Sound Manager 3.0 and QuickTime 1.6.2,
and either System 7.0 fonts or System 7.1 fonts, depending on your
system. To find out what system you are running, go to the Finder and
select "About this Macintosh..." from your Apple menu.]

-------------------
7. KNOWN PROBLEMS
-------------------
- Not ejecting non-Bookshelf discs
On some systems, when you launch Bookshelf 1994 with a non-Bookshelf
1994 disc in the CD-ROM drive, the drive will not eject that disc for
you. To get around this problem: (1) eject the disc from the Finder by
dragging it to the Trash, (2) insert the Bookshelf 1994 disc into the
CD-ROM drive.

- Restarting from the Installer may  cause performance problems on some
Macintosh Performa models
Clicking the Restart button in the "Installation Successful" dialog box
may occasionally hang some Performas. This is a known bug in System
7.1P5 and earlier. Apple recommends upgrading to 7.1P6 or higher. To
work around this problem: (1) Use the power switch to turn your
computer off,  (2) wait 10 to 15 seconds,  (3) and then restart your
computer.

- The NexusFX accelerator card for the Macintosh IIfx is incompatible
with Sound Manager 3.0. Any sound made in a system running Sound
Manager 3.0 will conclude with a choppy, reverberating echo. Since we
require Sound Manager 3.0, sound on these systems will be of poor
quality. The rest of the application will run as expected.

- You may experience redraw problems when scrolling the Bookshelf
window on Virtual Desktop. For best results, do not run the two
applications simultaneously.

- MenuChoice and TearOffs, when used with EvenBetterBusError, may cause
a system error. Avoid accessing the Control Panel via the Apple menu
when running MenuChoice or TearOffs and EvenBetterBusError with
Bookshelf 1994.
