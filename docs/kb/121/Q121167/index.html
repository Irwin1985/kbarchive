-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the ProofReader utility in Microsoft Word version 6.0 for
Windows, the following error messages are displayed:

- An error has occurred in your application. If you choose Ignore, you should
  save your work in a new file. If you close, your application will terminate.

-and-

- Application Error: Winword caused a General Protection fault in module
  S3640.DRV at 0003:0FD2

The keyboard is remapped for every keyboard entry in all text-based applications.

CAUSE
=====

The problem with keyboard mapping occurs because the CTRL+N combination is used
in both Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows and Windows Sound System version
2.0 ProofReader. Word uses the CTRL+N function for starting a new document. In
ProofReader, the CTRL+N combination is used to begin proofreading a range of
selected items. ProofReader does not fully release the CTRL key to Word, nor
does it properly refresh the function of the CTRL key. As a result, it seems as
if the CTRL key is locked, making it possible for all CTRL functions to occur.

If the CTRL key is pressed in Word after ProofReader has proofread a document,
the CTRL functions are released back to Word successfully without the GP fault,
application error, or remapping problems.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, press the CTRL key immediately after ProofReader has
completed proofreading the selected text in the Word document.

If you receive the GP fault and application error messages, reboot Windows to
correct the keyboard mappings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows Sound System versions
2.0 and 2.0a. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The keyboard remapping does not effect the MS-DOS environment. The keyboard
mapping operates correctly after exiting Windows. Additionally, the mappings are
correct in MS-DOS virtual machines (VMs). However, when you return to the
Windows environment the mappings are still incorrect. You must restart Windows
to correct the problem.
