-------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING ENCARTA 1994
-------------------------------------------------

To install and run Encarta 1994 you need a minimum of the following:

-  Any Apple Macintosh Computer that supports a 12-inch or larger
  monitor (512 x 384 display area or larger) running 256 or more
  colors
-  System 7.0 or later
-  4 MB of random-access memory (RAM) with 2.5 MB available
-  5 MB of available hard disk space
-  CD-ROM drive

Note:
It is highly recommended you run Encarta 1994 on a Macintosh with a
13-inch screen and 6 to 8 MB of RAM.

In order to use Encarta 1994, you must install it on your hard disk.
The Installer program on the CD-ROM installs the Encarta program to a
new folder and adds any necessary files and resources to your System
Folder on your hard disk.

[ NOTE: The installation process may require more than 5 MB hard disk
space on machines running System 7.0 or 7.0.1. This space is required
only during installation: after you restart, Encarta 1994 will take
only 5 MB on your hard disk. Under System 7 or 7.0.1, the installation
program must make a copy of your System file in order to install the
fonts required for Encarta 1994. The extra copy of the System file is
removed when you restart your computer. If you encounter this problem,
see section 7, MANUAL AND CUSTOM INSTALLATION.]

-------------
2. MEMORY USE
-------------
Encarta 1994 needs a relatively large amount of your computer's system
memory (RAM) to display pictures and play sounds. It should run on
systems with 4 MB (4,096K) of RAM and at least 2.5 MB (2,560K)
available. Most users will not have problems, but if you have only 4 MB
of RAM and your system software uses a large portion of your RAM, you
may need to adjust memory usage to make Encarta 1994 run properly.
Refer to the "Encarta &amp; Memory Read Me" document for advice about
memory usage.

---------------
3. PERFORMANCE
---------------
If Encarta 1994 seems to run slowly or gives you interrupted sounds or
film clips, here are the main things to check.

- If you are running on a Macintosh with low memory you may experience
performance problems, check the previous section 2, MEMORY USE, and the
document "Encarta Memory Issues" for advice about memory usage.

- If your Macintosh is using Virtual Memory, you may find that Encarta
1994 runs slowly. For best performance, turn off Virtual Memory. To do
this, open the Memory control panel, choose the Virtual Memory Off
option, and then restart your computer.

- If you are using a slow CD-ROM drive, it may be not be able to supply
information to the Macintosh at the speed required by the software.
There is no workaround for this problem. If you suspect a problem with
your CD drive, ensure that it is properly terminated and that its
software is properly installed. For more information on SCSI
termination, read your Macintosh or CD-ROM drive documentation, or ask
your Apple dealer.

----------------------------------------
4. COLOR CONFIGURATION AND SCREEN SIZES
----------------------------------------
Encarta 1994 requires that your monitor can display 16 colors or more.
If you have only 16 colors, you may prefer to run Encarta in Grayscale
mode. To do this, use the Monitors control panel to switch to grays.

Encarta 1994 will run in 16-bit mode (thousands of colors) and 32-bit
mode (millions of colors). These video modes improve the appearance of
Encarta's photos and film clips; however, using 16-bit or 32-bit video
may slow Encarta's performance or reduce the amount of memory available
to Encarta. If you see low memory messages, you can increase the memory
available to Encarta. Refer to the "Encarta &amp; Memory Read Me" document
for more details.

------------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
------------------
If there is no sound at all, first make sure that the sound level on
your Macintosh is set correctly. To set the sound level, use the Sound
control panel and experiment with the speaker volume setting until you
get a comfortable sound level. If you set the sound level to maximum,
you may hear sound distortion.

If your Macintosh is using Virtual Memory, you may find that sounds are
interrupted. When Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are sometimes
placed on the hard disk rather than in RAM. For best performance, turn
off Virtual Memory. To do this, open the Memory control panel, choose
the Virtual Memory Off option, and then restart the computer.

The sounds used in Encarta 1994 are stored on the CD-ROM in a
compressed format. In order to be played, the sound must be read from
disk and decompressed. Older or slower Macintoshes (such as the
Macintosh II and Macintosh LC) may experience interruptions in audio
playback
.

On some older Macintoshes, the slider on the audio controller may not
reach the end of the bar by the time the sound actually finishes.

Macintosh computers have built-in speakers. These speakers vary in
quality and loudness depending on which Macintosh you have. The quality
has generally improved in later models.

-----------------------------
6. WHERE ENCARTA INSTALLER PUTS FILES
-----------------------------
The Encarta Installer program creates folders and copies files to
several locations. When you install Encarta 1994, the Installer program:

- Creates a folder called "Encarta 1994" and copies the following:
    "Microsoft Encarta 1994" - the main Encarta application.
    "Encarta 1994 Read Me" - the document you are reading now.
    "Encarta &amp; Memory" - a Read Me document explaining memory issues
      and troubleshooting.
    "Animation Launcher" - used to run animations in low memory
      situations.
    "Encarta Projector" - Macromedia application that plays Director
      movies.
    "Encarta Spelling" - spelling database for Encarta topic titles.
    "MindMaze" - an alias to the Encarta MindMaze game on the CD.
    "Multimedia Catalog" - a catalog of other Microsoft Home titles.

- Creates a folder called "Encarta 1994 Preferences" in your
 System:Preferences folder and copies the following:
    "EncartaTitleCache" - (optional) to improve performance, this
      file containing topic titles needed frequently by Encarta is
      copied from the CD to the Encarta 1994 Preferences folder.
    "EncartaFileLocations" - a text file containing the locations of
      the important folders and files on the hard disk or CD.

- Copies QuickTime 1.6.2 and SoundManager 3.0 to the System:Extensions
 folder (if needed)

- Copies SoundManager 3.0 sound control panel to the System:Control
 Panels folder (if needed)

- Copies V Lucida Sans fonts to System folder
  - the location is different for System 7.0 and 7.1

-----------------------------
7. MANUAL AND CUSTOM INSTALLATION
-----------------------------
For the majority of users, using the Easy Install provided in the
Installer program is the best way to install Encarta 1994.

You may wish to perform a manual or custom installation when the
following has occurred:

 - You are running System 7.0 or 7.0.1 and don't have the extra hard
   disk space needed for installation. (See Section 1 for details.)

 - You want to install or re-install only a portion of the files,
   such as QuickTime or Sound Manager.

To perform a manual installation of Encarta 1994:

 - Create a new folder on your hard disk titled "Encarta 1994."

 - From the Encarta 1994 CD-ROM, open the "Installer Files" folder.
   (You may need to scroll down or click the zoom box in the title
   bar to find it.)

 - Copy all the files from "Installer Files" into the "Encarta 1994"
   folder you have created on your hard disk.

 - Open the "Encarta 1994" folder on your hard disk. Open the "System
   Files" folder. Move all the files from that folder to the System
   Folder on your hard disk. Click OK when asked if you want to put
   the files in the appropriate places in the System Folder.

[Note: If you have previously installed Sound Manager 3.0 with a
version of QuickTime later than 1.6.2 and are told that you cannot copy
QuickTime over because it is in use, then do the following: (1) Move
the old version of QuickTime from your Extensions folder to the Trash,
(2) Restart your machine, (3) Copy the new version of QuickTime from
the "System Files" folder to your Extensions Folder on your hard disk.]

 - Restart your Macintosh

To perform a custom installation of Encarta 1994:

 - Double-click the "Install Encarta" icon on the Encarta 1994 CD-
   ROM.

 - Click the Customize button in the Installer dialog box.

 - Click the files you want installed.

[To run Encarta 1994, you must install or have previously installed the
Encarta 1994 application, Sound Manager 3.0 and QuickTime 1.6.2, and
either System 7.0 fonts or System 7.1 fonts, depending on your system.
To find out what system you are running, from your Apple menu go to the
Finder and select "About this Macintosh...".]

-------------------
8. KNOWN PROBLEMS
-------------------

- Animations on Power Macs turn pink
 Encarta animations require switching the display into 16 color mode.
 The Power Mac does not have a 16 color mode, so if you are in 256
 color mode and run an animation, some of the animation colors appear
 pink. In Thousands color mode, the animation colors are correct, but
 the controller buttons below the animations will be pink.

- Virus protection software issues warnings during Encarta
 installation. Some virus protection software may confuse the
 Installer program's necessary actions with behaviors associated with
 a virus, possibly disrupting the installation process. It is
 recommended that you disable any virus protection software before
 installing Encarta, then re-enable it after the installation.

- Non-Encarta discs don't eject
 On some systems, when you launch Encarta 1994 with a non-Encarta
 1994 disc in the CD-ROM drive, the drive will not eject that disc.
 To get around this problem: (1) Eject the disc from the Finder by
 dragging it to the Trash, (2) Insert the Encarta 1994 disc into the
 CD-ROM drive.

- Restarting from the Installer program may hang on some Macintosh
 Performa models. This is a known problem with System 7.1P5 and
 earlier. Apple recommends upgrading to 7.1P6 or later. To work
 around this problem: (1) Turn your computer off by its power switch
 and wait 10 to 15 seconds, (2) Restart your computer.

- Dialog box warns you have an incorrect version of QuickTime or Sound
 Manager installed. During installation, the Installer program checks
 the versions of QuickTime and Sound Manager present on your machine
 and, if necessary, replaces them with newer versions. However, the
 Installer cannot remove older versions if you have renamed them. For
 example, if you renamed an older version of QuickTime "My
 QuickTime," the Encarta Installer would install a newer version of
 QuickTime, but would fail to remove the older version. To fix this
 problem, manually remove the renamed version(s) of these system
 components and restart your Macintosh.

- V-series Lucida Sans fonts appears in font menus
 If you use an application with a font menu, such as Microsoft Word
 or Microsoft Works, you may notice the addition of V-series Lucida
 Sans fonts in those menus after installing Encarta. These fonts are
 used by Encarta 1994, and it is necessary to have them installed for
 Encarta 1994 to run. If you choose to delete these fonts when
 Encarta 1994 is not in use, you can easily install them again by re-
 running the Installer program from the Encarta 1994 disc.

- Special or international characters are copied incorrectly to the
 Clipboard. As a custom bitmap font, the V-series Lucida Sans fonts
 do not map special or international characters correctly to the
 Macintosh character set. These characters appear as inappropriate or
 non-printing characters when copied to an application such as
 TeachText. [Note: Special characters appear and print correctly in
 V-series Lucida fonts when printed from Encarta.]

- PopChar control panel feature conflicts while running Encarta 1994
 There is a conflict between Gunther Blaschek's PopChar control panel
 (versions 2.3 through 2.6.2) and Encarta 1994 that can lead to the
 machine crashing when you select characters in the "More..." feature
 of PopChar while Encarta is running. We recommend you avoid this
 feature of PopChar while using Encarta.

- QuicKeys conflicts while running Encarta 1994
 In situations where intensive keystroking is performed, there can
 be conflict between Encarta 1994 and QuicKeys. If this becomes a
 problem for you, we recommend running Encarta 1994 without QuicKeys
 installed.

- The NexusFX accelerator card for the Macintosh IIfx is incompatible
 with Sound Manager 3.0. Any sound made in a system running the
 NexusFX accelerator card and Sound Manager 3.0 will conclude with a
 choppy, reverberating echo. Since Encarta requires Sound Manager
 3.0, sound on these systems will be of poor quality. The rest of
 the application will run as expected.

- Dictionary, Orbit, MindMaze, and animations crash using CacheOut
 control panel. In these mini-applications, using the CacheOut
 control panel will result in a system crash when running or
 quitting. We recommend you disable or remove the CacheOut.
