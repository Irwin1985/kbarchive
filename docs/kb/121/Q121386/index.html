SUMMARY
=======

The use of Systems Management Server in certain domain structures can sometimes
lead to confusion about the capabilities and limitations of Systems Management
Server; specifically when Systems Management Server is used in a wide area
network (WAN) consisting of a single domain separated by routers. In this
situation, special consideration must be given to site type and placement and
logon script configuration, as well as package distribution technique.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example
-------

Consider a common retail company utilizing a primary domain controller (PDC) at
the corporate office, and a backup domain controller (BDC) at each outlet (to
perform logon validation locally) linked to each other by 19.2 Kb routed links.

1. In this situation, Systems Management Server should be implemented as
  follows:

  a. Install a central Systems Management Server site at the corporate office.

  b. If the remote offices have a large number of clients, install a primary
     site there; if not, a secondary site should be installed.

  c. Establish the needed parent-child assignments and addresses.

  d. If logon scripts are to be used, ensure replication is set up at the PDC
     and all BDCs.

  e. Ensure that NONE of the Systems Management Server sites in the domain
     selected Automatically Detecting Logon Servers, and that NONE of the sites
     in the domain are using the Automatically Configure Logon Script options.

2. Now, each client at outlet xyz will have a site-domain assignment such as
  "xyz:corpdom" for example, and clients at the corporate office will have an
  assignment such as "abc:corpdom" (these assignments will be used again
  later). Systems Management Server makes the "ownership" distinction based on
  the combination of the 3-letter site code combined with the domain name.

3. If logon scripts are going to be used, manually assign a script to each user
  account (through multi-select in User Manager) and ensure the needed script
  files are copied into the REPL$\SCRIPTS directory on the export server
  (usually the PDC). Here is a list of the files needed in REPL$\SCRIPTS
  directory or wherever you run your logon scripts from:

     CHOICE.COM     : When a slow network connection is detected, choice
                      prompts the user.
     CLRLEVEL.COM   : Needed to reset the DOS errorlevel flags.
     DOSVER.COM     : Temporary only to detect Windows 95 clients.
     NETSPEED.COM   : Used to detect if a slow network link is being used
                      for the logon.
     NETSPEED.DAT   : Companion to NETSPEED.COM.
     SETLS16.EXE    : Finds logon servers and manages client mapping and
                      connections (MS-DOS clients).
     SETLS32A.EXE   : Windows NT Alpha clients.
     SETLS32I.EXE   : Windows NT Intel clients.
     SETLS32M.EXE   : Windows NT MIPS clients.
     SETLSOS2.EXE   : OS/2 clients.
     SMSLS.BAT      : Main SMS script file for Windows NT and MS-DOS.
     SMSLS.CMD      : For OS/2 clients.
     SMSLS.INI      : Mapping file for resource domains (optional).

4. If a BDC goes down, a client logon request will most likely be serviced by
  the PDC and the logon script will execute through the 19.2K link. The SMSLS
  script will detect that this client belongs to site xyz and that the current
  site is abc. When these site codes differ, the script will gracefully exit
  two times and on the third time, the client will be MOVED to the abc site.
  This is not a desirable situation, so it is recommended that you increase the
  following registry item to a higher number depending on the link speed and
  BDC availability:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ 
          SMS\Components\SMS_Maintenance_Manager

  REG_DWORD: Inventory False Logon Limit (default=3)

  WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

5. The other area to discuss is that when sending packages from the central site
  to the child sites, each child site must be separately targeted (a different
  job for each destination site). This is needed so that the client station's
  PGC and PCM will not see another site's distribution servers in the list of
  servers hosting the package (this list is generated at job activation time).
