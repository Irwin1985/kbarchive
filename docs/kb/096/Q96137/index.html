SUMMARY
=======

Fuji Golf is a computer simulation of an imaginary golf course. The object of
Fuji Golf is to play the 18 holes of the course in as few strokes as possible.
You are competing for position in a tournament with 39 other players whose skill
levels range from beginner to professional. Game play changes each round because
particular factors such as wind are randomly generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As in real golf, each hole has a par rating, and tournament scores are based on
the number of strokes above or below par that you have accumulated.

Fuji Golf automatically selects clubs for you. This club choice is based on ideal
conditions, hence, you may want to change this selection.

Fuji Golf also automatically selects a shot direction for you. This is indicated
by the white line in the Overhead View located on the right side of the screen.
Should you need to change the shot direction, move the mouse pointer into the
Overhead View, or the area in the center of the screen called the Shot View.
When the mouse becomes a golf ball, click and hold the mouse button down, then
drag the mouse to a new direction.

The wind gauge is located in the lower-right corner. The larger the arrow, the
more severe the wind.

To initiate a stroke, start your backswing by clicking the Backswing button. This
will start the red power meter. To hit the ball, click the same button. The
higher the power meter, the further the ball will go.

Note: Fuji Golf is designed to be played by one player at a time. Attributes of
the player other than the name may not be changed. Any name in the player list
may be modified by opening the file FUJIGOLF.DAT into a text editor and changing
the name list.
