SUMMARY
=======

Fp0779.exe is a sample that contains the ISDISKIN utility that provides an
alternative method of dealing with the "Not Ready Reading Drive A" error
message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Fp0779.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

When a FoxPro program attempts to load a file from a floppy disk and no disk is
present in the drive or the drive door is open, MS-DOS returns a "Not ready
reading drive &lt;letter&gt;" message and provides the option to "Abort, Retry,
Ignore" the error.

To provide an alternative method of dealing with this error, the ISDISKIN utility
is included in the multiuser version of Microsoft FoxPro versions 1.02 and 2.0
for MS-DOS. A FoxPro application can call ISDISKIN to determine the status of
the drive and, if necessary, provide a more appropriate message for the user.

INTRODUCTION
============

When a FoxPro program attempts to load a file from a floppy disk and no
disk is present in the drive or the drive door is open, MS-DOS returns a
"Not ready reading drive &lt;letter&gt;" message and provides the option to
"Abort, Retry, Ignore" the error. The ISDISKIN utility on the disk enclosed
with this Application Note is a binary file that provides an alternative
method of dealing with this situation. A FoxPro application can call
ISDISKIN to determine the status of the drive and, if necessary, provide a
more appropriate message for the user.

NOTE: .BIN routines cannot be used in the Windows environment.

To install ISDISKIN
-------------------

NOTE: If you are using the multiuser version of FoxPro 1.02 or 2.0,
ISDISKIN.BIN is already installed in the FOXPRO2\GOODIES\ADDUSER directory
by default.

1. Insert the enclosed FP0779 disk in your floppy disk drive.

2. Copy Isdiskin.bin to your main FoxPro directory. To do this, type
  the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER

     copy &lt;drive&gt;:\isdiskin.bin &lt;destination&gt;

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the FP0779 disk
  and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your FoxPro
  files are located.

  For example, if the FP0779 disk is in drive A, and your FoxPro
  directory is named FOXPRO25 and is on drive C, type the following
  command:

     copy a:\isdiskin.bin c:\foxpro25

To use ISDISKIN in a FoxPro program
-----------------------------------

1. If you are using FoxPro version 2.5 or later or the single-user version
  of FoxPro version 1.02 or 2.0, issue this command:

     SET DEFAULT TO &lt;FoxPro directory&gt;

  If you are using the multiuser version of FoxPro version 1.02 or 2.0,
  issue this command:

     SET DEFAULT TO C:\FOXPRO2\GOODIES\ADDUSER

2. Use the LOAD command to load the Isdiskin.bin file.

3. Create a character memory variable. Set the variable to the drive
  letter for the disk drive to test. For example, create a memory
  variable called &lt;pvalue&gt; and set it equal to "A:".

4. Use the CALL command to invoke the Isdiskin.bin file with the
  character memory variable as a parameter.

ISDISKIN returns one of the following values to indicate the status of
the disk drive:

  Return value     Meaning
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  A:               Drive A tested and a disk is present in drive A.
  B:               Drive B tested and a disk is present in drive B.
  0: (zero)        No disk is present in the tested drive.

NOTE: Isdiskin.bin must be loaded each time the drive requires testing. If
multiple calls are made without reloading and the return value has changed
from A: to 0:, reinserting a disk will not cause A: to be returned; the
return value will remain 0:. To use the function reliably, reload it before
every call.

SAMPLE PROGRAM
==============

  * If you are using the multiuser version of FoxPro 1.02 or 2.0, use
  * SET DEFAULT TO C:\FOXPRO2\GOODIES\ADDUSER instead of the
  * following line.
  SET DEFAULT TO &lt;FoxPro directory&gt;
  LOAD isdiskin.bin
  pvalue = "A:"
  CALL isdiskin.bin WITH pvalue
  DO CASE
  CASE pvalue = "A:"
     RUN DIR A:
  CASE pvalue = "0:"
     WAIT WINDOW "Please put a disk into drive A:"
  ENDCASE
