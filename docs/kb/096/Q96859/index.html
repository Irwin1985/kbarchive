SUMMARY
=======

Audio signals from a CD-ROM drive emulating a CD player (through Music Box or
Media Player) cannot play through a headphone or set of speakers attached to the
Microsoft Windows Sound System card unless an external connection is made
between the headphone jack of the CD-ROM drive and the line-in jack on the
Windows Sound System card. Waveform (.WAV) and MIDI (.MID, .RMI) files that are
opened from a CD-ROM by an application such as Sound Finder or Quick Recorder
will play without this connection.

Page 180 of the "Windows Sound System User's Guide" provides an illustration of
how this connection should be made.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Quick Recorder, Sound Finder, or Sound Recorder play a sound file from a
CD-ROM, the data describing that sound is loaded into memory from the CD-ROM
drive through the data ribbon cable and CD controller. This data is ultimately
transferred to the Windows Sound System through the computer's data bus. The
Sound System then plays the sound.

When Music Box and Media Player play an audio CD, the audio signal is produced in
the CD-ROM were it is made ready as analog output at the CD-ROM's headphone
connector or as digital output on a digital connector if available. No data is
sent to the data bus or to the Sound System directly.

If a patch cord with a 1/8-inch male stereo mini-plug at each end is used to
connect the headphone jack of the CD-ROM drive to the line-in jack on the
Windows Sound System card, the audio will play through the Sound System speakers
or headphones.

Some audio cards can act as CD-ROM controllers. These cards usually have an
internal attachment to control digital input from a CD-ROM. The Windows Sound
System card does not function as a CD-ROM controller and does not have this
connector; it requires the external connection.
