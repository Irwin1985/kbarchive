SUMMARY
=======

Directory Synchronization Error and Status Messages #30 - 59
------------------------------------------------------------

On Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.0 Server Disk 1, there is a file
called DIRSYNC.TXT that contains the error codes used in directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) and in the IMPORT utility for Mail. The errors are
logged in the DIRSYNC.LOG file.

[30]    Error accessing transaction file
  Check to make sure the transaction files exist and/or are not corrupt.
  Files to check are SRVTRANS.GLB, REQTRANS.GLB, USRTRANS.GLB,
  NMETRANS.GLB, and GWTRANS.GLB.

[31]    Network not found
  Check the import file for a network name that is not defined at
  this postoffice.

[32]    Postoffice not found
  Check the import file for a postoffice name that is not defined at
  this postoffice.

[33]    Template file not found
  If you are running Import as a stand-alone utility, use the
  template file (T) code in the import file to import a new template
  file for the requestor. Otherwise, submit an Import request to the
  directory server postoffice with the Administrator program. The
  response to your import request will include the template file.

[34]    Template information not accessible
  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
  is still a connection to the server. If the connection to the
  server is still intact, check that the specified filename exists
  and is not locked open, preventing Import from accessing it.
  Contact your network vendor to determine how to find and close
  files that are locked open. If the specified filename is ADMIN.INF,
  copy backups of ADMIN.INF and ADMIN.TPL to your data files. If the
  specified filename is for an external postoffice, submit an Import
  request to your directory server postoffice. The response to your
  import request will include the template information.

[35]    Template memory allocation error in file
  Ensure that you are running Import on a computer with at least 640K
  of memory.

[36]    Template mismatch error in file
  The template information in the .INF file does not match the
  template prompts in the .TPL file. If changes are made in one file,
  they must be reflected in the other file. Change the files so that
  they match.

[37]    Prompt not found in template
  Check the import file for lines containing template information
  that do not have a matching prompt in the template file.

[38]    Error loading postoffice template
  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
  is still a connection to the server.  If the connection to the
  server is still intact, run the Mail program and check an address
  information window for a user in the specified network and
  postoffice. If you cannot see any template prompts and template
  information then either run the import utility with a template file
  code (T) in the import file to import the template file of the
  specified postoffice, or submit an Import request to your directory
  server postoffice. The response to your import request will include
  the template file.

[39]    Error generating TID
  Check that the TID.GLB file exists. If it cannot be found, it must
  have been accidentally deleted and you should restore a back-up of
  your data files. If TID.GLB exists, ensure that it is not locked
  open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to find and
  close files that are locked open.

  The CONTROL.GLB file may be locked open. Contact your network
  vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
  open.

[40]    Possible database corruption detected
  In most cases, the problem in the data files is not serious enough
  to prevent successful processing of transactions. If this causes a
  fatal error, restore a backup of your data files.

[41]    Internal sort error
  This is an internal error. Please notify Microsoft Product Support
  Services. Transactions will be processed correctly except if you
  are updating the Postoffice Address List with the -R command line
  option, which requires correct sorting in order to avoid missing
  aliases.

[42]    File already opened and locked
  The network operating system has an open file handle to this file.
  Close the open handle with network utility if one is available.

[43]    Gateway alias has no physical address
  There is no address specified for this gateway alias. Run the
  Administrator program and try to delete the alias. If this is not
  possible, either run Import as a stand-alone utility with the
  Replace (R) code to replace the entire list for this gateway, or
  submit an Import request to your directory server postoffice. The
  response to your import request will include the list for this
  gateway.

[44]    Gateway not installed
  There is a directory synchronization transaction for an address
  type that is not recognized at the postoffice. Install the Gateway
  Access component for this address type before trying to process
  this type of transaction.

[45]    File error sorting queue
  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
  is still a connection to the server.

[46]    No fullname
  Check the import file for lines that are missing an alias
  (fullname).

[47]     Transaction has no effect
  Check the transaction format for errors.

[48]    Expecting physical address
  Check the import file for lines that are missing an address.

[49]     Fatal error creating network:
  During the autocreate function, the new network name could not be
  created. Make sure the NETWORK.GLB and *.XTN files are not corrupt.

[50]     Fatal error creating postoffice:
  During the autocreate function, the new postoffice name could not be
  created. Make sure the *.XTN files are not corrupt. Ensure the MBG
  and KEY subdirectories are not write protected.

[51]    Error creating mailbag
  Ensure that the computer that is running Import has at least 640K
  of memory. One of the data files could be locked open, so try the
  operation again. Also check that there is still a connection to the
  server. If the problem continues, use the Administrator program to
  create the user.

[52]    Error accessing configuration information
  If this error occurs while running the Import utility, try the
  operation again. If the problem continues, the REQCONF.GLB may be
  locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to find
  and close files that are locked open.

  If this problem occurs while running the Dispatch program, try the
  operation again. If the problem continues, check that the MASTER.GLB
  file is in the GLB directory. If it is not there, it may have been
  accidentally deleted and you should restore a backup of your data
  files. If it is there, it may be locked open. Contact your network
  vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
  open.

[53]    Unable to read network and postoffice definitions
  Ensure that the computer you are running Import on has at least
  640K of memory. Try the operation again. If the problem continues,
  MASTER.GLB or an .XTN file may be locked open. Contact your network
  vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
  open.

[54]    No Server name has been set
  The requestor administrator must specify the directory server
  postoffice before continuing.

[55]    Can't find Dir-Sync Server postoffice definition
  Ensure that the directory server postoffice has been specified at
  the directory server postoffice itself and at all requestors.

[56]    Error accessing input file
  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
  is still a connection to the server.

  Check for someone editing the Import utility input file (specified
  with -F command line option). If the problem continues, the file may
  be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to
  find and close files that are locked open.

[57]    Error accessing output file
  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check that there
  is still a connection to the server. If the problem continues, the
  Import utility output file (specified with the -F or -X command
  line option) may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to
  determine how to find and close files that are locked open.

[58]    Error accessing database file
  Ensure that there is still a connection to the server and try the
  operation again. If the problem continues, the specified data file
  may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to
  find and close files that are locked open.

[59]    Error autocreating postoffice: xxxxxx
  Ensure that the computer running the Import utility has at least
  640K of memory and that there is still a connection to the server.
  One of the data files may be locked open. Contact your network
  vendor to determine how to find and close files that are locked
  open. You can also create the postoffice with the Administrator
  program External-Admin Create command.
