-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft MS-DOS can conserve memory by loading itself into the first 64
kilobytes (K) of extended memory, known as the high memory area (HMA). MS-DOS
can load itself into the HMA if your computer has an 80286 or higher processor,
extended memory, and is configured correctly.

This article provides guidelines for configuring your system so that MS-DOS can
successfully load into the HMA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find out whether MS-DOS has loaded into the HMA, type the following at the
MS-DOS command prompt:

  " mem" (without the quotation marks)

MS-DOS displays information about your system's memory. If the last line of the
display reads "MS-DOS is resident in the High Memory Area," MS-DOS has
successfully loaded into the HMA.

If MS-DOS fails to load into the high memory area, follow the procedures below in
the order presented.

Step 1. Make Sure Your System Meets the Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure your system has an 80286 or higher processor.

2. Make sure your computer has extended memory. (MS-DOS cannot load into
  expanded memory.) To find out, type the following at the MS-DOS command
  prompt:

  " mem" (without the quotation marks)

  The MEM command reports the type and amount of memory that your computer has.

NOTE: If your system does not meet these requirements, you cannot load MS-DOS
into the HMA.

Step 2. Edit Your CONFIG.SYS File
---------------------------------

Edit your CONFIG.SYS file to be sure that it contains all required statements.

1. Open your CONFIG.SYS file in a text editor. For example, to edit the file
  with MS-DOS Editor, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  " edit &lt;drive&gt;:\config.sys" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive containing your CONFIG.SYS file.

2. Make sure your CONFIG.SYS file contains a DEVICE command for HIMEM.SYS. If
  the file doesn't contain one, insert the following line at the beginning of
  the file:

  " device=&lt;drive&gt;:\dos\himem.sys" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive containing your MS-DOS directory.

3. Make sure your CONFIG.SYS file contains a DOS=HIGH command or a DOS=HIGH, UMB
  command. If the file doesn't contain one of these commands, insert the
  following line:

  " dos=high" (without the quotation marks)

4. If you are using MS-DOS Editor, choose Exit from the File menu. When MS-DOS
  Editor displays a dialog box prompting you to save your file, choose the Yes
  button or press ENTER.

5. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

6. Use the MEM command to find out whether MS-DOS loaded successfully into the
  HMA. If MS-DOS failed to load into the HMA, continue with the next procedure.

Step 3. Add the /CPUCLOCK Switch
--------------------------------

1. If you are using MS-DOS 5.x or earlier, you need to create an MS-DOS startup
  disk. To do so, insert a formatted floppy disk in drive A and type the
  following:

  " sys &lt;drive&gt;: a:" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive containing your MS-DOS directory.

  NOTES:

   - Do not use drive B when you create a startup disk. Most computer BIOS
     startup procedures do not look for a disk in drive B when starting the
     computer (even though the light on drive B may turn on momentarily).

   - If you are using MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, you can skip to step 3. You do not
     need to create a startup floppy disk because you can use the MS-DOS
     interactive startup key (F8) to bypass commands in your CONFIG.SYS file if
     they cause your system to stop responding (hang). For more information on
     using interactive startup, see the "MS-DOS User's Guide," for version 6.

2. Copy your CONFIG.SYS file to the startup disk by typing the following:

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\config.sys a:\ " (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive containing your CONFIG.SYS file.

3. Use MS-DOS Editor to open your original CONFIG.SYS file. Locate the DEVICE
  command for HIMEM.SYS and add the /CPUCLOCK:ON switch to it. The command
  should now appear similar to the following:

     device=c:\dos\himem.sys /cpuclock:on

4. Save your CONFIG.SYS file.

5. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

6. Use the MEM command to find out whether MS-DOS has loaded successfully into
  the HMA. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type:

  " mem" (without the quotation marks)

  If MS-DOS has failed to load into the HMA, continue with the next procedure.

Step 4. Add the /MACHINE Switch
-------------------------------

The /MACHINE switch specifies the type of computer you have. The following table
lists machine types in alphabetical order, and shows the number to specify with
the /MACHINE switch:

  Machine Type               Number
  ----------------------------------------------
  Abacus 386                 1
  Acer 1100                  6
  AT&amp;T(R) 6300 Plus          5
  Bull Micral 60             16
  Chaplet                    1
  CompuAdd(R) 386 systems    1 or 8
  CSS Labs                   12
  Datamedia 386/486          2
  Everex(TM) AT Plus 1800    1
  Everex Notebook ELX        1
  Excel Computer Systems     13
  Hitachi(R) HL500C          8
  Hewlett-Packard(R)         14
     (HP(R)) Vectra(R)
  HP Vectra (A and A+)       4
  IBM(R) PC/AT(R)            1, 11, 12, or 13
  IBM PS/2(R)                2
  Intel(R) 301z or 302       8
  JDR 386/33                 1
  OPT 386-25 motherboard     1
  Pak 386SX                  1
  PC Limited                 4
  PC 380/33C, PC 350/33C,    2
     or PC300/33C BIOS
     revision 1.14
  Philips                    13
  Phoenix Cascade BIOS       3, 1, or 8
  Toshiba 1600 and 1200XE    7
  Toshiba 5100               7
  Tulip(R) SX                9
  Unisys(R) PowerPort        2
  WYSE(R) 12.5 MHz 286       8
  Zenith(R) ZBIOS            10

To add the /MACHINE switch, follow these steps:

1. Since using the wrong /MACHINE switch can cause your system to stop
  responding (hang), you should make an MS-DOS bootable system disk before
  changing the /MACHINE switch. To do this, put a formatted floppy disk in
  drive A and use the SYS program to transfer the system files from your boot
  drive. For example, if your boot drive is C, type "sys c: a:" (without the
  quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, and then press ENTER.

2. Use a text editor, such as MS-DOS Editor, to open your CONFIG.SYS file.

3. Locate the DEVICE command for HIMEM.SYS, and add the /MACHINE switch and the
  number from the table above that corresponds to your hardware. The switch
  should be followed by a colon (:) and your machine number. For example, the
  following DEVICE command specifies a Toshiba(R) 5100:

     device=c:\dos\himem.sys /cpuclock:on /machine:7

  NOTE: If your computer is not on the list, or you are not sure which number to
  use, try machine numbers in the following order: 1, 11, 12, 13, 8, 2-10,
  14-16.

4. Save your CONFIG.SYS file.

5. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

  If your computer fails when you restart it, or you see the "ERROR: Unable to
  control A20 line!" message, the machine number you specified is incorrect for
  your hardware. If the computer hangs and you are using MS-DOS 5.0, insert the
  bootable system disk in drive A and restart your system. If you are using
  MS-DOS 6.0 or 6.2, use the F8 key to start the interactive startup procedure.
  When you are prompted to load HIMEM.SYS, press the N key.

  Then, edit your CONFIG.SYS file, specify a different machine number, save your
  changes, and restart your system. You may need to try several machine numbers
  before you identify the one that works for your computer.

6. After your computer starts, use the MEM command to find out whether MS-DOS
  loaded into the HMA. If it did not, repeat this procedure and specify a
  different machine number.
