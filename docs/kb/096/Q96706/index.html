-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use MS-DOS Shell, your mouse moves erratically, or the mouse pointer
doesn't appear at all. Or, the following dialog box appears when you start
MS-DOS Shell for the first time:

  Warning:

  You do not have a current mouse driver. This driver may cause your system to
  stop or cause other problems with MS-DOS Shell.

  Contact your vendor to get more information or a driver that will work with
  MS-DOS Shell.

  &lt;Disable Mouse&gt; &lt;Use Mouse Anyway&gt;

NOTE: If the dialog box appeared earlier and you now want to disable or re-enable
your mouse, you must modify your DOSSHELL.INI file. For more information about
modifying DOSSHELL.INI, see the "Disabling and Re-Enabling Your Mouse with
MS-DOS Shell" section in this article.

CAUSE
=====

The mouse driver you are using may be installed incorrectly or may be
incompatible with MS-DOS Shell or MS-DOS Editor. (The mouse driver is a file
that enables your computer to interpret your mouse movements. Every mouse should
come with its own mouse driver.)

Some earlier mouse drivers do not work well with MS-DOS Shell because they cannot
perform all the functions required by MS-DOS Shell. Also, using the wrong mouse
driver for your mouse can cause some problems due to hardware differences.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you have no mouse pointer at all, refer to the "Check Your Mouse Driver
Installation" section below. If you do have a mouse pointer, but it moves
erratically or not at all, or if the "You do not have a current mouse driver..."
dialog box appears, refer to the "Check Your Mouse Driver Compatibility" section
later in this article.

Check Your Mouse Driver Installation
------------------------------------

To determine whether your mouse driver is installed correctly, use the procedure
below.

NOTE: The following steps assume your mouse uses a driver called MOUSE.SYS or
MOUSE.COM. If you don't find either file on your hard disk, check the
documentation that came with your mouse for the correct driver name and use it
wherever appropriate.

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER after each
  line

  " &lt;drive&gt;:
  cd &lt;drive&gt;:\
  dir mouse.* /s" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive. (If you have more than one hard
  disk drive, perform this command for all the hard disks on your system.) For
  example, if your hard disk is drive C, type the following command and press
  ENTER after each line:

  " c:
  cd c:\
  dir mouse.* /s" (without the quotation marks)

  MS-DOS displays the location of all mouse files on the drive.

2. Make sure you have either the MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS file, and note which
  directory contains the file. If you have more than one hard disk drive, check
  each drive for these files.

  If you don't have either of these files on your hard disk, copy them from the
  floppy disk that came with your mouse.

3. Use a text editor to open your CONFIG.SYS file (if you have MOUSE.SYS) or
  your AUTOEXEC.BAT file (if you have MOUSE.COM). If you want to use MS-DOS
  Editor, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER

  " edit &lt;drive&gt;:\config.sys" (without the quotation marks)

  -or-

  " edit &lt;drive&gt;:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the startup drive where either AUTOEXEC.BAT or
  CONFIG.SYS currently resides. For example, if your startup drive is drive C,
  type the following command:

  " edit c:\config.sys" (without the quotation marks)

  -or-

  " edit c:\autoexec.bat" (without the quotation marks)

4. Check the file you open to make sure it contains a command for starting your
  mouse and that the location of your mouse file is the same as the location
  specified in the command. Also, make sure your path points to the most
  current version of your mouse files. If you have MOUSE.SYS, a command similar
  to the following should be in your CONFIG.SYS file

  " device=&lt;path&gt;:\mouse.sys" (without the quotation marks)

  where path is the path to your MOUSE.SYS file. For example, if MOUSE.SYS is
  located in the MOUSE directory on drive C, a command like the following
  should be in your CONFIG.SYS file:

  " device=c:\mouse\mouse.sys" (without the quotation marks)

  If you have MOUSE.COM, a command similar to the following should be in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file

  " &lt;path&gt;:\mouse.com" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the path to your MOUSE.COM file. For example, if
  MOUSE.COM is located in the MOUSE directory on drive C, a command like the
  following should be in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  " c:\mouse\mouse.com" (without the quotation marks)

5. Save the file and quit the text editor. If you're using MS-DOS Editor, choose
  Exit from the File menu. When MS-DOS Editor displays a dialog box prompting
  you to save your file, choose the Yes button or press ENTER.

6. If you modified your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, restart your computer
  by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

7. Start MS-DOS Shell to determine whether this solved the problem. If the
  problem still occurs, check your mouse driver's compatibility with MS-DOS
  Shell, as described below.

Check Your Mouse Driver Compatibility
-------------------------------------

To determine whether your mouse driver is compatible with MS-DOS Shell, proceed
as follows:

1. Determine the version number of your mouse driver.

  For some mouse drivers, you can find out what version you have by typing
  "mouse" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. Or,
  observe the message your computer displays when your mouse driver starts. If
  your mouse driver starts from your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, as is
  usually the case, the message appears when you start your computer. This
  message often includes the version number.

2. Ensure your mouse driver is compatible with MS-DOS. The following is a list
  of compatible mouse drivers:

     Type of Mouse       Compatible Versions
     ---------------------------------------

     Genius              9.06 or later
     Hewlett-Packard(R)  7.04 or later
     IBM(R) PS/2(R)      7.04 or later
     Logitech(TM)        5.01 or later
     Microsoft           6.21 or later
     Mouse Systems       7.01 or later

3. If your mouse driver is not on this list, contact your vendor for an updated
  driver. If you have a Microsoft Mouse and MS-DOS Upgrade version 5.0a (MS-DOS
  file dates of 11/11/91) or 6.0, you can install a compatible mouse driver
  from your MS-DOS installation disks by doing the following:

  a. Perform Procedure 1 to determine if you are loading MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS
     and where the mouse driver you are currently using is located.

  b. MS-DOS 5.0a and 6.0 both ship with MOUSE.COM only. If you found in
     Procedure 1 that you are using MOUSE.SYS, you'll need to disable the
     command in CONFIG.SYS by changing it to resemble the following

        rem device=&lt;path&gt;:\mouse.sys

     where &lt;path&gt; is the path to MOUSE.SYS. For example, if MOUSE.SYS is
     located in the MOUSE directory on drive C, the command should appear as
     follows:

        rem device=c:\mouse\mouse.sys

     The REM command stands for "remark" and tells MS-DOS to ignore the command
     it precedes.

     Then add a line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file using the same location for the
     path as you found in Procedure 1. It should look similar to the following
     line

        &lt;path&gt;:\mouse.com

     where &lt;path&gt; is the path to MOUSE.COM. For example, if MOUSE.COM is
     located in the MOUSE directory on drive C, use the following line:

        c:\mouse\mouse.com

  c. To determine which MS-DOS installation disk contains the new mouse driver,
     insert the disk containing the PACKING.LST file in your floppy disk drive.
     To find the disk containing the PACKING.LST file, use the following
     chart:

        MS-DOS 5.0a           Disk Number
        ---------------------------------

        5.25-inch 1.2 MB      1
        5.25-inch 360K        3
        3.5-inch 720K         3

        MS-DOS 6.0            Disk Number
        ---------------------------------

        5.35-inch 1.2 MB      1
        3.5-inch 1.44 MB      1

  d. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER to see the
     contents of each installation disk

  " type &lt;drive&gt;:\packing.lst | more" (without the quotation marks)

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the installation
     disk. For example, if the installation disk is in drive A, type the
     following command:

  " type a:\packing.lst | more" (without the quotation marks)

     NOTE: MOUSE.COM will appear as MOUSE.CO_ because it is a compressed file.

  e. Insert the MS-DOS installation disk containing MOUSE.CO_ in your floppy
     disk drive.

  f. To expand the compressed mouse driver file and copy it to your hard disk
     drive, you must use the EXPAND command. For example, type the following at
     the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER after each line

  " &lt;drive&gt;:
  expand mouse.co_ &lt;path&gt;:\mouse.com" (without the quotation marks)

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the installation
     disk and &lt;path&gt; is the path to the directory where your current
     mouse driver resides. For example, if the installation disk is in floppy
     disk drive A and your current mouse driver is located in the root
     directory of drive C, type the following commands and press ENTER after
     each command:

  " a:
  expand mouse.co_ c:\mouse.com" (without the quotation marks)

     You now have an MS-DOS Shell compatible mouse driver installed for your
     Microsoft Mouse. To start using your mouse, remove any disks from your
     floppy disk drive and restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

Disabling and Re-enabling Your Mouse with MS-DOS Shell
------------------------------------------------------

If the "You do not have a current mouse driver..." dialog box appeared the first
time you started MS-DOS Shell, you had the choice of disabling the mouse or
using the mouse anyway. MS-DOS Shell recorded your choice in a file called
DOSSHELL.INI, which contains information about how MS-DOS Shell appears on your
system.

NOTE: If you just installed a new mouse driver, you do not need to manually edit
the DOSSHELL.INI file to enable the new mouse driver. MS-DOS Shell will
automatically update the DOSSHELL.INI file the next time you start it.

If you chose the Disable Mouse option, MS-DOS Shell added the following line to
your DOSSHELL.INI file:

  mouseinfo=&lt;version&gt;,disabled

However, if you chose the Use Mouse Anyway option, MS-DOS Shell added this line:

  mouseinfo=&lt;version&gt;,ignore

The &lt;version&gt; parameter represents the version number of the mouse driver
MS-DOS Shell detected on your system.

To either enable or disable your mouse, you must manually change the "mouseinfo="
(without the quotation marks) line in the DOSSHELL.INI file.

If you originally chose Disable Mouse, and you want to enable your mouse, follow
this procedure:

1. Use a text editor to open your DOSSHELL.INI file. If you want to use MS-DOS
  Editor, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER

  " edit &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;directory&gt;\dosshell.ini" (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive and &lt;directory&gt; is your
  MS-DOS directory. For example, if your hard disk is drive C and your MS-DOS
  directory is called DOS, type the following command:

  " edit c:\dos\dosshell.ini" (without the quotation marks)

2. Find the "mouseinfo=" (without the quotation marks) line and change it to
  read as follows

  " mouseinfo=&lt;version&gt;,ignore" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;version&gt; is the version number of the mouse driver MS-DOS Shell
  detected on your system.

3. Save the file and quit the text editor. If you're using MS-DOS Editor, choose
  Exit from the File menu. When MS-DOS Editor displays a dialog box prompting
  you to save your file, choose the Yes button or press ENTER.

If you originally chose Use Mouse Anyway and you want to disable your mouse,
follow this procedure:

1. Use a text editor to open your DOSSHELL.INI file. If you want to use MS-DOS
  Editor, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER

  " edit &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;directory&gt;\dosshell.ini" (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive and &lt;directory&gt; is your MS-
  DOS directory. For example, if your hard disk is drive C and your MS-DOS
  directory is called DOS, type the following command:

  " edit c:\dos\dosshell.ini" (without the quotation marks)

2. Find the "mouseinfo=" (without the quotation marks) line, and change it to
  read as follows:

  " mouseinfo=&lt;version&gt;,disabled" (without the quotation marks)

3. Save the file and quit the text editor. If you're using MS-DOS Editor, choose
  Exit from the File menu. When MS-DOS Editor displays a dialog box prompting
  you to save your file, choose the Yes button or press ENTER.
