SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Undelete is using the Delete Sentry level of protection, files
that are deleted are stored in a hidden SENTRY directory in the root of the
drive. These files are automatically purged from the drive under the following
conditions:

- MS-DOS requires the disk space. For example, if the drive is full and you are
  saving updates to a data file, enough files are removed from the hidden
  SENTRY directory so that you can save your data.

- Files in the hidden SENTRY directory are taking up too much space on the
  drive. By default, Delete Sentry allows files to take a maximum of 20% of
  total the drive space.

- Files in the hidden SENTRY directory are too old. By default, files are saved
  for seven days. Purging of old files occurs when Microsoft Undelete is loaded
  (typically from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file).

In each case, files are purged in chronological order (oldest first).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can adjust the maximum amount of disk space allowed for deleted files or the
number of days to save deleted files.

To change options using Microsoft Undelete for Windows:

1. From the Options menu, choose Configure Delete Protection.

2. Select Delete Sentry and choose the OK button.

3. In the Configure Delete Sentry dialog box, set the Maximum Number Of Days To
  Save Deleted Files and Maximum % Of Disk Space For Deleted Files.

4. Choose the OK button.

  -or-

  Use a text editor to change the [Configuration] section of the UNDELETE.INI
  file:

  1. Set percentage= to the maximum percentage of disk space for deleted files.

  2. Set days= to the maximum number of days to save deleted files. For
     example:

  [configuration]
  days=5
  percentage=50

The next time you load Undelete, the new settings are active.

For more information, see "Purging Files Protected by Delete Sentry" in the
"Managing Your System" chapter of the "Microsoft MS-DOS 6 User's Guide," the
"Configuring Delete Sentry" topic in Undelete for Windows Help, or type "help
undelete" (without the quotation marks) and refer to the Notes section.
