The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the OS2.TXT file. The same file is
included with MS-DOS 6 Upgrade, MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade, MS-DOS 6.21 Upgrade, and
MS-DOS 6.22 Upgrade

OS2.TXT
-------

NOTES ON UPGRADING TO MS-DOS 6
------------------------------

If you have OS/2 on your computer, and the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE
referred you to the OS2.TXT file, carry out the following procedure that
corresponds to your computer's configuration.

If You Have Neither OS/2 Dual Boot Nor OS/2 Boot Manager
--------------------------------------------------------

If you want to remove OS/2 from your computer but want to save the data on your
hard disk first, carry out the following procedure:

To remove OS/2 and save the data on your computer:

1. Restart your computer using OS/2.

2. Back up the data files you want to keep onto floppy disks by using the COPY
  command.

  CAUTION: Do not remove OS/2 system files from your hard disk.

3. Reinsert Setup Disk 1 in drive A (the startup drive).

4. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

5. When Setup displays the screen about a non-MS-DOS partition or non-MS-DOS
  files, choose to remove the partition or files.

6. After you finish setting up MS-DOS, copy the data files you saved in step 2
  from the floppy disks back to your hard disk.

If You Have OS/2 Dual Boot with DOS or OS/2 Boot Manager

with DOS
--------

When Setup detects OS/2, it displays a "Non-MS-DOS Partition Detected" or "OS/2
Files Detected" screen. If Setup displayed the "Non-MS-DOS Partition Detected"
screen, carry out Procedure 1. If Setup displayed the "OS/2 Files Detected"
screen, carry out Procedure 2.

Procedure 1 To remove OS/2 and save the data on your computer:

1. When Setup displays the "Non-MS-DOS Partition Detected" screen, choose the
  "Continue Setup" option.

2. After you set up MS-DOS 6, make sure you can access your hard disk.

3. Back up the data files you want to keep onto floppy disks or a network drive.

4. See "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" in the chapter "Diagnosing and
  Solving Problems," and carry out all the procedures that appear in the
  following sections:

   - "Making a Startup Disk"

   - "Using Fdisk"

   - "Deleting Non-MS-DOS Partitions"

   - "Deleting Logical Drives"

   - "Deleting an Extended MS-DOS Partition"

   - "Creating a Primary MS-DOS Partition"

   - "Formatting Your Hard Disk"

5. Restart Setup. To do so, insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B, and then
  type the following at the command prompt:

  " A:SETUP " (without the quotation marks)

  -or-

  " B:SETUP " (without the quotation marks)

6. After you configure your hard disk, copy the files you saved in step 3 back
  to the disk.

Procedure 2 To remove OS/2 and save the data on your computer:

NOTE: If you have a version of OS/2 other than version 2.0, the names of the OS/2
files and directories on your hard disk may differ from those that appear in
this procedure.

CAUTION: Do not remove MS-DOS program files from your computer.

1. Back up the data files you want to keep onto floppy disks or a network drive.

2. If your Setup disks are compatible with drive A, insert Setup Disk 1 in drive
  A, and then restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL. After Setup
  displays the first screen, press F3 twice to quit Setup.

  If your Setup disks are not compatible with drive A, create a startup disk for
  drive A. To do so, insert Setup Disk 1 in drive B, and then type the
  following at the command prompt:

  " B:SETUP /F " (without the quotation marks)

  When prompted, choose to install MS-DOS on the floppy disk in drive A. After
  Setup is finished, leave the startup disk in drive A, and then restart your
  computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

3. Make drive C current by typing the following at the command prompt:

  " C: " (without the quotation marks)

4. One by one, make each of the OS/2 directories and subdirectories current by
  using the CD command, and then delete all the files in them by using the DEL
  command. For example, to make the SYSTEM subdirectory in the OS2 directory
  current and delete all the files in it, type the following at the command
  prompt:

  " CD \OS2\SYSTEM
  DEL *.* " (without the quotation marks)

5. After you have deleted all files in these subdirectories, delete the
  subdirectories by using the RD command. For example, to delete the SYSTEM
  subdirectory in the OS2 directory on drive C, type:

  " RD C:\OS2\SYSTEM " (without the quotation marks)

6. After you have deleted all subdirectories in the OS2, PSFONTS, SPOOL,
  NOWHERE, and OS!2_2.0_D directories, delete all files in these directories by
  using the DEL command.

7. Delete the OS2, PSFONTS, SPOOL, NOWHERE, and OS!2_2.0_D directories by using
  the RD command.

8. Move to another disk or directory all the OS/2 files in your root directory
  except the following:

      EA DATA.SF
      OS2lDR.MSG
      OS2lDR
      OS2KRNl
      OS2BOOT
      WP DATA. SF

9. Change to the root directory by typing the following at the command prompt:

  " CD\ " (without the quotation marks)

10. Change the attributes of the five files listed in step 8 by typing the
  following at the command prompt:

  " A:\ATTRIB -H -S -R C:\E*.*
  A:\ATTRIB -H -S -R C:\O*.*
  A:\ATTRIB -H -S -R C:\W*.* " (without the quotation marks)

11. Delete the files whose attributes you changed by typing the following at the
  command prompt:

  " DEL E*.*
  DEL O*.*
  DEL W*.* " (without the quotation marks)

12. Return to the root directory the files that you moved in step 8.

13. Remove disks from all floppy disk drives, and then restart your computer by
  pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

14. Insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B.

15. Run Setup again by typing the following at the command prompt:

  " A:SETUP " (without the quotation marks)

  -or-

  " B:SETUP " (without the quotation marks)

If You Have OS/2 Boot Manager Without DOS
-----------------------------------------

To remove OS/2 and save the data on your hard disk:

1. Back up the data files you want to keep onto floppy disks or a network drive
  by using the COPY command.

2. Reinsert Setup Disk 1 in drive A (the startup drive).

3. Restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

4. When Setup displays the screen about OS/2 or non- MS-DOS files, choose to
  remove OS/2 or the files.

5. After you finish setting up MS-DOS, copy the data files you saved in step 1
  back to your hard disk.
