-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run MS-DOS 6 Setup when you are logged onto a Novell server, Setup may
leave your Windows initialization (.INI) files in the root directory.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when all the following conditions are exist:

- You are logged on as a supervisor or a user with full access privileges to
  the root of the file server.

- You are using a shared installation of Windows (installed with the SETUP /N
  command).

- Your Windows initialization files are in a user directory that is being
  accessed with a search drive.

- You have installed the Windows-based optional utilities.

If these conditions exist, MS-DOS 6 Setup leaves the following initialization
files in the root of the Novell file server:

  PROTMAN.INI
  SYSTEM.INI
  WINFILE.INI

Setup also leaves the backup (.BAK) files for those files in the root of the
Novell file server.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following techniques to correct this situation:

- If this is the only installation of MS-DOS 6 you plan to perform when you are
  logged in as supervisor, you can simply move these six files back to the user
  directory.

- If you plan to do multiple installations of MS-DOS 6 when you are logged in
  as supervisor, temporarily override the search drive before beginning the
  MS-DOS 6 Setup on each subsequent computer. For example, if your Windows
  initialization files are accessed on Search drive W:\USER\JOEB. Before
  beginning the MS-DOS 6 Setup type these two commands at the MS-DOS command
  prompt:

  " map del w:
  map w:=sys:user\joeb" (without the quotation marks)

  When MS-DOS 6 Setup prompts you for the location of Windows directory, use
  W:\USER\JOEB for the path.

  NOTE: If desired, you may substitute the second command above with the
  following:

  " map root w:=sys:user\joeb" (without the quotation marks)

  When MS-DOS 6 Setup prompts you for the location of Windows, use W:\ for the
  path.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not use a search drive to specify the location of your Windows initialization
files. A search drive represents its drive letter as "&lt;drive&gt;:." instead
of "&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;pathname&gt;." MS-DOS 6 looks at "&lt;drive&gt;:.",
changes to the root of the drive, and then looks for the current (.) directory.
This is why MS-DOS 6 writes the files to the root of the server.

If you are logged on as a user without write access privileges to the root of the
file server (as is generally the case with a user on a Novell network), the same
approach as described in the second technique applies. If you don't have
privileges in the root directory, the temporary initialization files (.$$$) are
written to your user directory. No changes are been made to your original
initialization files. You can safely delete these .$$$ files. Use the second
technique and then restart the MS-DOS 6 Setup program.

The following three .$$$ files may be left in your user directory:

  __SYS__.$$$
  __PGI__.$$$
  __WFI__.$$$

If Setup detects that it did not need to modify one or more of the initialization
files, you may not have all three of these in your user directory.

NOTE: This information applies to both the SETUP and SETUP /E commands. (SETUP /E
is used to install the optional components.)
