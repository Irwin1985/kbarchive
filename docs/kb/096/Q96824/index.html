SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Undelete for MS-DOS (UNDELETE.EXE) and Microsoft Undelete for Windows
(MWUNDEL.EXE) are designed to share a common UNDELETE.INI file. The UNDELETE.INI
file specifies how Undelete should configure memory-resident delete protection.
This protection is enabled each time you run Undelete with one of the
following:

  undelete /load
  undelete /s[drive]
  undelete /t[drive]

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UNDELETE.INI file is a text file that can be edited using an ASCII text
editor, such as MS-DOS Editor. If the MSDOSDATA environment variable is set, the
UNDELETE.INI file is created in the directory specified by MSDOSDATA. Otherwise,
the UNDELETE.INI file is created in the directory that contains UNDELETE.EXE.

You can change the UNDELETE.INI file settings using any of the following three
methods:

Using Undelete for Windows
--------------------------

From the Options menu, choose Configure Delete Protection. The changes you make
take affect the next time you load Undelete. (This is the simplest method.)

Using the MS-DOS Command Line
-----------------------------

When you load Undelete using the /S[drive] or /T[drive] parameter, the mode of
delete protection and which drive[s] you specify to protect are saved in the
UNDELETE.INI file. These changes take affect immediately.

Note: This method does not allow you to specify a drive to be left unprotected.
For example, if you had been previously loading Delete Sentry on drive C,
UNDELETE /SD would enable Delete Sentry on both drives C and D.

Editing the UNDELETE.INI File
-----------------------------

Use an ASCII text editor, such an MS-DOS Editor, to change the UNDELETE.INI file
settings.

For more information on the UNDELETE.INI file, type "help undelete" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, press ENTER and refer to the
Notes section.
