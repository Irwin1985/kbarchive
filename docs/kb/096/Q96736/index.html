SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses FTSETUP--its features, how to use it, and how it works.

MORE INFORMATION
================

General Installation Issues
---------------------------

Before running FTSETUP, make sure that the drive becoming the mirror is "raw,"
meaning that it is not formatted or partitioned. Also make sure that the
partition(s) on the drive being mirrored do not take up all of the drive's
capacity. For more information on requirements for fault tolerance, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  EISA and HPFS and LADDR and FTBOOT.EXE

Running FTSETUP installs fault tolerance on a machine even if mirroring is not
selected. If a machine cannot be made fault tolerant (if it has FAT drives or
only one disk) FTSETUP presents an explicit warning; on machines that can
possibly be made fault tolerant, the warning is still present, but is less
explicit.

After fault tolerance has been installed and the machine has been rebooted, LAN
Manager cannot be removed from the machine until fault tolerance is removed,
even if mirroring is not active.

Current fault tolerance is not compatible with OS/2 version 2.0. Although it
seems to install without problems, reboot reports CONFIG.SYS errors. As a
result, LAN Manager can be removed from the machine without removing fault
tolerance (as theoretically installed in FTSETUP) first.

Once you have scheduled fault tolerance for installation and exited FTSETUP, you
cannot re-enter the program without rebooting. Attempting to do so results in
the message "DISKFT.SYS is in CONFIG.SYS but is not running. FTSETUP cannot
continue."

Mirroring Issues
----------------

To determine the capacity available for mirroring/duplexing, choose
&lt;Config&gt; then &lt;View Drive Status&gt; in FTSETUP.

FTSETUP allows you to select invalid actions (such as scheduling a drive for
mirroring when no mirror is available or scheduling more capacity for mirroring
than is available), but generates error messages when you choose the &lt;OK&gt;
button.

To schedule drives to be mirrored, use the Mirror Drives menu. When you finish
scheduling and exit this menu no changes are noticeable. They do not become
visible until you choose the Exit option in the FTSETUP Exit menu.

Once FTSETUP has made changes and you have been instructed to close all other
processes and reboot, you cannot exit FTSETUP. Attempts to end it at the OS/2
task list or close it from the Desktop have no effect. You must reboot.

Other Issues
------------

FTSETUP has an option for deleting drives as well. If you select Delete Drive and
then select Remove Fault Tolerance, a warning states that you have "...drives
that are mirrored, drives pending mirroring or orphaned drives" and displays the
consequences of continuing. No mention is made of deleted drives. Choosing OK
presents a message that says fault tolerance will change the partition
configuration tables and that you must reboot. When you exit FTSETUP, the
deleted drive is not available. Attempting to access it results in a SYS0108
message that the drive is being used by another process.

FTSETUP installs itself by inserting lines in CONFIG.SYS and a line in
STARTUP.CMD that calls a command file that runs FTSETUP. When this file runs,
FTSETUP presents messages about the progress of mirroring. When it is done, you
must exit the program manually. Any commands in the STARTUP.CMD file following
the call to run FTSETUP (such as NET START SERVER) are not executed until you
exit FTSETUP. At some point in this process, the CALL FTAUTO in STARTUP.CMD is
REMed out.
