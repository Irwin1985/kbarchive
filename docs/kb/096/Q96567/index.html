The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

Running Microsoft Windows for Workgroups on a computer with one 5.25-inch or
3.5-inch high-density disk drive and a hard disk with 9.5 megabytes (MB)
available memory is fully supported. (We recommend that you have a hard disk
with 14.5 MB available memory). Windows for Workgroups is not designed to be
installed on workstations without hard disks (computers without hard disks that
are connected to a network), and Microsoft does not support running Windows for
Workgroups with any type of diskless workstation. However, a workaround to set
up Windows for Workgroups on Novell workstations that do not have hard disks is
available.

This article contains information that you can use to install Windows for
Workgroups on a Novell NetWare workstation that does not have a hard disk.

NOTE: A true diskless workstation (one with no floppy disk drive or hard disk
drive) using a network adapter with a boot ROM does not work with Windows for
Workgroups. This is because the boot ROM establishes a network connection and
does not allow the Windows for Workgroups network drivers to coexist with the
boot ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up Windows for Workgroups on a diskless workstation on a Novell network,
use the following procedure:

1. Start the computer with a network boot disk and log on as supervisor.

  NOTE: If you upgraded from Windows 3.1 by using the SETUP /A command should
  remove the Windows 3.1 shared directory before continuing. For more
  information on upgrading a shared networked Windows directory, query on the
  following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  and attrib and flag

2. Run SETUP /A from the Windows for Workgroups Disk 1. This process expands the
  Windows for Workgroups files and places them in a shared network directory.

3. Have each user start his or her computer with a network boot disk and log on.
  Run SETUP or SETUP /N (recommended) from the shared directory created in step
  2. When prompted for the directory name, enter the network user's home
  directory.

  (A network boot disk contains the MS-DOS operating system and necessary files
  to establish network connection, that is, IPX and NETX. The boot disk must
  have approximately 1 MB of free disk space. The free disk space needed varies
  depending on which NDIS network card driver is installed.)

  NOTE: Windows 3.1 directories created with SETUP /N can only be upgraded to
  Windows for Workgroups with SETUP /N. Windows 3.1 installations created with
  SETUP must be upgraded by SETUP.

4. After selecting the network adapter type and settings, the Compatible
  Networks dialog box appears. Select Novell NetWare and choose the Add
  button.

  During the setup process the following message appears:

  Setup cannot find or cannot update your system files on drive A:. If you
  started your system from a floppy disk, be sure to remove write-protection
  from your system startup (boot) disk. Then insert the disk into drive A and
  choose Retry.
  To copy system files to your Windows directory choose Cancel.

  This is normal. If your bootable floppy boot contains approximately 1 MB of
  free disk space, select Retry.

When the setup process is finished, the boot disk will contain the following
files:

Notes on Using Workstations Without Hard Disks
----------------------------------------------

- A workstation without a hard disk has the same system requirements for
  running Windows for Workgroups 3.1 as a workstation with a hard disk drive.
  (The RAM requirement may be greater if you are using a RAM drive).

- Running Windows for Workgroups in standard mode (the highest mode on an 80286
  computer) makes it necessary to log on to the Windows for Workgroups network
  before you run Windows. Network commands such as Net Start and Net Logon
  Username will require information from the SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows
  user directory. Copy this file from the Windows for Workgroups user directory
  to the network boot disk. Note that changes made in the Networks dialog box
  in Control Panel will not update the SYSTEM.INI file on the boot disk. If you
  make changes in Control Panel, you must recopy the SYSTEM.INI file to the
  boot floppy disk before the changes can take effect.

- To share local workstation resources (such as floppy disk drives, printers,
  and CD-ROM drives), you must create a RAM drive and set your SET TEMP
  environment variable to its location. The RAM drive needs to be of
  considerable size (2048K or larger) if you are planning to share a local
  printer because Print Manager will queue jobs into the RAM drive. To set up a
  2 MB RAM drive, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

  DEVICE=A:\RAMDRIVE.SYS 2048 /E
