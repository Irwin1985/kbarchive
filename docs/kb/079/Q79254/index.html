SUMMARY
=======

LAN Manager version 2.1 with the Remote Access Service (RAS) is primarily
intended to run on machines with a hard disk drive. However, it is possible to
create a high-density, bootable LAN Manager 2.1 Enhanced RAS MS-DOS workstation
floppy disk. The following steps describe the procedures and directory
structures required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTES
-----

Because RAS cannot be installed to a floppy disk, it is necessary to first
install a LAN Manager 2.1 enhanced workstation with the Remote Access Service
(RAS) to a workstation with a hard disk drive. Additionally, RAS must be
configured for the modem type found on the machine for which this disk is being
prepared.

Also, this article assumes that LAN Manager will be installed to the
C:\LANMAN.DOS directory. If this is not the case, substitute the appropriate
directory.

INSTALLATION STEPS
------------------

Create a bootable high-density floppy disk (FORMAT A: /S), using either a
3.5-inch (1.44 MB) or 5.25-inch (1.2 MB) disk. Once the disk is formatted, copy
the files listed below to the same directory on the floppy disk. The tree
structure of this disk is as follows:

A:\ 
   COMMAND  COM
   CONFIG   SYS
   AUTOEXEC BAT

A:\LANMAN.DOS\ 
             LANMAN   INI
             MODEMS   INF
             RASPHONE MSG
             RASDIAL  MSG
             RASHELP  MSG
             COMDEV   INI
             PHONE    INF
             PROTOCOL INI

A:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\ 
                     CHKNET   EXE
                     MINSES   EXE
                     NETBIND  COM
                     LOAD     COM
                     OSO001   MSG
                     NET      MSG
                     NET      HLP
                     NET      EXE
                     NETWKSTA EXE
                     RASLOAD  BAT
                     RASPHONE EXE
                     VCOMMIOD EXE
                     WANTSR   EXE

A:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\ 
                             PRO     MSG
                             PROTMAN DOS
                             PROTMAN EXE

A:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\ASYBEUI\ 
                                      ASYBEUI EXE

A:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ASYNC\ 
                           ASYMAC DOS

A:\LANMAN.DOS\SERVICES\ 
                      MSRV     EXE
                      ENCRYPT  EXE
                      NETPOPUP EXE

A:\LANMAN.DOS\LOGS\ 
                  MESSAGES LOG

In all cases, the files listed are copied from the hard disk directory to the
identical directory on drive A.

There is an alternative to copying the files directly from the hard disk to the
floppy disk that involves deleting files from the hard disk installation before
copying to the floppy disk. In this circumstance, all files in the LAN Manager
tree not listed in the above description are deleted, leaving only the structure
as listed. At that point, XCOPY the structure to a formatted system floppy disk
(note: include the subdirectory switch with XCOPY). For example:

  " xcopy c:\lanman.dos a:\lanman.dos /s" (without the quotation marks)

The disadvantage of the installation technique just described is that it will
leave the LAN Manager tree on the hard disk workstation without all of the
functionality of the original installation.

MODIFICATIONS TO SYSTEM FILES
-----------------------------

Once the files have been copied to the appropriate directories, make the
following modification to the lanroot entry in the [workstation] section of
LANMAN.INI:

  lanroot = A:\LANMAN.DOS

Modify CONFIG.SYS to update the LAN Manager driver devices to look to drive A, as
well as set the location of the shell to A:\. For example:

  FILES= 30
  BUFFERS=10
  SHELL=A:\COMMAND.COM /P /e:256
  DEVICE=A:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTMAN\PROTMAN.DOS /i:A:\LANMAN.DOS
  DEVICE=A:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ASYNC\ASYMAC.DOS

It is also necessary to modify AUTOEXEC.BAT by setting the comspec, path, and LAN
Manager path extension to point to drive A. It is also possible to autostart
RASPHONE by including it at the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, after calling
RASLOAD. For example:

@ECHO OFF
PROMPT $P$G
SET COMSPEC=A:\COMMAND.COM
PATH A:\;
REM ====== LANMAN 2.1 === DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES ===== LANMAN 2.
===
SET PATH=A:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG;%PATH%
NET START WORKSTATION
CALL RASLOAD
REM ====== LANMAN 2.1 === DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES ===== LANMAN 2.
===

Note: The above are minimal configurations. Options can be added at any time, and
are limited only by available disk space.

OPTIONS
-------

If the modem is sufficiently fast, it is possible to locate the majority of the
MS-DOS and network executables on the network, and allow them to be accessed
across the modem connection. Please note that even with the fastest of modems,
workstation performance will be seriously degraded. The steps necessary for
creating this situation include the following:

- Create a share on the server that contains MS-DOS and a full LAN Manager 2.1
  Enhanced MS-DOS RAS workstation.

- Create a batch file, called LOGON.BAT, to log on to the server. The usage is
  identical to the NET LOGON command currently used. The batch file (LOGON.BAT)
  will resemble the following:

     @ECHO OFF
     REM  Logon to server and transfer control to the LM share
     net logon %1 %2 /y
     net use A: \\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;share&gt;
     REM  This connects us to the LM share

- The structure of the directories on this share should be identical to that
  listed above.

- Access to the boot floppy will be disallowed. However, on a machine with only
  one floppy disk drive, the boot floppy disk can still be accessed via the
  MS-DOS drive mapping capabilities. Therefore, the disk drive can be
  referenced by accessing B:. MS-DOS will map this to the one physical floppy
  disk, allowing access.

- Similarly, a batch file for logging off must be constructed. It should
  resemble the following:

     @ECHO OFF
     REM Logoff from server
     B:
     NET LOGOFF /Y
     A:

  Using this method may result in some harmless error messages of missing batch
  files and possibly a missing NET.MSG at log off time. This is to be expected
  and the messages can be ignored.

Given this configuration, it is possible to create a bootable LAN Manager 2.1
Enhanced MS-DOS RAS floppy disk. The important points to note are that it is
required to first install the configuration to a workstation with a hard disk.
The installation must be made for the hardware that is to be booted from the
floppy disk, regardless of what is on the hard disked workstation. There should
be sufficient room on the floppy disk for the most commonly used MS-DOS
utilities.
