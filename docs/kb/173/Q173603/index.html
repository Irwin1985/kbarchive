-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you quit Microsoft Word 97, the following error message may appear:

  Word cannot save or create this file. The disk may be full or write
  protected.

  Try one or more of the following:

  - Free more memory.

  - Make sure that the disk you want to save the file on is not full,
  write-protected, or damaged. (&lt;path&gt;\NORMAL.DOT)

where &lt;path&gt; is the location to which Word is trying to save Normal.dot.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

- You are running Windows NT or Windows 95 with user profiles enabled.

- Office 97 installation has been performed for other users of the workstation,
  but not for you.

- The Office folder is in a location that you cannot write to. This may occur
  if you installed Word with a Run From CD installation, a Run From Network
  Server installation, or a local installation on a Windows NT workstation if
  you do not have permissions to write to the Office folder.

- You start and quit Word for the first time, without using the New command on
  the File menu.

When you quit Word, Word attempts to write a Normal.dot (template) file in the
Office folder. Because the Office folder is in a location that you cannot write
to, you receive the error message described in the "Symptoms" section of this
article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Word 97.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. Click the File Locations tab.

4. Under File Types, click User Templates, and then click Modify.

5. In the Modify Location dialog box, select a new folder name and click OK. The
  default value is:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates

6. Under File Types, click Workgroup Templates, and then click Modify.

7. In the Modify Location dialog box, select a new Folder Name and click OK
  twice. The default value is undefined (blank).

8. Quit Word without saving changes to Normal.dot and then restart Word.

Word writes a new Normal.dot file in the location specified in step 5.

If Word writes the Normal.dot file in a location other than the one you
specified, follow these steps:

1. Manually move (don't copy) the Normal.dot file to the directory you want.

2. Follow steps 1 through 5 above to set the User Templates path to the
  directory that contains the Normal.dot file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design and is different from earlier versions of Word.
Earlier versions of Word search the program (Office) directory for a Normal.dot
file before searching the User Templates or Workgroup Templates locations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Template Search Order
---------------------

When Word 97 starts, it automatically searches for a Normal.dot template file
upon which to base Document 1. The search order is as follows:

1. Local Templates path - On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the File
  Locations tab. The setting is called "User Templates." This setting is stored
  in the following registry location:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
     \LocalTemplates

2. Shared Templates path - On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the File
  Locations tab. The setting is called "Workgroup Templates." This setting is
  stored in the following registry location:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
     \SharedTemplates

3. The program folder that contains Winword.exe.

NOTE: If there is a Normal.dot file in more than one of these locations, Word 97
uses the first Normal.dot file it finds, based on the above search order.

The search order for Word 97 is different from earlier versions of Word.

How the Registry Keys Are Written
---------------------------------

Setup does not create the User Templates and Workgroup Templates paths mentioned
earlier. The registry keys are first created in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and Word
copies them to HKEY_CURRENT_USER the first time someone uses the File New
command.

Word does not create the SharedTemplates registry key unless the installation is
an upgrade over a previous version of Office in which a WorkGroups Templates
location was specified. The process is as follows:

1. Setup writes the User Templates and Workgroup Templates settings to the
  following respective registry keys:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
     \LocalTemplates

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\FileNew
     \SharedTemplates

2. You then log on to Windows and start Word 97.

3. When you click the File menu and click New, Word copies the settings in

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

Possible Problems
-----------------

If you never use the New command on the File menu, Word never copies the registry
entries from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_CURRENT_USER. In this situation, the
LocalTemplates and SharedTemplates keys in HKEY_CURRENT_USER do not exist;
therefore, Word attempts to write the Normal.dot file to the program directory.
(See item 3 in the "Template Search Order" section earlier in this article.)

Run from Network Server Installation:

If you are running Office 97 from a network server, the error message described
earlier occurs because Word cannot save the Normal.dot file to the program
directory on the network server, a directory to which you do not have write
permissions.

Run from CD Installation:

If you are running Office 97 using a Run From CD installation, the error message
occurs because Word is trying to save the Normal.dot file to the program
directory on the Office CD, a directory which cannot be written to.

Run Local Installation:

If you are running a local installation of Office 97, Word writes the Normal.dot
file to the program directory as long as you have permission to write to that
directory. Otherwise, the error message occurs.
