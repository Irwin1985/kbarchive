SUMMARY
=======

When you configure Microsoft Replication Manager for Internet synchronization,
the seventh screen of the Configure Microsoft Replication Manager Wizard asks
you to provide the alias of an FTP folder. If an Internet synchronization fails,
a message file is left in this shared FTP folder. For example, this can occur if
the communications link between the server and the remote computer fails. The
format of a message file name is rep&lt;xxxx&gt;.msg.

To prevent files that are no longer needed from accumulating on the server, you
should periodically delete any old message files from the shared FTP folder.
Even if you happen to delete a message file that has not yet been processed by
the Synchronizer, the missing message is re-sent the next time you synchronize
the replicas.


MORE INFORMATION
================

A failed Internet synchronization also leaves temporary files with names that
are in the format Jet&lt;xxx&gt;.tmp on the server. If you are using Microsoft
Internet Information Server, however, these files may not be placed in the Temp
folder because the TEMP environment variable is typically a user variable; the
FTP service only recognizes system environment variables. Therefore,
Jet&lt;xxx&gt;.tmp files may accumulate in the server's System Root directory
(the folder in which Microsoft Windows NT is installed) after a failed internet
synchronization. You can safely delete these files regardless of where you find
them.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

This example assumes that you have set up your Internet or intranet server for
replication and that you have configured Microsoft Replication Manager for
Internet synchronization. For information about setting up Internet or intranet
replication, search the Microsoft Replication Manager Help Index for "Internet,
synchronizing replicas" and display the topic, "Setting Up an Internet or
Intranet Server for Replication."

This example demonstrates the accumulation of message files by temporarily
stopping the WWW Service on your server.

1. Start Microsoft Access 97 and create a new database on your Internet server.

2. Create a new table with one field.

3. Save the table as tblTable1 and close it.

4. Convert the database to a Design Master.

5. Manage the Design Master with Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5; this assigns
  an Internet address to the Design Master.

6. In Windows Explorer, copy the Design Master to a shared FTP folder that is
  accessible over the Internet.

7. On a remote computer, download the file that you copied to the shared FTP
  folder in step 6.

8. Open the replica on the remote computer.

9. Open tblTable1 and add a record. Close the table.

10. On the Tools menu, point to Replication and click Synchronize Now.

11. In the Synchronize Now dialog box, select a member of the replica set on the
  Internet and click OK.

12. In the Synchronize Database dialog box, click Synchronize.

13. When you receive the message that synchronization was completed
  successfully, click Yes.

14. At the server, start Windows Explorer and open the FTP folder that you
  designated to receive message files. Note that there are no messages
  remaining in this folder because the Synchronizer has already processed the
  data exchange.

15. Stop the WWW Service. The folder that you specified as the location for the
  Synchronizer when you configured Microsoft Replication Manager is now
  unavailable to the remote computer. However, the FTP folder that you
  designated to receive message files is still available to the remote
  computer.

16. In the replica on the remote computer, try to synchronize again with a
  member of the replica set on the Internet. When you receive the message,
  "Internal internet failure," click OK.

17. On the server, open the FTP folder that you designated to receive messages;
  note that it contains a file whose name is in the format
  rep&lt;xxxx&gt;.msg.

18. Start the WWW Service on the server.

19. In the replica on the remote computer, try to Synchronize again; when you
  receive the message that the synchronization was completed successfully,
  click Yes.

20. On the server, open the FTP folder that you designated to receive messages.
  Note that, although the replica set has been synchronized, the file
  rep&lt;xxxx&gt;.msg is still present in the folder.
