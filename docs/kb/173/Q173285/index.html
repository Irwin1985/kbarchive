The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, on platform(s):

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure the SNA Server Windows 3.x client software with two firewall
addresses, the SNA client is unable to connect through the second firewall
server if the SNA Server computer associated with the first firewall server is
unavailable. This problem occurs when the SNA Server Windows 3.x client is
communicating over the TCP/IP Windows sockets interface provided by Netmanage
Newt version 4.6 or 4.65. This problem does not occur when you are using the
Microsoft TCP32 protocol and Windows sockets interface.

SNA Server client support for connectivity across Internet firewalls is described
in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q139508 Internet Firewall Support in SNA Server

Here are the specific failure scenarios you encounter when using the Netmanage
Newt TCP/IP sockets interface:

- If the first SNA Server computer (associated with the first firewall address)
  is not connected to the network, then the SNA Windows 3.x client receives
  error 10060 (WSAETIMEDOUT), as expected, when connecting to the SnaBase
  socket 1478. But when the SNA client attempts to connect to the second SNA
  Server computer (associated with the second firewall address), you still
  receive error 10060, even though a network trace (such as Microsoft Network
  Monitor) indicates that the TCP/IP syn/syn/ack connection succeeded to socket
  1478 on the second server.

- If both SNA Server computers are connected to the network, but the SNA Server
  service is not running on the first server, then the SNA client's attempt to
  open a connection to socket 1477 on the second server fails with socket error
  10009 (WSAEBADF). The connection attempt to the first SNA Server computer
  fails as expected with error 10061 (WSAECONNREFUSED), because the SNA Server
  service was not started on the first SNA Server computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

At the time this article was written, there was no solution for this problem
available from Netmanage.


This problem does not occur when you are using the SNA Server Windows 3.x client
software over the Microsoft TCP32 protocol stack.
