-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a person running the Systems Management Server Administrator program
attempts to establish a Remote Control session with a client computer running
Windows NT, the message "Cannot establish a security context with the client" is
returned. If the Remote Control button is clicked again, another window
containing the following message appears:

  The currently logged in user does not have rights to access the client
  machine. Please provide the username, domain, and password of an account that
  is allowed to access the client.

Regardless of what user name, domain, and password is supplied, the "Cannot
establish security context" message is always returned.

CAUSE
=====

This particular problem has two possible causes. One possible cause is that
there is no valid entry in the Permitted Viewers registry key on the Systems
Management Server client that is to be controlled remotely.

The other possible cause is that this is an Administrator program problem where
the Workstation service is not functioning correctly on the system running the
Systems Management Server Administrator program. If this is the case, the system
running the Administrator program will be unable to remotely control any other
computer running Windows NT.

To determine which of these two possibilities may be causing your problem, try to
use Remote Control on the target client from another computer running the
Systems Management Server Administrator program. If the workstation can be
successfully controlled remotely from another system running the Systems
Management Server Administrator program, then this is probably not a problem
with the client computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow the steps below, depending on whether the
cause of the problem is with the client computer or the computer running the
Systems Management Server Administrator program:

Client Problem
--------------

1. If the client computer running Windows NT cannot be remotely controlled from
  any system running the Systems Management Server Administrator program,
  examine the following registry key on the Windows NT client that you want to
  use Remote Control on:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client Services\Remote
     Control\Parameters

2. Ensure that the Permitted Viewers value (REG_MULTI_SZ) contains a valid
  Windows NT user account or group (such as Administrators).

You can define the site-wide setting for the permitted viewers in the Systems
Management Server Administrator program. To do this, click Clients on the Site
Properties menu, and then click Options.

Administrator Problem
---------------------

1. If the system running the Systems Management Server Administrator program is
  unable to use Remote Control on any client computer running Windows NT (that
  can be controlled remotely from other stations running the Systems Management
  Server Administrator program), first try applying (or reapplying) the latest
  service pack for Windows NT. This has proven to correct some of these
  problems. If the problem remains, remove and reinstall the Workstation
  service on the system running the Systems Management Server Administrator
  program. You can do this by using the Network tool in Control Panel. If the
  system is a domain controller, the workstation service cannot be removed.

  WARNING: Removing this service will not allow the workstation to connect to a
  remote location to reinstall the service. Make certain the system has a
  CD-ROM drive and the Windows NT CD-ROM, or has copied the Windows NT I386 (or
  other platform) folder to its local hard disk before removing this service.

2. Reapply any Windows NT service packs that were previously applied to the
  system.

3. Restart the system.

The system should now be able to use Remote Control on any remote client
computers running Windows NT.
