SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you how to play an AVI file stored in a resource .dll file
through Visual Basic. Although you can add an AVI file to a resource file in
Visual Basic and then compile the Visual Basic project into a .dll file, the AVI
file is accessible only through Visual Basic.

An AVI file stored in a resource .dll file compiled in Visual C++ has two
advantages:

- The file is accessible from more than one application written in several
  different programming languages, such as both Visual C and Visual Basic.

- If you need to change the resource file because you need to change the AVI
  file, you only have to change one file. That file can reside on a server and
  become accessible to all programs using that file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Avirsce.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/utility1/1/WIN98/EN-US/Avirsce.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

When you run the self-extracting file Avirsce.exe, the following files are
expanded into the directory, AVI Resource Sample Project, on your hard drive:

- Avirsce.vbp (1Kb)-the project file
- Avirsce.vbw (1Kb)-the workspace file
- Form1.frm   (2Kb)-the form file
- Module1.bas (5Kb)-the module file
- Readme.txt       -you are reading this file

Steps to Create the Sample
--------------------------

This sample assumes you have a compiled resource .dll file with an AVI file. You
also need the Resource.h file for the resource .dll file in order to determine
the identifier for the AVI file.

Look for a line similar to this one in the Resource.h file to determine the AVI
file identifier:

     #define IDR_AVI1     101

The identifier for the AVI file in this case is 101.

To create a resource .dll file containing an AVI file, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q178199 HOWTO: Create a Resource DLL File Containing an AVI


1. Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form. (Add the AVI
  file identifier and the path to the resource .dll file in the lines marked
  with the comment &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ):

        Option Explicit
        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim hRsrc As Long
           Dim hGlobal As Long
           Dim lpString As String
           Dim strCmd As String, strReturnVal As String
           Dim nbuf As Long

           'Identifier for the AVI in the resource file from the resource.h
           'file of the resource dll, which must be preceded by '#'.
           lpString = "#101" '                                       &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

           'Loads the resource
           'Change the filename argument in the next line to the path and
           'filename of your resource dll file.
           hInst = LoadLibrary("&lt;Path resource dll file name&gt;") '    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
           hRsrc = FindResource(hInst, lpString, "AVI")
           hGlobal = LoadResource(hInst, hRsrc)
           lpData = LockResource(hGlobal)
           fileSize = SizeofResource(hInst, hRsrc)

           Call mmioInstallIOProc(MEY, AddressOf IOProc, _
                                  MMIO_INSTALLPROC + MMIO_GLOBALPROC)
           nbuf = 256

           'Play the AVI file
           strCmd = "open test.MEY+ type avivideo alias test"
           strReturnVal = mciSendString(strCmd, 0&amp;, 0&amp;, 0&amp;)
           strCmd = "play test wait"
           strReturnVal = mciSendString(strCmd, 0&amp;, 0&amp;, 0&amp;)
           strCmd = "close test"
           strReturnVal = mciSendString(strCmd, 0&amp;, 0&amp;, 0&amp;)

           Call mmioInstallIOProc(MEY, vbNull, MMIO_REMOVEPROC)
           FreeLibrary hInst
        End Sub

4. From the Project menu, click Add Module to create a new module.

5. Copy the following code to the code window of the Module1 module.

        Option Explicit
        Public lpData As Long
        Public fileSize As Long
