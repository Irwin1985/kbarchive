How to Cancel Your MSN Account
------------------------------

If you are experiencing problems using your MSN account, we recommend that you
review the list of Frequently Asked Questions below. Oftentimes, we find the
problems that lead members to cancel their accounts are easily solved by the
information provided in these Frequently Asked Questions.

If you would like to cancel or discuss your MSN Internet Access account, please
call (800) 386-5550 to speak to an MSN representative.

When you call, please have the following information ready:

- Your MSN Member ID

- Your name and mailing address

- The last 6 digits of the credit card associated with your MSN account (for
  verification purposes)

Before you proceed, there are a few important issues you should be aware of
before canceling your account.

- After the cancellation has taken effect, you'll no longer be able to log on
  to MSN. If you attempt to log on after this time, you will receive an error
  message.

- Before you cancel, make sure to download any e-mail you want to keep to your
  computer; as a part of cancellation, your e-mail account is also deleted.

- Charges incurred prior to cancellation, but not yet billed, may be applied to
  your credit card at a future date.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

MSN is Busy or Too Slow. Why Is This?

The dramatic rise in Internet usage has placed more demands on the telephone
lines, which are used to log on to the Internet. At MSN our goal is to create
the best online experience for our members. In an effort to meet the rising
demand for Internet access, we are always adding new MSN Internet Access
numbers, which you can find on the Access Number Update. In addition, we?re
working on bringing new access technology like ADSL to our membership.
If you are currently experiencing difficulties establishing a connection using
MSN Internet Access, it is possible that you are using an access phone number
which has an unusually high volume of callers or you are dialing during peak
hours. For best connection results, MSN suggests the following:

- Try changing your Internet access phone number. You might find a number that
  isn't experiencing as much volume as the one you are currently using.

- Try connecting to the Internet during off-peak hours. General peak hours for
  Internet usage range between 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., local time.

Is There a Less Expensive Plan Than My Current One?

The best plan for you will depend on how much you use the Internet. For most
members, the $19.95 Premier Unlimited Plan offers the best value. You get
unlimited access to the Internet and e-mail.

To find out which alternate price plans are available to you as an MSN member, go
to the member accounts page and click the Change Plan option to see which plan
you currently have as well as the other options available or call (800)
386-5550.

Access?

the software. To do this, either visit http://explorer.msn.com/ or call

appear, listing the MSN version installed on your computer.

Other Than My Modem?
