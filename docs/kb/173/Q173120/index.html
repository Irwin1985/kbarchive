IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Systems Management Server to remote control a Windows NT client
computer in a routed environment, the remote control session may fail if the
router(s) drop too many of the packets.

Therefore, the stability of a remote control session is directly related to the
stability and performance of the network environment in which it is being used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server remote control uses IP Sockets as the default
transport method for Windows NT client computers. More specifically, the remote
control session relies on a stream of UDP frames (packets) between the client
and administrator console.

Because UDP frames are not guaranteed delivery (which is inherent to the TCP/IP
protocol suite), a busy router may drop UDP frames in favor of higher priority
traffic such as TCP frames. You can use Network Monitor to see ICMP frames from
the router indicating that the router is too busy to process the packet (for
example, ICMP Source Quench messages or ICMP Redirect messages and so forth). If
the router is a black hole router, (no notification that it is dropping packets)
you will not see any ICMP messages returned.

If too many frames in a remote control session are lost, the session will
terminate without warning.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use a NetBIOS session for remote control rather than using IP sockets to work
around this problem. Even though it is much more reliable, it may prove to be
slower in some environments.

To test a remote control session over a NetBIOS session or Lana such as NetBT,
(NetBIOS encapsulated in TCP/IP) perform the following steps:

I. View the Lana numbers defined on the client computer running Windows NT.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. On the Services tab, select NetBIOS Interface, and then click Properties.

  From the list of defined Lana numbers, you may see something like "NetBT -&gt;
  El90x -&gt; El90x1" defined for Lana 0. This can be interpreted as NetBIOS
  encapsulated in TCP/IP over the Ethernet adapter. This is normally the most
  desirable choice for a remote control session. As long as a name resolution
  method (such as WINS) is being used in the network environment, this is a
  reliable choice.

        NetBT   = NetBIOS encapsulated in TCP/IP
        NwlnkNB = NetBIOS encapsulated in IPX
        NBF     = NetBIOS encapsulated in NetBEUI

  For systems that use a dial-up connection as well, you may see other Lana
  numbers similar to "NetBT -&gt; NdisWan4".

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

II. Configure the Remote Control agent to listen on a specific Lana number.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and find the following registry key:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client Services
        \Remote Control\Parameters

2. Change the "CommandLine" value from "-IP" (IP Sockets) to "-L0" (Lana 0). To
  permanently override the site-wide setting, set the "Override Site
  CommandLine" value under the Remote Control key to a value of "1" as well.
  This ensures that the CommandLine value is not overwritten if the Systems
  Management Server client components are ever upgraded.

If NetBT proves to be a reliable and functional alternative to IP sockets in your
environment, the site-wide setting for Windows NT Server Remote Control can be
changed via the Systems Management Server Administrator utility. To change the
setting, start the Administrator utility and use the following steps:

1. In the Site Properties window, click Clients, and then select Proposed
  Properties.

2. Click Options.

3. Click the "NetBIOS Lana Number" option button and enter the Lana number you
  want. This will most often be a zero.

4. Click OK until you have closed the Site Properties window.

After the site property changes have taken effect, each Systems Management Server
client running Windows NT will need to run Upgrade.bat from the SMS_SHR share of
a Systems Management Server logon server to be configured to use the new remote
control setting.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
