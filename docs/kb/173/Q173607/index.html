-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Windows 95 Dial-up Networking to access a remote network
via a RAS member server that has been configured to use only the IPX/SPX
protocol, you may receive the following error message when the remote Windows NT
domain controller attempts to send back a logon response through the RAS member
server:

  There is no domain controller available

After receiving the error message, the dial-up client may still have access to
the remote network (without authentication), and may be able to access some
resources on the domain.

CAUSE
=====

The RAS member server cannot authenticate logon attempts, so it forwards the
NetBIOS broadcast (type 20 packets) to the domain controller on the local area
network (LAN). The domain controller tries to respond with a type 20 broadcast
back through the RAS gateway to the client. By default, the RAS member server
will not forward type 20 Packets (14h) back to the client unless two-way
broadcasting of type 20 packets (NetBIOS over IPX) is enabled on the RAS member
server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable two-way broadcasting of NetBIOS over IPX through a RAS gateway, change
the data value in the registry on the RAS server.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys and Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), then locate the following registry
  subkey in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

  \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NwlnkRip\Parameters

2. Select the value NetBiosRouting.

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD.

4. If the system has one network adapter, change the data value from 2 to 6. Or,
  if the system has multiple network adapters and you are already forwarding
  between LANs, change the data value from 3 to 7.

  This is a 3-bit FLAG field set depending on whether you have multiple network
  adapters and/or RAS. The following is a list of the data values you can use
  for NetBiosRouting:

   - 0 = Do not forward broadcasts. (This is the default, to reduce network
     traffic.)

   - 1 = Forward NetBIOS packets from the LAN to LAN.

   - 2 = Forward NetBIOS packets from the remote client to the LAN (WAN to
     LAN).

   - 4 = Forward NetBIOS packets from the LAN to the remote client (LAN to
     WAN).

  Additionaly, you can set multiple flags simultaneously (that is, 3, 6 or 7).
  This can enable NetBIOS packets being forwarded both ways between remote
  clients and the LAN (LAN to WAN and WAN to LAN) and between LANs if 7 is
  selected.


5. Click OK, and then quit Registry Editor.

6. Shut down and restart Windows NT Server.

NOTE: Forwarding 14h packets significantly increases network and RAS traffic. It
is more efficient to enable the NetBEUI protocol over the RAS connection (RAS
Server + PDC) than to enable two-way broadcasting of type 20 (14h) packets.
