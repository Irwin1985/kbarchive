SYMPTOMS
========

When you are working on a Developer Studio project (DSP) that is source code
controlled (SCC), the SCC project has been branched, and you are working on the
branched version of the DSP, the following occurs:

1. SCC operations such as Check In and Check Out are carried out in the
  original, not the branched, project.

2. The working folder for the original SCC project is reset to the working
  folder of the branched project.

CAUSE
=====

1. The .DSP (Developer Studio Project) and .DSW (Developer Studio Workspace)
  files contain a reference to the SCC project that they were initially added
  to. When those files were branched in the SCC application and then opened in
  Visual Studio, they still referenced the project they were added to, not the
  project they were branched into.

2. From the SCC standpoint the original project has been opened in a different
  folder (subdirectory), so the working folder setting is updated to point to
  the new location.

RESOLUTION
==========

The first resolution will work with any SCC provider that integrates with
DevStudio the second is specific to Visual SourceSafe.

NOTE: Both .DSP and .DSW files are automatically generated with warnings not to
edit them. At this time, however, this problem cannot be resolved without
editing them manually.

SYMPTOM 1

Resolution 1
------------

The resolution here assumes that you have also added the workspace file (DSW) to
source control. If this is not the case, ignore references to checking in and
checking out the .DSW, otherwise the resolution is identical.

1. Check In or Undo Check Out of all checked out files, and then close Developer
  Studio.

2. From the SCC branched project, recursively Get all the files into their
  working directories. Do this in the SCC application itself (such as the
  Visual SourceSafe Explorer), not Developer Studio.

3. Check Out the .DSW and all .DSP files from the branched workspace. As in step
  2, do this in the SCC application.

4. Edit the .DSP file(s), and remove the following lines:

        # PROP Scc_ProjName ""$/&lt;project name&gt;", &lt;physical file name&gt;"
        # PROP Scc_LocalPath "."

5. In the .DSW, remove the lines:

        begin source code control
        end source code control

  and all lines between them.

6. Save and Check In the .DSW and .DSP(s).

7. Delete the &lt;workspace&gt;.OPT file from the working folder of the branched
  project.

8. Delete vssver.scc and mssccprj.scc also, if they exist.

9. Restart Visual Studio and open the local copy of the branched .DSW.

10. From the DevStudio IDE add the .DSW to source control, this time add it to
  the branched project.

  Answer Yes to the following message:

  A Microsoft Developer Studio project with the same name already exists in the
  selected source control project. Do you want to reconnect to the existing
  project?

11. From the DevStudio IDE, check out the .DSW.

12. For each project (.DSP) in the workspace choose Project, Add to Source
  Control, and then add the .DSP back to the corresponding branched SCC
  project. Answer Yes when prompted as in step 10. Also, answer Yes when
  prompted to check out the .DSP file.

13. Check In the .DSW and all .DSP files.

Resolution 2 (Visual SourceSafe specific)
-----------------------------------------

1. Check In or Undo Check Out of all checked out files, and then close Developer
  Studio.

2. Check Out the .DSW and all .DSP (if there are multiple projects in the
  workspace) files from the branched project. Do this in the Visual SourceSafe
  Explorer.

3. Find the physical file names for the branched project(s) by using the SS
  Physical command. Make note of these file names. For additional information
  on finding physical file names, please see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q131447 HOWTO: Use PHYSICAL Command to Find SourceSafe Database File

4. Edit the .DSP files. Look for all of the lines that look like:

        # PROP Scc_ProjName ""$/&lt;project name&gt;", &lt;physical file name&gt;"

  Change the project name and the physical file name to match the branched
  project and its physical file name.

5. Edit the .DSW file. Look for all of the lines that look like:

        "$/&lt;project name&gt;", &lt;physical file name&gt;

  There will be one line for each .DSP in the workspace, and an additional line
  under the "Global:" section if the .DSW itself is source controlled. As in
  step 4, change the project name and the physical file name to match the
  branched project and its physical file name.

6. Save and Check In the .DSW and .DSP(s).

7. Delete the &lt;workspace&gt;.OPT file from the working folder of the branched
  project.

8. Delete the vssver.scc and mssccprj.scc, if they exist.

9. Open the either the local or the Visual SourceSafe copy of the project.

SYMPTOM 2:

Resolution
----------

1. Open the original project by clicking File, Open Workspace, Source Control in
  the DevStudio IDE. Select the original SCC project.

2. The "Create local project.." dialog box appears. In the "Create a new project
  in the folder:" field you will see the working folder of the branched
  project. Change this to the working folder of the original project. Click OK
  to exit this dialog box.

3. In the Open Workspace dialog box, click Open to reset the working folder to
  the correct location.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To reproduce the following steps, the Developer Studio project that you use must
be SCC controlled.

1. In the SCC application, branch the original project into a new project.

2. In Developer Studio, enlist in the branched SCC project by clicking File,
  Open Workspace, Source Control in Developer Studio, and selecting the
  branched SCC project.

3. Check Out a file in Developer Studio. Note that in the SCC application, the
  checked out file is in the original, not the branched project. After closing
  the Developer Studio workspace, the working folder for the original SCC
  project is located in the branched project.
