-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a file, you receive the following error message:

  Sorry, the file cannot be opened because part of the file is missing.

This error may occur when accessing files that were directly saved on removable
media.


CAUSE
=====

This error may result from any of the following conditions:

- Improperly handling the disk while working with the presentation. For
  example, you removed the disk, such as a floppy disk, Zip disk, Jazz disk, or
  Bernouli disk, from the drive or you exchanged the disk with another disk
  while the presentation was open.

- A network interruption, such as a lost connection, occurred while saving,
  closing, or working in a file that you opened from a network drive.

- A power outage, spike, or brownout occurred while PowerPoint was attempting
  to access the disk.

- A virus scanner or other disk utility locked the disk while the file was
  opened in PowerPoint.

- You have a damaged disk or the disk drive is not functioning properly.

- The presentation was too large to fit on the disk. Hence, only part of the
  presentation was saved.

WORKAROUND
==========

In most cases, this error message indicates that the file you are attempting to
open is damaged and you will not be able to recover the file. However, in some
cases you may be able to recover the file using one of the following methods.

Method 1: Open the File on a Different Computer
-----------------------------------------------

Attempt to open the file on another computer that is running the same version of
PowerPoint. Or, if you have a Macintosh computer on which you installed
PowerPoint version 4.0, attempt to open the file on that computer. You must have
the PowerPoint 95 converter for PowerPoint 4.0 for the Macintosh. Currently
there is no converter available for PowerPoint 97 files.

Method 2: Run ScanDisk
----------------------

Run ScanDisk to determine if the file has become cross-linked with other files or
folders and repair any errors.

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then
  click ScanDisk.

  NOTE: If ScanDisk does not appear on the submenu, it may not be installed.
  Rerun Windows Setup in maintenance mode to install ScanDisk.

2. Select the drive you want to check and click Start.

Method 3: Open the File Using a Different Method
------------------------------------------------

Open the file using one of the following methods:

- In Windows Explorer, double-click the file.

- Start PowerPoint. Drag the file from Windows Explorer to PowerPoint.

- In PowerPoint, click Slide From File on the Insert menu.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Keep the following in mind when you work with files that are stored on removable
media:

- Do not remove the disk from the drive when the file is open in PowerPoint.

- Make sure the disk has enough free space to store your presentation.

- If the computer's power supply is unreliable, repair or replace the power
  supply or purchase an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

- Copy the file to the hard disk, make the changes you want, save the file, and
  then copy the file to the removable media or network drive.
