-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Graphics Blaster 3D video card, when you start Microsoft Word 97,
Word may stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when you install any of the following video drivers that
ship with Graphics Blaster 3D Installation CD (DISK.ID - G334-CDSTD-2- US):

  File name        Version
  ----------------------------------
  Ma33xw95.drv     4.03.00.2101-1.04
  Ma33xw95.vxd     4.03.00.2101-1.04
  Ma33xdd.dll      4.03.00.2101-1.04

To determine what version of the video driver you have, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

3. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the Display Adapters icon.

4. Double-click the Graphics Blaster 3D icon.

5. Click the Driver tab.

6. Click Driver File Details. Under Driver Files, click to select the file name
  of the driver, and verify the version number under File Version.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Use a Different Animated Cursor
-----------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Mouse icon.

3. On the Pointers tab, select a different pointer or scheme.

4. Click OK.

If this method does not work, install Microsoft Plus! or load a Microsoft Plus!
theme that ships with its own set of cursors.

Method 2: Decrease the Graphics Hardware Acceleration
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In the Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Choose a Hardware Acceleration setting with less acceleration. Note that the
  Hardware Acceleration slider has four settings: Full, Most, Basic, and None.
  Each of these settings is described below, in order of decreasing
  acceleration.

   - Full:

     This is the default setting, which allows for full hardware acceleration.

   - Most:

     The Most setting applies to Western Digital (WD) or S3-compatible drivers.
     If you have problems with the way the mouse pointer appears on the screen,
     try the Most setting.

     This setting adds SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini
     file, which turns off the hardware cursor.

     NOTE: This setting is similar to using the /Y switch with some versions of
     the MS-DOS-level Microsoft Mouse driver.

   - Basic:

     The Basic setting applies to S3-compatible video drivers. If your computer
     seems to stop responding randomly, try the Basic setting.

     This setting makes the following changes to your Win.ini and System.ini
     files:

      - Adds SafeMode=1 to the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file, which
        allows for basic acceleration only, for example, pattern bit block
        transfer (bitblt) and screen-to-screen bitblt.

      - Adds MMIO=0 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file, which
        turns off memory-mapped input/output (I/O) for S3- compatible drivers.

      - Adds SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file, which
        turns off the hardware cursor.

   - None:

     The None setting applies to S3-compatible video drivers. If your computer
     seems to stop responding randomly, and the Basic setting does not resolve
     the problem, try the None setting.

     This setting makes the following changes to your Win.ini and System.ini
     files:

      - Adds SafeMode=2 to the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file, which
        turns off all video card acceleration. For example, the graphics device
        interface (GDI) calls the device-independent bitmap (DIB) engine
        directly for screen drawing, rather than using the display driver.

      - Adds MMIO=0 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file, which
        turns off memory-mapped I/O for S3-compatible drivers.

      - Adds SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file, which
        turns off the hardware cursor.

STATUS
