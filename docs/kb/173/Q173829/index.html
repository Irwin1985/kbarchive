MORE INFORMATION
================

Online Book: Some Entries In List Return Error Message
------------------------------------------------------

If you attempt to choose any term from "emulsion laser storage" to "erasable
programmable read-only memory" in the list of terms in the left pane of the
online book, you will receive the following error message:

  Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site E:\book\sample2.htm.
  The system cannot find the file specified.

WORKAROUND
==========

Choose "emulator" and scroll down in the right pane until you locate the
definition that you are looking for. Alternatively, choose "erasable storage"
and scroll up in the right pane until you locate the definition that you are
looking for.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the online version of the
"Microsoft Press Computer Dictionary, Third Edition."


Online Book: Keyword search malfunctions
----------------------------------------

The keyword search on the electronic version of the Computer Dictionary does not
function properly. If you type a keyword in the text box you may receive the
following error message:

  The word you have typed is not in the index. Type another word or select one
  from the list.

In order to access the definitions, the keyword must be selected from the list in
the left hand panel rather than typed in the keyword text box. You can then
click the display button and the definition will appear in the right panel.


Defragmentation Definition Contains Error
-----------------------------------------

On page 138, the definition for "defragmentation" states, in part:

  Windows 95 and Windows NT include defragmentation utilities (or defraggers)
  as part of the operating system.

However, Windows NT does not include a defragmentation utility.

Correction:
Page 138: "defragmentation," sentence 4:
Change: "Windows 95 and Windows NT include..."
To: "Windows 95 includes..."

Page 138: "defragmentation," sentence 5:
Change: "For the MAC OS, Windows 3.x, and DOS systems..."
To: "For the Mac OS, Windows NT, Windows 3.x, and DOS systems..."


PC/XT Definition Inaccurate
---------------------------

Page 358: The PC/XT definition incorrectly states that the XT was the original
IBM Personal Computer.

Correction:
PC/XT \P'C-X-T'\ n. The second generation of the original IBM PC. The IBM PC/XT
computer was introduced in 1983 and was the first of the PC computers to support
hard disks.


Page 424: SDK Definition Incorrect
----------------------------------

Page 424, entry "SDK":
Change: "Acronym for software developer's kit."
To: "Acronym for software development kit."


SMB: Server Message Block protocol not included
-----------------------------------------------

The network protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is missing from the online and
printed version of the dictionary.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
