WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Save Your Document in a Different Format

2. On the File menu, click Save As and save your document in a format other than
  the "Word 6.0/95 (*.doc)" format.

Document. To do this, click Save As on the File menu, and click Word Document in
the Save As Type box.

To open the Word 97 document in Microsoft Word 6.0 or Microsoft Word for Windows
95 version 7.0, install the Word 97 converter.

  document.

2. Right-click the linked picture, and then click Format Picture on the shortcut
  menu.

3. Click the Position tab.

4. Click to select the Float Over Text check box, and then click OK.

7. On the File menu, click Open, and reopen your document. The linked pictures
  are now displayed.

Knowledge Base:

  Q161692 WD97: Problems With Float Over Text Objects

  Q157465 WD97: Can't See Field Codes for Some Objects

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Microsoft Word 97 for Windows. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert a picture in a Word document, if you select the Link To File
check box and clear the Save With Document and Float Over Text check boxes, Word
does not save any information about the picture, such as size and preview
information. Instead, information about the picture comes from its source file.
The location of the linked picture is stored in the IncludePicture field, and
the path to the picture can be seen by pressing ALT+F9 to show the field codes.

When you save a Word 97 document containing a linked picture as "Word 6.0/95
(*.doc)" format, the Word 6.0/95 converter does not correctly save the preview
information for the picture. Therefore, when you close and reopen the Word
6.0/95 document in Word 97 (or open in Word 6 / 95), the linked picture appears
to be missing.

Also when you update the IncludePicture field(s) the picture will revert back to
the original size of the source file.
