MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 3: Exit Loop Should Be Exit Do
-----------------------------------

Page 3, paragraph 3, sentence 5:

Change:
"The Exit Loop statement allows..."

To:
"The Exit Do statement allows..." (without the quotation marks)


Page 173: Typographical Error
-----------------------------

Page 173, paragraph 1, sentence 2:

Change:
"hold your piece."

To:
"hold your peace." (without the quotation marks)


Page 273: Typographical Error
-----------------------------

Page 273, code sample 3:

Change:

    CopyMemory LoWord4, dw 2

To:

    CopyMemory LoWord4, dw, 2


Page 279: IsArrayEmpty Function Code Incorrect
----------------------------------------------

The IsArrayEmpty function mentioned at the bottom of page 279 is coded
incorrectly in UTILITY.BAS and UTILITY.CLS. The function fails when used on an
array in which the first item is an object. The following version (provided by
reader Torsten Rendelmann) fixes the problem:

  Function IsArrayEmpty(va As Variant) As Boolean
      Dim f As Boolean
      On Error Resume Next
      f = IsObject(va(LBound(va)))
      IsArrayEmpty = (Err &lt;&gt; 0)
  End Function


Page 610: "VBCore" Should Read "VisualCore"
-------------------------------------------

In the last line of the paragraph before the heading "A Form Wrapped by a Class,"
the last three words, "...the VBCore component" should be changed to "the
VisualCore component."


Page 680: Typographical Error
-----------------------------

Page 680, paragraph 4, sentence 2:

Change:
"from new Visual Basic features such native code"

To:
"from new Visual Basic features such as native code" (without the quotation
marks)


Page 692: ListItemFromLinePosition Code Incorrect
-------------------------------------------------

The ListItemFromLinePosition function shown on page 692 is incorrect. The correct
code is:

  Function ListItemFromLinePosition(lvw As ListView, _
                                    ByVal y As Single) As ListItem
      Dim rc As RECT, i As Integer, c As Long, dy As Long
      c = lvw.ListItems.Count
      If c = 0 Then Exit Function
      ' Get the height of a single item
      rc.Left = LVIR_BOUNDS
      SendMessage lvw.hWnd, LVM_GETITEMRECT, ByVal 0&amp;, rc
      dy = rc.bottom - rc.Top
      ' Calculate the index of the item under the mouse pointer
      i = lvw.GetFirstVisible.Index - 1 + _
          ((y \ Screen.TwipsPerPixelY) - (dy / 2)) / dy
      ' Return the item (if any)
      If i &gt; 0 And i &lt;= c Then
          Set ListItemFromLinePosition = lvw.ListItems(i)
      End If
  End Function

The code that calls this function later on the page should be adjusted
accordingly:

  ' Determine if user double clicked anywhere on the line
  Set item = ListItemFromLinePosition(lvw, yList)


CD-ROM: error in Windows API Type Library for GetCursorPos
----------------------------------------------------------

The CD-ROM installs the Windows API Type Library. Win.Tlb is included in the API
Type and contains an incorrect declaration for GetCursorPos.

Change:

  GetCursorPos(lpPoint AS Long)

To:

  GetCursorPos(lpPoint AS POINTAPI)


ToRelease.bat, ToDebug.bat, and UnRegisterAll.bat Don't Work
------------------------------------------------------------

ToRelease.bat, ToDebug.bat, and UnRegisterAll.bat all require a program called
Regsvr32.exe. The batch files expect this program to be located in a subfolder
of the Hardcore Visual Basic folder, called Tools.

However, in the first printing of "Hardcore Visual Basic, Second Edition," the
setup program does not create a Tools folder and then copy Regsvr32.exe to it.
Consequently, the ToDebug, ToRelease, and UnRegisterAll batch files do not work
correctly.

Follow these steps to fix this problem:

1. Create a Tools folder in the folder to which you installed the Hardcore
  Visual Basic files.

2. Copy Regsvr32.exe from the CD-ROM to the new Tools folder.


Missing VisiCore.rc File
------------------------

The VisiCore.rc file is not included with the first printing of the companion
CD-ROM.

The self-extracting file, Hardvb2a.exe, distributed by Microsoft Press, contains
the VisiCore.rc file as well as instructions for installing this file to your
Hardcore Visual Basic folder.

For directions on downloading the Hardvb2a.exe patch file, please see the "How to
Download the Hardvb2a.exe Patch File" section.


CPalette Errors Don't Work Correctly
------------------------------------

The CPalette error IDs in VBCORE.RC don't match the corresponding error constants
in CPalette's error enumeration.

This error has also been corrected in the self-extracting file, Hardvb2a.exe.


How to Download the Hardvb2a.exe Patch File
-------------------------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  HARDVB2A.EXE
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/mspress/2.0/WIN98/EN-US/HARDVB2A.EXE)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


The following installation instructions are copied from the Readme.txt file
included in Hardvb2a.exe.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

1. Download Hardvb2a.exe into your Hardcore Visual Basic folder.

  If your software is not capable of downloading the file into a particular
  folder, download the file and copy or move it to your Hardcore Visual Basic
  folder.

2. Double-click (or run) Hardvb2a.exe to extract the necessary files.

3. If you are asked to confirm the replacement of files, please press Y to
  confirm the file replacement.

4. Delete Hardvb2a.exe.

LoadAnyResPicture Fails in VBCore.dll
-------------------------------------

The LoadAnyResPicture function described on page 469 does not work when used from
the VBCore DLL component.

CAUSE
=====

When you call from your application to LoadAnyResPicture in VBCore, the function
looks for your resource in the DLL rather than in the calling application. Since
your resource is not in VBCore.dll, you will receive an error message.

The List Files of Type combo box is not set to display .GIF and .JPG files by
default. Also, the UpdateFile subroutine of Browse.vbp attempts to open .GIF and
.JPG files using the LoadImage API rather than Visual Basic's LoadPicture.
However, LoadImage does not handle .JPG and .GIF files.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you use LoadAnyResPicture by including the PicTool.Bas module (from the
LocalModule directory) in your project, the function will be in your application
and everything will work fine. You can also cut and paste the function into your
own code as long as the functions and constants it uses are available.


Duplicate Files in Hardcore2 Directory
--------------------------------------

Some standard module versions of source modules are incorrectly duplicated in two
different directories on the book CD.

UTILITY.BAS and several other files are duplicated in two directories, Hardcore2
and LocalModule. Delete the following duplicated files from the Hardcore2
directory, while keeping the versions in the LocalModule directory:

Bytes.bas
ComDlg.bas
Draw.bas
GDITool.bas
ModTool.bas
Parse.bas
ProcTool.bas
Random.bas
Utility.bas
WinTool.bas

If you want to reuse procedures in the Utility module through the VBCore
component, use the class version UTILITY.CLS, which is located in the Hardcore2
directory. This is recommended in most cases. If you want to reuse the
procedures directly through the source module, use the standard utility
UTILITY.BAS, which is located in the Hardcore2\LocalModules directory. See
chapter five for further description of these choices.


XEditor Control Properties Require Twips as ScaleMode
-----------------------------------------------------

Some properties of the XEditor control, such as SelTabs and RightMargin, require
the control container to use Twips as its ScaleMode. If the container sets its
ScaleMode to another mode such as Pixels, setting these properties may have
unexpected results.

To work around this problem, convert values to Twips before assigning them to
these properties.

You can avoid this problem in your own controls by checking the
Container.Scalemode and making appropriate adjustments in the control.


ERROR Constant in Win.tlb Conflicts With VB Error Function
----------------------------------------------------------

The Windows API Type Library (Win.tlb and Winu.tlb) contains a constant ERROR
that conflicts with the Visual Basic Error function. Therefore, you cannot use
the Error function without qualification when the type library is loaded.

To resolve the conflict, qualify the Error function or constant with the
appropriate library name, as in the following example:

    Dim s As String, i As Long
    s = VBA.Error (4)   ' Use Visual Basic function
    i = Win.Error       ' Use type library constant


Error in RegTool Class
----------------------

In the CreateRegValue function of RegTool.cls:
Change code to appear as follows:

  &lt;...&gt;
    Case vbArray + vbByte
      Dim ab() As Byte
      ab = vValueA
      ordType = REG_BINARY
      c = UBound(ab) - LBound(ab) + 1  ' &lt;-- This line updated

  &lt;...&gt;


Browse.vbp Does Not Display .JPG or .GIF Files Properly
-------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The List Files of Type combo box in Browse.vbp does not show .GIF and .JPG files
by default. If you select a .GIF or a .JPG file manually, the picture will not
display.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change line 10 in the Form_Load subroutine in Browse.frm to:

    nsPicType.Add "*.bmp;*.dib;*.gif;*.jpg;*.ico;*.wmf;*.cur;*.wav"

Change lines 278-283 in the UpdateFile subroutine in Browse.frm as follows:

    Dim hBmp As Long, hPal As Long
    If sExt = ".GIF" Or sExt = ".JPG" Then
      Set imgPic = LoadPicture(sFile)
    Else
      hBmp = LoadImage(App.hInstance, sFile, IMAGE_BITMAP, 0, 0, _
                 LR_LOADFROMFILE Or LR_CREATEDIBSECTION)
      hPal = GetBitmapPalette(hBmp)
      Set imgPic = BitmapToPicture(hBmp, hPal)
    End If

Delete lines 275-277:

    If 0 Then
    Set imgPic = LoadPicture(sFile)
    Else \*


GModTool.cls Function CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Memory Leak
----------------------------------------------------------

There are several functions in GModTool.cls which call the Windows API function
CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(). This function allocates memory which must be
released or the memory remains allocated to the calling program. This can create
a serious memory leak.

To destroy the snapshot, use the CloseHandle() function.
