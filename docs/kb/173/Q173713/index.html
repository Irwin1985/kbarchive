-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A Custom Recipient (CR) receives a message that includes Rich Text Format (RTF)
information. This occurs even if Allow Rich Text Format is not selected in the
Advanced tab of Properties for the CR. If the original message sent contained an
attachment, the attachment may be received by non-Microsoft mail clients as an
unreadable RTF attachment.

CAUSE
=====

While expanding Distribution Lists and processing alternate recipients, the
Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) did not preserve the CR property
indicating whether it should receive RTF.

WORKAROUND
==========

In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, change the Send Microsoft
Exchange Rich Text Formatting option to "NEVER" (without the quotation marks) in
the Interoperability dialog box of the IMC Internet Mail property page (use the
Specify Message Content by E-Mail Domain option if you want to restrict this
option to individual domains).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

What the non-Microsoft client actually receives depends on:

- The Client software being used

  -and-

- The settings in Properties for IMS/Internet Mail.

Various clients will see inconsistent (in other words, this can vary when using
the same client) results in their mail. If IMS/Internet Mail is set to MIME, a
separate attachment is received at the client. If IMS/Internet Mail is set to
UUENCODE, the attachment file may merge with the mail message body.

the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Upon inspection, it can be seen that these messages correspond to messages sent
to a distribution list in which the CR is a member, or as a result of the CR
being defined as an alternate recipient for a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox.
