- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When a Microsoft Exchange user logs on to Exchange Server through the Microsoft
Internet Explorer, the Active Server page does not bring up the dialog box to
enable the user to enter the domain name, user name, and password. The user may
also get one of the following error messages:

  Failed to get Inbox

  -or-

  Error: Access is denied

Verification
------------

1. Confirm that the mailbox name does not include any spaces. If the name of the
  mailbox includes a space, then rename all of the mailboxes by removing the
  spaces. For more information, refer to the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q166994 XWEB: Spaces in Alias Name Cause "Failed to get Inbox."

2. Confirm that the user is trying to log on to the same Exchange Server
  computer that the user is created as a user on. If the user is trying to log
  on to an Exchange Server computer other than the user's home server, be sure
  to allow enough time for the user's mailbox to replicate to the server that
  the user is trying to log on to.

  For more information, refer to the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q165661 XWEB: Error Message: Failed to Get Inbox.

3. Verify that the user can log on to Exchange Server through Internet Explorer
  on the same computer where the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) is
  located. If the user is not able to log on from the IIS computer, check for
  an issue in the user's account or password.

  To verify that the Windows NT account is valid, from the IIS server, use
  Internet Explorer to log on to the Exchange Server computer with Outlook Web
  Access (OWA). If the user can log on from the IIS computer but not remotely
  through the Active Server, then give the user and all other users the
  advanced Windows NT access right of Log on Locally. To do this, go to User
  Manager for Domains. From the menu, select Policies, and then User Rights. In
  the User Rights dialog box, select from the drop-down menu Log On Locally.
  Add the desired group of users to the Grant To dialog box.

4. If the dialog box asking for the user name and password is displayed, but you
  are still getting the errors shown above, then modify the password
  authentication to both Allow Anonymous and Basic (Clear text). This can be
  done in the IIS \Internet Service Manager. Double-click on WWW service to
  open the properties. In the Password Authentication selection box, select
  both Allow Anonymous and Basic (Clear Text).

5. If the Exchange Server computer is on a Windows NT file system (NTFS)
  partition, then share the \webdata and \webtemp with the same names and give
  the group Everyone Full Control for Type of Access in the Permissions dialog
  box.

6. Attempt to log on to the Exchange Server Web Access logon page again,
  entering the name in the Log On dialog box as:

  DomainName\UserName

7. If all of the above procedures are not successful, try to log on with the
  same user credentials from IE located on another computer. If the same user
  is able to log on from another computer, then the password file of the user
  in the original computer may be corrupt. Delete the Username.pwl file in the
  original Windows 95 computer, log off, and log back on to the original
  Windows 95 computer. This will recreate this Username.pwl file and solve this
  issue.

  NOTE: If you are using a personal certificate, you should export it before
  renaming your .pwl file. If you do not do so, it may be unavailable when you
  send e-mail. For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q190296 Unable to Use Personal Certificates in Outlook Express

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above errors may also be reported if two users from two different Windows NT
domains have the same name. A local user account (from domain A) exists on the
computer used for remote access of the Exchange Server computer, and a remote
user account (from domain B) exists on the Exchange Server that is accessed
remotely. Credentials for the two accounts will not match, because they are from
different domains, with different passwords, even though the user name is the
same. This situation may occur after joining two sites and can be verified by
attempting to log on using a different computer (step # 7 above).

As a final resort, you may need to perform the following steps:

1. Uninstall Outlook Web Access Component.

2. Uninstall the Option Pack.

3. Reinstall the Option Pack.

4. Apply SP4 or later to the Windows NT server.

5. Reinstall OWA.
