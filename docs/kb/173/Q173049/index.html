-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the Microsoft Visual Basic Application Setup Wizard, a dialog
titled "Locate Kernel," "Locate User," "Locate GDI," etc., is displayed after
you click the Next button on the "Setup Wizard - Select Project and Options"
form.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual Basic Application Setup Wizard scans a project's files for Declare
statements to determine if any additional dependency files need to be
distributed. If any such files are found, the user is prompted for the location
of the files with the "Locate" dialog.

If any declarations for 16-bit DLLs are found in the project's files, the user is
prompted for the location. For example, if the following 16-bit declaration
appears in the project:

     Declare Function GetWindowsDirectory Lib "Kernel" _
        (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Integer) As Integer

Setup Wizard will prompt the user for the location of the Kernel DLL with the
"Locate" dialog.

This is a very common problem with applications converted from 16-bit Visual
Basic to Visual Basic 5.0, which is 32-bit, or with Visual Basic 4.0
applications that use conditional compilations that have been converted to
Visual Basic 5.0. Setup Wizard does not take into consideration the compiler
directives when looking for Declare statements resulting, for example, in a
"Locate Kernel" dialog for the sample code below:

     #If Win32 Then
        Declare Function GetWindowsDirectory Lib "Kernel32" _
           Alias "GetWindowsDirectoryA" _
           (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long
     #Else
        Declare Function GetWindowsDirectory Lib "Kernel" _
           (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Integer) As Integer
     #End If

RESOLUTION
==========

Convert all 16-bit declarations to their 32-bit equivalents and recompile the
project, or, if conditional compilation was used to select between pairs of
16-bit and 32-bit declarations, the conditional compilation statements and
16-bit declarations can be commented out or removed and the project recompiled.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic.

2. Add a new module (Module1) to the project.

3. In the General Declarations section of Module1, add following code:

        Declare Function GetWindowsDirectory Lib "Kernel" _
           (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Integer) As Integer

4. Save the project, compile it, and then exit Visual Basic.

5. Start the Visual Basic Application Setup Wizard and proceed to the form
  entitled "Setup Wizard - Select Project and Options," click the Browse
  button, and select the project you compiled.

6. Click the Next button. A locate file common dialog box entitled "Locate
  Kernel" is displayed.
