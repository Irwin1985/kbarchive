SYMPTOMS
========

When calling an Automation server that passes your client application RDO
objects, the RDOErrors collection never contains error information if the server
is compiled as an ActiveX Automation EXE. RDOErrors collection will contain
error information if the server is compiled as an ActiveX Automation DLL.

CAUSE
=====

You are obtaining the RDOErrors collection from your application's RDOEngine
object rather than from the server method,

RESOLUTION
==========

Provide a method or property on the server object from which to retrieve the
RDOErrors collection.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you compile a server component as a DLL, it has access to the same global
objects that the client does. Because of this, you can inadvertently engage in
practices that break object design principles. When you compile the server to an
ActiveX Automation EXE, it now has its own global objects that are separate from
the client application and object encapsulation cannot be violated.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Create the server:

1. Create a new project with a MultiUse class module (named MyConnect) with the
  following code:

        Public Function Connect () As rdoConnection
          Set Connect = rdoEngine(0).OpenConnection("MyDSN",
                        rdDriverComplete, "uid=sa;pwd=;database=pubs")
        End Function

        Public Function Errors () As Variant
          Set Errors = rdoErrors
        End Function

2. Add a module with the following code:

        Sub Main ()
        End Sub

3. Remove the default form.

4. Add a reference to Microsoft Remote Data Object.

5. Set Sub Main to be the Project Startup Form.

6. In the Project Options dialog, in the Compatibility tab, set Version
  Compatibility to No Compatibility. This will enable steps 7 and 8 to generate
  distinct server GUIDs for the EXE and DLL servers.

7. Change the project type to ActiveX DLL, name to DLLConnect, compile to a DLL,
  and save.

8. Change the project type to ActiveX EXE, name to EXEConnect, compile to an
  EXE, and save.

Create the client:

1. Create a new project with a form and three CommandButtons.

2. Add a reference to Microsoft Remote Data Object, DLLConnect, and EXEConnect.
  You will have to add the last two by using the Browse feature of the
  References dialog.

3. Add the following code:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Dim Connector As DLLConnect.MyConnect
        Dim Conn As rdoConnection, rs As rdoResultset, E As rdoError
          rdoEngine.rdoErrors.Clear
          Set Connector = New DLLConnect.MyConnect
          Set Conn = Connector.Connect
          On Error Resume Next
          Set rs = Conn.OpenResultset("THIS IS BAD SQL")
          For Each E In rdoErrors
            MsgBox E.Description
          Next E
          Conn.Close
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command2_Click()
        Dim Connector As EXEConnect.MyConnect
        Dim Conn As rdoConnection
        Dim rs As rdoResultset
        Dim E As rdoError
          rdoEngine.rdoErrors.Clear ' required to prevent previous error
                                 ' from showing
          Set Connector = New EXEConnect.MyConnect
          Set Conn = Connector.Connect
          On Error Resume Next
          Set rs = Conn.OpenResultset("THIS IS BAD SQL")
          For Each E In rdoErrors
            MsgBox E.Description
          Next E
          Conn.Close
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command3_Click()
        Dim Connector As EXEConnect.MyConnect
        Dim Conn As rdoConnection
        Dim rs As rdoResultset
        Dim E As rdoError
        Dim Errors As Variant
          Set Connector = New EXEConnect.MyConnect
          Set Conn = Connector.Connect
          Set Errors = Connector.Errors
          Errors.Clear
          On Error Resume Next
          Set rs = Conn.OpenResultset("THIS IS BAD SQL")
          For Each E In Errors
            MsgBox E.Description
          Next E
          Conn.Close
        End Sub

4. Run the program and press each of the CommandButtons in turn.

  Command1 and Command2 both break object programming standards because they
  refer to the global rdoErrors collection. The code for Command1_Click works
  (displays errors) because it runs the server as an in-process component,
  whereas Command2 doesn't work because the server is an out-of-process
  component and uses a different instance of RDOEngine.

  Command3 works with an out-of-process component because it follows object
  design principles and gets the errors collection from the Connector object
  and not from the RDOEngine global object.

NOTE:

- This problem can also affect ActiveX components that share DAO objects or
  other classes that have global objects.

- This problem can also affect Visual Basic 4 and other 32-bit VBA products.
