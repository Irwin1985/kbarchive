The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Tracking logs are created when message tracking is enabled on a Microsoft
Exchange Server component. These logs can be read and edited by any text editor.
The logs are tab delimited and can be loaded into spreadsheet programs like
Microsoft Excel. You can also write an application to interpret message tracking
logs.

For a list of the tracking log events generated by Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q174078 XADM: Tracking Log Event Numbers for Exchange 4.0

The events 1010 thru 1018 were not available in previous versions of Microsoft
Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Message tracking must be enabled for a component to begin recording activity in
the tracking log. When you enable message tracking for any component, all
similar components on servers in that site write to the tracking log.

To Enable Message Tracking for the Information Store
----------------------------------------------------

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, double-click Information Store
  Site Configuration.

2. Click the General tab, and click to select the "Enable message tracking"
  check box.

To Enable Message Tracking for the MTA
--------------------------------------

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, double-click MTA Site
  Configuration.

2. Click the General tab, and click to select the "Enable message tracking"
  check box.

To Enable Message Tracking for the Internet Mail Connector
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Double-click on the Internet mail connector for this site.

2. Click the Internet Mail tab, and click to select the "Enable message
  tracking" check box.

Tracking logs are located in Exchsrvr\Tracking.log. Each daily log is named by
the date on which it was created in yyyymmdd.log format. The file name date,
like all time in the tracking log, is in Greenwich mean time.

The following table defines the event numbers in the tracking logs.
