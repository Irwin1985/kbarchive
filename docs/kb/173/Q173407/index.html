SUMMARY
=======

If a compiled client application attempts to reference an object contained in an
ActiveX DLL that is not currently or correctly registered on the machine, the
following run-time error appears:

  ActiveX component can't create object or return reference to this object
  (Error 429)

This error will not occur when testing in the Visual Basic IDE. In the
development environment Visual Basic will one of the following compile errors:

  User-defined type not defined

  Can't find project or library

This article details a method that can be used to ensure that your client
application correctly traps for and resolves error 429 at run-time if the
ActiveX DLL is present on the machine but not correctly registered.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below are steps for creating both an ActiveX DLL server and a client
application. The client application is designed to trap for error 429. If the
error occurs, the ActiveX server will be registered through code.

In this example, MyServerObject.DLL is the ActiveX server. MyClient.Exe is the
client application.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating MyServerObject.DLL
---------------------------------------------------------

1. In Visual Basic, create a new ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is created by
  default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Project1 Properties and change the Project Name
  property to MyServerObject.

3. Set the following properties for Class1:

     Property            Value
     ---------------------------------
     (Name)              MyObject
     Instancing          5 - MultiUse

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of MyObject
  class:

        Public MyProperty As String

5. Save the Project as MyServerObject.VBP and the MyObject class as
  MyObject.CLS.

6. Build the MyServerObject.DLL.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating MyClient.Exe
---------------------------------------------------

1. In Visual Basic, start a new standard EXE. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Project1 Properties. Change the Project Name to
  MyClient.

3. Select the Project\References menu item to bring up the References dialog
  box. Go down the Available References list and check MyServerObject.

4. Add a new module (Module1) to the project.

5. In Module1, add the following code to the General Declarations section:

        Public Declare Function RegMyServerObject Lib _
        "&lt;Path&gt;\MyServerObject.DLL" _
        Alias "DllRegisterServer" () As Long

  where &lt;Path&gt; is the full path to MyServerObject.Dll. The
  "DllRegisterServer" portion of the above declaration is case-sensitive. NOTE:
  For more information on this API function see Programmatic Registration at
  the end of this article.

6. Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1.

7. Add the following code to the Load event procedure of Form1:

        Private Sub Form_Load()
           On Error GoTo Err_DLL_Not_Registered
           Dim RegMyDLLAttempted As Boolean
           Dim MyObj As New MyServerObject.MyObject

           'The following statement will fail at run-time
           'if MyServerObject is not registered.
           MyObj.MyProperty = "Hello"
           Set MyObj = Nothing
           Exit Sub

           Err_DLL_Not_Registered:
           ' Check to see if error 429 occurs
           If Err.Number = 429 Then
              MsgBox "Attempting To Register MyServerObject"

              'RegMyDLLAttempted is used to determine whether an
              'attempt to register the ActiveX DLL has already been
              'attempted. This helps to avoid getting stuck in a loop if
              'the ActiveX DLL cannot be registered for some reason.
              If RegMyDLLAttempted Then
                 MsgBox "Unable to Register MyServerObject"
                 Resume Next
              Else
                 RegMyServerObject   'Declared in Module1
                 RegMyDLLAttempted = True
                 MsgBox "Registration of MyServerObject attempted."
                 Resume
              End If
           Else

  MsgBox "An Error Occurred"
           End If
        End Sub

8. Add the following code to the Click event procedure of Command1:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim MyObj As New MyObject
           MyObj.MyProperty = "Hello"
           MsgBox MyObj.MyProperty
        End Sub

9. Save the project and make the MyClient.Exe executable file.

10. Exit Visual Basic. Test MyClient.Exe by double-clicking on the file in
  Windows Explorer.

11. For testing purposes, unregister MyServerObject.Dll using RegSvr32.Exe. From
  the Start menu, choose Run, and in the Run dialog, type the following
  command:

  RegSvr32.Exe /U &lt;Path&gt;\MyServerObject.Dll

  where &lt;Path&gt; is the full path to MyServerObject.Dll.

12. Run the MyClient.Exe program again. This time you should be notified that
  registration of MyServerObject.dll is being attempted because it is not
  already registered.

As demonstrated with the example above, when working with your own client
application there are two basic tasks that must be accomplished. First, you need
to publicly declare the DllRegisterServer function:

     Public Declare Function RegMyServerObject Lib _
     "&lt;Path&gt;\MyServerObject.DLL" _
     Alias "DllRegisterServer" () As Long

Second, you need to trap for error 429 in the error handling routine of the Form1
Load event and attempt to recover from the error by calling the function
declaration for DllRegisterServer.

Programmatic Registration
-------------------------

All ActiveX DLLs created with Visual Basic export the DllRegisterServer and
DllUnregisterServer functions. These functions can be declared in a Visual Basic
client and called to self-register or unregister an ActiveX DLL. For example,
the following declaration could be used to declare a function which would
register the custom ActiveX DLL MyServerObject.DLL:

     Public Declare Function RegMyServerObject Lib _
     "MyServerObject.DLL" _
     Alias "DllRegisterServer" () As Long

In code, the "RegMyServerObject" could be called to register the DLL:

     Call RegMyServerObject
