SUMMARY
=======

Deleting the %SystemRoot%\Repair folder from a Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 Server or
Workstation installation produces the following problems:

- You cannot install a Windows NT Service Pack.

  When you run the Update program from the Windows NT service pack you receive
  the following error message:

  Service Pack Setup could not find the Setup.log file in your repair
  directory.

  The Update program will not continue.

- You cannot create an Emergency Repair Disk. When you run Rdisk to update and
  create an Emergency Repair Disk, it fails with the following error message:

  Repair Disk Utility could not copy all files to the Emergency Repair Disk.
  One or more files were not found.

  This error occurs after the update option has finished copying the following
  files to the newly created repair folder:

     Autoexec.nt
     Config.nt
     ntuser.da_ New user profile (V4.0 only)
     Software._ Software Registry hive
     System._   System Registry hive

The following files are missing from the repair folder and are necessary for a
good Emergency Repair Disk.

    Sam._      Sam Registry hive
    Security._ Security hive
    Default._  Default user profile
    SETUP.LOG file
