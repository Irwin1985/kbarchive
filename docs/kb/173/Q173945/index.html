SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the procedure for installing Microsoft Windows NT Server
4.0 Evaluation Edition, included with the Microsoft TCP/IP Training kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to install the Windows NT Server software on your
computer.

NOTE: These steps assume that you are using two computers on a LAN. If other
computers are present on the LAN as well, these steps may need to be modified to
avoid network conflicts. Your system may also require additional steps to
configure your network card or other hardware.


Create the Windows NT Server Setup Disks
----------------------------------------

These steps will create three Windows NT Server setup disks that you will then
use to install Windows NT Server to your system.

NOTE: It is possible to run Setup directly from the Windows NT Server CD-ROM
without first creating the setup disks. However, this could cause your system to
become unusable if the Windows NT Server installation process is interrupted.
Microsoft Press recommends that you do not run Setup directly from the CD-ROM.

1. Insert the Microsoft Windows NT Server Evaluation Edition compact disc into
  the CD-ROM drive.

  NOTE: A Microsoft Windows NT CD-ROM Autorun window may appear when you insert
  the compact disc. The Setup button in this window will run Setup directly
  from the Windows NT CD-ROM. Do not click the Setup button in this window.
  Instead, click the Close button to close this window.

2. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt or
  Command Prompt. Type the command for your operating system:

  MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows 95:

  " D:\i386\winnt /ox " (without the quotation marks)

  and then press ENTER.

  NOTE: Replace the "D" with the letter of your CD-ROM drive if necessary.

  Windows NT:

  " D:\i386\winnt32 /ox " (without the quotation marks)

  and then press ENTER.

  NOTE: Replace the "D" with the letter of your CD-ROM drive if necessary.

3. If the path to your compact disc does not already appear, type

  " D:\i386 " (without the quotation marks)

  and then click Continue.

  NOTE: Replace the "D" with the letter of your CD-ROM drive if necessary.

4. When prompted, label a blank disk as Windows NT Server Setup Disk #3, insert
  the disk into drive A, and then press ENTER.

5. When prompted, label a blank disk as Windows NT Server Setup Disk #2, insert
  the disk into drive A, and then press ENTER.

6. When prompted, label a blank disk as Windows NT Server Boot Disk, insert the
  disk into drive A, and then press ENTER.

7. Close the Command Prompt, and remove the CD-ROM from the CD-ROM drive.

8. With the Windows NT Server Setup Boot Disk in drive A, restart the computer.

To Install the Evaluation Copy of Windows NT Server
---------------------------------------------------

1. At the Welcome To Setup screen, press ENTER to install Windows NT Server.

2. Press ENTER and follow the directions on your screen to allow Setup to detect
  your disk controllers.

3. If asked if you are upgrading or installing a new version of Windows NT
  Server, type "N" (without the quotation marks) for new version.

4. Select a partition that has enough free disk space to install Windows NT
  Server.

5. Click "Leave Current File System Intact".

6. When prompted for a location to install Windows NT files, if you are
  installing the evaluation copy of Windows NT Server on the same computer as
  another version of Windows NT, type a different name (for example, \NTEval or
  \120Eval); otherwise, accept \Winnt.

7. Restart the computer when prompted to do so.

8. Type your name and your organization's name when prompted to do so.

9. When prompted for a CD-key, type "040" followed by "0048126" (without the
  quotation marks).

10. In the Per Server For box, type 10 for the maximum number of client access
  licenses provided with the evaluation copy of Windows NT Server.

11. If you are installing Windows NT Server onto your first computer, type
  Server1 as the name for your computer. If you are installing Windows NT
  Server on your second computer, type Server2.

12. If you are installing Windows NT Server on your first computer, click
  Primary Domain Controller. Click Backup Domain Controller if you are
  installing Windows NT Server on your second computer.

13. Type a password for the default Administrator account. Keep in mind that
  passwords are case sensitive.

14. If asked about the floating-point workaround, click "Do Not Enable The
  Floating-Point Workaround."

15. When asked about the Emergency Repair Disk, click "No, Do Not Create An
  Emergency Repair Disk."

  NOTE: You may want to create an Emergency Repair Disk for your computer, but
  it will not be used in the book.

16. Make sure that the default components to install are selected, and then
  click OK.

17. When asked how this computer should participate on the network, select
  "Wired To The Network."

18. Click the Microsoft Internet Information Server check box to clear it, and
  then click Next.

19. When asked about the Network Adapter, click Start Search. If Setup cannot
  detect the installed network adapter, click Select From List, and select
  your network adapter.

20. When asked about network protocols, accept TCP/IP Protocol and "NWLink
  IPX/SPX Compatible Transport."

21. When asked whether you want to use DHCP, click No.

22. For now, accept the default values for your network settings by clicking
  Next. You will change these settings in Lesson 1 of Chapter 2 in the "TCP/IP
  Training" text.

23. Accept the default values for your network bindings by clicking Next.

24. Type "Domain1" (without the quotation marks) as the name of your domain.

25. In the Date/Time Properties window, select your time zone and then click
  Close.

26. In the Display Properties window, set the color palette for 256 colors and
  the desktop area for 800 x 600 pixels.

27. Restart the computer when prompted to do so.

28. If you have not already done so, repeat steps 1-27 for your second computer.
