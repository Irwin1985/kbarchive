-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft 2000 version of this article, see Q288266.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Rich Text Format (RTF) document that has a template attached
that contains macros, Microsoft Word 97 does not prompt you with the macro
warning message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a template that contains macros is attached to a Rich
Text Format document and then opened. Microsoft Word trusts that the attached
template contains safe macros.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem described in this article, obtain and install the latest
Microsoft Word 97 update from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/Wd97mcrs.aspx

IMPORTANT: To use Wd97mcrs.exe, you must have already installed Office 97 Service
Release 2b (SR-2b). Otherwise, if you install the update now and then install
Office 97 SR-2b at a later date, you will have to reinstall this update. To find
out whether you have SR-2b installed, start an Office program and then click
About Microsoft &lt;program name&gt; on the Help menu. You should see Microsoft
&lt;program name&gt; 97 SR-2b as your version of the program.


WORKAROUND
==========

To temporarily work around this problem with a Rich Text Format document that
you suspect is attached to a template that contains macros, do one of the
following:

- Hold SHIFT when you open the Rich Text Format document.

  -or-

- In a new blank Word document, click File on the Insert menu, and then insert
  the Rich Text Format document. The new file is automatically attached to your
  existing global template (Normal.dot), and the macros contained in the
  previously attached template are not inserted into the new Word document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem is fixed in the latest
Microsoft Word 97 Update.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you have the "Macro virus protection" option turned on in Word 97, a
warning appears whenever you open a document that might contain macro viruses.
You are prompted with the following warning:

  The document you are opening contains macros or customizations. Some macros
  may contain viruses that could harm your computer.

  If you are sure this document is from a trusted source, click Enable Macros.
  If you are not sure and want to prevent any macros from running, click
  Disable Macros.

To set macro virus protection in Word, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the General tab.

3. Click to select the "Macro virus protection" check box, and then click OK.

When the "Macro virus protection" option is selected, you can choose whether to
run potentially unsafe macros.
