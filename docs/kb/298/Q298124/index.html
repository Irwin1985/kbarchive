SYMPTOMS
========

When you cancel an MSN Internet Access paid account that you created via MSN
Explorer, a free Hotmail Inbox for your msn.com or hotmail.com e-mail address
still exists.
Note: The Inbox size limit for these types of accounts is downgraded to 2MB.

CAUSE
=====

This issue happens when you cancel an MSN Internet Access account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To set up MSN Explorer to use another Internet connection

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Internet Options icon.

3. Click the Connection tab.

4. Do one of the following:
   - If you are setting up a dial up connection, select Always dial my default
     connection, click the connection you want to set as default, and then
     click the Set Default button.

   - If you wish to set up a LAN connection, click Never dial a connection and
     configure proxy settings by clicking the LAN settings button.

5. Click Apply, and then click OK.

To change the connection settings in MSN Explorer

1. Start MSN Explorer and click Connection Settings.

2. Click Change how to connect to the Internet, and then click Continue.

3. Click Existing Internet Service Provider, and then click Continue.

If you still have the user tile set up in MSN Explorer, you will still be able to
sign in with that tile once the connection settings have been changed.
If you have no user tiles set up in MSN Explorer, you will have to first sign up
for a new free msn.com account.

To sign up for a new free msn.com account

1. Follow the instruction above to change the Internet Options to use another
  Internet connection.

2. Start MSN Explorer.

3. Choose No, I already have Internet Access, and then click Continue.

4. Click No, and then click Continue.

5. Follow the instructions for setting up a new free msn.com e-mail account.
  After this free account has been set up, you can use the Guest sign in feature
  to access the account that you cancelled.
  Note: When using guest sign in, you must type in the entire e-mail address.

You will not be able to add the cancelled account as a user tile in MSN Explorer,
but you can use Guest sign in on any machine with an Internet connection.
