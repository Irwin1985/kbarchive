SUMMARY
=======

This article describes procedures to help you diagnose and fix issues when you
cannot dial out by using your modem in Microsoft Windows 98 and Microsoft
Windows 98 Second Edition.

Windows-Only Modem Troubleshooting
----------------------------------

Windows-only modems require drivers that are specific to the operating system to
function. Because of this, the modem must be recognized by the operating system
before you can perform any troubleshooting to the operating system, associated
applications, or via the command prompt in MS-DOS mode.

Windows 98 and Windows 98 Second Edition typically detect a Windows-only modem
and add the modem to Device Manager. If a Windows-only modem is not detected,
there can be one of three causes:

- The Windows-only modem was previously detected (whether drivers were
  installed for it or not).
  In this case, the Windows-only modem should be listed in Device Manager.
  Note: You can update the driver by using the procedure that is described in
  the "Verify Modem Type and Model" section of this article.

- You installed and then uninstalled the Windows-only modem drivers, but some
  registry entries remain.
  You must remove the registry entries before the Windows-only modem can be
  detected again. For 3Com US Robotics modems, use the Wmregdel.exe tool
  included on the Windows 98/98 Second Edition CD-ROM to clear all of the
  Windows-only modem-related registry entries, and then restart your computer.
  The Wmregdel.exe tool is located in the Drivers\Modem\3com-usr\Winmodem
  folder on the Windows 98/98 Second Edition CD-ROM. If Windows 98/98 Second
  Edition still does not detect your Windows-only modem, the Wmregdel.exe tool
  may not have removed all of the necessary registry entries. To resolve this
  issue, contact 3Com or US Robotics to inquire about the availability of a fix
  for this issue.

- Something is physically wrong with the Windows-only modem.
  Contact your modem manufacturer for the correct procedure to test your
  Windows-only modem.

If no default drivers exist in Windows 98 or Windows 98 Second Edition for your
Windows-only modem, Windows 98 or Windows 98 Second Edition prompts you to
search for drivers.

Drivers for your Windows-only modem may exist in the Drivers\Modem folder on the
Windows CD-ROM. For a complete list of additional modem drivers that are
included on the CD-ROM, view the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

Q190363Additional Modem Drivers Included on the Windows CD-ROM.
If you cannot locate drivers for your Windows-only modem, Windows 98 and Windows
98 Second Edition add it under the Other Devices branch in Device Manager. You
can update the existing drivers in Device Manager with drivers that are provided
by your Window-only modem manufacturer. Note that Microsoft Windows 95 drivers
often work in Windows 98 or Windows 98 Second Edition.

If you cannot locate drivers for your Windows-only modem, Windows 98 and Windows
98 Second Edition add it under the Other Devices branch in Device Manager. You
can update the existing drivers in Device Manager with drivers that are provided
by your Window-only modem manufacturer. Note that Microsoft Windows 95 drivers
often work in Windows 98 or Windows 98 Second Edition.

If your Windows-only modem still does not work after you install the drivers,
there may be a resource conflict or an issue that is specific to your
Windows-only modem. To determine if this is the case, view one of the following
sections, depending on your modem.

For more information about Windows-only modems and how to troubleshoot them,
obtain the US Robotics Windows-only modem FAQ from the following U.S. Robotics
Web site:

http://www.usr.com/home/online/trblshot/13011.htm

Verify That You Are Using the Most Current Driver for Your Modem
----------------------------------------------------------------

Many modem issues relate to using an old or out-of-date modem driver. Because of
this, you should verify that you are using the most current driver for your
modem. To verify your driver, contact the manufacturer of your modem to inquire
about the availability of a new or updated modem driver.

For additional information about how to locate contact information for your modem
manufacturer, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Errors that relate to Windows Millennium
----------------------------------------

Windows Millennium Edition (Me) Dial-Up Networking connections have software
compression enabled by default, but the "Log on to Network" feature is not
enabled by default.

When the Log on to Network option is enabled, the Dial-Up Networking service
attempts to find a Microsoft Windows network. If it does not find one, it times
out. This behavior causes the delay when you log on to an Internet provider,
since the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) server for the Internet Service Provider
(ISP) will not be running a Microsoft Windows network. Disabling the Log On To
Network option decreases this delay. In most cases, the PPP server will be
running only the TCP/IP protocol. Removing the NetBEUI and IPX/SPX protocols
from the connection file or "connectoid" saves a few more seconds by not trying
to bind these protocols to the dial-up adapter.

When troubleshooting , please verify "log on to network" is disabled.

Dial-Up Networking "Error 630" Error Message
--------------------------------------------

When you attempt to use Dial-Up Networking, you may receive the following error
message:

  Error 630: The computer is not receiving a response from the modem. Check
  that the modem is plugged in, and if necessary, turn the modem off, and then
  turn it back on.

You may receive this error message if the modem is using a new serial port
assignment due to new devices that are installed by Windows 98/98 Second Edition
hardware detection. If this occurs, change the properties of the Dial-Up
Networking connection to use the new modem settings.

Programs in the Startup folder can also cause this error message. To disable
programs in the Startup folder, follow the steps in the "'Could Not Open Port'
Error Message" section in this article (below).

Dial-Up Networking "Error 633" Error Message
--------------------------------------------

When you attempt to use Dial-Up Networking, you may receive the following error
message:

  Error 633: The modem is not installed or configured for Dial-Up Networking.
  To check your modem configuration, double click the Modems icon in Control
  Panel.

This error message can occur if the Telephon.ini file is absent or damaged. To
resolve this issue, view the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

Q191444 Error Message: The Modem Is Not Installed or Configured for...
Q120221 How to Rebuild the Telephon.ini File

This error may also occur if the modem is in conflict with another hardware
device. Check Device Manager for conflicting devices.

Note: Device Manager may not display an actual problem with conflicting devices
due to IRQ Steering. Look at the IRQ lists, etc., to see actual device usage.

Could Not Open Port" Error Message
----------------------------------

When you try to use your modem, you may receive the following error message:

  Could not open port

This error message typically occurs because a resource conflict or a program
loading from the Startup folder opens a Component serial communications (COM)
port. Use the troubleshooting steps in the "Resource Conflicts" section in this
article to resolve this issue.

To temporarily disable programs in the StartUp folder

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click System Information.

2. On the Tools menu, click System Configuration Utility.

3. Click the Startup tab.

4. For programs that may control your modem, clear the box for the program.
  Note: If you are unsure whether or not a specific program should be disabled,
  clear all of the check boxes except the following check boxes:
   - ScanRegistry

   - SystemTray

   - LoadPowerProfile

   - TaskMonitor

Dial-Up Networking "Error 745" Error Message
--------------------------------------------

When you attempt to use Dial-Up Networking, you may receive the following error
message:

  Error 745: An essential file is missing. Re-install Dial-Up Networking.

You may receive this error message if a Dial-Up Networking dynamic-link library
(.dll) file is absent or damaged. To resolve this issue, view the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q174579 Error Message: Error 745: An Essential File Is Missing

Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) Issues
---------------------------------------------------------

If your modem passes a diagnostics test but is not available in HyperTerminal,
Dial-Up Networking, or Phone Dialer, a Telephony Application Programming
Interface (TAPI) issue may exist--the Telephon.ini file may be absent or
damaged.
