MORE INFORMATION
================

Error Message: MSN Explorer Signup, "You must be 18 or over to sign up for an account with MSN Internet Access. Please have a parent or guardian set up the account.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The user has specified a birthday that implies an age of less than 18 years old.
Click the Back button in Setup until the page with birthday information
reappears. Correct the birth date and try again.

Error Message: Sorry, we cannot upgrade this account to use the MSN Internet Access service because this computer already uses the MSN Internet Access service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is already an MSN Internet Access subscriber with a user tile set up in
MSN Explorer, the user cannot add another. However, the user can delete the MSN
Internet Access subscriber as a user, so another can be created.

To resolve this issue

1. Sign in to MSN Explorer with the MSN Internet Access subscriber's user tile.

2. Click Help And Settings, click Accounts, and then click Remove Users.

3. If any child accounts are present, these accounts must be removed first by
  clicking the Remove link next to the tile.

4. Click the Remove link next to the MSN Internet Access member's user tile.

5. When prompted "Are you sure you want to remove this account?" click OK.

6. Click OK.
  You will now be signed out of MSN Explorer; you can add a new user now.

There currently is no fix for users who get this error message and who do not
have an MSN Internet Access member user tile set up in MSN Explorer.

Error Message: User not found.  Please check your e-mail name and try again.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error generally happens when the user types the user name incorrectly while
going through Setup. Have the user try again. If this doesn't work, try to
locate the user's account information in CSS. If you can find the account in
CSS, but the user still gets the error message above, escalate the inquiry. If
you cannot find the account information, refer the user to Customer Service;
Customer Service will supply the correct account information.

Error Message: We were unable to create your account because of the following reason: \n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have the user try again. If the user still cannot create an account, refer the
user to Customer Service, to have an account created over the phone and to go
through MSN Explorer Setup as an "existing user".

Error Message: We were unable to create your account because of the following reason:\n infocode: 801.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This means an problem occurred while communicating with the sign up server. Try
again. If the user cannot create a new account, refer the user to Customer
Service (to create an account over the phone), and then have the user go through
MSN Explorer Setup as an existing user. Also, escalate to MSN Internet Access
Network Operations Center (MSNIANOC).

Error Message: We were unable to create your account because of the following reason:  This e-mail name is already taken.  Please choose another e-mail name and try again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The user is attempting to create a subscriber ID that is already in use by
another user. Attempt to sign up with a different user name.

Error Message: We were unable to create your account because of the following reason:  The e-mail name you have chosen contains a forbidden string; please select a new e-mail name.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Account IDs or e-mail names can only contain numbers, letters, the dash symbol
(-), or the underscore symbol (_). Account IDs also cannot contain spaces.
Create an ID containing only valid characters.

Error Message: We were unable to create your account with the correct dial-up credentials.  Please try again later.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The dialing user name and password were not saved correctly. Contact
  Technical Support.
