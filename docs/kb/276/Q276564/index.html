-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server (SMS) Client Services domain controller (DC)
account "SMS&amp;_&lt;domaincontrollername&gt;" is deleted, the SMS client
service may stop responding (hang) during startup.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Client Configuration Manager (CCM) account
cleanup cycle runs every 30 days and deletes any SMS Client Services DC account
when the domain controller cannot be contacted. This issue can occur frequently
when multiple SMS-based site servers are sharing logon points from one master
domain and when each server initiates an account cleanup cycle for which it sets
the 30 day interval on its own.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, remove and then reinstall the SMS-based client on the
domain controllers. This procedure temporarily resolves the issue until the next
cleanup cycle runs.

To prevent the cleanup cycle from running, change the registry on the SMS-based
site server to set the date of the next account cleanup cycle to five years in
the future:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

2. Locate and click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_CLIENT_CONFIG_MANAGER\Next
  Account Cleanup

3. Change the value from 16\4\2000 to 16\4\2005. This example shows a date of
  April 16, 2000.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior occurs mostly in multi-site shared domains when one of the domain
controllers is offline. It can also occur if network problems are preventing
access to one of the domain controllers.

This can also occur in a single site domain with no logon points.
