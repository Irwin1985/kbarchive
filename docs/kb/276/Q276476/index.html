IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

The TN3270 service that is included with SNA Server allows each TN3270 logical
unit (LU) and/or Pool to be configured to listen over specific Transfer Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) ports. This makes it possible to restrict
access to TN3270 LUs/Pools through ports, in addition to using TCP/IP address
and workstation names.

However, the use of specific ports for TN3270 LUs/Pools is only checked/enforced
for "generic" session requests. A generic session request is a session request
for a TN3270 LU/Pool that does not explicitly specify the name of the requested
TN3270 LU/Pool.

If the TN3270 client sends a "specific" session request, the client can access
the requested TN3270 LU/Pool even if the client is configured to use a different
port than the LU/Pool, as long as the TN3270 LU/Pool name is specified
correctly. A specific session request is one that explicitly specifies the name
of a TN3270 LU/Pool.

The TN3270 service is not designed to validate TCP/IP ports for specific TN3270
session requests.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

When the TN3270 service receives a session request, it first determines whether
the request is generic (no device name specified) or specific (device name
specified). If the request is generic, the TN3270 service checks the port number
and then it checks for TCP/IP address and/or host name restrictions. If the
request is specific, it reads and validates the device name. After the device
name is validated, the TN3270 service checks for TCP/IP address and/or host name
restrictions. The TN3270 service never checks for any port restrictions for
these specific requests.

After you apply the update, the TN3270 service enforces port-based restrictions
for specific session requests by adding the following registry entry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TN3270\Parameters

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: RestrictLUAAccessByPort
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  Value: YES

4. Quit Registry Editor.

If the RestrictLUAAccessByPort value is set to YES, the TN3270 service only
allows access to a TN3270 LU/Pool for specific session requests if the TN3270
client specifies the device name (that is, TN3270 LU/Pool name) and is
configured to use the same port as the requested TN3270 LU/Pool. If this
registry entry is not defined (or is defined with any value other than YES), the
default behavior remains the same as it was prior to making the change, such
that ports are not validated for specific session requests.
