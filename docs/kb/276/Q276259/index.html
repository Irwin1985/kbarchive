The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a Systems Management Server (SMS) multiple-level hierarchy, an intermittent
problem can occur when the Scheduler and Sender components repeatedly try to
evaluate and send jobs to child sites when the send-request file has no routing
details. When this problem occurs, a build up of these send requests that do not
have routing instructions causes the SMS Executive service to consume high CPU
utilization as the Sender threads loop through the send requests.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Scheduler and Sender components collide when they
read the same send request. When this occurs, the Scheduler component does not
update the status of that send request and assumes that a new send request is
required for the same package and instruction files.

A new request file is created, but the Scheduler component does not update
destination and final destination site details for the send request because the
routing-instruction file already exists. The Sender component unsuccessfully
attempts to send directly to a third-tier site or a lower site for which no
direct address exists. This causes the request to be retried repeatedly, which
causes the CPU utilization to increase.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create addresses for all downlevel sites in the SMS
hierarchy.

When you periodically delete the bad send request files, most of the symptoms
that are produced by this problem do not occur. To delete the bad send request
files:

1. Stop the SMS Executive and Site Component Manager services on the site
  server.

2. Delete the .srq and .srs files from the following folders:

  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Schedule.box\Requests

  -and-

  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Schedule.box\Outboxes\Lan

3. Start the SMS Executive and Site Component Manager services on the site
  server.

The send requests are automatically re-created by the SMS Scheduler component.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs only on primary site servers that do not have direct
addresses for downlevel sites, which requires routing site-to-site communication
through a direct child site.

The following log entries indicate that the problem occurs on a site server.

Sched.log:

  Cannot create the routing instruction.

Sender.log:

  Found send request. ID: 1_C6CT01, Dest Site: T30
  There is no longer an address to destination site T30
  Returning send request to pending because address cannot not be found.
  Site T30 added to list of busy sites because there is no available address.
