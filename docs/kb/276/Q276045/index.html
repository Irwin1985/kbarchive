SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Rumba TN3270 client, the emulator may stop responding (hang) when
it is used with the TN3270 Server to access a host application.

If a network analysis tool, such as Microsoft Network Monitor, is used to capture
a network trace of the TCPIP traffic between the TN3270 client and TN3270
Server, this problem may occur after the client sends an Interrupt Process (IP)
and Data Mark (DM) message sequence (FFF4FFF2) in the inbound data stream.

Network Monitor frame illustration:

  + Frame: Base frame properties
  + ETHERNET: ETYPE = 0x0800 : Protocol = IP:DOD Internet Protocol
  + IP: ID = 0x7CC1; Proto = TCP; Len: 44

CAUSE
=====

The problem is that TN3270 client emulators can send data or, as in this case, a
function key (PA1 key), when the client does not have direction on the session
flow.

To enable TN3270 clients to work in this manner and to avoid a TN3270 session
protocol violation error, SNA Server internally queues such data until the
client is granted direction on the session and can legitimately send inbound
data.

In this instance, however, after the client's illegal PA1 key is queued, the
TN3270 Server subsequently fails to process the following IP-DM sequence. This
is because the TN3270 Server adds it to the queue of data for later inbound
transmission to the host when the client is granted direction on the session
flow. As a result, no SIGNAL is sent, which typically is expected when an IP
command is processed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
(all Service Packs).

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The TN3270 Server has been enhanced so that it no longer tries to act as a
broker to resolve protocol ambiguities between the TN3270 client and host. The
DisableDataQueuing registry option, which turns off queuing of data by the
TN3270 Server, has been implemented as follows:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CCS\Services\TN3270\Parameters

NOTE: This registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: DisableDataQueuing
  Data Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ
  Value: YES

4. Quit Registry Editor.

This registry option is a generic solution to problems that are caused by clients
that are not working correctly (sending data when they don't have direction)
and/or hosts that are not working correctly (failing to lock the client's
keyboard appropriately through the WCC byte).
