SUMMARY
=======

As a Systems Management Server (SMS) administrator, when you attempt to initiate
a remote control session on a client workstation that is located at a remote
site on a different physical network, the session is not successful, and you
receive the error message "Remote Control Agent not found." Although the
workstations client components include the Remote Control component, and it
displays a status of installed, you may still be unable to initiate the remote
control session.

If you first establish a remote control session with the remote site server, and
then you attempt the remote control session to the client, this method will be
successful. In addition, attempts to establish a remote control session by using
a command line such as "remote.exe 2 192.168.32.55" might not succeed. After you
successfully establish a connection with the computer, subsequent connections to
that computer are successful.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue may be the result of NetBIOS name resolution issues. When SMS
attempts to initiate a remote control session, it first attempts to resolve the
hostname to IP address. If name resolution is not possible, you receive the
error message "Remote Control Agent not found." NetBIOS name resolution problems
can include any of the following possible causes:

- There is corruption in the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) database
  that is preventing SMS Remote Control from correctly resolving the computer.

- An improperly configured Lmhosts file exists.

- There are workstations that are not configured to reference the WINS servers
  for the local and remote location.

In addition, if the local router is not configured with a static route to the
remote subnet, the local SMS site server may not be able to determine a route to
the remote client.
