The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5

SYMPTOMS
========

If you implement a system policy to delete the locally cached user profile when
the user logs off, the locally cached user profile may not be deleted in Spanish
Windows NT 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is known to occur only in the Spanish version of Windows NT. Some of
the registry keys related to the logon sound are localized while the associated
.wav file names are not. This causes the audio compression manager to open the
MSACM and Priority V4.00 keys (shown below) under the current user's SID as
opposed to opening them under the default user.

  1 -
  \REGISTRY\USER\S-1-5-21-1515338695-2011171286-569397357-1020\Software\Microsoft\Multimedia\Audio
  Compression Manager\MSACM

  \REGISTRY\USER\S-1-5-21-1515338695-2011171286-569397357-1020\Software\Microsoft\Multimedia\Audio
  Compression Manager\\Priority v4.00

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The Spanish-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date      Time                 Size    File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  10/05/99  09:09a               93,968  Msacm32.dll   Intel
  10/05/99  06:13a               26,896  Msacm32.drv   Intel
  10/05/99  09:09a               245,008 Msacm32.dll   Alpha
  10/05/99  06:13a                65,296 Msacm32.drv   Alpha



The fix closes the keys listed above when the user logs off if they are opened
under the current user's SID. Although the problem is specific to Spanish
Windows NT, this fix applies to all localizations including U.S. English.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
