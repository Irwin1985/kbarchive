-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Host Security Domains (HSDs) may intermittently disappear from the SNA Server
Manager. When this occurs, the following host security features no longer
function:

- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Password replications to or from a host (for example, a mainframe or AS/400)
  system

CAUSE
=====

When the SNA Host Account Cache (HAC) service (Snaudb.exe) operates in a backup
role, it receives a new copy of the master database when it detects that its
local copy is out of sync with the master copy. The backup SNA HAC service
incorrectly stops itself after it successfully copies and reads the master Host
Account Database. The local copy of the Host Account Database is deleted when
the backup SNA HAC service stops. If the system running the backup SNA HAC
service is promoted to be the primary domain controller (PDC) for the Windows NT
domain while the HAC service is stopped, the HAC service becomes the Primary (or
Master) HAC the next time it is started. It then creates a new Host Account
Database because it does not have a local copy. When this occurs, the Host
Security Domains that existed in the previous Host Account Database no longer
exist. The SNA Server Manager sends RPC messages to the Host Account Database to
get a list of the defined Host Security Domains when the SNA Server Manager is
open. Because the HAC does not have any HSDs defined, it does not return any.
Therefore, the SNA Server Manager does not display any HSDs. Because a new Host
Account Database is created, the SSO and password replication features no longer
function until the database is repopulated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the update, the backup SNA Server HAC services will no longer
stop after they successfully copy and read the master Host Account Database.

The following is a sequence that can lead to the problem described in this
article:

1. Backup Host Account database determines it is out of sync with the master
  database.
2. The master database is successfully copied to the local system and is
  successfully read.
3. The SNA HAC service stops, which causes the local Host Account Database to be
  deleted.
4. The system running the backup SNA HAC service is promoted from a Backup
  Domain Controller (BDC) to a PDC because the original PDC is no longer
  available for some reason.
5. The SNA HAC service is started. It starts as the Primary (or Master) HAC, as
  it determines its role from role of the Windows NT Server is it running on.
6. A new Host Account Database is created because the local copy no longer
  exists.
7. SNA Server Manager is opened and the Host Security Domains that used to be
  listed are no longer shown. In addition, the host security features no longer
  function correctly.

Every 15 minutes, backup Host Account Databases check with the master database to
see if they're are still in sync. The databases use generation (for example,
sequence) numbers to keep track of the changes that are made to the database.
The generation numbers are incremented by 1 for each change that is made. If the
backup database's generation number differs from the master database's
generation number by 5 or more, the backup copies the master database locally.


Starting with SNA Server 4.0 SP3, a backup HAC service will no longer delete its
local Host Account database when the service is stopped if the master account
database on the PDC is unavailable. For additional information about the update
that prevents the backup host account database from being deleted when the
master host account database is unavailable, click the article number below to
