-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to the network from a Microsoft Windows 95-based
client, you may receive the following error message:

  Request is not accepted by the network

Also, Event Viewer may record Event ID 202, indicating that the server is out of
licenses.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the server is out of licenses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, either change the licensing option from Per Server to Per
Seat, or add more licenses in the Per Server configuration. In either case, you
must have the proper number of licenses.

To change the licensing option:

NOTE: You are legally permitted to convert from a Per Server to a Per Seat
configuration once at no additional cost. This is a one-time, one-way conversion
option. It is not necessary for you to notify Microsoft if you elect to make
this change. However, you are not legally permitted to change the licensing
option from Per Seat to Per Server.

1. In Control Panel, double-click Licensing.

2. In the Client Licensing Mode box, click Per Seat.

3. In the License Violation box, click No.

To add more licenses in the Per Server licensing configuration:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Licensing.

2. In the Product list, click NT Server, and then click Add Licenses.

3. In the Concurrent Connections box, type the number of additional concurrent
  connections to permit on your server, and then click OK.

4. Click to select the I Agree check box to indicate that you have read the
  license agreement and agree to be bound by it, and then click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Per Server Licensing: The number of client access licenses purchased is applied
to a specific computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0. There is no
restriction on who may use the server; the restriction is only on the number of
clients that have simultaneous use of the server.

Per Seat Licensing: A client access license is purchased for each computer that
obtains access to a server product. If you need to add an additional server for
your licensed clients, you need to purchase a server license rather than more
client licenses.

Additional query words: per seat concurrent connections license logging
