The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create Exchange Server mailboxes for MS Mail recipients (before you
migrate the MS Mail recipients) and attempt to migrate MS Mail messages to the
newly created Exchange Server mailboxes by using the Migration Wizard, the
following event may be logged in the Microsoft Windows NT application event
log:

  Event ID: 7026
  Source: MSExchangeMig
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: Migration Aborted due to Mapi logon failure.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Migration Wizard is unable to find the specified
mailbox to migrate the messages to. The Migration Wizard searches for a mailbox
that has a MIGRATE proxy address that matches the MS Mail recipient that is
being migrated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, manually create a MIGRATE address proxy in the new
mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, run the Migration Wizard by using a two-step process.
First run the migration wizard to create all the mailboxes. This step creates
the MIGRATE proxy address in the mailbox. If a custom recipient exists for that
MS Mail user, the Migration Wizard assigns that MS Mail address to the new
mailbox as a secondary MS Mail address and deletes the custom recipient.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Server 5.5 Migration Wizard uses the MIGRATE address proxy to
locate the mailbox to migrate MS Mail messages to. Earlier versions of the
Migration Wizard (for example, the Exchange Server 5.0 version) use the alias to
locate and open the mailbox. Consequently, the Migration Wizard in the earlier
versions of Exchange Server works in the situation that is described in the
"Symptoms" section of this article. However, this proved to be an unreliable
method to locate the mailbox. The design changed in Exchange Server 5.5, and the
MIGRATE proxy address is used instead.

You may need to create mailboxes that are localized for a country. If a version
of Exchange Server is not available in the country's language, you need extra
steps (either the steps in the "Resolution" section or the steps in the
"Workaround" section of this article) to migrate from MS Mail to Exchange
Server. For example, if you are located in Mexico, you want to use Spanish
localized software, and you perform the following steps

- Create a mailbox in Exchange Server.

- Log on to the mailbox with Spanish Exchange Server or Spanish Microsoft
  Outlook.

- Run the Migration Wizard.

the error event in the "Symptoms" section of this article is logged in the
application event log.
