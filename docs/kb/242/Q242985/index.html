SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the new features included in Microsoft DirectX 7.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DirectX 7.0 is composed of the following six components:

- Direct3D (used for 3-dimensional rendering)
- DirectDraw (used for screen graphics)
- DirectSound (used for audio playback)
- DirectPlay (used for multi-player gaming)
- DirectInput (used for input device support)
- DirectMusic (used for message-based musical data)

The following new features are included in DirectX 7.0.

New Direct3D features include:

- Hardware-accelerated transformation and lighting: Direct3D can now take
  advantage of 3-D accelerators to accelerate transformation and lighting
  operations in hardware devices.

- Environment mapping with cubic environment maps: Direct3D and DirectDraw now
  support a special type of texture map used in environment mapping, called a
  cubic environment map. Cubic environment mapping involves the use of a
  six-sided texture that can contain images to be applied to objects in a
  scene. Cubic environment maps provide realistic environment mapping in
  programs.

- Geometry Blending: Programs that use the Direct3D geometry pipeline can take
  advantage of new support for geometry blending. Geometry blending can be used
  to perform "skinning" effects to increase the realism of segmented objects in
  a scene, especially characters.

- Device-state blocks: Programs that target the new IDirect3DDevice7 interface
  can take advantage of its support for programmable sets of state changes,
  called state blocks. State blocks make it possible for a Direct3D program to
  record common sequences of device state changes into a construct that has a
  unique identifier, or block handle. Programs can use the block handle to
  execute previously recorded state blocks in a single method call. Besides
  minimizing the calls required to change device states, state blocks enable
  devices to cache precompiled sets of state changes for optimal execution,
  often resulting in improved performance.

- Improved texture management: The Direct3D texture manager has been expanded
  to allow programs to prioritize managed textures. Direct3D uses texture
  priorities to determine which textures to keep in memory, and which to
  remove.

- Enhanced software emulation: Direct3D has been optimized to use any special
  instructions supported by the CPU. Supported instruction sets include the AMD
  3D-Now! instruction set on some AMD processors and the MMX instruction set
  supported by many Intel processors. Where available, Direct3D utilizes the
  3D-Now! instruction set to accelerate transformation and lighting operations
  and the MMX instruction set to accelerate rasterization. Programs that use
  the Direct3D transformation and lighting pipeline with software devices
  automatically benefit from this feature.

New DirectDraw features include:

- DirectDraw stereo support has been added for active devices.

New DirectSound features include:

- Improved hardware voice management.

- New 3-D audio processing algorithms result in better CPU utilization.

New DirectPlay features include:

- Ripple launching is provided for Microsoft DirectPlay lobbied programs.

New DirectInput features include:

- Microsoft DirectInput now supports up to eight mouse buttons, exclusive
  access to the keyboard, and delayed start for force-feedback effects.

New DirectMusic features include:

- Microsoft DirectMusic supports the Downloadable Sounds level 2 standard.
