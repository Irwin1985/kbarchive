- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install a small network (less than 10 computers)
that does not require a Windows NT-based server or access to the Internet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT is designed with built-in networking features that allow Windows
NT-based computers to share resources such as files, printers, and some
programs. A peer network is a network of computers that allows each user to
control his or her own desktop settings, resource sharing, and security. There
is no centralized control of security, no single logon environment, and no
ability to maintain a roaming desktop environment (this requires a client/server
network environment).

Windows NT 4.0-based workstations and servers have similar network interfaces.
You can install a Windows NT-based server as a primary domain controller (PDC),
a member server, or a stand-alone server. As a member server or a stand-alone
server, a Windows NT Server-based computer acts as a peer with Windows NT-based
workstations. When you install a Windows NT Server-based computer as a PDC, you
can configure it to control network security and other settings for all the
other Windows-based computers on the network. However, unless security is a
priority, a PDC is generally not required until it becomes difficult to maintain
the various security and resource settings configured on each peer computer.
Windows NT-based computers can communicate with Microsoft Windows 98-based,
Microsoft Windows 95-based, and Microsoft Windows 3.x-based computers when they
have at least one common protocol installed and are using a Microsoft-compliant
network redirector.

This article assumes that there is no network program that requires a specific
protocol and that all the computers exist on one physical network, so that a
router is not required. In this configuration, the NetBEUI protocol is
appropriate

Installing a Simple NetBEUI Network
-----------------------------------

To install a basic network with Windows NT-based computers:

1. Determine that all the network adapters have Windows NT 4.0 drivers
  available. Use similar network adapters across the network, if possible.

2. Install Windows NT. During Setup, click to select the "Yes, I am going to
  participate on a network" and "Wired to the network" check boxes.

3. When Windows NT prompts you to search for the network adapter, click Select
  From A List, click Have Disk, place the floppy disk containing the network
  driver in drive A, and then click OK.

4. When you are prompted to select the protocols to install, click to clear the
  TCP/IP check box, and then click to select the NetBEUI check box.

5. Type a meaningful computer name when you are prompted, and then continue with
  the installation of Windows NT.

6. Repeat these steps for each computer on your network, typing a different and
  meaningful computer name for each computer.

7. Double-click Network Neighborhood to view other computers. Note that it may
  take up to several minutes for the computers to see each other the first
  time.

Setting Up Shares
-----------------

After you set up your computers to see each other, set up shares and users to be
able to access computers on your network. If you are not concerned about
security, enable the Guest account in User Manager and allow full control in
Windows NT Explorer:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools (Common), and
  then click User Manager.

2. Double-click Guest, click to clear the Account Disabled check box, and then
  click OK.

3. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows NT Explorer.

4. Right-click the drive that you want to share, click Properties, click the
  Sharing tab, click New Share, type the name of the drive, and then click OK.

5. Click Permissions, click Everyone, and then click Add. Note that the default
  rights for the Everyone group is Full Control. To change the rights for the
  Everyone group, click the appropriate rights in the Rights box.

6. Double-click one of the computers in Network Neighborhood to see the shares
  listed for that computer. If you share a drive, all the folders on the drive
  are also available.
