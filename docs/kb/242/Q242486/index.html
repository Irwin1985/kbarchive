IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience very slow NetWare logon script performance on a Terminal
Server computer with Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) installed.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft fixed a problem in Terminal Server Edition 4.0 where users had
restricted permissions based on the preferred server users logged on to. This
caused a problem for users attempting to log on to a server to which the
previous user did not have permissions. The previous user's server is used to
obtain the address of the current logon user's preferred server, but the server
cannot detect the new user's server.

GSNW is modified in Terminal Server Edition so that the process loops through 10
servers, rather than just the first two servers in the list. This behavior can
cause very slow logon script performance. A registry key is added, so that you
can set the number of logon servers that the Terminal Server computer loops
through to a value between 2 and 10.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  08/13/99   07:48p   2,073,136   Win32k.sys   (Alpha)



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

After you apply the hotfix, use the following steps to modify the registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Current Control Set\Services\nwrdr\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

  Value Name: FindServerLessAttempts
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value (Decimal): Maximum and default is 10. Use a value less than 10, such as
  3.

  NOTE: You may have to test values to find the appropriate value for your
  environment.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Shut down and restart the computer.
