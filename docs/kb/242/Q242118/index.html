  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Messenger service after upgrading to Seagate Backup Exec
version 7.0 (build 719, shipped in March 1998), you may experience one or more
of the following symptoms:

- Your remote connections may be disconnected.

- You may receive a message that prompts you to re-establish your remote
  connections.

- Your computer may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of a problem in Seagate Backup Exec version 7.0,
build 719, that was corrected in Seagate Backup Exec version 7.0, build 719.2,
released in April 1998. When you install this specific build, the installation
process deletes the MaxRequestThreads=16 value data from the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to Seagate Backup Exec version 7.0, build 719.2 or
later, or contact VERITAS Software (merged with Seagate Software NSMG in May
1999) to inquire about the availability of a fix for this issue:

To work around this issue, use Registry Editor to add the MaxRequestThreads=16
value data to the Windows value in the following registry key:

NOTE: If there is other information in the Value Data box, type a space at the
end of the text, and then type "MaxRequestThreads=16" (without the quotation
marks).

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Subsystems\
