-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple Systems Management Server (SMS) sites share the same Microsoft
Windows NT domain, Windows clients may begin to deinstall the SMS client
software after performing Windows Networking Logon Client Installation or
Discovery. This problem can be sporadic, with clients appearing to reinstall the
SMS client during a future logon.

When you check the primary domain controller's Smslogon share, the
Sites\&lt;Sitecode&gt; folder for one or a number of sites that share the logon
point may be missing or empty. Additionally, the Sitescfg folder on the logon
point is missing the &lt;Sitecode&gt;_cfg.lcf files for one or more sites.

These symptoms are more likely to occur on a Windows NT domain in which domain
controllers exist across slow links.

CAUSE
=====

During an SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER polling interval performed by one of the
sites sharing the SMS Logon Point, connectivity to the domain's primary domain
controller (PDC) was lost for a short period. During the period of
communications loss, the SMS site server was unable to read the configuration
files in the PDC's Smslogon\Sitecfg folder. This can cause a site server that is
not currently the senior site to assume the role of the senior site, and perform
a domain deinstallation of all sites for which it is unable to find a
&lt;Sitecode&gt;_cfg.lcf file.

You can consider the domain deinstallation process performed by Logon Server
Manager to be the same as if Windows Networking Logon Installation or Windows
Networking Logon had been disabled for some sites in the domain. As part of this
process, the Sites\&lt;Sitecode&gt; folder on the SMS Logon Point is removed
from the PDC and the Logon Point configuration is replicated to all other domain
controllers in the domain. Any clients that run the SMS logon script for any of
the deleted sites are unable to find the configuration files for the site on the
SMS Logon Point. The SMS client, being unable to determine the site boundary
from the site's Netconf.ncf file, begins the deinstallation process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix:

1. Copy the Q242492.exe file from the disk on which you received it to a share
  on your network. This is an SMS Installer file that updates specific files on
  your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the executable file that you copied in step 1 and follow the directions
  in the wizard.
