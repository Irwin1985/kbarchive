- Microsoft Age of Empires II Expansion: The Conquerors 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- The Age of Empires shortcut is damaged or missing information.

- Your video adapter or monitor is incapable of achieving a screen resolution
  needed to play your Age of Empires game.

  NOTE: Age of Empires II requires a minimum screen resolution of 800 x 600
  Pixels at 16 bit high color.

- Your video adapter does not meet the minimum system requirements needed to
  run your Age of Empires game.

- Microsoft NetMeeting is running on your computer.

- A Terminate-and-Stay-Resident program (TSR) that is running is incompatible
  with the game is running.

- Your monitor is not configured properly.

- Your system's refresh rate is not compatible with the game.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Verify the Shortcut Contains Accurate Information
-------------------------------------------------

If you are running Age of Kings II or Conquerors, follow the steps below:

To resolve this issue, verify that the Age of Empires II shortcut contains
accurate and complete information to start Age of Empires II:

1. On the Desktop, right-click the "Age of Empires II" shortcut, and then click
  Properties.

  NOTE: If the Age of Empires II or Conquerors shortcuts are not on the Desktop,
  open Start menu folder. To do so:

  a. Right-click Start, and then click "Open" or "Open All Users".

  b. Double-click the Programs folder.

  c. Double-click the Microsoft Games folder.

  d. Double-click the "Age Of Empires II" or "Age of Empires II - The
     Conquerors Expansion" folder.

2. In the "Start in" box, type the following line, and then click OK:

   - Age of Kings:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II" (including
  the quotation marks)

   - Age of Conquerors:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires II/age2_x1"
  (including the quotation marks)

     If you are running Windows 2000 or XP, the path should look like this:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\Desktop" (including
  the quotation marks)

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Age of
     Empires II or Conquerors are installed.

If the issue continues to occur, create a new shortcut.

Create New Shortcut
-------------------

1. Right-click the "Age of Empires II" or "Conquerors" shortcut, and then click
  Delete.

  If you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.

2. Click Start, point to "Find" or "Search", and then click "Files or Folders"
  or "For Files or Folders".

3. In the Named or Search for files or Folders named box, if you are runing Age
  of Kings type "empires2.exe" (without the quotation marks); and if you are
  running Age of Conquerors type "age2_x1.exe" (without the quotation marks).

4. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer.

  NOTE: For Windows 98, make sure that the "Include subfolders" check box is
  selected, and then click Find Now.

5. In the list of found files, right-click the "Empires2.exe" or "Age2_x1.exe"
  file, and then click Create Shortcut.

6. When you are prompted to create the shortcut on the desktop, click Yes.

7. Close all the windows.

8. Right-click the newly-created shortcut, and then click Rename.

9. Type "Age of Empires II" (without the quotation marks) or "Age of Conquerors"
  (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

If the problem continues to occur, proceed to the next step.

Verify Video Adapter Meets Minimum System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------

Verify that your video adapter meets the minimum system requirements needed to
play your Microsoft Age of Empires game. If your video adapter does not meet the
minimum video memory requirement needed to play Age of Empires, you must install
additional video memory on your video adapter, or install a video adapter with
more video memory.

For additional information about system requirements for Age of Kings and Age of
Conquerors, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q266620 Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings: Minimum System Requirements

  Q273811 AoE II Expansion: The Conquerors: Minimum System Requirements

To use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to determine the amount of video memory
installed on your video adapter:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following line (including the quotation marks), and
  then click OK:

  "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks)

3. Click the "Display" or "Display 1" tab.

4. Note the amount of video memory on the Approx. Total Memory line under
  Device, and then click Exit.

  NOTE: The DirectX Diagnostic Tool is installed with newer versions of DirectX.

For additional information about how to install the latest version of DirectX,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

Turn Off NetMeeting
-------------------

If you are running NetMeeting on your system, quit NetMeeting before you start
the game. To do so:

1. Right-click the NetMeeting icon on the Windows taskbar.

2. Click "Stop NetMeeting" or "Exit".

NetMeeting prevents DirectX from dynamically changing your screen resolution when
you start the game.

If the problem continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Clean Boot the Computer
-----------------------

These articles describe how to disable common startup programs, settings, and
drivers to troubleshoot issues. This procedure is known as "clean booting."
Programs that run in the background in memory are called
terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSR's). For example, these programs may be
virus protection software, utility programs, print manager programs, or screen
savers.

To clean boot your computer, use the appropriate method for your version of
Windows.
