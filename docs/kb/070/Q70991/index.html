SUMMARY
=======

Word reserves special names for macros that you can create to alter the way Word
behaves. These are called auto macros. The auto macros in Microsoft Word are:

  AutoExec
  AutoNew
  AutoOpen
  AutoClose
  AutoExit

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word recognizes a macro whose name begins with "Auto" as a macro that runs
automatically when the situation to which it applies arises. You supply the
actual steps for the auto macro by either writing or recording the macro.

You can prevent an auto macro from running by holding down the SHIFT key when you
perform the action that triggers the macro.

NOTE: There are also a variety of startup switches that can be used with Word.
For more information about startup switches, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  

  Q70014 WD: Word for Windows Startup Switches

Description of Auto Macros
--------------------------

AutoExec:

The AutoExec macro runs when you start Word. This macro makes it easy to instruct
Word to automatically make adjustments when you start Word. For example, you can
create an AutoExec macro that automatically changes the default directory when
you open Word for Windows.

For more information about how to change the default directory, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  

  Q110629 Macro to Change Default FileSaveAs Directory

The AutoExec macro runs when Word starts if the AutoExec macro was saved as part
of the default (Normal.dot) template or if it was saved as part of a global
add-in.

To prevent AutoExec from running, type

  "winword /m" (without the quotation marks)

into a command prompt to start Word.

AutoNew:

The AutoNew macro runs after you create a new document based on a current
template. For example, an AutoNew macro could update all the fields in a
document, attached to a template of choice, and then run when you open a new
document based on that template. The AutoNew macro runs when New is selected on
the File menu in Word if the AutoNew macro was saved as part of the current
template.

The AutoNew macro does not run if the AutoNew macro was saved as part of a global
add-in. The AutoNew macro is available when selecting Macros on the Tools menu.

AutoOpen:

The AutoOpen macro runs after you open a file with the FileOpen or FileFind
command, or from the list of the last four documents that were opened (see the
bottom of the File menu).

The AutoOpen macro runs when Open is selected on the File menu and the AutoOpen
macro was saved as part of the current template.

The AutoOpen macro does not run if the AutoOpen macro was saved as part of a
global add-in. The AutoOpen macro is available when Macros is selected on the
Tools menu.

AutoClose:

The AutoClose macro runs when you close a document. The AutoClose macro will run
when Close is selected on the File menu and the AutoClose macro was saved as
part of the current template.

The AutoClose macro will not run if the macro was saved as part of a global
add-in. The AutoClose macro is available when Macros is selected on the Tools
menu.

AutoExit:

The AutoExit macro runs when you quit Word.

The AutoExit macro runs when Word quits if the macro was saved as part of the
default (Normal.dot) template or when saved as part of a template that has been
added into the Startup folder or added as a global template.
