SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how bin selection is handled when using the Hewlett-
Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 with Word for Windows. If the bins of the printer are
not correctly configured using the front control panel on the printer, several
problems may occur, including the following:

- Each time you print an envelope to the manual feed bin, rather than
  automatically pulling the envelope from the manual feed bin, the printer goes
  offline, and you must press the Continue button on the printer to force it to
  pull the envelope.

- When you print an envelope, the printer pulls the envelope from a different
  tray than you want it to.

- When you print a custom paper size, the printer pulls paper from the letter
  cassette rather than the manual feed bin.

- When you print a custom paper size, rather than automatically pulling the
  paper from the manual feed bin, the printer goes offline, and you must press
  the Continue button on the front panel of the printer to continue.

- When you print legal size paper, the printer either goes offline or pulls
  paper from a different tray than you want it to.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BIN TERMINOLOGY
---------------

Paper Cassette:

The LaserJet 4 has a slot for a paper tray near the base of the front of the
printer. You can insert a letter tray that holds letter-size paper, or you can
insert a legal tray that holds legal-size paper. There is also an optional
universal tray, which uses an adjusting knob to set the paper size available.
Because the physical size of these trays differs, the printer has internal
sensors that can detect what type of tray it is (letter or legal) and therefore
know what type of paper is being loaded into this slot. With the optional
universal tray, the paper size is detected through the position of the
paper-size adjusting knob. This is called "auto- detecting" the paper size.

The Multipurpose (or MP) Tray:

The MP tray is a door that drops down on the front of the printer above the paper
cassette. The door can drop down a level and has sliders so that you can put
different sizes of paper in it. It looks like a manual-feed tray; however,
unlike a manual-feed tray, with the MP tray, you can load a small stack of paper
(100 sheets) instead of only one sheet at a time.

Because you can load 100 sheets of paper, you can use the MP tray as a second
paper source. This is why HP calls it a multipurpose tray rather than a
manual-feed tray.

NOTE: Because you can put any size paper in the MP tray, you must configure it to
correctly match the paper you are using. (This is done on the control panel on
the printer.)

Optional Envelope Feeder:

This is an optional box that is hooked into the front of the printer. It holds
envelopes only.

NOTE: Many people think they have an envelope feeder, when, in fact, they are
using an MP tray. Finding out whether you have a true envelope feeder or are
using the MP tray to load envelopes is very important--this determines whether
you have two or three possible paper sources.

The printer can detect when an optional envelope feeder is installed because this
device hooks into a special spot on the front of the printer.

Although the printer can tell an envelope feeder is installed, it cannot tell
what size envelope is loaded in the feeder. The envelope size also must be
configured using the front control panel of the printer.

Once the feeder is installed, you have 15 seconds to change the envelope size;
otherwise, the printer selects the default value (COM 10).

Optional Lower Cassette:

This is an optional tray that the printer sits on top of. It holds up to 500
sheets of paper. There are two types of lower cassettes available: standard,
which supports letter, A4, and executive; and universal, which supports letter,
legal, A4, and executive.

HOW DOES THE HP LASERJET 4 DETERMINE WHICH BIN TO PRINT FROM?
-------------------------------------------------------------

This section explains how the HP LaserJet 4 determines which bin to use when you
print from Word under a variety of configurations and scenarios.

Configuration: No Optional Envelope Feeder or Lower Cassette Installed:

If your printer does not have an optional envelope feeder or lower cassette
installed, the two possible paper sources are the MP tray and the paper
cassette:

  MP Tray              You tell the printer what size paper is loaded
                       using the Paper Size button on the control panel on
                       the front of the printer.

  Paper Cassette       Tells the printer what size paper it contains
                       (letter or legal).

Scenario 1: Print Envelope from Word:

Printer Configuration: Printer contains letter paper cassette, and the MP tray is
configured for legal size paper.

Problem:

When you print a COM 10 size envelope from Word, the printer displays the
following message: [MP LOAD COM 10]. This error occurs because the printer does
not contain a COM 10 paper source. The printer cannot pull from the paper
cassette because it tells the printer it contains letter size paper. Further, it
cannot pull from the MP tray because you configured that tray for legal size
paper. The printer goes offline and requests the correct size paper.

Resolution:

Load up to ten envelopes in the MP tray and press the Continue button to begin
printing. If you want to print more than ten envelopes without pressing the
Continue button, reconfigure the MP tray for envelopes. This resolves the
conflict between the requested and available paper sizes.

Scenario 2: Print Envelope from Word:

Printer Configuration: Printer contains the letter cassette and the MP tray is
configured for COM 10 size envelopes.

NOTE: With this configuration, when you send a COM 10 envelope from Word, the
printer pulls an envelope from the MP tray without going offline or displaying
any error message. In other words, everything works correctly.

Problem:

If you print a legal size page from Word and select MP Tray for the Paper Source
setting, the printer goes offline and displays the [MP FEED LEGAL] error. The
printer assumes the MP tray contains envelopes, so it prompts you to remove the
envelopes and add legal paper to the tray. Similarly, if you print a legal size
page from Word and select Upper Cassette, Lower Cassette, or Auto Select for the
Paper Source setting, the printer goes offline and displays the [PC LOAD LEGAL]
error. The printer assumes you want to print from the legal paper cassette, so
it prompts you to remove the letter paper cassette and insert the legal paper
cassette.

Resolution:

Either place a legal size sheet in the MP tray or switch to the legal paper
cassette and then press the Continue button. To avoid the error message
altogether, either configure the MP tray for legal size paper or insert the
legal cassette before you print.

Configuration: Envelope Feeder Installed, No Lower Cassette Installed:

The three possible paper sources are the MP tray, paper cassette, and the
optional envelope feeder:

  MP Tray              You tell the printer what size paper is loaded
                       using the Paper Size button on the control panel on
                       the front of the printer.

  Paper Cassette       Tells the printer what size paper it contains
                       (letter or legal).

  Envelope Feeder      You tell the printer what size envelopes are
                       loaded using the Paper Size button on the
                       printer.

Scenario 1: Print Legal Paper:

Printer Configuration: Printer contains the letter paper cassette, the MP tray is
configured for legal size paper, and the envelope feeder is configured for COM
10 size envelopes.

NOTE: With this configuration, when you print a COM 10 envelope to the envelope
feeder, the printer pulls an envelope from the envelope feeder without going
offline or displaying any error message. In other words, everything works
correctly.

Problem:

If you print a COM 10 envelope with the Paper Source set to Manual Feed, the
printer goes offline and displays the [ME FEED COM 10] error, even though the
envelope feeder contains the correct size envelope. To continue, remove the
legal paper from the MP tray, place a COM 10 envelope in the MP tray, and press
the Online button to print.

Similarly, if you print a Monarch size envelope from Word with the Paper Source
set to Envelope Feeder, the printer goes offline and displays the [EE LOAD
MONARCH] error to prompt you to put a Monarch size envelope in the envelope
feeder. Word does not pull an envelope from the envelope feeder because it is
set for COM 10 size envelopes, not Monarch. If you place a Monarch envelope in
the feeder, the printer resumes printing automatically. (You do not have to
press the Continue button.)

Resolution:

You can either put a Monarch size envelope in the feeder, or you can put the
envelope in the MP tray and press the Continue button on the printer. If you
want to avoid the error message, reconfigure your envelope feeder for Monarch
size envelopes.

BIN SELECTION FLOWCHART
-----------------------

Below is a flow chart that provides a visual representation of the bin selection
process on the HP LaserJet 4. Remember that when you select Paper Source and
Paper settings in Word, the printer complies with that request only if you
configured the printer for the requested paper size and source as well. In other
words, the printer configuration must match the Word settings to print without
displaying an error. This behavior is consistent with the bin-selection
functionality of all HP multibin printers.

IMPORTANT: If you change the MP Tray setting from CASS to FIRST using the menu on
the control panel of the printer, the printer first checks the MP tray for the
correct paper size instead of first checking the lower trays.

                      Word Sends a
                      Paper Size to

GLOSSARY OF PRINTER PANEL [FEED...] MESSAGES
--------------------------------------------

The errors on the printer usually display the paper size it is trying to print
and the bin it is trying to print from. Below is a list of the printer error
messages, along with the causes and troubleshooting methods you can use for
each.

EE LOAD &lt;Envelope Size&gt;:

Meaning:

The printer received a request for an envelope that is not loaded in the optional
envelope feeder.

Troubleshooting Tips:

The printer has an envelope feeder, but it is configured for an envelope size
that does not match the Paper Size setting in Word.

Resolution:

Place the envelope in the MP tray and press the Continue button or reconfigure
the envelope feeder to match the envelope size you want to print.

MF FEED &lt;Paper Size&gt;:

NOTE: Possible &lt;paper size&gt; settings are Letter, Legal, Exec, and A4.

Meaning: Word requested manual feed bin as the paper source.

Troubleshooting Tips:

- If the error occurs even though the MP tray contains the correct size paper,
  you need to change the Paper Source setting in Word from Manual Feed to MP
  Tray (this assumes your MP tray is configured for the requested paper size).
  Alternatively, you can place the paper in the MP tray and press the Online
  button (in other words, feed the paper manually).

- If you are using a standard Page Size setting and then adjusting the margin
  settings to print on a custom paper size, you need to configure your MP tray
  for the requested paper size. In addition, make sure the Page Size setting in
  Word matches the MP tray paper size setting.

ME FEED &lt;Envelope Size&gt;:

NOTE: Possible &lt;envelope size&gt; settings are COM 10, Monarch, DL, C5, and
B5.

Meaning:

The printer prompts you to place an envelope in the MP tray, even though the
envelope feeder contains the correct size envelope.

Troubleshooting Tip:

The Paper Source setting in Word is Manual Feed, so the printer does not
automatically pull the correct size envelope from the envelope feeder.

Resolutions:

- Place the envelope in the MP tray and press the Online button.

  -or-

- Change the Paper Source setting in Word to MP Tray and configure the MP tray
  for the correct envelope size.

  -or-

- Change the Paper Source setting in Word to Envelope Feeder and configure the
  envelope feeder for the correct envelope size. To use this method in Word
  2.x, you must also select the Envelope Feeder Has Been Installed option under
  the Print category in the Options dialog box. (To access this dialog box,
  choose Options from the Tools menu.)

&lt;xx&gt; LOAD &lt;Envelope or Paper Size&gt;:

NOTE: The following are the possible settings for the variables in the above
error message:

- &lt;xx&gt; can be MP (multipurpose tray), PC (paper cassette), or LC
  (optional lower cassette)

- &lt;Paper size&gt; can be Letter, Legal, Exec, or A4

- &lt;Envelope size&gt; can be COM 10, Monarch, DL, C5, or B5

Meaning:

The printer received a request for a paper or envelope size that is not available
in the printer.

Troubleshooting Tip:

The error message indicates the paper size and source Word requested. This size
should match the page size of your document, except when you are creating a
custom page size using a standard Page Size setting and adjusted margins. If the
printer tray contains the correct paper size, that tray is probably not
correctly configured.

Resolution:

Load the correct paper into the MP tray and press the Continue button, or
configure the MP tray for the paper size it contains.

HOW TO CONFIGURE THE MP TRAY
----------------------------

NOTE: This procedure also appears on page 3-25 of the "LaserJet 4 User's Guide."

1. On the front panel of the printer, press the Online button to switch the
  printer offline.

2. Press the Menu button five times so [CONFIG MENU] appears in the LCD display.

3. Press the Item button once so [MP TRAY= ] appears in the LCD display.

4. Press the +/- button until [MP TRAY=CASS] appears.

5. Press the Enter button so [MP TRAY = CASS*] appears. This enters your choice.

6. Press the Online button to switch the printer online.

7. Press the Online button to reset the printer and switch it offline.

8. Press the Shift+Reset buttons to reset the printer to factory default
  settings.

9. Press Online to switch the printer online.

10. Press the Paper Size button. [MP TRAY = ...] appears in the LCD display.

11. Press the +/- button until the paper size you have loaded in the MP tray
  appears.

12. Press the Enter button to lock your choice.

13. Press the Online button to switch the printer online.

HOW TO CONFIGURE THE OPTIONAL ENVELOPE FEEDER
---------------------------------------------

When the optional envelope feeder is installed, the printer briefly displays [EE
TRAY = COM 10] when you turn on the printer. After about 15 seconds, the display
changes to [00 READY]. To reconfigure the envelope feeder, you must make the
changes before the display changes to [00 READY]. If the display changes to [00
READY] before you reconfigure the envelope feeder, turn off the printer then
turn it on again (or remove the envelopes from the feeder and then replace them)
to display the [EE TRAY = COM 10] message again.

1. Make sure the envelope feeder is properly installed.

2. Restart the printer by turning it off and then on.

  -or-

  Reset the envelope feeder by removing the envelopes from the envelope feeder
  and then putting them back.

  The printer displays [EE TRAY = COM10] (or another envelope size).

3. On the front panel of the printer, press the +/- button until your envelope
  size displays. The possible choices are COM 10, Monarch, C5, DL, and B5.

4. When your envelope size is displayed, press the Enter key to lock your
  choice.

5. Press the Online button.

PRINTING CUSTOM PAPER SIZES
---------------------------

Word generally creates custom paper sizes by internally selecting the closest
paper size supported by the printer and increasing the margins so that the text
prints in the correct location on the supported paper size.

The following steps describe what usually happens when you print a custom paper
size from Word:

1. Word formats the document for letter size paper and increases the margin
  settings to create the correct print area on the custom size paper.

  The printer does not know that you want to print on custom size paper; it
  knows only that Word requested letter size paper.

2. The printer looks for letter size paper.

3. If the MP tray is configured for letter size paper, the printer automatically
  prints from the MP tray. (Frequently, your MP tray already contains letter
  size paper, so the document prints correctly and no printer error occurs.)

  On the other hand, if your MP tray is configured for a different size paper,
  the printer searches the other paper sources and prints from there if it
  finds the correct size paper. This usually prints the document in the wrong
  position on the page.

Resolution: Configure your MP tray for letter size paper.

HINTS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING BIN SELECTION PROBLEMS
------------------------------------------------

1. Make sure the printer is reset by pressing the SHIFT+MENU buttons on the
  printer.

2. Make sure the Paper Source setting in the printer driver is set to Auto
  Select.

3. For envelopes, make sure Paper Source setting is correct; for example, do not
  select Envelope Feeder if your printer does not have an optional envelope
  feeder.

4. Whenever you want to print from the MP tray, make sure the MP tray is
  configured to match the paper size you want to print.

5. Note the error message on the printer. This usually indicates the paper size
  Word is requesting for the print job. Configure the MP tray for this paper
  size.

6. Make sure you have a current version of your printer driver.
