SUMMARY
=======

When you depersist an object in Visual Basic, Visual Basic creates a thread for
the object. If the object embeds other objects and the ActiveX .exe is set to
use Thread per Object, Visual Basic creates a thread for each embedded object
within the .exe when the object is depersisted. For objects embedding other
objects, the number of threads created is different from a non-persisted object.
Moving the embedded objects from the ActiveX .exe to a referenced ActiveX DLL
can reduce the number of threads created. This article demonstrates how to
achieve this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual Basic 6.0 introduces the capability of class persistence, which enables
developers to store a component's properties between instances. A PropertyBag
object makes this functionality possible because it stores or "persists" the
object with the current property values for later retrieval. You can store the
PropertyBag object anywhere that binary data can be stored, such as a file or
database. Subsequently, an application can read the object back in from or
"depersist" the PropertyBag object and use the object. The property values for
the depersisted object are those set prior to saving the object in the
PropertyBag, which can be different from the object's default properties.

The number of threads created with a depersisted object can differ from a
non-persisted object. If an object embeds other objects and the ActiveX .exe is
set to use Thread per Object (specified in Project Properties), a depersisted
object creates multiple threads when it is depersisted. For example, under on
Windows NT or Windows 2000, if an object within an ActiveX .exe that is set to
use Thread per Object and has public properties of class types, Visual Basic
creates the following threads when the object is depersisted:

- One thread for the object.

- One thread for each public property of a class type within the ActiveX .exe.

For instance, if an ActiveX .exe has three class modules (for example, Class1,
Class2, and Class3) and Class1 exposes two properties of type Class2 and Class3,
three threads are created for each Class1 object that is depersisted. That is,
if you depersist ten Class1 objects, Visual Basic creates thirty threads, in
addition to the threads Visual Basic uses.

If the object is not persisted, Visual Basic just creates one thread for the
object.

You can reduce the number of threads that Visual Basic creates upon depersisting
an ActiveX .exe object by moving the contained classes out of the ActiveX .exe
and into an ActiveX DLL, which the ActiveX .exe references. By doing so, Visual
Basic creates only one thread for the containing class and the embedded classes
are created on the same thread.

The following example demonstrates the difference between having embedded objects
within an ActiveX .exe and having an ActiveX .exe reference objects within an
ActiveX DLL.

Step-by-Step Procedures
-----------------------

Create the ActiveX DLL:

1. Create a new ActiveX DLL project in Visual Basic. Class1 is created by
  default.

2. From the Project menu, click Add Class Module to add a Class (Class2) to the
  project.

3. Change the Class name of Class1 to Class3.

4. Set the Persistable Property of Class3 to 1-Persistable.

5. Add the following code to Class3:

        Public Class3Prop As Variant

6. Set the Persistable Property of Class2 to 1-Persistable.

7. Add the following code to Class2:

        Public Class2Prop As Variant

8. From the Project menu, click Project Properties and change the Project name
  to Embedded.

9. Create the Embedded.dll by selecting Make Embedded.dll from the File menu.

10. Save changes to the Embedded DLL Project.

Create the ActiveX .exe:

1. Create a new ActiveX .exe project. Class1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, click Project Properties. Change the Project name to
  PersistThread.

3. Set the Persistable Property of Class1 to 1-Persistable.

4. From the Project menu, click References. Make a reference to Embedded.dll.

5. Add the following code to Class1:

        Dim m_obj As Class2
        Dim m_obj2 As Class3
        Private Sub Class_InitProperties()
           Set m_obj = New Class2
           Set m_obj2 = New Class3
           ' Normally, some initialization takes place here.
        End Sub
        Private Sub Class_ReadProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)
          ' PropertyBag is detected, so you need to read the objects in.
          With PropBag
             Set MyObject = .ReadProperty("m_obj")
             Set MyObject2 = .ReadProperty("m_obj2")
          End With
        End Sub

        Private Sub Class_WriteProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)
          ' Save objects into the PropertyBag.
          With PropBag
             .WriteProperty "m_obj", m_obj
             .WriteProperty "m_obj2", m_obj2
         End With
        End Sub

        Public Property Get MyObject() As Class2
          Set MyObject = m_obj
        End Property

        Public Property Set MyObject(ByVal vNewValue As Class2)
          Set m_obj = vNewValue
          PropertyChanged "m_obj"
        End Property
        Public Property Get MyObject2() As Class3
          Set MyObject2 = m_obj2
        End Property

        Public Property Set MyObject2(ByVal vNewValue As Class3)
          Set m_obj2 = vNewValue
          PropertyChanged "m_obj2"
        End Property

6. From the Project Menu, click PersistThread Properties. In the Threading Model
  Section, select Thread per Object.

7. From the File Menu, click Make PersistThread.exe to create PersistThread.exe.

8. Save the Project as PersistThread.vbp.

Create and run a Standard .exe:

1. Create a new Standard .exe project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. From the Project menu, click References and click PersistThread.exe to make a
  reference to PersistThread.

3. Paste the following code into Form1:

        Private Sub Form_Load()
           Dim pb As New PropertyBag
           Dim obj(1 To 10) As Class1
           Dim idx As Integer

           For idx = 1 To 10
              Set obj(idx) = New Class1
              obj(idx).MyObject.Class2Prop = "Object " &amp; CStr(idx)
              obj(idx).MyObject2.Class3Prop = "Object " &amp; CStr(idx)
              pb.WriteProperty "Object" &amp; idx, obj(idx)
           Next idx

           Stop  ' Check number of running threads.

           Erase obj   'The server goes away here.  No threads are running.

           Stop

           For idx = 1 To 10
              Set obj(idx) = pb.ReadProperty("Object" &amp; idx)
           Next idx

           Stop ' Check the number of running threads.

        End Sub

4. Start Windows NT or Windows 2000 Task Manager and position it so that you can
  see both Visual Basic and Task Manager.

5. Click the Processes Tab. If you do not have a Threads column, click Columns
  from the View menu and click Thread Count.

  RESULT: A column appears in Task Manager for the number of threads that are
  running within each process.

6. Save the project as PersistThreadTester.vbp.

7. In Visual Basic, press F5 to run the project. The debugger brings you to the
  first Stop statement in the code. Now view PersistThread.exe in Task Manager,
  there are 13 threads under Windows NT or 15 threads under Windows 2000
  running for PersistThread.exe.

8. In Visual Basic, press F5. The debugger brings you to the second Stop
  statement, after the Erase statement. In Task Manager, PersistThread.exe is
  no longer running and consequently no threads are running.

9. In Visual Basic, press F5. The debugger brings you to the third Stop
  statement in the code, after the 10 objects have been depersisted. Task
  Manager now displays 13 threads under Windows NT, 15 threads under Windows
  2000, or 11 threads under Win95/98/Me running.

This is the optimal case, because the contained classes are within a referenced
ActiveX DLL and the number of threads remained the same for the depersisted
object.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

These steps demonstrate how the persisted object spawns new threads for each
object it embeds. These steps assume that you have already followed the previous
Step-by-Step Procedures.

1. Open the project PersistThread.vbp that you created.

2. From the Project Menu, click References and clear the reference to
  Embedded.DLL.

3. Add two Class Modules (Class2 and Class3) to the project by selecting Add
  Class Module from the Project menu.

4. Set the Persistable Property of Class3 to 1-Persistable.

5. Add the following code to Class3:

        Public Class3Prop As Variant

6. Set the Persistable Property of Class2 to 1-Persistable.

7. Add the following code to Class2:

        Public Class2Prop As Variant

8. Make PersistThread.exe and replace the existing file.

9. Save the project.

10. Open the PersistThreadTester.VBP project.

11. Start Windows NT or Windows 2000 Task Manager and position it so that you
  can see both Visual Basic and Task Manager.

12. Click the Processes tab. If you do not have a Threads column, click Columns
  from the View menu and click Thread Count.

  RESULT: A column appears in Task Manager for the number of threads that are
  running within each process.

13. Save the project as PersistThreadTester.vbp.

14. In Visual Basic, press F5 to run the project. The debugger brings you to the
  first Stop statement in the code. Now view PersistThread.exe in Task
  Manager, there are 13 threads under Windows NT or 15 threads under Windows
  2000 running for PersistThread.exe.

  NOTE: The results are the same as the previous time.

15. In Visual Basic, press F5. The debugger brings you to the third Stop
  statement in the code, after the 10 objects have been depersisted. Looking
  at Task Manager, you see that there are 33 threads under Windows NT or 35
  threads under Windows 2000 running, as compared to 13 under Windows NT or 15
  under Windows 2000 when you used a referenced ActiveX DLL for the embedded
  objects (under Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me you will see 31
  threads).

If you are looking to optimize the number of running threads, you can see using a
referenced ActiveX DLL is optimal.
