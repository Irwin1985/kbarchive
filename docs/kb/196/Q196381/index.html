SYMPTOMS
========

Mail flow may be slow and seemingly sporadic over X.400 connectors through a
Raptor Firewall (version 5.x or greater). Messages may accumulate on the Message
Transfer Agent (MTA) on the Exchange Server computer that is outside the Raptor
firewall. However, the external Exchange Server computer's queued up messages
are delivered after the internal Exchange Server computer contacts the external
Exchange Server computer to deliver a mail message.

The external Exchange Server computer attempts to initiate the connection with
the internal Exchange Server computer, then typically fails. Failure of the
attempted connection, results in one or more of the following events being
logged in the Windows NT Application Event log:

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1290
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  A locally initiated association to
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections
  /CN=ConnectorName was refused. The failure reason provider was 0 and the
  reason was 0. Control block index 202. Type 1. [PLATFORM KERNEL 20 130]
  (12)

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 289
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  A connection to   /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration
  /CN=Connections/CN=ConnectorName could not be opened. [MTA XFER-IN 17
  26] (12)

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1294
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  An association with entity
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration
  /CN=Connections/CN=ConnectorName ended abnormally. [198 1 0 1 PLATFORM
  KERNEL 20 130] (10)

The internal Exchange Server computer will log the following Event:

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1293
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  A remotely-initiated association from
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections
  /CN=ConnectorName was refused. The failure reason provider is 0 and the
  reason is 0. Control block index 1. Type 1. [PLATFORM KERNEL 26 128]
  (12)

CAUSE
=====

Event ID 1290 indicates that the MTA on the external Exchange Server computer
attempted to communicate with the MTA on the internal Exchange Server computer
and was refused by the internal Exchange Server computer's MTA.

The internal Exchange Server computer will log Event ID 1293 when the external
Exchange Server computer attempts to communicate with it. This event indicates
that the MTA on the internal Exchange Server was contacted by the external
Exchange Server computer's MTA and the internal Exchange Server computer's MTA
had refused the connection.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the three methods below:

- The best option is to remove the Generic Service Passer from the firewall
  that is listening on TCP port 102. Then enable a local tunnel on the Raptor
  firewall so that connections between the two Exchange Server computers over
  TCP port 102 are simply routed through the firewall. In this scenario, the
  X.400 connectors will need to be configured to point directly to either the
  IP address or to fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the remote Exchange
  Server computer.

- Create a second X.400 connector on the internal Exchange Server computer that
  matches the pre-existing X.400 connector in every property page except the
  Schedule and Stack property pages. The Schedule should be set to
  remote-initiated, and the Stack property page should be configured to point
  to either the IP address or to the FQDN of the external Exchange Server
  computer. Also, the cost of this connector should set to 99. By doing this,
  the internal Exchange Server computer will not reject the connection requests
  of the external Exchange Server computer. Therefore, mail flow should become
  consistent and steady.

- Disable the client-side transparency feature on the firewall. This may
  present a problem for customers that want other internal servers, such as
  http servers, to be able to log the actual IP address of the external client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is required that both of the internal Exchange Server computer's and the
external Exchange Server computer's X.400 connector be scheduled for always.
This is can be configured on the Schedule Property Page of the X.400 Connector.

Because the firewall is configured to proxy communications that come in on TCP
port 102, both the internal Exchange Server computer's and the external Exchange
Server computer's X.400 connectors are configured to communicate with the
firewall and not directly to each other. This can be done by placing either the
FQDN or the IP address of the firewall on the X.400 connector's Stack Property
page.

Both the internal Exchange Server computer's and the external Exchange Server
computer's X.400 connectors are configured to allow two-way alternate on the
Advanced Property Page of the X.400 connector.

The problem stems from a feature or option available in Raptor Eagle firewall,
version 5.x and later. The feature is called Client-side Transparency. It allows
the inbound IP packets to not be re-written with the firewall's internal IP
address. Therefore the source IP address is the IP address of the external
client that is making the connection. This feature is not enabled by default.
The default behavior of the Raptor Eagle firewall is to re-write the inbound IP
packet so that the packet appears to be coming from the firewall's internal
network interface.

What this means to the Exchange Server X.400 connectors:

The Raptor firewall must be configured to proxy connections over TCP port 102.
This requires that both the internal Exchange Server computer's and the external
Exchange Server computer's X.400 connectors are configured to communicate with
the firewall's internal and external network interfaces, respectively, and not
directly to each other. This is done by placing either the FQDN the IP address
of the firewall on the X.400 connector's Stack Property page. The problem arises
when the external Exchange Server computer attempts to connect to the internal
Exchange Server computer. With the Client-transparency feature enabled, the
firewall leaves the source IP address in the inbound packet untouched. Because
the internal Exchange Server computer's X.400 connector is configured to accept
connections from the firewall's internal IP address, it rejects the connection
request from the external Exchange Server computer. However, when the internal
Exchange Server computer initiates the conversation, the firewall does re-write
the outbound packet with the firewall's external IP address. Because the
external Exchange Server computer's X.400 connector is configured to communicate
with the external interface of the firewall, the connection is allowed and mail
is delivered. Because the X.400 connectors on both servers are set to two-way
alternate, the internal Exchange Server computer also "picks" up the messages
that the external Exchange Server computer has queued up for it.
