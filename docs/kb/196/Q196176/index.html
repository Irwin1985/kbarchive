-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when attempting to view the
properties of a recipient in an Exchange Server site that has had the Optus
Faxsys Connector removed.

  Extension "Faxsys" could not be loaded.
  The extension for the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's CPU type has
  not been installed in the site.
  ID no:c1031667
  Abort Retry Ignore

CAUSE
=====

The connector's .dll files are being called by the Exchange Server Administrator
program but can no longer be accessed because the connector has been removed.
This is a result of an incomplete removal of the connector.

WORKAROUND
==========

If possible, run an Uninstall program for the connector. If no automated
uninstall method exists for the connector, proceed as follows.

1. After removing the Optus Faxsys Connector, verify that all mention of Faxsys
  has been removed from the registry and in the Exchange Server Administrator
  program.

  a. In the registry check the following key for any left over keys:

     Hkey_Local_Machine/System/CurrentControlSet/Services

  b. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, verify that under Site,
     Configuration, there is no mention of Faxsys in the Add-Ins container or
     the E-Mail Address Generators container. Also, make sure there is no
     entry, or the Faxsys proxy is not selected on the Site Addressing
     properties. (Click Site, click Configuration, and then double-click Site
     Addressing in the right window to open the Properties page. Select the
     Site Addressing tab to see the Faxsys proxy option.)

2. You will also have to start the Exchange Server Administrator in raw mode.

  WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
  (admin/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to
  reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
  raw mode can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

  a. At a command prompt, type:

  c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r

  b. Select the Recipients container, and on the File menu, click Raw
     Properties.

  c. In the Objects Attributes list, select Extension-Name-Inherited, and
     remove Faxsys.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The customer should consult with the third-party proxy vendor for any additional
information concerning a "clean" removal of the connector.
