RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this problem, modify and increase the value of the following registry
keys:

Registry path:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\ASP
  \Parameters

  ProcessorThreadMax  REG_DWORD
  Default: 10

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

This value specifies the maximum number of worker threads to create per
processor. It is not advisable to create more than 20 threads per processor. If
this value is changed, the Web server must be stopped and restarted for the
change to take effect.

Registry Path:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo
  \Parameters

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

  MaxPoolThreads REG_DWORD
  Range: 0 - unlimited
  Default:4

This value specifies the number of pool threads to create per processor. Each
pool thread watches for the network request and processes it.

Creating more than 20 threads per processor is discouraged.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outlook Web Access and the WWW Publishing Service can fail if a server is
supporting multiple roles in the domain. For example, if the server is
functioning as a Primary Domain Controller, DHCP Server, and a Web Server, then
the adjustments listed above may need to be made.
