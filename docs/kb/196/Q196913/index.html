-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Word on a Chameleon NFS, DEC PathWorks, or Sun PC-NFS network, you
get the following behavior:

Case 1: Saving a Document
-------------------------

When you save a document, the following error message may occur:

  Word cannot save or create this file. Make sure the disk is not write
  protected.

  -or-

You are able to save to the local drive but receive the following message when
you attempt to save to a network drive:

  Word cannot save this document. Be sure the drive is not full or
  write-protected.

NOTE: You may be able to use My Computer or Explorer in Windows 95 (or File
Manager in earlier versions of Windows) to move documents to the network drive,
but you are unable to access the documents directly from within Word for
Windows.

Case 2: Running a Wizard
------------------------

If you run a wizard, the following error message may occur:

  Error 1025: Cannot open the document.

Case 3: Opening a Document
--------------------------

If you try to open a document, the following error message may occur:

  Error 1025: Word cannot open the document.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages occur when Word cannot create a docfile (the OLE2 file
format). This happens when your connection to a PC-NFS network drive does not
include file locking (also known as mandatory record locking). File-locking
functionality does not exist when:

- You create the connection WITHOUT using the /NS ("no share") switch. For
  example:

  NET USE F: SUNNY:/HOME/WINWORD

  -or-

- You create the connection WITH the /MS ("must share") switch. For example:

  NET USE F: SUNNY:/HOME/WINWORD /MS

Both of the examples above create a connection to a PC-NFS network that does not
include file locking. Therefore, Word cannot create docfiles.


RESOLUTION
==========

Change the /MS switch to /NS, or add the /NS switch if it is missing from your
network connection command line. The following sample command line creates a
connection on a PC-NFS network that supports file locking:

  NET USE F: SUNNY:/HOME/WINWORD /NS


MORE INFORMATION
================

Record-Locking Information
--------------------------

The following information comes from page 75 in the "DEC PathWorks PC- NFS 5.0
Administration Guide":

  File sharing provides security at the file level. However, many
  applications require that a common database be updated by multiple
  clients (for example, a transaction-based stock control
  application).

  For this kind of situation, MS-DOS 3.1 or later supports record
  locking mode, also known as byte-range locking. Record locking lets
  you temporarily deny other users access to a particular section of a
  file.

  PC-NFS software supports advisory record locking. It does not
  provide mandatory locking. It is important to be aware of the
  distinction between mandatory and advisory record locking in order
  to adequately protect the integrity of your files in a networked
  environment.

  Mandatory record locking means that if you lock part or all of a
  file, no other application can access the locked portion of the
  file. Mandatory locking prevents access to the locked portion of a
  file, regardless of the consistency of locking requests by other
  users. Advisory record locking ensures that locking requests are
  granted consistently.

The DEC PathWorks and Sun products included here are manufactured by Digital
Equipment Corporation and Sun Microsystems, respectively, vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
