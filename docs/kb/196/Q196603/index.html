-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following are recommended recovery options for computers running Windows NT
4.0 with Service Pack 4 and later installed:

- Use the Uninstall feature by selecting Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 or later
  in Control Panel - Add/Remove and clicking the Remove button.

- Run an Emergency Repair with an emergency repair disk (ERD) that was created
  with rdisk /s after installing Service Pack 4 or later.

- Run an Emergency Repair with the Repair folder on the boot drive.

The following methods can be modified to repair an installation:

- Do an Emergency Repair using an emergency repair disk created prior to
  Service Pack 4.

- Do an upgrade of Windows NT 4.0 over Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or
  later installed. For example, when the system restarts after the text-mode
  portion of Setup is complete, select the Upgrade option rather than the New
  or Repair options.

Because of changes in the registry's SAM and Security Hives, the Samsrv.dll,
Samlib.dll, Winlogon.exe, Lsasrv.dll, Services.exe, and Msv1_0.dll files have
changed, and previous versions of these files cannot access Windows NT system
security information after Service Pack 4 or later is applied. If pre-Service
Pack 4 versions of the first three files are present, you may not be able to log
on and, instead, receive a pop-up error message referencing the STOP code
0xC00000DF (that is, the specified domain name does not exist). If the
pre-Service Pack 4 versions of the last three files are present, you may receive
a driver entry point failure in Lsasrv.dll.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Uninstalling the Service Pack
-----------------------------

If an administrator can log on to the computer and run an application, uninstall
the service pack by running the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel,
selecting Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 or later, and clicking the Remove
button. This is always the preferred method of recovery. When using the
uninstall feature, the computer is restored to the system configuration as it
was directly before applying the service pack. If the computer stops responding
(hangs) during startup, this is not a viable option.

Using an ERD Created After Installing the Service Pack
------------------------------------------------------

The Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 and later installation modifies the Setup.log
file in the Repair directory on the system to reference the correct checksum
value for the 6 files that need to match the Sam and Security registry files.
This lets you run the repair procedure and repair system files and only try to
repair the six files if they do not match the checksum value for the Service
Pack 4 and later versions. The registry files are not updated in the Repair
directory until you run the Rdisk program. The SAM and Security hives are not
updated unless you run Rdisk with the /s parameter. If the Service Pack 4 and
later versions of the six files are on the system but the registry files are
restored from the repair information before Service Pack 4 and later are
installed, the registry files will be updated on system startup.

For more information about rdisk, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q156328 Description of Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk

NOTE: To use the Emergency Repair procedure, you must have the updated version of
Setupdd.sys. The updated version is contained in Service Pack 2, 3, and 4 and
later. To update your version of Setupdd.sys, you must copy Setupdd.sys from the
service pack to your installation disk 2. This replaces the previous version of
Setupdd.sys with the updated version.

For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q168015 Files Not Replaced When Running Emergency Repair

Repairing the Windows NT system files will replace the current files on the
system with files from the Windows NT 4.0 installation media. This ensures
recoverability for users where the system has become unstable after the
application of the service pack. If a service pack is required, it must be
reapplied when the Emergency Repair is completed and the system has restarted.
This method should only be used if the system is in an unbootable state.

If, when running the repair procedure and inspecting the System files, it prompts
to repair Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll, Winlogon.exe, Lsasrv.dll, Services.exe, or
Msv1_0.dll, you can either repair them and replace with the Windows NT 4.0 media
versions or choose not to repair these specific files. If you still cannot start
the system, you can either replace these files manually with Service Pack 4 and
later versions by starting to another installation on the computer that can
access the file system of the volume containing these system files or modify the
Setup.log file on the emergency repair disk to replace the files with Service
Pack 4 and later revisions with the following procedure:

1. Make a duplicate copy of the emergency repair disk before modifying because
  this procedure may keep the repair procedure for fixing other problems.

2. Remove the attributes from the Setup.log file by typing the following at the
  command prompt:

  attrib -r -h -s a:\SETUP.LOG

3. Add the following lines under the [Files.WinNt] section of the Setup.log
  file:

     \Winnt\System32\Samsrv.dll = "samsrv.dll"," 30ec0","\","nt40 repair
        disk","samsrv.dll"
     \Winnt\System32\Samlib.dll = "samlib.dll","f993","\","nt40 repair
        disk","samlib.dll"
     \Winnt\System32\Winlogon.exe = "winlogon.exe"," 3c2eb","\","nt40
        repair disk","winlogon.exe"
     \Winnt\system32\lsasrv.dll = "LSASRV.DLL","2e7c7","\","nt40 repair
        disk","lsasrv.dll"
     \Winnt\system32\services.exe = "SERVICES.EXE","2e740","\","nt40
        repair disk","services.exe"
     \Winnt\system32\msv1_0.dll = "MSV1_0.DLL","cca6","\","nt40 repair
        disk","msv1_0.dll"

  NOTE: \Winnt represents the folder where Windows NT is installed.

4. Copy Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll, Winlogon.exe, Lsasrv.dll, Services.exe, and
  Msv1_0.dll from the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 and later media to the root
  folder of the emergency repair disk.

  NOTE: If there is not enough room on the ERD for the file you are replacing,
  any files other than Setup.log can be deleted from the ERD to make room. This
  makes the ERD unusable for other repair functions, so keep the original ERD
  in a safe place. You can also use a second disk containing the file to be
  replaced and insert it when prompted for the "nt40 repair disk".

5. Restart your computer with the three Windows NT 4.0 setup disks.

6. Select "R" to Repair your Windows NT installation.

7. Select "Verify Windows NT System Files" and continue.

8. If prompted to insert Windows NT setup disk 4, press ESC to continue with the
  Repair process.

9. Replace any of these files when prompted.

10. Reboot the computer and restart Windows NT.

For more information on this procedure, please see the following article(s) in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q164471 Replacing System Files Using a Modified Emergency Repair Disk

"Upgrading" Windows NT 4.0 Over Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack
----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you had to use Service Pack files to install originally, these files
will need to be used during this upgrade procedure. For example, if you used the
SP4 atapi.sys to access an ide drive larger than 8GB, follow the procedure in
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q197667 Installing Windows NT Server on a Large IDE Hard Disk

If the computer is unable to start and the repair process fails or you do not
have an emergency repair disk or a CD-ROM drive, you must perform an upgrade of
Windows NT 4.0 over Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 and later. Please follow these
steps to do this:

1. Copy the i386 folder from the original Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the hard disk
  of the target system if FAT, or to a network share if NTFS. In this folder,
  rename the following files. Copy these same six files to the I386 directory
  from the Service Pack 4 and later source. The goal is for the upgrade to be
  done using these six files from Service Pack 4 and later.

  Samsrv.dl_ to Samsrv.org
  Samlib.dl_ to Samlib.org
  Winlogon.ex_ to Winlogon.org
  Lsasrv.dl_ to Lsasrv.org
  Services.ex_ to Services.org
  Msv1_0.dl_ to Msv1_0.org

2. Choose the correct procedure below based on your file system:

   - If the file system is FAT and the i386 folder is on the local hard disk,
     perform the following steps:

     a. Start to MS-DOS and run WINNT /B from the i386 folder.

     b. Choose the Upgrade option during the first start into the GUI mode.

   - If the install source location is remote and the local file system is FAT,
     you must either install Windows with networking enabled, or create an
     installation boot disk off the Windows NT Server CD-ROM, connect to the
     modified i386 folder, and then run WINNT /B.

   - If the file system is NTFS, you must create a parallel install in a new
     folder and then run WINNT32 /B from the modified i386 folder.

NOTE: The Winnt32.exe and Setupdd.sys files are not included with the
downloadable versions of Service Pack 4 and later(they are on the CD-ROM).

The Setupdd.sys file is available for download from the following location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/ussp4/Additional/

Additional query words: recovery trap C00000DF ntfaqset servpack sp4
