SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running any of the programs listed at the beginning of this article
on a computer with an Ensoniq Soundscape sound card, you may not be able to play
compressed audio. Instead, you receive the following error message:

  No wave device that can play files in the current format is installed. Use
  the Drivers option to install the wave device.

NOTE: This article does not apply to Windows 95. If you get this symptom in
Windows 95, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q133365 Windows 95: Troubleshooting Problems with Compressed Audio

NOTE: If you get the above symptoms with newer versions of any of the programs
listed at the top of this article (that is, an MSACM 2.0 application), this
article will not apply. In that case, please refer to the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q121132 MSACM 2.0: Compressed Audio Will Not Play

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is caused because the older Soundscape drivers do not install the
complete Audio Compression Manager (MSACM). To correct this, try one of the
following resolutions:

Method 1
--------

Obtain the Soundscape driver version 1.20.03 or later from Ensoniq. The version
1.20.03 disks (there are three disks) were mailed in January 1995 to all
registered Ensoniq Soundscape owners. Please note that the Ensoniq driver
shipped by Gateway has different version numbers (that is, version 1.52) than
the Ensoniq supplied driver.

Method 2
--------

Remove MSACM 2.0 and reinstall the program in which the problem is occurring.

1. Exit Windows.

2. Enter the following commands at then MS-DOS prompt and press ENTER at the end
  of each line:

     Cd  \Windows\System
     Ren  Msacm.Drv  Msacm.Dr
     Ren  Msacm.Dll  Msacm.Dl

3. Reinstall the program in which the problem was occurring. The Setup program
  will install MSACM 1.0. And all sounds should play properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Ensoniq Soundscape Setup program version 1.52 installs only the MSACM 2.0
drivers and does not install any decompression modules. When an application that
uses MSACM 1.0 is installed, its Setup program is, by design, not allowed to
overwrite the newer MSACM 2.0 driver files. The application's Setup program will
be able to add only the 1.0 decompression modules (codecs). These decompression
modules will not work with MSACM 2.0.
