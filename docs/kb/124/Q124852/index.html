SYMPTOMS
========

When you run one of the Microsoft programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may see a one-inch or two-inch border around the program screen.
You may experience this symptom even when the display area is set to 640 x 480
pixels.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft
Windows.

Windows 95/98
-------------

To resolve this issue in Microsoft Windows 95/98, follow these steps:

1. On the desktop, double-click the My Computer icon.

2. Maximize the My Computer window.

3. If the My Computer window fills the entire screen, verify that the display
  area is set to 640 x 480. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. In the My Computer window, double-click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click Display.

  c. On the Settings tab, drag the Desktop Area slider all the way to the left
     (the 640 x 480 setting), and then click OK.

  d. When you are prompted to keep the new desktop area setting, click Yes.

  e. Close Control Panel, and then close the My Computer window.

  NOTE: The programs listed at the top of this article are designed for a
  desktop area of 640 x 480 pixels. If the desktop area is set to a resolution
  greater than 640 x 480, then you see a border around the program window.

4. If the My Computer window does not fill the entire screen, use the controls
  on your monitor to adjust the size and position of the screen display. These
  controls are usually located in a flip-open panel on the front of the
  monitor.

Windows 3.1x
------------

To resolve this issue in Microsoft Windows 3.1x, follow these steps:

1. Maximize Program Manager.

2. If Program Manager fills the entire screen, verify that the display area is
  set to 640 x 480. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. In the Main group in Program Manager, double-click Windows Setup.

  b. Note the resolution setting on the Display line.

  NOTE: The programs listed at the top of this article are designed for a
  desktop area of 640 x 480 pixels. If the desktop area is set to a resolution
  greater than 640 x 480, then you see a border around the program window.

3. If Program Manager does not fill the entire screen, use the controls on your
  monitor to adjust the size and position of the screen display. These controls
  are usually located in a flip-open panel on the front of the monitor.
