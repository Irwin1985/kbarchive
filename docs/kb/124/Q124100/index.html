-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order to successfully install version 3.2x of Microsoft Mail for Windows or
version 3.2x of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows over Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, certain Windows for Workgroups Mail files must be
deleted prior to running 3.2x of Mail for Windows or Mail Remote for Windows
SETUP.EXE.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows for Workgroups Mail components have a more recent internal version stamp
than version 3.2x of Mail for Windows or Mail Remote for Windows files. The
setup process is designed to check this version stamp during installation and
ensure that the most recent version of the file is installed or remains on the
disk. Since many Workgroup component files share the same file names as Mail for
Windows and Mail Remote for Windows files, the Workgroup files remain on the
disk.

In the case of upgrading a Workgroups client to the Mail for Windows, the
Workgroups Mail client components will remain and will continue to operate when
running against version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice.
Additionally, Mail for Windows setup will update the Windows for Workgroups
MSMAIL.INI and enable spell checking, demonstrations, and Apple Macintosh (MAC)
file type translation tables.

The Windows for Workgroups Mail files are designed to integrate with and
support:

1. Microsoft At Work Fax technology designed into Windows for Workgroups.

2. Unified logon/mail sign-in (the user's mail password can be cached in the
  Workgroups USERNAME.PWL file). This prevents the user from having to enter a
  password when mail is launched.

3. An Optimize Local Mail File option (enabled by selecting the Mail menu and
  choosing Options) for optimizing performance when storing the MMF file
  locally (Windows for Workgroups default) on a compressed volume (Doublespace,
  Drivespace, Stacker, etc.).

Version 3.2x of Microsoft Mail for Windows files do not have this integration and
support. This only poses a problem if the Windows for Workgroups user needs to
incorporate one or more of the Microsoft Mail updates (Application Note
updates/bug fixes) to the mail files. The mixing of these versions is not
supported. Therefore, if even one of these updates is required, then the Windows
for Workgroups client should be fully upgraded to 3.2x of Mail for Windows.

NOTE: This will result in the loss of At Work Fax and unified logins. Special
considerations will need to be addressed if the Workgroups user has selected the
Doublespace option.

In summary, either the Windows for Workgroups machine must maintain the full set
of Windows for Workgroups Mail specific files (listed below), or the files
should be deleted prior to running 3.2x of Mail for Windows setup. This will
update the required files for Mail for Windows.

To update the Windows for Workgroups Mail client to version 3.2x of Mail for
Windows:

NOTE: If Windows for Workgroups files must be replaced with Mail for Windows
files, the following procedure should be performed for all Windows for
Workgroups client machines prior to deleting the Windows for Workgroups Mail
files.

1. If At Work Fax has been enabled, it should be disabled by opening the Control
  Panel, and selecting Fax, Remove.

2. Sign-in to Mail. Check that the Optimize Local Mail File is set to Highest
  Security. Select OK.

  (If the options are grayed out, this indicates that the user's MMF is stored
  on the postoffice, not locally). Alternatively, the user could move the MMF
  to the postoffice by selecting the Mail menu and choosing Options, Server,
  and then selecting the Postoffice option under Storage.

3. (Optional) If the users have adequate disk space available, consider having
  them Export All Folders in their MMF (select the File menu and choose, Export
  folder...). This creates a transportable backup of the MMF.

4. Exit and Sign Out of Mail. Exit Windows for Workgroups.

Delete the Windows for Workgroups Mail files listed below, prior to running 3.2x
of Mail Remote for Windows SETUP.EXE.

NOTE: The files prefaced with * are Mail specific files that load when MSMAIL.EXE
is launched. Files prefaced with # are files that are Mail specific, but are
called when some menu item within mail is selected. Both the \WINDOWS and the
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectories should be checked for copies of these files.
MSMAIL.EXE and MSMAIL.HLP may reside elsewhere on the disk as well.

Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows
---------------------------------

Mail Remote for Windows will not function properly when installed into a standard
Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 installation (due to file version stamps).
If only Remote Mail functionality is desired, then the above procedure should be
performed prior to running Remote Mail's SETUP.EXE. If both LAN-based Mail (full
3.2x Mail for Windows) and Mail Remote for Windows functionality is desired
(switched through the Mail Selector Icon), then:

1. Execute the above procedures.

2. Run version 3.2x of Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE.

3. Run Mail Remote for Windows SETUP.EXE.
