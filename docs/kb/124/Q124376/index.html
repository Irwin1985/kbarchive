-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Spry Air TCP protocol and Spry Air Dialer version 3.0 to
connect to a Windows NT version 3.5 Remote Access Service (RAS) server, the
connection fails.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT RAS uses password authentication protocol (PAP) or challenge-
handshake authentication protocol (CHAP) for password authentication of
third-party RAS client software. Since Spry remote access software does not use
PAP or CHAP, it cannot be authenticated by a Windows NT RAS server.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a registered user of Spry's Internet In A Box product, you can obtain an
update which will fix the problem noted above. The update is version 1.0a and
includes Air Dialer version 03.0a.01.08. The WINSOCK.DLL file is dated 12/6/94
with a file size of 123,328 bytes.

NOTE: You can check to see if you have the correct version of Air Dialer by
looking at the serial number. If you do, the serial number should look like:
IBX10-RT6&lt;xxxxxxx&gt; (where &lt;xxxxxxx&gt; is the unique serial number of
your product).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information was taken from a technical note provided by Spry:

The maintenance release for Internet In A Box is now available to all registered
owners of the product. You may download it from our ftp server by following the
directions below. If you wish, you may also obtain the release on diskette for
an $8.95 shipping and handling fee by calling the SPRY, Inc. technical support
department at 1-206-447-0958.

REQUIREMENTS: A working installation of version 1.0

PROCEDURE:

1. Start Internet In A Box's Network File Manager application. If you are
  unfamiliar with this application, you may wish to review pages 101-144 of The
  Whole Internet Users Guide included with your package.

2. In the "Host" field, type "support.spry.com" (without the quotation marks)
  *This should also be in the drop-down selections.

3. In the "User Name" field, type "anonymous" (without the quotation marks).

4. In the "Password" field, type your e-mail address.

5. Leave the "Account" field empty.

6. In the "Host Type" field, use the drop-down selections to choose Unix.

7. When all this information is complete click the "OK" button.

8. This will start the dialer and connect you to support.spry.com.

9. If you have ever connected to support.spry.com before, you will enter the ftp
  directories at the place you last exited from. This can be determined by the
  small blue arrow pointing "up" in the upper left corner of the directory
  listing. Please see the table 6-1 on page 109 of The Whole Internet Users
  Guide for further explanation of this symbol.

10. Once connected to support.spry.com, you will see the directory listing and
  the item IBOXPATCH. Double click on IBOXPATCH.

11. This will take you to another directory. Double click on the file name
  READIBOX.TXT. This will open the file so you may read it. You may prefer to
  print this file for future reference, or click and drag this to your local
  drive to save.

12. The patch itself is called ALL_IBOX.EXE. Click and drag this to your local
  drive. Do the same for either IBOX.TXT (documentation in text format) or
  IBOX.DOC (documentation in Word for Windows 6.0 format).

13. Follow the directions in the file READIBOX.TXT to install the upgraded
  files.
