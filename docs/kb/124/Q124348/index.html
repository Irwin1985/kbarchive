-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an ON SHUTDOWN procedure calls a window that is then exited, the mouse can
only access the current GET object in the READ that was active when the ON
SHUTDOWN procedure was called.

CAUSE
=====

Control is not passed from the ON SHUTDOWN procedure back to the previous READ
level if the RELEASE WINDOW command is used.

WORKAROUND
==========

Replace the "RELEASE WINDOW window1" command with the "DEACTIVATE WINDOW
window1" command to send control back to the previous screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a program containing the following commands, and run it:

     ON SHUTDOWN DO shutdialog

     mbutton = 1
     @ 10, 10 GET mbutton ;
        PICTURE "@*HN Button1; Button2" ;
        SIZE 2, 12, 2
     READ CYCLE
     ON SHUTDOWN         &amp;&amp; To clear the setting

     PROCEDURE shutdialog
     DEFINE WINDOW window1 FROM 0,0 TO 4,45
     ACTIVATE WINDOW window1
     @ 1,2 SAY 'Type "q" To Quit Or Any Key To Continue:'
     mwindow1=INKEY(0,"H")

     IF mwindow1=113 or mwindow1=81     &amp;&amp; INKEY() values for "q" and "Q"
        QUIT
     ELSE
        RELEASE WINDOW window1   &amp;&amp; Becomes DEACTIVATE WINDOW window1
     ENDIF

2. Press ALT+F4 to invoke ON SHUTDOWN.

3. Press a key other than q to exit the ON SHUTDOWN window. The mouse will only
  access the GET object which was active when ON SHUTDOWN was called. Moving
  between GET objects with the cursor keys will allow the object that has the
  focus to be accessed with the mouse.

The RELEASE WINDOW &lt;windowname&gt; command does not release the window. This
can be verified by going into the Window menu and seeing Window1 even after the
RELEASE WINDOW command has been executed. However, the RELEASE WINDOW command
releases the window correctly if executed outside the ON SHUTDOWN procedure.

Using DEACTIVATE WINDOW &lt;windowname&gt; in place of RELEASE WINDOW allows the
GETS to work as expected.
