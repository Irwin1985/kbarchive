The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes a developer wants both the MS-DOS and Windows versions of an
application to have the same general appearance, such as taking up the entire
display area. This is usually not possible in the Windows version because FoxPro
appears in a window having a title bar, menu bar, and borders. This article
gives a procedure you can use to remove the title bar and borders. Optionally,
the menu bar can be removed while allowing full functionality of the menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This technique relies on the undocumented SIZE WINDOW command. The SIZE WINDOW
command syntax is identical to that of the MOVE WINDOW command in that it
supports both direct (TO) and relative (BY) position clauses.

Unfortunately, there is a brief display of the desktop being changed by the
commands. To minimize this effect, run the code from a program called by the
COMMAND= statement in a CONFIG.FPW file as in this example:

     COMMAND=DO starter

Alternately, place the commands at the beginning of the application code. Then
call the application as a parameter on the icon Command Line property within the
Program Item Properties dialog of Program Manager as in this example:

     Command Line:     C:\FPW26\FOXPROW.EXE myapp

And check the Run Minimized check box. Although this causes the application to
start minimized, the ZOOM WINDOW MAX command will cause the desktop to be fully
displayed.

     * Code to resize window and remove title bar
     SET STATUS BAR OFF      &amp;&amp; optional, required if next command used
     * SET STATUS ON         &amp;&amp; optional, MS-DOS style status bar
     ZOOM WINDOW SCREEN MAX  &amp;&amp; regardless of screen resolution
     MOVE WINDOW SCREEN BY -1.5,0  &amp;&amp;-1.5 for SVGA, adjust for others
     SIZE WINDOW SCREEN BY 1.5,0   &amp;&amp; drop bottom of screen to edge

The value -1.5 is the relative displacement required to move the desktop window
(actually named SCREEN) one and a half rows upward, thereby effectively removing
the title bar from view, beneath the upper edge of the display. The 0 value
indicates that the column position is not to change during the move.

The 1.5 value is the amount added in size to the bottom of the desktop window to
compensate for the loss at the top where the title bar was. Again, the width of
the window is not to change when resized.

To eliminate the System Menu bar from view as well, double the amount of
displacement. For example, move -3.0 rows up and size 3.0 rows down.

NOTE: The relative displacement values shown are based on SVGA measurements. They
may require adjustment to compensate for differences in monitor resolutions. Use
the following code to determine the offset values:

     nSkew = 1.5 + IIF(SYSMETRIC(1) = 1024, .55, 0)
     MOVE WINDOW SCREEN BY -(nSkew),0
     SIZE WINDOW SCREEN BY   nSkew ,0
