The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of Nature for Windows, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of People for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a description of the settings that you can change from
within Explorapedia.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following describes the behavior of each of the common Explorapedia
settings:

- Never Mind returns you to the ship.

- Go Back returns you to the previous dialog box.

- Selecting the On or Off buttons, a text color, or the painting or writing
  application returns you to the Settings dialog box.

In the Spaceship, click the Settings button. Tad asks which settings you want to
change. The settings you can change are:

- Sounds

- Color Of Leap Words

- Scene Actions

- Connections To Writing Or Painting Programs

- Never Mind

NOTE: Explorapedia World of People introduces the ability to turn on or off
Little Kids Mode. Little Kids Mode allows you to click on the Scene Actions and
see the actions only. When Little Kids Mode is off, when you click on a Scene
Action, the action occurs, then you go straight to the topic that you clicked
on. If you install People as well as Nature, then Little Kids Mode is available
as an option in Nature, as well.

Sounds
------

Tad asks which sounds you want to turn on or off:

- Tad's Voice

- Reading Explorapedia Out Loud

- All Sounds

- Never Mind

If you select one of the first three options, Tad takes you to the next dialog
box, where your choices are: On, Off, Go Back, and Never Mind.

Color of Leap Words
-------------------

Leap words are highlighted words within a topic that, when clicked, take you to
the leap word topic. Your choices are:

- Blue

- Red

- Green

- Brown

- Go Back

- Never Mind

Scene Actions
-------------

If you would like to move around a little faster, you might want to turn the
scene actions off. The scene actions occur when you click an animal or object in
a scene. Your choices are:

- Turn Scene Actions On

- Turn Scene Actions Off

- Go Back

- Never Mind

Connections to Writing or Painting Programs
-------------------------------------------

Your choices are:

- A Painting Program

- A Writing Program

- Go Back

- Never Mind

If you choose to connect to another program, you get a Windows dialog box, which
lets you select any .EXE file you desire. By default, it displays the Windows
directory, which is where WRITE.EXE, NOTEPAD.EXE, and PBRUSH.EXE are located.
You can select any one of these, or others as long as the file has a filename
that ends in .EXE.

Writing Programs You May Want to Use
------------------------------------

These programs are included with Microsoft Windows:

- Microsoft Notepad (NOTEPAD.EXE), located in the WINDOWS directory

- Microsoft Write (WRITE.EXE), located in the WINDOWS directory

These programs are NOT included with Windows, but may be purchased separately:

- Microsoft Creative Writer (WRITER.EXE), located in the MSKIDS directory

- Microsoft Word for Windows (WINWORD.EXE), normally located in the WINWORD
  directory

Painting Programs You May Want to Use
-------------------------------------

- Paintbrush (PBRUSH.EXE), located in the WINDOWS directory.(This program is
  included with Microsoft Windows.)

- Microsoft Fine Artist (ARTIST.EXE), located in the MSKIDS directory. (This
  program is NOT included with Microsoft Windows, but may be purchased
