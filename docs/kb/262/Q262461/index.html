-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Terminal Server client (Mstsc.exe) to connect to a Terminal
Server by using a server name that is longer than 32 characters (for example, by
using a fully qualified domain name, or FQDN) you cannot connect to that server.
Instead, you receive the follow error message:

  The server could not be found. Check that you have specified the correct
  server name or IP address, and then try connecting again.

If you take a Network Monitor capture of the network traffic resulting from the
connection attempt, the fact that the name is truncated to 32 bytes is clearly
visible.

CAUSE
=====

The server name is truncated to 32 bytes incorrectly because a buffer is too
small.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
