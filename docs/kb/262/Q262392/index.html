-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an environment with a Microsoft Windows 2000-based Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) server, Network Discovery may return fully qualified domain
names (FQDNs) instead of NetBIOS names for the resources it discovers through
DHCP. This could cause duplication of resources in the Systems Management Server
(SMS) Administrator console.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time    Version        Size   File name   Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  05/12/00  3:42pm  2.0.1380.1161  112KB  Ad_adm.dll  Intel
  05/12/00  3:42pm  2.0.1380.1161  190KB  Ad_adm.dll  Alpha

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



NOTE: Before you apply this hotfix, you must delete all resources that are
reported as FQDNs. To do this, create a collection that is based on a query that
lists all computers with FQDN NetBIOS names. For example, create a query similar
to:

  select NetbiosName from SMS_R_System where NetbiosName like
  "%&lt;domain.com&gt;%"

If you use this sample query, replace &lt;domain.com&gt; with your actual domain
name.

After you build the collection, use the Delete Special command to delete all of
the resources.
