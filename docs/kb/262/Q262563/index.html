Product(s): Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
Version(s): 7.0,7.0a,7.5
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): 
Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.0a, 7.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the InterOrg Replication tool to replicate the Schedule+ Free Busy
system folder between two organizations, a Schedule+ user sees question marks
(???) in the Free/Busy bar for an Outlook user in the secondary organization.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time    Version         Size     File name     Platform
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  11/18/99  22.36   8.30.2651.0060  121104   Msoutl32.dll  x86



WORKAROUND
==========

If the Schedule+ users do not need to open an Outlook calendar, rename the
Msoutl32.dll file on the Schedule+ clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Outlook 97 Viewer for Schedule +
7.x.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Schedule+ users cannot access an Outlook user's free-and-busy information when
they are using Schedule+ with the Outlook driver for Schedule+ (Msoutl32.dll) if
the free-and-busy information is replicated into the Exchange Server
organization by the InterOrg Replication tool. Free-and-busy time for all
Outlook users in a local organization is available to local Schedule+ users by
using the above mechanism, and all Outlook users in the local organization can
access the free-and-busy information for users in the remote organization. In
other words, both the Outlook driver for Schedule+ and the InterOrg Replication
tool work in their own right, the problem is that the Outlook driver cannot read
the free-and-busy information created by the InterOrg Replication tool.
Schedule+ users can see free-and-busy information for users in remote
organizations prior to installing the Outlook driver for Schedule+. The problem
only shows itself after Msoutl32.dll has been installed.

Additional query words: sched+ scd+ msoutl
