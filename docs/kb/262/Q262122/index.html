Installing Internet Mail Service Extension
------------------------------------------

To install Internet Mail Service Extension (Imsext.dll):

1. To copy Internet Mail Service Extension to your server, do one of the
  following:

   - Locate the Internet Mail Service in the following folder:

  Exchsrvr\Connect\Msexcimc\Bin

   - Locate the Internet Mail Service Extension included in the BackOffice 4.5
     Resource Kit.

2. Register Internet Mail Service Extension by typing the following at the
  command prompt:

  regsvr32 imsext.dll

3. To enable Internet Mail Service Extension in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
  1 or later without losing routing table capability, you need to create a
  registry value:

NOTE: Microsoft recommends the following method to enable Internet Mail Service
Extension.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: NonRoutingExtensionDll
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String Value: The full path of the Internet Mail Service Extension utility DLL

You can also enable Internet Mail Service Extension in the Exchange Server
Administrator program by opening the Internet Mail Service properties, clicking
the Routing tab, and then selecting Internet Mail Service Extension as the
custom routing program. IMPORTANT: Microsoft does not recommend this method. You
will lose routing table capability.

4. Create an Extension registry key:

  a. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

  b. On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and then type "Extension" (without the
     quotation marks).

  c. Quit Registry Editor.

Internet Mail Service Extension Message Journaling Capabilities
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Internet Mail Service Extension supports the following message journaling
capabilities:

- Inbound journaling

- Outbound journaling

- Per-recipient journaling

Inbound Journaling:

To journal inbound Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail:

1. Create an InboundJournal registry value:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\Extension

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: InboundJournal
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String Value: The e-mail address to which you want the journal e-mail
  delivered.

2. If you enable inbound journaling, you must also create an InboundJournalNDR
  registry value:

  a. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\Extension

  b. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: InboundJournalNDR
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String Value: The e-mail address to which you want non-delivery reports (NDRs)
  that are generated by journaled inbound e-mail delivered.

  c. Quit Registry Editor.

3. Remove the SMTP addresses of the e-mail addresses that you used in the
  InboundJournal and InboundJournalNDR values and hide the objects from the
  Address Book. If possible, these recipients should be located on the same
  server that Internet Mail Service Extension is located on.

Outbound Journaling:

To journal outbound Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail:

1. Create an OutboundJournal registry value:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\Extension

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: OutboundJournal
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String Value: The e-mail address to which you want the journal e-mail
  delivered.

2. If you enable outbound journaling, you must also create an OutboundJournalNDR
  registry value:

  a. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\Extension

  b. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: OutboundJournalNDR
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String Value: The e-mail address to which you want NDRs that are generated by
  journaled outbound e-mail delivered.

  c. Quit Registry Editor.

3. Remove the SMTP addresses of the e-mail addresses that you used in the
  OutboundJournal and OutboundJournalNDR values and hide the objects from the
  Address Book. If possible, these recipients should be located on the same
  server that Internet Mail Service Extension is located on.

Per-Recipient Journaling:

If you enable inbound journaling and outbound journaling, all inbound and
outbound e-mail messages are journaled, respectively. If you want to journal
based on recipient, you can enable per-recipient journaling. This allows you to
specify the journal address on a per-recipient basis. For example, this feature
is useful when you send a copy of a user's SMTP e-mail to the user's branch
manager. As with inbound journaling and outbound journaling, you can set
per-recipient journaling for each direction: inbound and outbound.

To enable per-recipient journaling:

1. Specify a property on the recipient that contains the journal address. You
  can use the Custom Attributes property page of the recipient to do this. As
  with the InboundJournal and OutboundJournal values, Microsoft recommends that
  you set the recipient's custom attribute to a distribution list.

2. Secure the mailboxes that are contained in that distribution list (as well as
  the distribution list itself) by removing the SMTP address and hiding the
  objects from the Address Book.

3. After you decide the recipient property that you want to use to store the
  journal address, create a registry value:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\Extension

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: InboundRecipJournalProp (or OutboundRecipJournalProp for outbound
  journaling)
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Hexadecimal
  Value: The property that you chose.

  For example, custom attribute 10 is value 0x8036. This must be specified as
  the high word of the InboundRecipJournalProp value with a low word of 0.
  Therefore, the value of the InboundRecipJournalProp value in this example is
  0x80360000. You can find the values of the custom attributes in the
  Emsabtag.h file in the VC\Include folder.

4. If you enable per-recipient inbound journaling (or per-recipient outbound
  journaling), you must also create an InboundJournalNDR registry value (or an
  OutboundJournalNDR value for per-recipient outbound journaling):

  a. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\Extension

  b. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: InboundJournalNDR (or OutboundJournalNDR, as applicable)
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String Value: The e-mail address to which you want NDRs that are generated by
  journaled inbound mail (or outbound mail for per-recipient outbound
  journaling) delivered.

  c. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Remove the SMTP addresses of the e-mail addresses that you used in the
  InboundRecipJournalProp and InboundJournalNDR values (or the
  OutboundRecipJournalProp and OutoundJournalNDR values, as applicable) and
  hide the objects from the Address Book. If possible, these recipients should
  be located on the same server that Internet Mail Service Extension is located
  on.

Journaling Tips
---------------

Microsoft recommends that you use a distribution list as the e-mail address that
you enter in the registry. This allows you to add multiple recipients to the
journal and makes it easy to modify the recipients. Also remove the SMTP
address, so that the mailbox cannot be attacked from outside your system, and
hide the address from the Address Book so that the address is difficult to
attack from inside your system. Then you can set the address to the X.500
address of the distribution list.

You can set the InboundJournal and OutboundJournal values to the same value. If
you do this, all inbound and outbound SMTP e-mail journal mail is delivered to
the same location.

You can also use per-recipient journaling in conjunction with inbound journaling
and outbound journaling. You can also set the InboundRecipJournalProp and
OutboundRecipJournalProp values to the same value. If you do this, both inbound
and outbound per-recipient journal mail is delivered to the same location.
