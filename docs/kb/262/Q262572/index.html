-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a functional conversion of a FoxPro 2.x (for either MS-DOS or Microsoft
Windows) Screen is performed, the resulting formset closes unexpectedly after
printing a report or encountering an error that is handled by the default error
handler of Visual FoxPro.

CAUSE
=====

The FoxPro 2.x Screen contained code in the On Screen Deactivate section. The
Visual FoxPro functional conversion process places this code in the
ReadDeactivate event of the resulting formset. Any code or comments in the
ReadDeactivate event of the formset cause the form to unload when the Screen
loses focus to any of the following items:

- The Error dialog box of the default Visual FoxPro error handler.

- The Printing Report spooler dialog box that appears when printing a Visual
  FoxPro report.

- The window created by a MODIFY COMMAND or MODIFY MEMO command.

- Invoking a Visual FoxPro form with a Do FORM command.


RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this behavior, remove all code and comments from the ReadDeactivate
event of the formset. Generally, this code can be placed in the Destroy event of
the formset. Test the application to ensure that the code functions properly
once it is moved out of the ReadDeactivate event.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ReadDeactivate event is specific to a formset and it is used in conjunction
with other Read-related events to allow for the conversion of FoxPro 2.x Screens
to Visual FoxPro forms. While the behavior is present in the cases described in
the "Cause" section of this article, it is not easily reproduced with a formset
that is created apart from the functional conversion process.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

In FoxPro 2.6:

1. Using a table in Fox2x format, create a quick report, and then save and close
  it.

2. Create a new screen.

3. Add a button with the following information:

   - Two Prompts: ("Print" and "Exit")
   - variable = m.what2do
   - VALID PROCEDURE CODE:

  DO CASE

     CASE m.what2do = 1
        REPORT FORM &lt;reportname&gt; NOCONSOLE TO PRINTER PROMPT

     CASE m.what2do = 2
        CLEAR READ

  ENDCASE

4. From the Screen menu, choose Layout.

5. On the Screen Layout window, choose Options, and then choose Code.

6. In the On Screen Activate code section, add the following code:

  PUSH KEY

7. In the On Screen Deactivate code section, add the following code:

  POP KEY

8. Save the screen, generate the .spr code, and the run the code.

9. Select to print the report. In the Prompt dialog box, click OK. Note that the
  screen is still in its READ wait state.

10. Exit the screen.

In Visual FoxPro:

1. Open the screen created earlier, and perform a functional conversion. After
  conversion, it may be necessary to overcome the invalid ColorSource bug. Do
  this as follows:

  1. USE the screen .scx file as a table.
  2. Issue the following commands:

  REPLACE ALL properties WITH STRTRAN(properties,"ColorSource = 0","ColorSource = 4")
  REPLACE ALL properties WITH STRTRAN(properties,"ColorSource = 1","ColorSource = 4")
  REPLACE ALL properties WITH STRTRAN(properties,"ColorSource = 2","ColorSource = 4")
  REPLACE ALL properties WITH STRTRAN(properties,"ColorSource = 3","ColorSource = 4")
  REPLACE ALL properties WITH STRTRAN(properties,"ColorSource = 5","ColorSource = 4")
  REPLACE ALL properties WITH STRTRAN(properties,"ColorSource = 6","ColorSource = 4")

2. Run the form and then print the report. When the Spooler dialog box closes,
  the form closes.
