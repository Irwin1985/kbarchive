SUMMARY
=======

When you are using Server for NFS, file permissions from a UNIX client may
appear incorrectly. This article describes how UNIX file permissions are
approximated from Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 2000 Discretionary
Access Control Lists (DACLs) when you are using Windows Services for UNIX.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each file in UNIX has an associated owner and group. File permissions are then
assigned to the owner of the file, the file's group, and then to all others. For
example, the following sample output is the output from running the "ls -l"
command:

  -rwxrw-r--  1 user1 staff          64 May 15 19:01 letter.txt

The owner of the Letter.txt file is user1; the group is staff. The following
rights are assigned:

  user1 has Read, Write, and Execute permissions.
  staff has Read and Write permissions.
  All others have Read permissions.

In the Windows NT and Windows 2000 NTFS file system, each file also has an owner
and a primary group. The primary group of a file is not used by the Win32
subsystem, but is present for programs that make use of the POSIX subsystem.
When a file is created, the user who created the file becomes its owner and that
user's primary group becomes the file's primary group. Access Control Entries
(ACEs) are then added to the DACLs to assign permissions.

Server for NFS approximates NTFS file permissions to UNIX file permissions by
using User Name Mapping Server. User Name Mapping Server allows an administrator
to map users and groups in Windows NT and Windows 2000 to corresponding users
and groups on a UNIX server or an NIS domain (for more information about User
Name Mapping Server, please see the online Help). ACEs for the owner of the file
and for the primary group of the file are then translated into the appropriate
UNIX permissions for owner and group. The ACE for the built-in Everyone group is
then translated into the appropriate UNIX permissions for all others. Consider
the following example:

  File name: letter.doc
  Owner: user1
  Primary group: Users

The permissions are:

  user1 has Full Control permissions on the file.
  The Users group has Read and Write permissions.
  The built-in Everyone group has Read permissions.

User1 is mapped to a UNIX user also named user1. The Users group is mapped to the
UNIX group named staff. A UNIX client sees the following permissions with the
"ls -l" command:

  -rwxrw-r--  1  user1 staff          512 May 9 15:42 letter.doc
