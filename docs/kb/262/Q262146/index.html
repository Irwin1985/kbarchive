-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1), messages that you send
to Fenestrae Faxination custom recipients are returned as undeliverable by the
message transfer agent (MTA) with the following non-delivery report:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject: Test Fax
  Sent: 11/22/99 12:55 PM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

  FaxTest on 11/22/99 12:55 PM
  The recipient name is not recognized
  The MTS-ID of the original message is: &lt;msg-id&gt;
  MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:OrgName:SITENAME

The MTA also records the following event:

  Event ID: 290
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Category: X.400 Service
  Type: Warning
  Description: A non-delivery report was (reason code unable-to-transfer and
  diagnostic code unrecognized-OR-name) is being generated for message
  &lt;msg-id&gt;. It was originally destined for &lt;Faxination Custom
  Recipient&gt;, and was to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 19 136] (12)

Additional notes about this problem:

- This problem cannot be reproduced with the original release of Exchange
  Server 5.5.

- This problem cannot be reproduced if Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2)
  or later is applied without first installing SP1.

- When you apply SP2 or later, the problem is not resolved.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by the lack of an X.400 proxy address for the custom
recipients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add an X.400 proxy address for all custom recipients.
You can do this manually in the Exchange Administration program or
programmatically by using a variety of tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server versions 4.0 through 5.5 are all X.400-based, and the routing of
messages depends heavily on X.400 addresses. It is not typical that an Exchange
Server-based computer routes messages to objects without X.400 proxy addresses,
but it is typical that an Exchange Server-based computer returns such messages
as undeliverable.

To illustrate the importance of the X.400 proxy address, administrators may
locate the Site Addressing object in the Configuration container of any site,
and then click the Site Addressing tab in properties. If the administrator
attempts to clear the X.400 E-mail address, the administrator receives the
following error message:

  The X.400 site address cannot be disabled. All recipients must have an X.400
  address in Microsoft Exchange.

There is no way to remove or disable the X.400 site proxy address. However, the
Exchange Server-based computer does allow administrators to remove X.400 proxy
addresses for recipients, custom recipients, and distribution lists, and the
administrator does not receive any warning messages when they do this.
Administrators are therefore cautioned to only remove proxy addresses when they
are fully aware of the implications of that action.
