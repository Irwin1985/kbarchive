SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an appointment in Outlook and set it as an all day event, the
appointment appears to span across two days when you view it in another time
zone.

CAUSE
=====

When you click the All Day Event option, the appointment is scheduled from
midnight on the first day to midnight on the next day. When you view the
calendar in a different time zone than the one in which the appointment was
created, the time is adjusted for that time zone based on the regional time
settings on that computer. This makes the appointment appear to span over two
days when you view it from another time zone.

NOTE: Computers that are running Exchange Server store all calendar events in
Greenwich mean time and shift the events based on the regional settings of the
computer that is accessing each event.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, schedule the event for the beginning and end of
your normal workday instead of choosing the All Day option, and then mark the
event as needed (Free, Tentative, or Busy). Also, Microsoft recommends that you
not create events that span over the midnight time frame unless your normal
working hours include those times.

NOTE: When you use this workaround, the top section of the calendar does not
display the date of the event, but it does display the event as a single event
that fills the hours for that workday.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
