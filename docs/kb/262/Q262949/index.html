IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade a Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 client to SMS 2.0 without
removing the old SMS client software, but you delete the Sms.ini file on the
client, the Remote Control service may log messages in the Remctrl.log, noting
that it is in an install pending state.

After you restart the client, none of the SMS 1.2 services are running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

SMS 2.0 uses three markers to determine if a client is an SMS 1.2 client:

1. The Sms.ini file.

2. In the SMS registry entry, it checks the load key under
  HKCU\Software\Microsoft \WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Windows to see if it
  contains Smsrun32.

3. It checks the load line in the Win.ini file to see if it contains
  Smsrun16.exe.

The upgrade from the SMS 1.2 Remote Control components to the SMS 2.0 Remctrl.exe
(the SMS 2.0 remote control bundle) consists of two parts: One that depends on
migration (Migrat1x.exe) to complete, and another test that it performs
separately from the migration.

Migrat1x.exe can only remove the SMS 1.2 components that it knows about. It uses
the Sms.ini file as the key to the SMS 1.2 components that are present, and
where a component can be found to remove it. If the Sms.ini file is not present,
a number of SMS 1.2 components will remain on that client (including Remote
Control), because the key to the entire cleanup, or migration process has been
removed.

As a result, other client components may not be upgraded either.

The Remctrl.log file generates the following message every time the computer
starts:

  Remote Control Installation starting
  Looking for conflicting products on an NT system
  SMS 1.2 Client Migration is not yet complete.
  Migration status is 'Failed'
  Abandoning installation until after next reboot
  Successfully notified SMS that installation has not completed
  Installation abandoned at &lt;date&gt;

The Install.log for the Remote Control component generates the following
message:

  *** Installation Started &lt;date&gt; ***
  Title: SMS Remote Control Installation
  Source: \\SCHULZ\CAP_MFS\clicomp.box\remctrl\i386\remctrl.exe
  SMS 1.2 Remote Control client on workstation.
  Abandoning installation until after next reboot.

There is an SMS Client Installation State registry key in the registry that is
located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client
Components\Remote Control\Installation Properties. Until migration is completed,
and until this key is set to Done (which Migrat1x.exe was unable to set upon
completion), SMS 2.0 Remctrl.exe does not try to install Remote Control
components. If it were to do so, Migrat1x.exe might unknowingly clean up
incoming SMS 2.0 Remote Control components.

If you experience this condition, the migration can be continued by replacing the
contents of this registry key with "Done" (without the quotation marks), and
then restarting the computer, at which point the migration continues.

After the migration is complete, the Remctrl bundle scans all local hard drives
for copies of Wuser.exe, and Wuser32.exe. If it finds either of these files, it
assumes a third-party Remote Control agent is resident, chooses not to replace
it, logs an error in the Remctrl.log file, stops gracefully, and then waits for
someone to read the log and make the necessary adjustments so that it can
install SMS 2.0 Remote Control at some point in the future.
