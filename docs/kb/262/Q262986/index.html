SUMMARY
=======

The information contained in this article represents the current view of
Microsoft Corporation on the issues discussed as of the date of publication.
Because Microsoft must respond to changing market conditions, it should not be
interpreted to be a commitment on the part of Microsoft, and Microsoft cannot
guarantee the accuracy of any information that is presented in this article
after the date of publication.

This article is for informational purposes only. MICROSOFT MAKES NO WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE INFORMATION IN THIS DOCUMENT.

This article is intended to be a reference for which Requests for Comments (RFC)
and other standards are supported in Exchange Server 5.5 and Exchange 2000
Server. While every effort has been made to verify this information, omission of
an RFC from this list does not necessarily mean that Exchange does not at least
partially comply with the RFC. RFCs are guidelines, but often contain two types
of information: required and optional. Microsoft and other vendors may or may
not chose to implement optional requirements or may interpret portions of RFCs
differently.

However, if you do have an issue where you feel that Exchange is not compliant
with a particular RFC and this is causing a problem, please open a support
incident with Microsoft Product Support Services.

Please visit the following non-Microsoft Web sites for additional information:

  http://www.rfc-editor.org/
  http://www.ietf.org/
  http://www.w3c.org/
