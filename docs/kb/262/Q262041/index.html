SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore an online backup and replay the log files generated after the
backup was made (allowing the Jet Engine to take the transactions in the log
files and commit them to the database), not all of the data (transactions) in
the log files can be found in the database.

The Event Viewer Application Log reflects that the database engine has played in
the logs without logging any errors, but the data from the logs generated after
the backup is not in the database. Running through the logs only takes a few
seconds for each log, a fraction of the time normally required to commit a log's
worth of new data to the database.

The events in the Exchange Event Viewer Application log look similar to the
following:

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: ESE97
  Event Category: Logging/Recovery
  Event ID: 106
  Time: 11:39:12 AM
  Description:
  (364) The database engine is restoring from backup directory
  f:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA.

  Event Category: Logging/Recovery
  Event ID: 109
  Time: 11:39:16 AM
  Description:
  (364) The database engine is replaying log file
  f:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb1C5E0.log.

  Time: 11:39:25 AM
  Description:
  (364) The database engine is replaying log file
  f:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb1C5E1.log.

  ***Numerous logs replaying at about 5-15 seconds per log.***

  Time: 12:03:23 PM
  Description:
  (364) The database engine is replaying log file
  f:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb1C6EC.log.

  Time: 12:03:30 PM
  Description:
  (364) The database engine is replaying log file
  f:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\edb1C6ED.log.

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: ESE97
  Event Category: Logging/Recovery
  Event ID: 107
  Time: 12:03:36 PM
  Description:
  (364) The database engine has stopped restoring.

Despite all indications to the contrary, the logs are not committed to the
database. The data contained in those logs must be considered lost unless it can
be extracted from a restored backup or the original database.

CAUSE
=====

In Exchange Server 5.5, in order for the database engine to replay log files
during hard recovery (after restoring an online backup), there must be an exact
mapping from the "old" database path to the "new" database path in the
EDB_RstMap value of the "Restore in Progress" registry key.

CAUTION: Altering the Restore in Progress registry key manually is not
recommended.

The old database path indicates the path to the databases when they were backed
up. This path is in the header of each log file that came from tape.

The new database path is the path to the databases on the server that you
restored to.

Usually, recovery only runs on a log file if the database is in the location that
is specified in the header of the log file. Restoring an online backup allows a
way around this by using the mapping in the Restore in Progress key.

The EDB_RstMap value contains two lines for each database restored. The first
line indicates the old location (the path to the previous location of the
database contained in each log file header) and the second line indicates the
new location (where the database is currently located; this is where the copy
from goes).

When hard recovery runs, Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) reads the database path
written in the log file header and compares it to the EDB_RstMap value. If it
matches the "old" location specified, it substitutes the "new" location instead,
and recovery runs successfully on the log file. If it does not match the "old"
location, the log file is skipped. For example:

- Information store full backup occurs on Sunday night.

- Monday morning, the Priv.edb and Pub.edb databases are moved from
  D:\exchsrvr\mdbdata to E:\exchsrvr\mdbdata.

- Towards the end of business Monday, a problem occurs and the information
  store needs to be restored.

- The restore of the Sunday night full backup finishes and the Priv.edb and
  Pub.edb are written from tape to the E:\exchsrvr\mdbata directory.

- In the log directory, the log files from tape point to Priv.edb and Pub.edb
  on the D: drive, and the log files generated all day Monday point to Priv.edb
  and Pub.edb on the E: drive.

- The EDB_RstMap registry key now holds values like this:

  \\computer\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\Priv.edbo

  \\computer\E$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\Priv.edbo

  \\computer\D$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\Pub.edbo

  \\computer\E$\exchsrvr\mdbdata\Pub.edb

- In order for log files to be played into the databases that are located in
  E:\exchsrvr\mdbdata, they must point to databases in D:\exchsrvr\mdbdata.

- Only the log files created before the database was moved will be successfully
  replayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Be certain that a full online backup is made after you change the location of
any database files on the Exchange Server computer. Do this regardless of
whether the files are moved using Performance Optimizer (Perfwiz.exe) or through
editing the registry and moving the files manually.


WORKAROUND
==========

If a copy of the database that contains the data you want to recover (the
database that failed to start) is available, you may be able to use the
following steps to recover some of the data that did not play in from the logs
because of the change in the database location.

1. Install Exchange Server on a recovery server with the same Organization and
  Site names as the production server.

2. Create a new site, and DO NOT join the existing site.

3. Move out all files from the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directories on all drives. Note
  the directory where Priv.edb and Pub.edb are before moving them.

4. Copy the Priv.edb and Pub.edb files that contain the data you want to extract
  to the mdbdata directory noted above on the recovery server.

NOTE: In the following steps, a repair (eseutil /p) will be run on the databases.
This will cause data loss, but may allow the databases to start so you can
extract some data that would otherwise be lost. Please make sure you have backup
copies of Priv.edb and Pub.edb before proceeding.

1. At a command prompt, run eseutil /p /ispriv.

2. From the exchsrvr\bin directory, run isinteg -pri -fix -test alltests

3. Run eseutil /p /ispub

4. From the exchsrvr\bin directory, run isinteg -pub -fix -test alltests

5. After these utilities are finished, start all Exchange Server services. If
  you get a 1011 error when the information store starts, run isinteg -patch
  from the exchsrvr\bin directory.

6. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program and get properties of the
  server object. Click the Advanced tab and click the Consistency Adjuster
  button.

7. Click the top check box to synchronize the private information store with the
  directory. Click All inconsistencies and click OK.

  If this procedure does not create mailboxes or if you have any other problems
  with this step, consult the Microsoft Knowledge Base or Microsoft Product
  Support Services (PSS).

8. Use Exmerge.exe to merge all data between the last backup and the time of the
  failure, from the recovery server into the production server.

  ExMerge.exe (Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Merge Program) is available from the
  Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, Second Edition, as well as from Microsoft
  Product Support Services.

9. You can manually move public folder data to a .pst file and copy it from the
  .pst file back to the production environment.

ramifications of running these on a database, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q259851 XADM: Ramifications of Running the ESEUTIL /P or EDBUTIL /D /R
  Command

If a copy of the database with the data you want to extract is no longer
available, save all log files and the backup tape that you restored from and
contact Microsoft PSS for additional assistance.
