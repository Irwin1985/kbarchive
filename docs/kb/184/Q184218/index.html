SUMMARY
=======

Formexit.exe is a sample file that that shows how adding an EXIT command to a
FOR...NEXT loop that iterates through a series of Application.Form objects can
leave a form object on the desktop. The example also provides a workaround to
the problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Formexit.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vfox50/Sample2/1/W9X/EN-US/Formexit.exe)

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

This example has three forms, One, Two, and Three that sequentially appear. In
the Activate event code of each form, a FOR...NEXT loop uses the
Application.Form object to check if a form exists and changes the Caption
property of a label object. If the FOR...NEXT loop is terminated by an EXIT
command, it prevents Visual FoxPro from discarding the first form, and the form
is left in memory.

To work around this problem, remove the EXIT command from the FOR...NEXT loop.
This change allows the loop to complete, and the first form disappears.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Copy the Formexit.exe file to a directory on your system and run it to
  extract the sample files.

2. To run the application and follow the instructions on the forms that appear,
  type the following in the Command window: " DO Formexit.app " (without the
  quotation marks) After following the instructions, the form titled One
  remains on the desktop.

3. To exit the example, activate form Three and press the Clear Events button.
  Activate the Command window by pressing the CTRL and F2 keys simultaneously
  and type "CLEAR ALL" (without quotes) in the Command window.

4. To implement the workaround, modify the project, open Frmone and open the
  Activate event. Comment the EXIT command by placing an asterisk (*) character
  in front of the line.

5. Repeat the same steps to the other two forms.

6. Rebuild the application and run the application file. Notice that Frmone now
  closes properly.
