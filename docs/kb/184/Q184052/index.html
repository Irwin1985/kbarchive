-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

In the following setup, an Exchange Server computer is connected to a HUB PO1
(via the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail), which has child postoffices
linked to it via the Automatic Directory Exchange (ADE) relationships. A HUB PO2
is connected (via ADE) to HUB PO1; HUB PO2 also has child post offices. The
problem is as follows:

When you send from a postoffice under HUB PO1, everything works fine. But when
you send from a postoffice under HUB PO2, the reply address is wrong, resulting
in Exchange users not being able to reply to cc:Mail messages that originated
from child postoffices connected to HUB PO2.

CAUSE
=====

An Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail that is connected to either HUB of the
enterprise boundary only recognizes the true address of users belonging to the
same side. However, messages relayed to Exchange from the opposite side of the
boundary carry their true downstream address in the sender field.

For example, to reproduce this behavior, do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   SYSTEM\Current ControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC\Parameters

3. Set the "Save a copy of the imported files" registry key to 1.

4. Send a message from Exchange to cc:Mail.

5. In the file in the \exchsrvr\ccmcdata\import.bak directory, you should see
  something like the following:

     Message:
     179
     From: Grewal, Jeff at Hub
     Date: 6/2/98 8:39
     To: Admin at HUBPO2
     Subject: Another message
     Contents:
     58
     Text item:
     32
     This is the message body

The issue is that the To: line contains the recipient address with the "at
HUBPO2". This causes the cc:Mail postoffice that is connected to the Exchange
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail to reject the message with recipient unknown,
because addresses here are of the form "at HUBPO1".

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add all downstream postoffices of HUB PO2 into HUB
PO1.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix has been coded to have the Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail recognize
a registry setting that turns off sending the "at PO" information on imported
messages to cc:Mail. This way, the process uses cc:Mail Automatic Name
Resolution (ANR) to resolve the name to an entry in the "directory" for cc:Mail,
thus making the message deliverable across the ADE relationship.

Note that this is a registry-based behavior with the default=OFF.

After applying the hotfix detailed below, make the following registry changes:

To turn on the new behavior (that is, make the Exchange Connector for Lotus
cc:Mail use cc:Mail Automatic Name Resolution), you must add the DWORD registry
value:

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   SYSTEM\Current ControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC\Parameters\Use ANR

3. Set "Use ANR" registry key to 1.

For example, to reproduce this new behavior, do the following:

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

   SYSTEM\Current ControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC\Parameters

3. Set "Save a copy of the imported files" registry key to 1.

4. Send a message from Exchange to cc:Mail.

5. In the file in the \exchsrvr\ccmcdata\import.bak directory, you should see
  something like the following:

     Message:
     179
     From: Grewal, Jeff at Hub
     Date: 6/2/98 8:39
     To: Admin
     Subject: Another message
     Contents:
     58
     Text item:
     32
     This is the message body

Note that the postoffice name is omitted from the To: line.

NOTE: After enabling the "Use ANR" feature, it is recommended that you do a
dirsync. Otherwise, the addresses may be in an encapsulated format.

STATUS
