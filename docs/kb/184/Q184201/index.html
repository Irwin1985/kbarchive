-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Network versions 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive an error
message similar to the following:

  The file &lt;filename&gt; could not be found on the installation disc.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions exist:

- The CD-ROM is dirty or damaged.

- The CD-ROM drive is not properly configured.

- The CD-ROM drive hardware may be damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Confirm that the CD-ROM drive is double-speed or faster. The MSN software
  does not support single-speed CD-ROM drives.

2. Verify that the MSN CD-ROM is clean and free of scratches. To do so, inspect
  the shiny side of the CD-ROM. Use a CD-ROM cleaning kit or a soft, lint-free
  cloth to clean the CD-ROM, and then run the MSN Setup program again. If the
  issue continues to occur, proceed to the next step.

3. Determine if the CD-ROM is damaged. To do so, attempt to install MSN on a
  different computer using the same CD-ROM. If the issue does not occur on the
  other computer, continue to the next step. If the issue does occur on the
  other computer, the MSN CD-ROM is damaged. You can request a replacement MSN
  CD-ROM by calling the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561. If you are
  outside the United States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To
  obtain contact information for your Microsoft subsidiary, visit the following
  Microsoft Web page:

  http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm


4. Use a CD-ROM lens cleaning kit to clean the CD-ROM drive. If the issue
  continues to occur, proceed to the next step.

5. To decrease the likelihood of CD-ROM read errors, try reducing data caching
  on the CD-ROM drive.

  To reduce CD-ROM data caching, you must first determine whether you are using
  real-mode or protected-mode drivers to access your CD-ROM drive. To determine
  this, follow these steps:
  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click System.

  c. Click the Device Manager tab.

     If a CD-ROM device is listed, you are using protected-mode drivers. Follow
     the steps in the "Reducing Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching" section
     later in this article. If a CD-ROM device is not listed, use the steps in
     the "Reducing Real-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching" section.

  Reducing Real-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching
  ---------------------------------------

  To reduce CD-ROM data caching if you are using real-mode drivers, follow these
  steps:
  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click System.

  c. On the Performance tab, click File System.

  d. Click the CD-ROM tab.

  e. In the Optimize Access Pattern For box, click No Read-Ahead.

  f. Click OK, and then click Close.

  g. If you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

  Reducing Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drive Caching
  --------------------------------------------

  To reduce CD-ROM data caching if you are using protected-mode drivers, follow
  these steps:
  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click System.

  c. On the Performance tab, click File System.

  d. Click the CD-ROM tab.

  e. In the Optimize Access Pattern For box, click No Read-Ahead.

     NOTE: Selecting a faster speed than is appropriate for your CD-ROM drive
     does not necessarily increase performance.

  f. Make sure the Supplemental Cache Size slider is set all the way to the
     left (the Small setting), and then click OK.

  g. Click OK, and then click Close.

  h. If you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

6. If the issue continues to occur, contact your hardware manufacturer to
  inquire about obtaining the most recent BIOS updates and drivers for your
  CD-ROM drive.
