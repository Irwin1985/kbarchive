SUMMARY
=======

In general, running the Edbutil program with the repair option against the
directory should never be done on a production server. The repair option is
invoked by using the defragment (/d) and the recovery (/r) parameters together.
Using these two parameters together is not the same as running the utility
twice, once with each parameter.

Running /d and /r together can cause unpredictable problems with the directory.
Once this command is run, it may never be possible to fully recover the
directory. Unpredictable results may include symptoms such as the inability for
this server to see new servers added to the site, or the inability to add
connectors to this server.

If a Dir.edb file has been modified by running Edbutil /d /r /ds, it should not
be used in a production environment unless specifically recommended by a
Microsoft Support Professional.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When /d /r are used together, they function differently than when they are used
separately, one after the other. When used together, these parameters indicate
that the Edbutil utility should repair the database while defragmenting it. This
process eliminates unreadable data from the database. Some of this data may be
required for the operation of the service, and may not be recoverable.

When Edbutil is run against the Priv.edb or Pub.edb files, the Isinteg -fix
utility can be used to "clean up" any problems that the combination of the /d /r
switches might have created. In the case of the Dir.edb file, however, there is
no such utility. Because it is working in conjunction with the directories of
all of the other servers in the site, missing entries in one Dir.edb file can
cause problems throughout the site.

In most cases, if the directory is in an inconsistent state, Edbutil /r /ds
should return it to a consistent state and the database can be used in
production. In some cases, it may require running Edbutil /d /r /ds to return
the directory to a consistent state. If this is done and no changes are made to
the database, then it may be possible to use this directory in a production
environment. This determination can only be made by running Edbutil /d /r /ds on
the directory on a recovery computer after Edbutil /r /ds has failed to make the
file consistent. Look at the entries in the application event log after the
utility is run. If there are no events in the 41 to 50 range with the source
EDB, then the only modification made by the utility was to mark the file as
being in a consistent state. Please contact a PSS engineer before using such a
directory in a production system.

In a disaster recovery situation where the directory (Dir.edb) has become
corrupted, it may make sense to run the utility with these parameters to reclaim
the directory information by means of an Export. Once the directory is confirmed
to be corrupted, it must be restored from backup, or Exchange Server will need
to be reinstalled from scratch to create a new directory file. In the situation
where Exchange Server must be reinstalled from scratch, running Edbutil /d /r
/ds on a recovery computer makes sense to get the directory to a state where a
Tools/Directory Export can be run from the Exchange Administrator program to
export the mailboxes, custom recipients, and distribution lists (DLs) to .csv
files. These files can then be imported to the production server to bring back
all the information about the mailboxes, custom recipients, and DLs into the new
(empty) directory after the information store has been restored.
