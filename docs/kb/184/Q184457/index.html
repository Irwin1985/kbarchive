-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send message in Rich Text Format from a Microsoft Mail postoffice to a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer through a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) gateway and the Internet Mail Service, and then reply to the message, you
may receive a non-delivery report. This problem occurs if the original message
is also addressed to a recipient on the Microsoft Mail postoffice, and the
recipient on the Exchange Server postoffice includes the Microsoft Mail
recipient in their reply.

Note that if you view the properties for the Microsoft Mail recipient before you
send the reply, the recipient's Microsoft Mail address is displayed instead of
their SMTP address.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Request for Comments (RFC) 822 recipient
information in the message is replaced with transport-neutral encapsulation
format (TNEF) recipient information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Exchange Server 5.0
-------------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.

This fix has been posted to the following Internet location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg5.0/Post-SP2-STORE/


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.



MORE INFORMATION

replaced with TNEF recipient information when the message is converted to TNEF.
