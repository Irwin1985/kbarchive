-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Direct Mail Manager for Windows 
- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an envelope from Microsoft Direct Mail Manager (DMM) to an
Hewlett-Packard (HP) 692C DeskJet printer, you may see one of the following
symptoms:

- The delivery and return addresses may be printed upside down.

  -or-

- The return address may be printed too far from the edge of the envelope.

CAUSE
=====

Envelopes are Printing Upside Down
----------------------------------

The Clockwise Rotation option is turned off and the envelope is being fed into
the printer according to the printer specifications.

NOTE: To locate the Clockwise Rotation option, click Envelopes And Labels on the
Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Printing Options tab.

Return Address is Printed Too Far in from the Edge of the Paper
---------------------------------------------------------------

When printing envelopes in landscape orientation, the return address is printed
on the trailing edge of the envelope (the bottom). That causes the return
address to be printed about an inch in from the edge of the envelope to avoid
the unprintable region specified by the printer. This causes the return address
not to print near the edge of the envelope.

WORKAROUND
==========

Envelopes Are Printing Upside Down
----------------------------------

If your envelope is printed with the delivery and return addresses upside down,
rotate the envelope 180 degrees before placing it in the manual feeder of your
printer and then print it.

Return Address Is Printed Too Far in from the Edge of the Paper
---------------------------------------------------------------

Reset the envelope feed option in Word and feed the envelopes into the printer
the way that Word describes rather than how the Microsoft Direct Mail Manager or
your printer manual explains. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a new document.

2. On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels, and then click the Envelopes
  tab.

3. Click Options.

4. Click the Printing Options tab.

5. Select the following options:

  a. Clockwise Rotation.

  b. Face Down.

  c. The third image from the right under Feed Method.

6. Click OK.

7. Click Add To Document.

8. On the File menu, click Exit. You do not need to save the document.

9. Feed your envelope into the printer feeder with the upper right-hand corner
  facing the printer, face down, and the flap toward the left.

  NOTE: These instructions are different than the instructions in the Deskjet
  Manual or the instructions provided by DMM.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

How To Print Envelopes From Direct Mail Manager
-----------------------------------------------

1. In Direct Mail Manager, import your address list, verify your addresses, edit
  the address list, and check for duplicate addresses (steps 1 and 2 in the
  DMM).

2. When Direct Mail Manager prompts you with "How would you like to send your
  mailing" (step 3 in the DMM), click to select "Quick and Simple - First Class
  Mail" and then click Next.

3. When Direct Mail Manager prompts you with "Design your mailpiece here," click
  the Design button.

4. In the Mailpiece Design Options dialog box, do the following:

  a. Click the Media tab.

     1. Under Media Types, select Envelopes.

     2. In the Size box, under Media Details, select the type of envelope you
        want and click OK.

  b. Click the Delivery Address tab and make the changes you want.

  c. Click the Return Address tab and make the changes you want.

  d. Click OK.

5. Click Next.

6. Under Printer, select your DeskJet printer. Under Feed From, select Manual
  Feed. Under Orientation, select Landscape.

  NOTE: When you select Manual Feed, you will need to feed the envelopes in the
  printer one at a time and press the Load Paper button on your DeskJet printer
  each time you put in a new envelope. However, if your DeskJet printer rollers
  are working correctly, you may be able to place up to 10 envelopes in the
  tray at once. However, if the rollers pull more multiple envelopes at a time,
  you will need to feed the envelopes one at a time.

7. Click OK.
