SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent from Microsoft Mail to Exchange through the Microsoft Mail
Connector interchange (MSMI) using a Japanese Outlook client fail to be
delivered to their destination. The sender receives a non-delivery report (NDR)
similar to the following:

  Your Message

    To:      'someone@microsoft.com'
       Subject:  Test Message From Kanji Outlook/MSMail

  Was not delivered for the following reasons:

       Delivery failed to MS:MICROSOFT/DOGHOUSE/SOMEONE
       Reason: 0 (transfer failed)
       diagnostic: -1 (no diagnostic).
       MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:DogHouse:PAUL11.

  Original message body follows...

The following events are logged in the event log when the message results in an
NDR:

       Event ID:   2025

       Event ID:   290
       Source:     MSExchangeMTA
       Description:
       A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and
       diagnostic code Omit any diagnostic code) is being generated
       for message C=US;A= ;P=Microsoft;L=MICROSOFT-DOGHOUSE-
       00000287. It was originally destined for
       DN:/o=Microsoft/ou=DogHouse/cn=Recipients/cn=Someone&lt;A7&gt;
       (recipient number 1), and was to be redirected to . [MTA
       DISP:RESULT 20 136] (12)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Microsoft Exchange information store receives the
message from the MTA and detects that there are two MAPI Properties for strings
within the message that have conflicting code page IDs. The information store
sends an NDR on the message because the discrepancy was encountered.

This problem does not occur if the Kanji Exchange client is used instead of the
Kanji Outlook client. This is because the Kanji Outlook client includes four
additional MAPI Properties for the TNEF portion of the message, one of which is
an additional string property containing a code page ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
