MORE INFORMATION
================

Ambiguous LabFiles Folder References
------------------------------------

There are many references to files throughout this book using the
LabFiles\ChapterX\&lt;filename&gt; format. This format assumes the files are in
the C:\LabFiles folder.

Correction:

Change all LabFiles\Chapter... references to C:\LabFiles\Chapter...


Page xviii - xxii: Discrepancies in where to find specific skills in the book
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The table on page xviii states that information on "... replacing other Internet
browsers. ...Explorer 3.x and Netscape Navigator ..." can be referenced in
"Chapter 1, Lesson 2". However, it is not referenced at all in the book. The
same is true on page xxi, and similarly on page xxii, where it states that
Chapter 10 Lesson 1 contains information on appropriate tools for
troubleshooting "IP configuration, PING, Trace route, Network Monitor, and
Nslookup".


Page xxv: Publish Files Instructions Are Unclear
------------------------------------------------

Page xxv states "Publish the following files as Web pages using Internet
Information Server (IIS)." However, there are no instructions telling the reader
how to publish the files using IIS.

Step 8 on page xxiv instructs the reader to copy the \LabFiles folder to the Web
site folder. This step is all that is needed to publish the lab files mentioned
on page xxv.

Page xxv: Remove the first sentence "Publish the following files as Web pages
using Internet Information Server (IIS)."

Page xxv: Remove the two-column table containing the list of Files and Publish
as.


Lab File Installation Instructions Unclear for Chapters 2-6 and 10
------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 all use lab files from the CD-ROM; however the
installation instructions are not clear for these chapters.

CORRECTIONS
-----------

Page xxv, below file list: Add the following text below the text on page xxv (the
first line is bold with an arrow bullet):

  To install the practice lab files to the hard disk:

1. Copy the \LabFiles folder and all subfolders from the CD-ROM to C:\LabFiles
  on your hard disk.

This assumes that the lab files are installed to the C:\ folder. Adjust the steps
in this book if you installed to a different hard disk or folder.

Page 23, second to last sentence: Change "...as described in the "About This
book" section." To "...as described near the end of the "About This Book"
section."

Page 43, last sentence: Change "...on your computer." To "...to C:\LabFiles on
your hard disk (as described at the end of the "About This Book" section of this
book)."

Page 61, last sentence: Change "...on your computer." To "...to C:\LabFiles on
your hard disk (as described at the end of the "About This Book" section of this
book)."

Page 77, last sentence: Change "...on your computer." To "...to C:\LabFiles on
your hard disk (as described at the end of the "About This Book" section of this
book)."

Page 92, last bullet: Change "...on your computer." To "...to C:\LabFiles on your
hard disk (as described at the end of the "About This Book" section of this
book)."

Page 181, below last sentence: Add the following sentence in a new paragraph
below the last sentence:

  Install the Chapter 10 Lab files from the Course Materials CD-ROM in the
  LabFiles\Chap10 folder to C:\LabFiles on your hard disk (as described at the
  end of the "About This Book" section of this book)."


Chapter 6: Lab Files Are Incorrectly Configured
-----------------------------------------------

Chapter 6 relies on Classcomp.cdf and Classcomp.htm, but these files are not in
the proper location and need additional changes to work properly.


Corrections: Correct \demos\chapter6\classcomp.htm to contain the Day2.htm
content.

Move Classcomp.htm from \demos\chapter6 to \labfiles\chapter6.

Correct \Labfiles\chapter6\Classcomp.cdf by changing the two

   //Instructor/component/ references to //Instructor/labfiles/chapter6/.

Page xxv, list of files: Remove the row referencing the \component folder and
/component Web share.

Page 92: Remove the first bullet referencing Day1.htm and Day2.htm.

Page 92: Replace the fourth bullet referencing the /component Web share with:
Edit the \labfiles\chapter6\classcomp.cdf file using Notepad and change the two
//Instructor/ references to

   //your_machine_name.

NOTE: The online book also contains the text for pages xxv and 92 and should have
the same text changes applied.

Day2.htm can be added to Classcomp.htm, but several minor changes are necessary
for the HTML to work properly. Microsoft Press has prepared a downloadable patch
file that will resolve this problem.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  ie4tkfix.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/ie4095/MSPRESS/2.0/W9X2KMe/EN-US/ie4tkfix.exe)

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


Page 55: SelectC.htm is not included on CD-ROM
----------------------------------------------

Page 55, exercise 5, step 1 asks you to open the file
\Labfiles\Chapter3\SelectC.htm. However, SelectC.htm is not included on the
CD-ROM.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Internet Explorer 4
Training."


Page 56: Code Error
-------------------

Page 56, Exercise 6:
Change:
For nCounter = 1 to 30
Document.Write "This is a loop" &amp; counter &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;"
Next

To:
For nCounter = 1 to 30
Document.Write "This is a loop" &amp; nCounter &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;"
Next


Page 100: Incorrect Reference to Network Neighborhood
-----------------------------------------------------

Correction:
Page 100, paragraph 2, sentence 1:
Change "Netscape Navigator"
To "Network Neighborhood"


Page 182: IEAK 4.0 License and Registration availability
--------------------------------------------------------

The License and Registration for IEAK 4.0 is still available at
http://ieak.microsoft.com, even though this site now features IEAK 5.0.
To obtain the IEAK 4 code you need to register for IEAK 5.0 as a new user, or
have an existing account.
If you register as a new user, you can use your registration ID and password to
review your registration information, and then select the option to get the 4.x
code.


\Labfiles\chapter2\test.htm Shows a Blank Web Page
--------------------------------------------------

When Step 2 on page 28 is performed, the hyperlink
http://your_machine_name/labfiles/chapter2/test.htm displays a blank page. Upon
further inspection, the title for this page contains the entire HTML page
contents and several HTML tags.

This behavior is caused by an error in \labfiles\chapter2\test.htm. There is no
&lt;/TITLE&gt; tag to end the page title.

Correction:

In \labfiles\chapter2\Test.htm: Change "&lt;TITLE&gt;Welcome!&lt;TITLE&gt;" To
"&lt;TITLE&gt;Welcome!&lt;/TITLE&gt;"


CD-ROM: \Labfiles\Chapter3\Answer Is Incomplete
-----------------------------------------------

The answers for the exercises in Chapter 3 are contained in
\Labfiles\Chapter3\Answer. However, exercises 5 and 6 are not included in this
directory.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Internet Explorer 4
Training."


Online Book: ClassComp.cdf URL Inaccurate
-----------------------------------------

In the Online book (\Ebook\IE4TST.chm), the classcomp.cdf URL for Chapter 6,
Exercise 2 is inaccurate.

Correction:
Change "http://your_machine_name/labfiles/ClassComp.cdf"

To "http://your_machine_name/labfiles/Chapter6/ClassComp.cdf"
