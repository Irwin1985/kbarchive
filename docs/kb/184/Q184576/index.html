IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When the 3270 Datastream Order, Program Tab (0x05) is received by the print
service, it is interpreted as a horizontal tab, and three space characters are
placed in the print output. However, sometimes the Program Tab will resolve to
only two spaces. This problem appears to occur at random.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix or service pack mentioned in this
article. With the updated SNA Print Server fix applied, you can map tabs to a
fixed number of spaces based on the size of the first tab in the Set Horizontal
Format SCS control code. To do this, perform the steps below after applying the
hotfix. WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious
problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry
Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
NOTE: The registry entry below needs to be created even if a Service Pack is
applied. The registry entry is not created by the Service Pack.

1. Start RegEdt32.exe.

2. Navigate to the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \SnaPrint\Parameters

3. Add SetFixedTabs = 'TRUE' (the type is REG_SZ).

4. Stop and Start SNA Print Service for registry change to take effect.
