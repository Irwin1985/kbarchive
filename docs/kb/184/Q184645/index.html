SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you how to create a lightweight control in Visual Basic
version 6.0, briefly covers the advantages and limitations of lightweight
controls, and contains instructions on how to create a sample project that
demonstrates how lightweight controls use less system resources.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Lightweight, or windowless controls, are controls that are similar to regular
controls except that lightweight controls do not have window handles. Because of
they lack window handles, lightweight controls require less system resources,
making them ideal for Internet applications, distributed applications, or any
application where limited system resources may be an issue. Further, lightweight
controls can be any shape and have true transparency properties.

When you create a lightweight control, the container can hold only other
lightweight controls. If you try to place a regular control in a lightweight
user control, you will receive the following error:

  Can't have windowed child controls on a windowless control.

Regular controls always appear on top of lightweight controls because lightweight
controls use the resources of the parent form. The ZOrder of a regular control
changes only with respect to other regular controls.

Because lightweight controls do not have a Hwnd property, you cannot use these
controls with Windows API functions that require an HWnd parameter. The HWnd
property of the container is used instead, which may result in unpredictable
results.

To make a control into a lightweight control, set the Windowless property of the
control to True.

Visual Basic ships with intrinsic lightweight controls and other lightweight
controls in the ActiveX component file MSWLess.ocx. For a list of these
intrinsic controls and instructions on how to use the controls in the ActiveX
component file MSWLess.ocx, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q184687 INFO: Lightweight Controls in Visual Basic 6.0

The next section tells you how to create a sample project that contains a
lightweight control. The sample project demonstrates that a lightweight control
uses less resources than a regular control.

Creating the Sample Project
---------------------------

This section shows you how to create the sample project. The project measures the
amount of time to load and unload a lightweight control as compared to a regular
control. To create this project, you need to create a Standard EXE project, a
lightweight control, and a regular control.

To Create the Standard EXE Program
----------------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add the following controls to the Form1 form and set the following properties
  to the appropriate controls:

     Control           Default Name     Property               Setting

           txtNumofControls.Text = "20"
        End Sub

4. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program. If the
  form successfully launches, then you have completed creating the standard
  executable program in this project.

The next section shows you how to create the regular and lightweight controls
that the standard executable program uses.

To Create the Regular and Lightweight Controls
----------------------------------------------

1. Add an ActiveX Control project to your project group.

  a. On the File menu, click Add Project. The Add Project dialog box appears.

  b. In the New Tab, select ActiveX Control.

  c. Click Open to add the project to your project group and to close the Add
     Project dialog box. UserControl1 is created by default.

  d. Change the name of UserControl1 to ctrlWnd. This will be your regular
     control.

2. Add a combo box to the ctrlWnd control. Save the control.

3. Add another UserControl by completing the following steps. This will be your
  lightweight control:

  1. On the Project Menu, click Add User Control. The Add User Control dialog
     box appears with User Control highlighted.

  2. Click Open to add the User Control to the project and close the Add User
     Control dialog box. UserControl1 is created by default.

  3. Change the name of UserControl1 to ctrlWndLess.

  4. Set the Windowless property to True.

4. Save the control.

5. Rename the Project to TestControls. Save the project.

You have completed creating the ActiveX controls required by this project. To run
the project, press F5 or from the Run menu, click Start. You can set the number
of controls and compare the load and unload times.
