MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xviii: Text Errors
-----------------------

Page xviii has two text errors (misspelled/garbled words): 4th bullet: "Each
lesson ends with a short summary of the material presenteda set of review
questions..."

"presenteda set of " should be: "presented and a set of"

Last paragraph: "Because there are two exams associated with Windows Architure
for..."

"Architure" should be: "Architecture"


Chapter 1: System Monitor Not Included with Windows NT 4.0
----------------------------------------------------------

The back cover of Microsoft Windows Architecture for Developers states that you
can complete this kit's lessons using Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 or
Microsoft Windows 95. However, many of the labs in chapter one make extensive
use of a Windows 95 utility called System Monitor. Windows NT 4.0 does not
include System Monitor.

Microsoft Press is investigating this problem and will post further information
when available.


Page 19: File Name Refers Only To Windows NT
--------------------------------------------

On page 19, under "Paging", the following statement is made: "To maximize its
flexibility in managing memory, the kernel can move pages of physical memory to
and from a paging file (Pagefile.sys) on a disk. When a page is moved in
physical memory, the kernel updates the page maps of the affected processes."

The filename: "Pagefile.sys" only refers to Windows NT. No mention is made of the
Windows 95 paging file, (Win386.swp).


Page 26: Text Error
-------------------

Page 26 illustrates the three dynamic link libraries: User32, GDI32, and
Kernel32. However, Kernel32 is misspelled in the text and in the illustration.
Specifically:

Text: "The core code of Win32 API is primarily made up of three dynamic link
libraries (DLLs): USER32, GDI32, and KERNAL32."

"Kernal32" should be "Kernel32".

Figure 1.10: Box in lower right-hand corner, "KERNAL32".

This should read "KERNEL32".


Page 29: Regedit.exe is Windows 95 Tool Only
--------------------------------------------

Page 29, section "Registry Editor": Change sentence to read as follows:

In Windows 95, the registry can be viewed or modified with the Registry Editor
(REGEDIT.EXE), located in the \Windows folder. In Windows NT, the registry
editor is called REGEDT32.EXE.


Page 30: Text Error
-------------------

Page 30, paragraph 2, sentence 2:
Change: "...(typically USER.DAT)."

To: "...(typically USER.DAT), and a file containing settings used universally by
the system (typically SYSTEM.DAT)."


Page 35: Correction for Question 2
----------------------------------

On page 35, change question 2 from:
"What technique does Windows 95 and Windows NT use to run 16-bit applications?"

To:
"What technique does Windows 95 and Windows NT use to call a 16-bit function from
a 32-bit application?"


Personal Web Server Exercises Cannot Be Run in NT 4.0
-----------------------------------------------------

Page 42 starts a section of exercises using applications which involve the use of
Personal Web Server for Windows 95. The exercises are: "Using FTP", "Configuring
TCP/IP", "WINIPCFG", and "TRACERT".

These exercises cannot be performed as stated on systems with NT 4.0. On NT 4.0
Server, Internet Information Server is the replacement for Personal Web Server.
The steps will need to be adapted for use with Microsoft Internet Information
Server.

Microsoft Press is aware of this issue and will post further information when
available.


Chapter 4 Requirements: NWind.mdb Cannot Be Read-Only
-----------------------------------------------------

The exercises in Chapter 4 ask you to interface to a database on the CD-ROM using
Excel and Visual Basic:

 \WA\Practice\NWind.mdb

This database is Read-Only, and accessing it gives an error. The workaround is to
copy the database to a temporary file and clear the 'Read-Only' property. Then
at each point in the lesson where the \WA\Practice\Nwind.mdb file is mentioned,
substitute instead the temporary file (for example, c:\temp\Nwind.mdb). The
exercise will then run properly.


Chapter 6 Requirements: Need Customized MS Access Installed
-----------------------------------------------------------

In order to successfully complete the exercises in Chapter 6, you must have
installed Microsoft Access using the Custom installation option.

In the Custom installation, you must have installed "Replicate Using My
Briefcase" for the exercises to work correctly.


Chapter 7: ODBC Direct &amp; RDO Exercises Require DSN To Be Set
------------------------------------------------------------

Pages 209 and 216 of Chapter 7 show 2 exercises which use ODBC Direct and RDO
(respectively) to retrieve data into an application from the Northwind
database.

Both exercises contain a connection statement where "DSN=nwind"; however, this
DSN setting does not work and the applications halt without performing data
retrieval.

The DSN must be set manually, and instructions need to be added to the chapter
which describe this procedure.

Microsoft Press is aware of this problem and will post further information when
available.


Page 261: FrontPage/VBScript Example Does Not Work in NT 4.0 Server
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Lesson 2 of Chapter 9 discusses Using Microsoft VBScript for Client Side
Scripting, and contains an exercise on pages 260-61 which the student should
work through. However, using Windows NT 4.0 (Server), this exercise cannot be
completed.

Microsoft Press is aware of this issue and will post further information when
available.


Page 351: Text Error
--------------------

Page 351, question 5, sentence 2:
Change: "TAPI"
To: "LSAPI"


Page 426: Text Error in Question &amp; Answers
------------------------------------------

On page 426 of "Questions and Answers", Question 19 from Chapter 1 reads:

1. "How many threads are active? (increases by 1)"

For systems running Windows 95, this is incorrect; the answer should be
"(increases by 2)". This question refers to the exercise on examining threads
which starts on page 13 of Chapter 1. In the exercise, on a system running
Windows 95, using System Monitor to observe the number of Kernel Threads after
opening an MS-DOS Window shows that 2 more threads are added.


Readme.txt Gives Incorrect Version Requirements
-----------------------------------------------

The Readme.txt file in the root directory of the companion disc states, in part:

  If you want to use the online portion of this book, you will need to have
  Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x or later installed on your computer.

However, the online portion of the book requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0
or later.

Correction:
Change: "Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.x"
To: "Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0"


CD-ROM: AVI Files Do Not Launch From E-Book
-------------------------------------------

The lessons included as multimedia files in the \AVI subdirectory of the CD-ROM
do not launch from the E-Book.

In the E-Book in the section: "About the Online Book", it is stated: "The CD-ROM
also includes an on-line version of the book that you can use to launch
demonstrations, link to all of the referenced articles, and view on-screen as
you work through the exercises."

To launch the multimedia file, use Windows Explorer to navigate to the \AVI
subdirectory, then select the file to launch.

This error will be corrected in a future edition of the Windows Architecture for
Developers Training kit.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of the book, it may already
contain the above corrections.
