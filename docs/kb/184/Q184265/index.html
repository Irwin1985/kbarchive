-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.0, 2.1 SP2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Redistributing ADO, Remote Data Services (RDS), and other Microsoft Data Access
Components correctly and safely with the Visual Basic 5.0 Application Setup
Wizard is done by SHELLing out and running the MDAC_TYP.exe.

You can download the latest version of MDAC_TYP.exe from the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article assumes you have ADO is already installed on your computer.

The MDAC_TYP.exe setup includes only the binaries necessary to redistribute the
components; it doesn't include documentation. This file can then be called from
Setup1.frm's QueryUnload method.

Note that in addition to MDAC_TYP.exe, you may need to distribute DCOM95 for your
Windows 95 clients. DCOM must be installed prior to the installation of MDAC.
Note that Windows 2000, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 98 have DCOM built in. You
can download the latest version of DCOM95 from the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/com

Note that DCOM must be installed separately and before MDAC_TYP.exe and your
Setup program. DCOM cannot be installed from within your Setup program.

How ADO and the Application Setup Wizard Interact
-------------------------------------------------

Currently, it is not possible to correctly install ADO/DB components with the
Visual Basic Setup Wizard for Visual Basic 5.0 applications. This is due to
several limitations in both ADO/DB required components and the Visual Basic
Setup Wizard described below:

- ADO and OLE-DB components, for future compatibility, must be registered in
  specific locations, for example:

     \program files\common files\system\ado
     \program files\common files\system\ole db
 

- The Visual Basic Setup Wizard, when registering a DLL, does not change the
  directory to the location of the DLL being registered.

- The OLE-DB DLL, Msdatl.dll, which is required for other OLE-DB components
  that ADO uses to register, is not self-registering. When Visual Basic
  attempts to register those DLLs, Msdatl.dll is not found in the "...\OLE DB"
  directory. Because the DLLs fail to register, ADO also fails to register.

The MDAC Setup may have to restart the system, depending on what the user has
loaded in memory when setup is started. Thus, the Shell command is used to spawn
the MDAC setup. Using SHELL allows for Setup1 and Setup to exit properly and to
clean up after themselves.

Distributing ADO with the Application Setup Wizard
--------------------------------------------------

To redistribute your own ADO/DB-based project, complete each of the following
steps: (You can safely ignore warnings about no dependency information for
ADODB.)

1. The MDAC redistribution file is MDAC_TYP.exe, which includes the OLE DB
  providers for SQL Server, Access, and Oracle; the ODBC drivers for SQL
  Server, Access, and Oracle; ADO; and RDS.

2. Make a copy of the ..VB\Setupkit\Setup1 folder.

3. Open the Setup1.vbp file in the ..VB\Setupkit\Setup1 folder.

4. Add the following code and comments to frmSetup1.frm's QueryUnload method:

        'Variable used to string path and EXE together.
        Dim progname As String
        'Global gstrDestDir As String      'dest dir for application files
        'gstrDestDir is defined earlier in basSetup1.bas
        'Uncommenting the line below hides the file on the user's machine.
        'This may be desired if it will be left on the user's machine after
        'the install. Note, the application's Uninstall routine will remove
        'this file, though.

         SetAttr gstrDestDir &amp; "MDAC_TYP.exe", vbHidden

        'All the calls below invoke MDAC Setup in a Quiet mode, meaning no
        'choices or options for the user to select or choose, "Setup.exe /Q".

        'The first two methods provide a minimum of a standard setup
        'background and thermometer bar window showing the progress of the
        'install. The first install methods are the most user-friendly.

        'When setup is called with "/Q0" it exits with a Message box
        'notifying the user it completed successfully. It also tells the
        'user if it is necessary to reboot the system to complete the
        'installation and gives the choice to reboot now or later.

  SetAttr gstrDestDir &amp; "MDAC_TYP.exe", vbHidden

        

        'Setup called with "/Q1" is the same as "/Q0" but exits without any
        'notification to the user that it installed successfully. It also
        'does not provide any notification that it is about to reboot the
        'system - if necessary.

        'progname = gstrDestDir &amp; "mdacrdst.exe /q /c:" &amp; Chr(34) &amp; _
                    "setup.exe /Q1" &amp; Chr(34) &amp; ""

        'When called with "/QT", almost everything is hidden and almost zero
        'feedback is given to the user that an install is occurring or when
        'it is finished. This method is probably the least favorable.

        'progname = gstrDestDir &amp; "mdac_typ.exe /q /c:" &amp; Chr(34) &amp; _
                       "setup.exe /QT" &amp; Chr(34) &amp; ""

        'Spawns the MDAC installation.
        Shell progname, vbNormalFocus

5. Save the project and rebuild the Setup1.EXE.

6. Start the Application Setup Wizard and point it toward the desired project.

7. By default, in the "ActiveX Server Components" step, Msado15.dll is checked.
  Uncheck it. This is because mdac_typ.exe will install and register all the
  necessary components for ADO to run.

8. In the File Summary step, add "file: MDAC_TYP.exe" if a "Floppy disk" or
  "Disk Directories" was the chosen method for distribution. If "Single
  Directory" method was chosen, it may be desirable not to add MDAC_TYP.exe. By
  not adding the file in "Single Directory" method, the mdacrdst.exe is run
  from the install directory and not copied to the application's install
  directory. This is useful for CD distributions or net installs where it is
  not desirable to have a copy of the MDAC_TYP.exe on the client machine.

9. In the final step, save as a template, and then go ahead and generate the
  distribution.

10. Before running your application's Setup program, you should ensure that your
  Windows 95-based clients have DCOM installed. DCOM must be installed prior
  to installing MDAC_TYP.EXE. Note that Windows 2000, Windows NT 4.0, and
  Windows 98 have DCOM built in.
