Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
------------------------------------

Windows NT Server includes the following added features for this service update
release to Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) and WINS Manager:

- Manual removal of dynamic WINS database records.

- Multi-select operations for WINS database records.

- Burst mode handling for WINS servers.

WINS Manager
------------

WINS Manager now provides improved database management through support for record
multi-selection and the ability to remove dynamic-type WINS records from the
WINS server database.

Manual Removal of Dynamic WINS Database Records:

The ability to manually delete dynamically-registered names mappings from the
WINS database is now a part of WINS Manager. Because this support was not
provided in previous versions of WINS Manager, deletion was difficult, requiring
the advanced use of certain command line tools, such as Winscl.exe, a tool
provided by the previous Windows NT Server resource kits.

NOTE: Dynamic mappings are added to the WINS database when clients start and
register their names in WINS before joining the network. Static mappings are
administratively added to the WINS database by a network administrator and can
be edited or removed in the same manner.

Deletion is a useful practice for clearing up problems where dynamic WINS records
are not fully consistent with currently stored mappings that have been
replicated to other remote WINS servers. In addition, by allowing deletion of
dynamic WINS mappings, WINS administrators can eliminate the practice of using
static WINS mappings to correct name resolution problems which can create
further problems for WINS.

NOTE: The use of static WINS mappings is not recommended for clients that can
directly perform dynamic registration of their names in WINS. Where static
mappings are used to resolve connectivity issues and provide domain logon
support for WINS clients, these mappings can cause additional problems or be
difficult to fully remove from large WINS installations with multiple points of
replications.

You can delete records in two ways: simple deletion or tombstoned deletion. With
simple deletion, the selected WINS records are only removed from the selected
WINS server that is actively being managed using WINS Manager. With simple
deletion, records that are deleted are not removed or modified on other WINS
servers. This method can be useful for making a "quick deletion" of selected
records on a single WINS server. For this method of deletion to be effective,
you must make certain that the deleted records do not still appear on other WINS
servers used in replication.

NOTE: If records are removed from a server using simple deletion but still exist
in WINS data on other servers, the deleted records may reappear on the server
where deletion was made when replication next occurs with other WINS servers.

Perform the following steps to use simple or tombstoned deletion:

1. Start WINS Manager.

2. Click Mappings, and then click Show Database.

3. Select the records you want to delete or tombstone.

4. Click Delete Mapping. The Confirm Deletion dialog box appears.

5. For Operation, click Delete to perform simple deletion of the records on the
  selected WINS server or Tombstone to tombstone the records for eventual
  deletion of the records on all WINS servers.

6. If a single record is selected, click Yes to delete. If multiple records are
  selected, click Yes to All to delete all selected records.

How Tombstoning Works
---------------------

With tombstoning, the "tombstoned" records are marked as extinct on the WINS
server and immediately removed from active use by the server for WINS name
resolution. However, these mappings are not immediately deleted from the
server's database. Instead, the tombstoned records remain present for
replication purposes so that other WINS servers are notified as well that these
records are inactive in WINS. After the deleted records are marked as tombstoned
on all WINS servers where they have been replicated, the records will then be
removed during subsequent scavenging operations performed on each server.

To use tombstoning effectively, you should only tombstone WINS records on the
WINS server that is the original owner for the records to be deleted.

IMPORTANT: In most cases, WINS records should be tombstoned at the original
owning WINS server to prevent deleted records from reappearing in WINS after
subsequent replication with other servers. Where a WINS server is no longer
active on the network, this is not a problem. For inactive owner servers, you
can use tombstoning effectively from other active WINS servers to remove records
owned by the inactive servers that are still present in WINS.

The owner of a given WINS server record is typically the first server contacted
by the WINS client during the registration process and the actual server first
used to register the client's local names in WINS. In most cases, the WINS
server that owns a client's name records in WINS will correspond to the primary
WINS server as configured on the WINS client computer. Where the configured
primary WINS server is not available during client registration, a configured
secondary WINS server may be used instead to perform the actual registration of
the client's names and become the owner. To verify the exact owner server for a
WINS record, view owner information in the Show Database dialog box using WINS
Manager.

Tombstoning uses the following sequence of events to remove the selected records
from all WINS servers that share and replicate the records to be tombstoned.

1. The owner WINS server marks and changes the status of selected WINS records
  from Active to Tombstoned in its local WINS server database.

  WINS then treats the records as inactive and released from use. After these
  records are tombstoned locally, the owner WINS server will not respond or
  resolve NetBIOS name queries for these names from other WINS clients and WINS
  servers unless the records are registered again by the WINS client.

2. The owner WINS server replicates the selected records as tombstoned to other
  WINS servers during subsequent replication cycles.

  The records are not forcibly and immediately removed from WINS, but are
  flagged or marked for eventual deletion. The exact replication cycle (or
  Extinct Interval) is set in the server's WINS database properties. The
  records are not removed from WINS data until the extinction interval has
  actually expired. This allows other WINS servers to be notified that these
  records are no longer in use, update their replicated mappings for these
  records, and further replicate this updated WINS data to other servers.

3. Records become extinct on all replicated WINS servers and are eventually
  removed physically from all WINS servers.

  After all WINS servers that participate in replication have completed a full
  replication cycle and arrived at a consistent state, the tombstoned records
  expire and are removed from each server's WINS database when it performs the
  next database scavenging operation. After scavenging occurs on all servers,
  the records no longer appear in WINS Manager and are no longer physically
  stored in the WINS database.

Multi-select Operations for WINS Database Records:

WINS Manager now provides support for deletion or removal operations to multiple
records in the Show Database dialog box. In previous versions of WINS Manager,
only one record could be selected at a time.

Burst Mode Handling for WINS Servers
------------------------------------

WINS servers can now support handling of high-volume, or burst server loads,
where a large number of WINS clients actively seek to register their local names
in WINS at the same time. With burst mode support, the WINS server can respond
positively to clients that submit registration requests before it has processed
and physically entered these updates in the WINS server database.

Burst mode uses a burst queue size as a threshold value to determine how many
name registration and name refresh requests sent by WINS clients will be
processed normally before burst mode handling is started. By default, the burst
queue is sized to allow 500 requests before burst handling is used.

How Burst Handling Works
------------------------

Burst handling is enabled for any WINS server running under Windows NT Server 4.0
with the current service pack update release applied. Where a WINS server
supports burst handling, the server will initiate burst handling once the number
of WINS client registration requests exceeds the burst queue size.

Burst handling is used to temporarily achieve a steady and gradual registration
state for the WINS server when the server is first started with a clean database
or when many WINS clients come online for the first time. Either situation can
cause a large amount of name registration and name refresh traffic to occur.

For burst handling, additional client requests beyond the amount specified by the
burst queue size are immediately answered with a positive success response by
the WINS server. The response also includes a varied time-to- live (TTL) to
clients to help regulate the client registration load and distribute processing
of the requests over time.

The purpose of using TTLs in the success responses is to slow the refresh and
retry rate for new WINS clients and regulate the burst of WINS client traffic.
For example, if the default burst queue size (500 entries) is used, the WINS
server will reply immediately to the next 100 WINS client registration requests
by sending early success responses that use a starting TTL value of 5 minutes.

For each additional round of 100 client requests, the TTL is incremented by the
WINS server to add 5 minutes (such as 10, 15, 20 minutes, and so on) until a
maximum of 50 minutes is used as the response TTL value. If WINS client traffic
is still arriving at bursted levels after the maximum TTL has been used to
answer clients, the next round of 100 client requests will be answered starting
over with the initial TTL value of 5 minutes and the entire process for
incrementing the response TTL is repeated.

This behavior will continue until the WINS server reaches its maximum intake
level of 25,000 name registration and refresh queries. At this point, the WINS
server will begin dropping queries.

Configuring Burst Mode Support:

You may use these additional registry values to further configure or disable
burst mode support where desired.

NOTE: By default, the following WINS registry values are not present and must be
manually added to reconfigure or disable burst mode support on the WINS server.
However, if you plan to use the default server behavior (which enables burst
mode handling at the WINS server using a default burst queue size of 500
entries), you will not need to add these Registry values or make any additional
configuration changes to the WINS server.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

- BurstQueSize

  You can add this registry value to adjust the maximum number of WINS client
  request entries that will be queued at the WINS server before it begins using
  burst handling.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \Wins\Parameters\BurstQueSize

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped For
  readability.

  Type:        REG_DWORD
  Default:     500
  Range:       Valid values are 50-5000

  Description: Sets the maximum number of name registration and refresh queries
  that are stored in the server's intake queue before burst handling is
  activated by the WINS server. This value has no effect where burst handling
  is disabled (for example, if the BurstHandling key has been added and set to
  a value of 0).

- BurstHandling

  You can add this registry value to disable the use of burst mode handling by
  the WINS server.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wins\Parameters
  \BurstHandling

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

  Type:        REG_DWORD
  Default:     1
  Range:       0 (disabled) or 1 (enabled)

  Description: This key determines whether the WINS server will use burst
  handling to send success responses to the clients in the queue. If the value
  of this entry is 0, the WINS server does not support burst handling or send
  early success responses to WINS clients. If the value of this entry is 1, the
  WINS server supports burst handling and sends early success responses to WINS
  clients.
