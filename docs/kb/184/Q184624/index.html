SYMPTOMS
========

When the cc:Mail connector is unable to resolve a cc:Mail address, it sends an
NDR (non-delivery report) back to the sender. This NDR, however, is generic and
lists all the cc:Mail recipients. The NDR does not indicate which recipient
address is bad.

The NDR contains the following:

- "This messages is From: cc:Mail Connector Interchange."

- The subject line is the original subject line preceded by the text

- "Undeliverable:"

- A new text body is created to notify the user that the message could not be
  delivered to one or more recipient addresses.

- The original text body of the messages is also attached to the messages.

- All other text and file attachments are discarded.

In cc:Mail when a message is addressed to a non existent user at a remote
postoffice (PO), the message is forwarded to the remote PO, and may be rejected
prior to delivery by the cc:Mail router session that connects directly to that
remote PO. The message is returned to the sender with the following changes:

- The "Forwarded by" (or From) block is changed to the user's name.

- A forwarding history is created in the message to indicate the reason why the
  mail was returned.

- The subject line is replaced by "Message not deliverable."

- The original subject is contained in the forwarding history.

- The message body is not changed.

The NDRs generated by cc:Mail back to the mailbox on the Exchange Server computer
list the unresolved recipients.
