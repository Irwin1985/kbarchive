Readme Notes for Certificate Server Update

Highlights
----------

This update to Microsoft Certificate Server applies to version 1.0 as
shipped with the Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack. The highlights of this
update are as follows:

- Teletex Encoding. Data encoded as teletex in a certificate request will be
  encoded as teletex data in the certificate issued. Formerly, this data would
  have been encoded as unicode in the certificate issued.

- Serial Number. Serial numbers generated during certificate issuance will
  always be positive. Formerly, these serial numbers were allowed to be
  negative. While this was consistent with X.509, it caused problems for
  certain restrictive mail clients.

- Backup/Restore. Specific backup requests are now supported, specifically for
  backing up keys and certificates. A Microsoft Knowledge Base article is
  available describing the procedural aspects of using this capability.

Be sure you are familiar with the release notes for the Certificate Server
originally distributed with the Windows NT Option Pack. Also, be sure you
get the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article on backup/restore of
keys and certificates.

  Q185195 : How to Use Key and Certificate Backup/Restore Utility

You can also get additional information on the installation of certificate
hierarchies for use with Microsoft Exchange Server from a white paper titled
"Creating Certificate Hierarchies with Microsoft Certificate Server
Version 1.0" that is available as a self-extracting .exe file (Hier3.exe)
on the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/downloads/LNP279.asp

Install Update
--------------

When you install or uninstall the Certificate Server, be sure to first
stop all services with the potential to cause file-locking conflicts. With
administrator privileges, you can enter the following commands at an MS-
DOS prompt:

  net stop iisadmin
  net stop certsvc

Follow the instructions displayed until both commands complete. You may
then install the updated Certificate Server.

If you are installing this update as an upgrade to a previously installed
version 1.0 Certificate Server, applying this update requires an
uninstall/reinstall of the Certificate Server. Values in the Certificate
Server registry and database will not preserved. An option is available to
preserve the keys of an existing certificate authority on reinstall.

To Uninstall Certificate Server
-------------------------------

1. Change directory to the directory containing the files downloaded from the
  Microsoft FTP site.

2. Start the uninstall process by typing the following:

   sysocmgr /i:certmast.inf /n

3. Select Uninstall by clearing the Certificate Server option and clicking Next.

To Reinstall Certificate Server (or install Certificate Server for the
first time)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Use the same directory and type the following:

  sysocmgr /i:cermast.inf /n

2. Select install by clicking the Certificate Server option and clicking Next.

3. If you want to preserve the keys of your previous certificate authority,
  click the Show Advanced Configuration box before you click Next.

4. On the Advanced Configuration page, click the Use Existing Keys box and
  highlight the name of the certificate authority to be preserved.

5. Click Next and proceed with install.
