-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the TCP/IP protocol with a server-based installation of Windows 95,
32-bit programs may be unable to resolve TCP/IP names using a DNS server. In
some circumstances, it may be possible to resolve NetBIOS names or host names on
the local DNS domain, but it may not be possible to resolve fully qualified
domain names (such as "yourhost.yourdomain.dom").

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 may not be able locate the Wsock32.dll file when installed as a
server-based installation. If this file is not found in the expected location,
or if more than one copy of this file is found in the search path, DNS name
resolution does not succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Create a System folder in the workstation's Windows folder, and then copy the
  Wsock32.dll file to the System folder. Repeat this step for each computer
  running a shared copy of Windows 95 on the network.

2. Add an entry for the System folder (from step 1) to the PATH statement in the
  Autoexec.bat file.

3. Rename or delete the Wsock32.dll file in the shared System folder, and in
  every other folder listed in the PATH statement. (You may want to remove
  unnecessary entries from the PATH statement.)

4. Make sure the following registry values point to the Wsock32.dll file in the
  System folder created in step 1:

     Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\ 
        Parameters\Winsock\HelperDllName

     Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Mstcp\ 
        ServiceProvider\ProviderPath

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
