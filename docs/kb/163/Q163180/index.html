The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Scenery created prior to the release of Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version
6.0 may require a manual installation to run correctly. Previous versions of
Flight Simulator were MS-DOS programs. The installation programs for these
MS-DOS programs may not work correctly with the new version of Flight Simulator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing scenery products shipped prior to the release of Flight Simulator for
Windows 95.

Microsoft
---------

- Expansion Pack for Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95.

  1. Insert the Flight Simulator compact disc into your CD-ROM drive. If
     Autorun is enabled, the Setup program will begin autoatically.

  2. If Autorun is not enabled, click the Start button, point to Settings, and
     click Control Panel.

  3. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

  4. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click the Install button. Setup will begin.
     Select your desired installation.

- Scenery Pack for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

  NOTE: If you have Microsoft Caribbean, Japan, Hawaii, or Scenery Pack 1, you
  must use the new Setup program provided on the Flight Simulator for Windows
  95 compact disc to set up those products.

  Do not install the Paris or New York scenery packages. These packages have
  been incorporated into Flight Simulator for Windows 95 and are installed
  automatically during the setup of Flight Simulator.

  To start the New Scenery Setup:

  1. Insert the Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95 compact disc into
     your CD-ROM drive.

  2. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

  3. In the Run dialog box, type "&lt;Drive&gt;:\scnsetup\setup.exe" (without
     the quotation marks) on the Open line, where &lt;Drive&gt; is the drive
     letter for you CD-ROM drive, and click OK.

  4. Follow the on screen instructions. Scenery Setup will ask which Scenery
     add-ons you are installing, and it will ask for your original Flight
     Simulator disks. Make sure you select ALL of the Scenery add-ons that you
     want to install.

  NOTE: Certain areas of New Scenery included with Flight Simulator for Windows
  95 are disabled to make these add-ons available. You can reactivate these
  areas by using the scenery library in Flight Simulator. For example, if you
  installed Hawaii, you should reactivate the North America scenery area.

  For more information about the scenery library, see the "Configuring and Using
  Scenery with the Scenery Library" section in this article. You will also find
  detailed information about the scenery library in the "Working With Scenery"
  topic under the "Using Flight Simulator Section" of Pilot's Help.

  If you decide to install additional Microsoft add-on scenery products (i.e.,
  Caribbean, Hawaii, Japan, or Scenery Pack 1), you will need to run the
  Scenery Setup again to uninstall any existing add-ons. Then run the Scenery
  Setup again and select ALL of the products you wish to install.

BAO Scenery Products
--------------------

Europe 1

NOTE: To use the BAO Europe 1 add-on scenery, you must copy files from your BAO
disks to a subfolder located in the folder where Flight Simulator for Windows 95
was installed. You must then run two .exe files and use the scenery library in
Flight Simulator to finish installing the BAO Europe scenery.

- To copy the files:

  1. Locate the folder where you installed Microsoft Flight Simulator for
     Windows 95. The default location is C:\Program
     Files\Microsoft\Games\Flight Simulator.

     NOTE: The steps below, refer to this folder as Fltsim.

  2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, click Disk1a.exe to select it.

     NOTE: Disk1a.exe is located on Disk 1 of Europe 1, or the Europe 1 compact
     disc.

     From the Edit menu, click Copy. Next, open the Fltsim folder and from the
     Edit menu, click Paste.

  3. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, open the Fltsim\Scenery folder. From
     the File menu, point to New, and then click Folder. When the new folder
     appears with a temporary name, type "Europe1" (without the quotation
     marks) for the new name. You will now see a new folder in your
     Fltsim\Scenery folder named Europe1.

  4. Copy Disk1.exe from the Europe 1 Disk 1 and Disk2.exe from the Europe 1
     Disk 2 to the Europe1 folder.

  5. Create two new folders in the Europe1 folder named SCENERY and TEXTURE.
     These folders should be located in the Fltsim\Scenery\Europe1 folder.

  6. From your Flight Simulator compact disc, copy the files in the \Scenery
     Setup\Europe1 folder to the Fltsim\Scenery\Europe1\Scenery folder on your
     hard disk.

  NOTE: For more information about performing these tasks in Windows, see your
  Windows printed documentation or online Help.

- To run Disk1.exe, Disk1a.exe, and Disk2.exe:

  NOTE: You should run these .exe files from an MS-DOS command prompt.

  1. Click on the Start button, point to Programs, and click MS-DOS Prompt.
     Change to the Fltsim folder on your hard disk by typing the following:

  cd fltsim

     Run the .exe by typing the following at the command prompt and pressing
     ENTER:

  disk1a

  2. When the files are finished expanding, type the following at the command
     prompt and press ENTER to delete the files:

  del disk1a.exe

  3. Change to the Fltsim\Scenery\Europe1 folder by typing the following at the
     command prompt and pressing ENTER:

  cd fltsim\scenery\europe1

     Run the .exe files by typing the following at the command prompt and
     pressing ENTER:

  disk1

     and then,

  disk2

  4. Delete the files Disk1.exe and Disk2.exe from the Europe1 folder by typing
     the following and pressing ENTER:

  del disk1.exe

     and then,

  del disk2.exe

- Complete the installation with the Scenery Library:

  To finish installing the BAO Europe scenery, use the scenery library in
  Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95.

  1. Start Flight Simulator. From the World Menu, click Scenery Library. You
     will receive a warning message, click OK.

  2. To display the Scenery Areas dialog box, click the Files button.

  3. Click the Search button. In the Scenery Area Search dialog box, select the
     drive letter where you installed Flight Simulator, and click on the Search
     Drive button.

  4. When the search is complete, click the Next Path button until you see the
     Europe1 folder you created.

  5. Type "Europe 1" (without the quotation marks) in the Scenery Area Title
     area and select Local as the Scenery Area type.

  6. Click the Scenery Area Active button, and then click the Add All Files In
     Path button.

  7. Click Close. Europe 1 should now be available.

  8. A patch for the BAO Europe 1 and Europe 2 programs is available online.
     This patch is NOT available from Microsoft, but it is available from
     Apollo Software. It can be found on CompuServe in the Fsforum and Simgames
     Forums. The file name is e1e2w95.zip.

     NOTE: Do not install the Las Vegas or Washington DC scenery packages. They
     have been incorporated into the Flight Simulator for Windows 95 program
     and will run automatically during the setup of Flight Simulator.

3rd Party Scenery Products
--------------------------

Scenery products for previous versions of Flight Simulator that were not created
by Microsoft or BAO may have special requirements for setup in Flight Simulator
for Windows 95. You should contact the manufacturer of that scenery package for
any special instructions.

Scenery products for previous versions of Flight Simulator that do not have a
setup program may require that files be copied to certain folders before they
are viewable in Flight Simulator for Windows 95.

The basic format for scenery with no setup:

1. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, open the Fltsim\Scenery folder. In the
  File menu, point to New, and then click Folder. When the new folder appears
  with a temporary name, type the name of the scenery area you wish to add. You
  should now have a new folder in your Fltsim\Scenery folder with the new
  scenery area name.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, open the Fltsim\Scenery\&lt;New Folder
  Name&gt; folder. Create two new folders within the new scenery area folder,
  and name one Scenery and the other Texture.

3. From the new scenery, copy all the Scenery files to the new Scenery folder.
  Copy all the Texture files to the new Texture folder.

4. Start Flight Simulator. From the World Menu, click Scenery Library. You will
  receive a warning message, click OK.

5. To display the Scenery Areas dialog box, click the Files button.

6. Click the Search button. In the Scenery Area Search dialog box, select the
  drive letter where you installed Flight Simulator, and click on the Search
  Drive button.

7. When the search is complete, click the Next Path button until you see the
  name of the new scenery folder you created.

8. Type the new folder name in the Scenery Area Title area and select Local as
  the Scenery Area type.

9. Click the Scenery Area Active button, and then click the Add All Files In
  Path button.

10. Click Close. The new scenery area should now be available.

Microsoft makes no guarantees that any 3rd party scenery will work correctly in
Flight Simulator for Windows 95. The steps outlined above are intended as
guidelines only. For best results contact the manufacturer of the scenery area.
