SUMMARY
=======

Mtacheck Logs are text files that show the results of running the Mtacheck.exe
utility. The Mtacheck utility scans the internal database of the Microsoft
Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) looking for objects that are damaged and
may be interfering with the queue processing. It places defective objects from
the queues in files for you to examine later. In addition, Mtacheck rebuilds the
queues so the MTA can be restarted and return to processing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mtacheck can be run manually, but is also run automatically when the MTA service
determines that the MTA was not shut down gracefully. If an automatic Mtacheck
is run, events will be logged to the Windows NT Application Event Log and an
Mtacheck.log file will be generated in the Mtacheck.out sub-directory of the
exchsrvr\MTADATA directory containing the DB*.DAT files used by the MTA. If the
Microsoft Exchange Performance Optimizer has been used to move Mtadata files,
there may be more than one Mtadata directory).

If Mtacheck is run manually, no logging is performed unless specified on the
command line. In addition, logs can be created in any location and with any
name. In terms of logging, the automatic Mtacheck is the equivalent of running
the following at the command line (except an automatic run also logs events to
the event logs):

  MTACHECK /V /F \exchsrvr\mtadata\Mtacheck.out\Mtacheck.log

INTERPRETING MTACHECK OUTPUT
----------------------------

Mtacheck examines each queue in the database. If it finds an error, it reports
the name of the queue, the type of error, and the number of messages returned to
the rebuilt queue.

For example:

  Queue 'xxxxxxx' required reconstruction
   - corrupted queue file
  23 messages recovered to the queue

It then examines objects in the queues. If an object is in error, it removes it
from the queue and places it in Exchsrvr\mtadata\mtacheck.out. It reports the
object ID, error type, queue name, and the MTS-ID of the corrupted message, if
known.

An MTS-ID is assigned to each message by its transport service and remains with
the message to its destination, although gateways may assign additional
identifiers. It consists of the originating server, the date and time the
message was sent, and a unique hexadecimal identifier for the message.

A sample Mtacheck log can include:

   Object 300596 invalid
   - missing object file
  Object removed from queue 'xxxxxxx'
  MTS-ID: c=US;a= ;p=Owen;l=Washington0196012020010800000CDE

When the MTA finishes processing, it displays one of following messages to
describe the results:

- Database clean, no errors detected

- Database repaired, some data may have been lost

- &lt;number&gt; queue(s) required repair out of &lt;percent&gt; detected

- &lt;number&gt; object(s) damaged out of &lt;percent&gt; detected

- Database has serious errors and cannot be reconstructed.

- Some objects missing from the Boot Environment. Please reload the files from
  the BOOTENV directory on the install CD.

The boot environment message indicates that the report templates and other
objects the MTA needs are missing and the MTA cannot generate them. These
objects are included in the files in the \BOOTENV directory. Once you have
installed them, rerun Mtacheck. When the process is complete, restart the MTA.

Warning: Copy only objects that are missing. If you replace existing objects, all
messages in MTA queues will be deleted.

SEARCHING MESSAGE LOGS BY MESSAGE ID
------------------------------------

Mtacheck also reports the message ID of removed objects in its log if they can be
determined. If message tracking is enabled, you can search the tracking log for
the object by its message ID. Determining the path of the bad message can lead
you to the cause of the problem. You may need to search the logs of more than
one site to find the complete path of the message.
