The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Outlook for Macintosh, Exchange Server Edition, versions 8.0, 8.1, 8.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Apple's Open Transport 1.1.2 contains a version of MacPPP for the Macintosh. You
can use MacPPP to dial in to a Microsoft Windows NT Server computer running
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, there is no remote solution included with the Exchange Macintosh
Client. Although the client does support offline folders and offline mode, it
does not contain any type of dial-up networking components. The Macintosh
operating system also has no built-in dial-up networking solution.

MacPPP allows you to create a dial-up networking connection for the Macintosh
using TCP/IP that is compatible with Windows NT Server computer running RAS. A
Macintosh with Open Transport 1.1.2 and MacPPP installed can call a Windows NT
Server computer running RAS, get validated, and use the Exchange Macintosh
client across the dial-up connection.

Below are some general tips to help you use this software successfully. Complete
instructions for obtaining, installing, and using MacPPP and the Exchange
Macintosh Client are also included.

Tips
----

- The client can ONLY be run in continuous (online) mode or use the
  Synchronization feature ONLY after a dial-up connection has been made. The
  dial-up connection must be made prior to starting the Exchange Macintosh
  Client, and the client does NOT auto-dial the connection.

- There are individual files available for download if the single Net Install
  file is too large, four files named OT_1.1.2-1OFx.SEA.HQX (x=1 of 4, 800 KB
  each). Both the complete Open Transport installation and the Open Transport
  Extras are required.

- The steps for configuring Open Transport assume that the Macintosh has both a
  LAN network adapter and a modem for dial-up networking. If you don't want to
  configure a LAN adapter, then proceed with steps 1 through 6 only and use
  your dial-up networking TCP/IP settings for the default configuration.

- Although there are many other options in the Config PPP Control Panel, the
  steps for configuring MacPPP are the minimum configuration for connection to
  a Windows NT Server computer running RAS.

- Be sure that you switch the dial-up networking configuration you want BEFORE
  you dial your PPP server. When you make this switch you are not prompted to
  restart the Macintosh, although you may have to restart to help clear
  problems.

- During connections an error message similar to the following may be
  displayed:

  Message from server: E=268

  If you connect to a Windows NT Server computer running RAS and you receive
  these error messages, refer to the Windows NT RAS Help file for an
  explanation of the number.

- Use a utility like MacPING (available on the World Wide Web) to ping the
  Exchange Server name. It is important that you receive a reply from the
  server's IP address. If you cannot ping the server name, try pinging the IP
  address of the server. If you can ping the address but not the name, create a
  local Hosts file that contains the IP addresses of the Exchange Server
  computer and the primary domain controller (PDC)(if they are different
  computers).

  For additional information about configuring the Exchange Macintosh Client for
  TCP/IP, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q149596 XCLN: Configuring Mac Client for TCP/IP

- You can also test profile and connection without starting the client. Start
  the Exchange Settings application, and in the Exchange Server Service
  properties page, click the General tab, and then click Check Names. When you
  are prompted for your domain credentials, type them. If the Exchange Server
  and user name appear underlined, then the client starts without problems.

Installing Open Transport 1.1.2
-------------------------------

1. Obtain Open Transport 1.1.2 from:

  ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/US/Macintosh/Networking-Communications/Open_Transport

  or do a Web site search from:

  http://www.apple.com

2. Download the files OT_1.1.2-NET_INSTALL.SEA.HQX (9 MB) as well as
  OT_1.1.2-EXTRAS.SEA.HQX (6 MB). See the second item in the list of tips
  above.

3. Use a BinHex converter (available on the Web), to extract the contents of the
  downloaded files onto the desktop. This creates two folders, Net Install and
  Open Transport Extras.

4. Review the included Readme document.

5. Open the Net Install folder. It contains four Install sub-folders, several
  Readme files and an Installer. Start the Installer to install Open Transport
  1.1.2 on the Macintosh. Restart the Macintosh.

6. Open the Open Transport Extras folder and the MacPPP sub-folder. Copy the PPP
  System Extension and Config PPP Control Panel to the System folder. They will
  automatically be placed in the correct sub-folders. Restart the Macintosh.

Configuring Open Transport 1.1.2
--------------------------------

See the third item in the list of tips above.

1. On the Apple menu, click Control Panels and TCP/IP.

2. In the Connect Via list, select your network adapter (that is, Ethernet
  Built-In, Ethernet Slot 1, or MacPPP). This is the adapter that you're
  creating a configuration for TCP/IP to use.

3. Type the TCP/IP settings according to the network you're using. If you need
  more options, on the Edit menu, click User Mode, select Advanced, and then
  click OK. This provides the TCP/IP configuration with more options. These
  settings must be correct for the Exchange Macintosh Client to be able to
  resolve the name of the Exchange Server computer.

4. Click Options, and ensure that the Active check box is selected and the Load
  Only When Needed check box is cleared. Click Select Hosts File if necessary.
  Please see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q149596 for a sample Hosts
  file.

5. Close the TCP/IP Control Panel. You are prompted to Save Changes to the
  Current Configuration; click Save. This saves this configuration as the
  Default TCP/IP configuration.

  This allows use of TCP/IP over the specified adapter with the settings
  provided.

  NOTE: Only proceed with the following steps if you want two TCP/IP
  configurations (one for a LAN and another for dial-up networking).

6. On the Apple menu, select Control Panels and TCP/IP.

7. On the File menu, click Configurations. Click Default, and then click
  Duplicate. Name the new configuration something unique to dial-up networking
  (that is, MacPPP). Select the new configuration, click Make Active, and then
  click Close.

8. In the Connect Via box, click MacPPP. Type the TCP/IP settings according to
  the network you're dialing. If you need more options, on the Edit menu, click
  User Mode, click Advanced, and then click OK. This provides the TCP/IP
  configuration with more options. These settings must be correct for the
  Exchange Macintosh Client to be able to resolve the name of the Exchange
  Server computer.

9. Close the TCP/IP Control Panel. You are prompted to Save Changes to the
  Current Configuration; click Save. This saves this configuration as the
  TCP/IP configuration you specified above.

10. To change between LAN and dial-up networking, use the TCP/IP Control Panel
  and the Configurations menu. The configuration that is set to Active is used
  for ALL TCP/IP applications.

Configuring MacPPP
------------------

See the fourth item in the list of tips above.

1. On the Apple menu, click Control Panels and Config PPP.

2. Click New to specify a new server. Type the name for this server. Click OK.

3. Click Config to set up this new server. Change the Port Speed to match your
  modem, select either the Tone or Pulse check box, according to your needs,
  and type the phone number of the server you need to call.

4. Click Authentication, and then type your Windows NT domain user name and
  Windows NT domain password. Click OK.

5. Click Open to establish a dial-up networking connection with the selected
  server. See the fifth and seventh items in the list of tips above.

Using Exchange Macintosh Client and MacPPP
------------------------------------------

1. Create a new profile for your Exchange Server mailbox. In the Exchange Server
  properties, click the General tab, select TCP/IP for the connection.

2. Connect to the Exchange Server computer's network either by means of MacPPP
  dial-up or LAN connection (use LAN to configure offline folders).

3. Start the Exchange Macintosh Client using this new profile to test the
  connection to the Exchange Server computer. You are prompted for your Windows
  NT domain account information. Once the client is open, send yourself a test
  message to verify that mail is moving correctly. See the eighth item in the
  list of tips above.

4. If you want offline folders, on the Tools menu, click Services.

  Select the Exchange Server service, and click Properties. Click the Advanced
  tab. Click Offline Folders, and then create a new Offline Folders file. Click
  OK, and return to the Inbox.

5. While you are still in online mode, on the Tools menu, click Synchronize All
  Folders. The Offline Folders file is now ready.

To get a copy of the global address list to use while working offline, on the
Tools menu, click Synchronize, and then click Download Address Book. This gives
you a copy of the global address list to use when you work offline.

You can now start the client using this profile in offline mode. You can read and
compose mail, and view and post to public folders in the Favorites folder. Any
changes made offline are delayed until the next synchronization with the
Exchange Server computer.

Suggestions
-----------

- Always use the simplest settings first, for the server as well as the client.
  Use clear text authentication and don't use callbacks on the RAS server.

- Create different Exchange profiles for working directly connected by means of
  the LAN and using MacPPP.

- Test the connection by pinging server names and getting replies from their IP
  addresses. The Exchange Macintosh Client will need to communicate with the
  PDC as well as the Exchange Server computer (if they are different
  computers).

- Ensure the Exchange account can be accessed from a LAN workstation.

- Try using static IP addresses for dial-up clients instead of Dynamic Host
  Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and create a local Hosts file instead of using
  Domain Name System (DNS) for testing.

- Try reducing the baud rate of the calling modem.
