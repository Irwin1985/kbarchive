SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose to paste a picture from the Clipboard to a document, Word pastes
the picture as a floating object (Float Over Text).

CAUSE
=====

By design, Word pastes the picture as a floating object (Float Over Text).

This article includes a macro that changes this default behavior, so that an
object is pasted as an inline object rather than a floating object.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

The following macro changes the default behavior in Word so that pasted objects
are pasted as inline rather than floating objects.

NOTE: Office Art objects are converted to pictures and pasted inline.

     Sub EditPasteObject()
        On Error GoTo ErrHandler ' Error will occur if object is Office Art.
        ActiveWindow.View.Type = wdPageView
        Selection.PasteSpecial Placement:=wdInLine
        ' If the object is not text, then convert it.
        If Selection.Type = wdSelectionShape Then
             Selection.ShapeRange.ConvertToInlineShape
        End If
     ErrHandler:
        If Err &lt;&gt; 0 Then
           ' If the object is Office Art, paste it as an inline picture
           ActiveDocument.Undo
           Selection.PasteSpecial DataType:=wdPasteMetafilePicture,
           Placement:=wdInLine
        End If
     End Sub

Copy the picture to the clipboard. If you want to paste the picture as an inline
object, run this macro. If you want to paste the object normally (as a floating
object), use the Paste command on the Edit menu.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Inline objects are treated as characters and are positioned as characters within
a line of text. In versions of Word earlier than Word 97 for Windows and Word 98
Macintosh Edition, all pictures are treated as inline objects.

Floating objects are anchored to a range of text but can be positioned anywhere
on the page.

For more information about inline objects, click the Office Assistant, type
"InlineShape," click Search, and then click to view "InlineShape Object."

For more information about floating objects, in the Visual Basic Editor, click
the Office Assistant, type "Shape," click Search, and then click to view "Shape
Object."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
