-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a macro to open a template, you may receive one of the following
errors:

  - Run-time error '-2147467259(80004005):

  Method 'Visible' of object 'CommandBar failed

  -or-

  - Run-time error '7':

  Out of memory

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if an AutoNew or AutoOpen macro is attempting to make a
custom toolbar visible that has the same name of a toolbar that is currently
displayed. For example, If you have a template named Template1 that contains a
custom toolbar named "Custom 1" and an AutoOpen macro that makes this toolbar
visible when a document that is based on this template is opened.

-and-

You also have a template named Template2 which contains a custom toolbar also
named "Custom 1," and an AutoOpen macro that displays this toolbar.

When you open "Template1" or a document based on "Template1", the AutoOpen macro
runs and displays the "Custom 1" toolbar. If you then open "Template2" or a
document based on "Template2", you receive one of the error messages listed in
the "Symptoms" section of this article.

NOTE: This problem does not occur when your templates reference the default
toolbars.

WORKAROUND

article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

To prevent these errors from occurring, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Remove or Disable the Command That Displays the Custom Toolbar
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit the auto macro in one or both of the templates to remove or disable the
command that displays the custom toolbar.

For example, the command line that may be causing the error may be either of the
following.

     Macro converted from WordBasic:

     WordBasic.ViewToolBars Toolbar:="Custom 1", Show:=1

  Visual Basic for Applications macro:

     CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = True

Adding an apostrophe at the beginning of either line will disable the command.

Method 2: Rename One ToolBar to a Unique Name
---------------------------------------------

Rename one of the custom toolbars to a unique name and edit the macro of the same
template to reference the changed custom toolbar name.

Method 3: Add an Error Trap for the Error
-----------------------------------------

Adding an error trap will prevent the error if Word attempts to display both
custom toolbars at the same time.

NOTE: Using an error trap will skip the command to display the second custom
toolbar. As a workaround, you can choose Toolbars on the View menu to display
the custom toolbar without receiving an error.

The following is an example of an error trap that can be used in this case:

  On Error Resume Next
  CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = True

For more information about error trapping, click the Office Assistant while in
the Visual Basic Editor, type "error trap" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view "On Error Statement."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q176476 OFF: Office Assistant Not Answering Visual Basic Questions

Method 4: Check the Visible state of the Custom toolbar
-------------------------------------------------------

     ' If the Custom toolbar is not visible then...
     If CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = False Then
        ' ...make the Custom toolbar visible.
        CommandBars("Custom 1").Visible = True
     End

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
