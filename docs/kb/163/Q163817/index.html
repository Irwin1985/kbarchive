-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To access the Novell Printers from the Microsoft Client computers without
NetWare client software, you can create a gateway using Gateway Services for
NetWare (GSNW) that comes with Windows NT Server. You can make gateways for
resources located on NetWare Directory Service (NDS) trees as well as for
resources on servers running NetWare 2.x or later with bindery security. These
resources include volumes, directories, printers, and print queues.

GSNW also enables users working locally at the Windows NT Server computer to
directly access NetWare file and print resources, both on NDS trees and on
servers with bindery security.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you can create a gateway on a Windows NT Server computer:

- You must have a user account on the NetWare network with the necessary rights
  for the resources you want to access.

- The NetWare server must have a group named NTGATEWAY with the necessary
  rights for the resources you want to access.

- The NetWare user account you use must be a member of the NTGATEWAY group.

The NetWare user account you use to enable gateways can be either an NDS account
or a bindery account. If the server will have gateways to both NDS resources and
resources on servers running bindery security, the user account must be a
bindery account. (This account can connect to NDS resources through bindery
emulation). If you create gateways only to NDS resources, the account can be an
NDS account.

Creating a gateway is a two-step process.

1. First you enable gateways on the server running Windows NT Server. When you
  enable a gateway, you must type the name and password of the user account
  that has access to the NetWare server and is a member of the NTGATEWAY group
  on that NetWare server.

  If you are activating a gateway to an NDS resource, and the gateway user
  account is a bindery user account, you should specify the resource using the
  bindery context name.

  If you are using a NDS user account, and you do not plan on also creating
  gateways to bindery resources, than you can specify the NDS resource name.
  You need to do this only once for each server that will act as a gateway.

2. To activate a gateway for a print queue, use Print Manager.

Steps to Setup the Printer on the Windows NT 4.0 Computer
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Printers. Double- click
  the Add Printer icon.

2. Click the My computer radio button.

3. Click Add Port.

4. Double-click on Local Port.

5. Type in the UNC name format (\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;printername&gt;) of the
  Novell server and printer name (this should be the same UNC name when you
  browse the NetWare network).

6. Click OK and Close.

7. Select the correct driver for the printer.

8. Type in the printer name.

9. Share out the printer. This is the name that the Client will see when
  browsing for the printer.

10. Click finish and test the printout.

Steps to setup the printer on a Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 Computer
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. From Print Manager, select Create Printer.

2. At the Create Printer dialog box, type in the printer name, and then select
  the correct printer driver.

3. Select OTHER in the PRINT TO: box and double-click on Local Port.

4. Type in the UNC name format (\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;printername&gt;) of the
  Novell server and printer name (this should be the same UNC name when you
  browse the NetWare network).

5. Click on the share this printer on the network box and type in the share
  name.

6. Click OK.

Security for gateway resources is provided on two levels:

- On the computer running Windows NT Server and acting as a gateway, you can
  set share-level permissions for each resource made available through the
  gateway.

- On the NetWare file server, the NetWare administrator can assign trustee
  rights to the user account used for the gateway or to the Ntgateway group.
  These rights will be enforced for all Microsoft client users who access the
  resource through the gateway.

There is no auditing of gateway access.

NOTE: Because requests from Microsoft networking clients are being processed
through the gateway, access is slower than direct access from the client to the
NetWare network. Clients that require frequent access to NetWare resources
should run Windows NT Workstation with the Client Service for NetWare or Windows
95 with its NetWare client software, to achieve higher performance.
