-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open a Microsoft Word document that was created using a Central European,
Russian, or Greek version of Microsoft Word, the text of the document may appear
as square boxes when you open the document in the U.S. version of Word 97.

In rare cases, this problem may also occur opening documents created in the U.S.
version of Microsoft Word.

CAUSE
=====

Many fonts available in the Central European, Russian, and Greek markets have
incorrect character set information. In these fonts, the character set parameter
is mistakenly set to 0, incorrectly indicating a Western font.

When the U.S. version of Word 97 opens the document, it converts it to Unicode
based on the character set parameter. Since this parameter is incorrect, the
conversion process is incorrect.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 for Windows Service Release 1
(SR- 1). This version of Word has been modified to correctly handle fonts that
are known to have problems.

For additional information about how to obtain Service Release 1 (SR-1), click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q172475 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are unable to update to SR-1, use the following workaround.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, modify the Windows Registry to specify the correct
font and code page Word needs to map the foreign language character set. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. Quit Word.

2. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "RegEdit" (without the quotation marks) and then click
  OK.

4. Click to select the following key in the Windows Registry:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Font Mapping

  This key determines which font and code page Word substitutes for a missing
  font. If the font that exhibits the problem is not on your system, Word
  substitutes the font specified by this key.

5. If a font mapping does not already exist for the font that exhibits the
  problem, create a new mapping. (If a font mapping already exists for this
  font, skip to step 6.)

  On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click String Value. Type the name of
  the original font that is contained in the document, and then press ENTER.

6. Click to select the original font name from step 5. On the Edit menu, click
  Modify, and type the name of the font you want Word to use, followed by a
  comma and the appropriate code page number from the following table. Use the
  OEM Primary code page for Windows fonts and the Macintosh code page for
  Macintosh fonts.

  Code page            Macintosh     Windows
  ------------------------------------------

  Greek                10006         737
  Russian              10007         866
  Central European     10029         852

For example, the following Edit String entry maps Systemny, a Macintosh font, to
the Cyrillic portion of Arial.

  Value Name: Systemny
  Value Data: Arial,10007

Reopening the Document in Word 6.0 or 7.0
-----------------------------------------

If you need to open the document again in Word 6.0 or 7.0, map the fonts
correctly back to the original font. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the document in Word 6.0 or 7.0.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. Click to select the Compatibility tab.

4. Click Font Substitution, and then select the desired fonts for those that are
  not available. Click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.&lt;A0&gt;This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a list of all known fonts that incorrectly set the character
set parameter to 0. Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 will
perform a font substitution when opening a document containing one of these
fonts and substitute the indicated font.

The list of fonts is stored in the following registry location:

Earlier versions of Word did not support Unicode. Unicode is a character set that
supports most alphabets (languages) in the world. Before Unicode, a character
set could support only 256 characters, so a different character set was needed
for each alphabet. Word 97, which supports Unicode, maps characters from the old
character set to the Unicode character set.

To do a correct mapping, Word 97 must map the text to the proper character set.
For example, character number 200 represents both a capital E (with a grave
accent) in the Western European character set, and a capital I in the Cyrillic
character set. To map each of these characters correctly to the Unicode
character set, Word must map character number 200 to either the Western European
range or the Cyrillic range within the Unicode character set. Word 97 has added
extra functionality that allows character mapping to be made to a specific
Unicode range in a font. For additional information, click the article number
