-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a SQL query that joins three or more tables in Visual FoxPro 5.0 is very
slow. If Visual FoxPro 3.x is available for testing, this same query performs
much faster by comparison. Using the new JOIN syntax with the SQL Select
statement is also slow.

CAUSE
=====

One or more of the tables have only one or only a few records that join with the
other tables.

RESOLUTION
==========

The query speed can usually be increased by using the new SQL Select syntax in
Visual FoxPro 5.0 for JOINS in conjunction with the FORCE keyword.

Using the sample SQL Select statements from step 3 under the Steps to Reproduce
Behavior section below, the addition of the FORCE keyword makes the queries run
much faster:

        SELECT * FROM FORCE test1 ;
         INNER JOIN test2 ON test2.id = test1.id ;
         INNER JOIN test3 ON test3.id = test2.id

        SELECT * FROM FORCE test1 ;
         INNER JOIN (test2 INNER JOIN test3 ON test3.id = test2.id );
         ON test2.id =test1.id

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem seems to occur when there is a join of three or more tables when
there are only one or two records in one of the tables or there are only one or
two records that have related records in the other tables. The tables also have
to have a large number of records in them (30,000, 70,000 and 90,000). All of
the table join scenarios that can exhibit the problem are not known.

If the slow query is allowed to run, it may fill the computer's hard drive with a
large temporary file and the following program error message may be received:

  There is not enough disk space for c:\temp\12345678.tmp

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following steps provide sample code that can be used to reproduce the
problem. Press the Escape key to cancel the query in step 2 when desired.

1. Place the code below in a program file and run it. The code creates three
  tables that will take up about 6.6 MG of disk space:

        CLOSE ALL
        SET ECHO OFF
        SET TALK OFF
        CREATE TABLE test1 (ID C(15),Dummy C(15))
        CREATE TABLE test2 (ID C(15),Dummy C(15))
        CREATE TABLE test3 (ID C(15),Dummy C(15))
        CLOSE ALL

        WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "filling test1"
        USE test1
        INDEX ON ID TAG ID
        FOR x = 1 TO 71894
        APPEND BLANK
        REPLACE ID WITH SYS(2015)
        NEXT
        GO TOP
        REPLACE NEXT 2 ID WITH "TEST"

        WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "filling test2"
        USE test2
        INDEX ON ID TAG ID
        FOR x = 1 TO 30622
        APPEND BLANK
        REPLACE ID WITH SYS(2015)
        NEXT
        GO TOP
        REPLACE NEXT 2 ID WITH "TEST"

        WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "filling test3"
        USE test3
        INDEX ON ID TAG ID
        FOR x = 1 TO 90000
        APPEND BLANK
        REPLACE ID WITH SYS(2015)
        NEXT
        GO TOP
        REPLACE NEXT 2 ID WITH "TEST"
        CLOSE ALL

2. Run the following query from a program file:

        SELECT * FROM test1,test2,test3 ;
         WHERE test1.id=test2.id AND test2.id=test3.id

3. The following two SQL Select statements can also be used to reproduce the
  problem using the sample data created in step 1 above:

        SELECT * FROM test1 ;
         INNER JOIN test2 ON test2.id = test1.id ;
         INNER JOIN test3 ON test3.id = test2.id

        SELECT * FROM test1 ;
         INNER JOIN (test2 INNER JOIN test3 ON test3.id = test2.id );
         ON test2.id =test1.id
