-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Word 97 as your e-mail editor in Microsoft Outlook 97,
you may receive one or more of the following error messages or behaviors:

In Word:

  Can't find Winword, using Outlook editor instead.

  -or-

  There is insufficient memory or disk space. Word cannot display the requested
  font.

  -or-

  In Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98:

  This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shut down.

  In Microsoft Windows NT 4.0:

  An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
  generated.

  In Microsoft Windows 2000:

  WINWORD has generated errors and will be closed by Windows. You will need to
  restart the program.

  An error log is being created.

  -or-

  Your computer beeps or does not respond, or you receive an unexpected error
  in Microsoft Word 97.

In Outlook:

  This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shut down.

  -or-

  The message "Please wait while Microsoft Outlook exits" is not displayed when
  you quit Microsoft Outlook.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because Word 97 or Outlook 97 processes remain in memory
after you quit the programs. The server objects of the programs may not be
closed when you quit the programs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To determine whether a program is still in memory, do one of the following
appropriate for your version of Microsoft Windows:

In Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0:

Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to view the Close Program dialog box. If Word or Outlook is
listed, the program is still active in memory.

To quit the program remaining in memory, in the Close Program dialog box, click
to select the program, and then click End Task. You may have to perform this
step more than once to close both Word 97 and Outlook 97.

In Microsoft Windows 2000:

Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to view the Windows Security dialog box, and then click
Task Manager. If Word or Outlook is listed on the Processes tab, click to select
the program, and then click End Process. You may have to perform this step more
than once to close both Word 97 and Outlook 97.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Outlook 98 and later.
