The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Intel processor receives a specific invalid instruction, your computer
may stop responding (hang). Your computer must be turned off and restarted to
return to normal operation.

NOTE: Although there is no known operating system or application that issues such
an invalid instruction, you should be aware that a program can be written
maliciously to contain such an instruction. The operating system would not trap
this error, as it should, which results in the processor hang.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur due to an error in the following Intel processors:

- Pentium processor

- Pentium processor with MMX technology

- Pentium OverDrive processor

- Pentium OverDrive processors with MMX technology

NOTE: This problem cannot occur on the following Intel processors:

- Pentium Pro processor

- Pentium II processor

- i486 and earlier processors

This problem is known as "Invalid Operand with Locked CMPXCHG8B Instruction" and
is erratum 81 on the Pentium processor errata list. For more information, please
contact Intel or go to the following Intel web site:

  http://support.intel.com/sites/support/

RESOLUTION
==========

Intel has identified a workaround to this problem that allows the operating
system to trap the invalid instruction and not pass it to the processor.
Microsoft has worked closely with Intel to provide the following hotfixes:
