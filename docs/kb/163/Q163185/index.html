SYMPTOMS
========

Upon browsing or skipping through a table with a filter condition set, or
through a cursor created with SQL SELECT and a WHERE condition, you may see one
of several errors:

  Object is not contained in a FORM.

  -or-

  Object is not contained in a FORMSET.

  -or-

  THIS can only be used within a method.

  -or-

  THISFORM can only be used within a method.

  -or-

  Property &lt;form or formset property holding filter value&gt; is not found.

CAUSE
=====

These errors are caused by the record pointer being moved or the table being
browsed outside of the object where the FILTER or WHERE condition has been
stored in a form or object property. Regardless of where the FILTER condition is
set, or how the record pointer is being moved, the FILTER condition is
reevaluated each time the record pointer is moved. If the table or cursor is
being accessed outside the form or other object where THISFORM.&lt;property&gt;
or THIS.&lt;property&gt; is a valid reference, one of these errors occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent these errors, use macro substitution, or store or reference the
FILTER or WHERE condition in a manner where it is always a valid reference.

You can do this in several ways:

- Set the FILTER condition with macro substitution, for example:

        THISFORM.cfilterstring = "cust_id = 'A'"
        lcFilterstring = THISFORM.cfilterstring
        SET FILTER TO &amp;lcFilterstring

- Store the FILTER condition to a public variable, for example:

        PUBLIC gcFilterString
        gcFilterString = "cust_id = 'A'"
        SET FILTER TO (gcFilterString)

- Store the FILTER condition in a property of an object with a reference in a
  public variable. There is an example of this below in MORE INFORMATION.

- If the error is caused by a WHERE condition in a cursor created with SELECT -
  SQL, the NOFILTER keyword may be used in Visual FoxPro 5.0 to force a
  temporary table to be used, rather than a filtered subset of the full table.
  Here, the WHERE is never reevaluated after the SELECT is executed, for
  example:

        SELECT * FROM customer WHERE cust_id = "A" ;
          INTO CURSOR custcursor NOFILTER

  In Visual FoxPro 3.0, this can be forced by adding a calculated field to the
  SELECT, such as the following:

        SELECT *, SPACE(1) FROM customer WHERE cust_id = "A" ;
           INTO CURSOR custcursor

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Within a particular object or form references can be made, within that object's
code, to the object itself or the form or formset containing it, with THIS,
THISFORM, or THISFORMSET. These references are valid only within code that is
contained within these objects or their members. Because of the nature of SET
FILTER or a SELECT - SQL WHERE condition (when the returned records are a
filtered set of records), when either of these is the case the FILTER or WHERE
condition must contain references that are always valid.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.prg) file:

        * Beginning of code example
        *
        PUBLIC oNavClass, oform
        oNavClass=CREATEOBJECT('navclass')
        oform=CREATEOBJECT("form1")
        oform.SHOW

        DEFINE CLASS navclass AS CUSTOM
           * This class does skipping and browsing in currently
           *  selected table
           cfilterstring = ""

           PROCEDURE DoBrowse
              BROWSE NOWAIT
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE DoSkip
              LPARAMETER ndirection
              SKIP (ndirection)
              IF EOF()
                 GO BOTTOM
              ENDIF
              IF BOF()
                 GO TOP
              ENDIF
           ENDPROC
        ENDDEFINE

        DEFINE CLASS form1 AS FORM
           cfilterstring = ""
           AUTOCENTER = .T.
           HEIGHT = 200

              WIDTH = 84, ;
              CAPTION = "Skip", ;
              NAME = "Command1"

           ADD OBJECT text1 AS TEXTBOX WITH ;
              CONTROLSOURCE = "customer.cust_id", ;
              HEIGHT = 23, ;

              CAPTION = "Browse", ;
              NAME = "Command3"

           PROCEDURE LOAD
              USE HOME()+'samples\data\customer'
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE UNLOAD
              SET FILTER TO
              USE IN customer
              RELEASE oNavClass

              SET FILTER TO EVAL(THISFORM.cfilterstring)

              * Comment out above 2 lines and remove comments from lines
              *   below to demonstrate workaround. ONavClass is public
              *   and its properties will always be in scope

              * oNavClass.cfilterstring = 'cust_id = "'+THIS.VALUE+'"'
              * SET FILTER TO EVAL(oNavClass.cfilterstring)
              GO BOTTOM
              GO TOP
              THISFORM.REFRESH
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE command1.CLICK
              oNavClass.DoSkip(1)
              THISFORM.REFRESH
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE command2.CLICK
              oNavClass.DoSkip(-1)
              THISFORM.REFRESH
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE command3.CLICK
              oNavClass.DoBrowse
           ENDPROC

        ENDDEFINE
        *
        * End of code example

2. A form appears. Make a selection from the drop-down list. The first record
  matching the condition is displayed in the text box.

3. Press any of the three command buttons to navigate through the records or
  browse the filtered list. The following error occurs:

  Object is not contained in a FORM.

4. Ignore the error, close the form, and edit the .prg file. As noted in the
  comments within the combo1.VALID procedure, comment out the lines storing the
  filter condition as a property of the form, and uncomment the lines storing
  the filter condition into a property of oNavClass.

5. Rerun the form, repeat steps 2 and 3 above, and no error will occur.
