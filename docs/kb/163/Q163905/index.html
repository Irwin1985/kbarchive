SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT can audit when a user or group is added to or removed from a User
Right. To audit these types of action, choose the auditing category, Security
Policy Changes in User Manager under the Policies menu, auditing. This is the
only needed audit category to audit these specific actions. Only the audit
category File and Object Access will add additional security events, but these
events simply show objects being opened and handles being closed for user
account access that populate the Add Users and Groups dialog boxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below is the sample output from the Security Event Log when a user is added to
each of the User Right. Although User Manager does not differentiate between
User Privileges and Rights, in actuality only Privileges are currently audited.
Actions that are not audited are actually "rights."
