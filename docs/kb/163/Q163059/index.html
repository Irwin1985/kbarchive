MORE INFORMATION
================

MS LineDraw
-----------

The MS LineDraw font is identified as a symbol font. Therefore, Word 97 will
interpret text typed in the MS LineDraw font as a series of symbols and many of
formatting and proofing features of Word will ignore the text.

Courier New contains the exact same character set as MS LineDraw. Existing
documents formatted with the MS LineDraw font will be mapped to Courier New when
opened in Word 97.

To access the line drawing characters that used to be available in MS LineDraw,
click Symbol on the Insert menu, change the font to (normal text), and change
the Subset to Box Drawing.

Bookshelf Symbol
----------------

Bookshelf Symbol 1 and Bookshelf Symbol 2 fonts are not proper symbol fonts.
Because Word 97 supports Unicode, these fonts are unusable in Word 97. In many
cases, if a converted document contains these fonts, you will get "empty"
characters, represented by a square box.

International Fonts
-------------------

International font sets that are available in Word 7.0 are not automatically
available in Word 97. Word 97 makes available only the fonts that are determined
by the language and keyboard setting in Windows 95.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q159341 Word 97: International Fonts Don't Appear in Font List

Vector Fonts
------------

Vector fonts use an older font technology and the quality of the printed output
is very poor. Because of the poor printed quality, these fonts were removed from
the font drop-down box in Microsoft Word 97.

Examples of this type of font are the Roman, Modern, and Script. They are mostly
used by Plotter printers under Microsoft Windows 3.x.

Screen Fonts
------------

Microsoft Word is designed to produce WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get)
output. In order to attain that goal, the text that is displayed on the screen
must be able to be printed. If the text is formatted with a screen font, then a
font substitution must occur when the document is printed because screen fonts
are for display only and cannot be printed.

Performing a font substitution when printing may produce non-WYSIWYG output. For
this reason, screen fonts are not available in the font drop-down box.

You can still force Word to use a screen font to display the text by typing in
the name of the font, exactly as it is named in Windows, into the font drop-down
box and pressing ENTER.
