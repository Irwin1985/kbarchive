SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

If you use the Linked Table Manager to refresh the link to a table that is under
Source Code Control, and you do not have Data and Misc. Objects checked out,
Microsoft Access does not prompt you to check it out. When you do check out Data
and Misc. Objects, if the data to which the table was originally linked is not
available, you receive two error messages for each linked table:

  Couldn't find file '&lt;Database Name&gt;' An error occurred while trying to
  create the linked table '&lt;Table Name&gt;'

After you click OK on the last error message, the linked tables are deleted.

NOTE: If the data to which the table was originally linked is still available
when you check out Data and Misc. Objects, the table will revert to the original
link.

This article assumes that you are familiar with using the client-side
capabilities of Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual SourceSafe,
please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or Help available from the
Visual SourceSafe Help menu.

CAUSE
=====

Changes to objects that are not checked out are not saved. When you check out a
linked table, Microsoft Access tries to refresh the link. If the data to which
the table is linked is unavailable or has been moved to another location, the
link cannot be refreshed and the linked table is removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Check out Data and Misc. Objects before you use the Linked Table Manager to
modify the linked tables.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access 97. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Any time you use Visual Basic for Applications code to modify an object in
a database that is under Source Code Control, you are not prompted to check out
the object. This behavior is by design; however wizards that modify objects
through code should prompt you to check out the object.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a new database called VssTest.mdb.

2. On the Tools menu, point to SourceSafe, and then click "Add Database to
  SourceSafe."

3. Check out Data and Misc. Objects from SourceSafe.

4. Link to the Customers table in the sample database Northwind.mdb.

5. Check in Data and Misc. Objects, which now contains the linked table.

6. Quit Microsoft Access 97.

7. Locate Northwind.mdb and change its name to Northwind1.mdb.

8. Start Microsoft Access and open VssTest.mdb.

9. Refresh the link to the Customers table by pointing to Add-Ins on the Tools
  menu, and then clicking Linked Table Manager.

10. Check out Data and Misc. Objects from SourceSafe.

11. Click OK on both error messages and note that the linked table no longer
  appears in the Database window.
