-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to unpack a presentation from multiple disks using
Pngsetup.exe, you receive the following error message and the unpack process
halts:

  Pack and Go Setup was unable to install the presentation. The disk may be
  full, you may not have permission for the &lt;Path&gt; or it may already
  contain a presentation with the same name."

Although you receive the error message, you can open the presentation.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you do not pack the PowerPoint Viewer with your
presentation and you use multiple disks to pack your presentation. The
Playlist.lst file, which is included in the packed presentation, is not
unpacked. Although this file is not required by PowerPoint it is required by the
Viewer and it is packed when you pack your presentation.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1
--------

Click OK when you receive the error message.

NOTE: You can open your presentation successfully if you have PowerPoint 7.0 or
the PowerPoint 7.0 viewer installed.

Method 2
--------

Copy all of the files from the disks to a single folder on your hard drive. Run
Pngsetup.exe from that folder. You will not receive the error message and the
presentation will run automatically.

NOTE: You must have PowerPoint 7.0 or the PowerPoint 7.0 viewer installed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
