IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring Registry Key" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

TCP performance on lossy networks has been improved in Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 2. Support was added for the Van Jacobson TCP fast retransmit and recovery
algorithm.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For an excellent description of fast retransmit and recovery, see "TCP/IP
Illustrated, Volume 1," Richard Stevens, page 312, Addison-Wesley, 1994. A
summary of behavior before and after you apply Service Pack 2 is presented.

(Assume a receive window size that allows six full-sized Ethernet frames to be
sent without waiting for acknowledgment.)

Before Service Pack 2
---------------------

  Sender     Receiver
  -------------------
  packet1 -&gt;
  packet2 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet3 -&gt; (assume this packet is lost)
  packet4 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet5 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet6 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet7 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet8 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  pause, for retransmission timeout of packet 3 data
  packet3 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet8

NOTE: After a packet is dropped, the receiver immediately sends an acknowledgment
that indicates the receive position in the byte stream each time it receives
another packet that is past the hole. These additional ACKS for packet2 are a
hint to the sender that there has been a dropped packet. However, prior to
Service Pack 2, this indication was not acted on. Instead, the sender continues
sending, to the end of the send window, then pauses. Eventually, the
retransmission timer for packet3 expires, and it is resent. An ACK is returned
for all of the data up through packet8, and the sender starts out again.
However, it engages congestion control and starts slowly. As a result, the data
throughput is not ideal.

The new behavior after applying Service Pack 2
----------------------------------------------

  Sender     Receiver
  -------------------
  packet1 -&gt;
  packet2 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet3 -&gt;    (assume this packet is lost)
  packet4 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet5 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet2
  packet3 -&gt;    (new !!)
  packet6 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet6
  packet7 -&gt;
  packet8 -&gt;
             &lt;- ack for data up through packet8

The new behavior exhibits the fast retransmit and recovery algorithm. On
receiving three ACKS for the same sequence number, the sender will quickly
retransmit the missing segment, without waiting for the retransmission timer to
expire. It also will engage a lesser degree of congestion control, as described
in the previously mentioned reference book.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

The following registry parameter can be used to control fast retransmit. To add
the registry key:

1. Run Regedt32.exe

2. Go to:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/currentcontrolset/services/tcpip/parameters

3. Click Edit, click New, and then click Key.

  Name: TcpMaxDupAcks
  Value Type: REG_DWORD - Number
  Valid Range: 1-3
  Default: 2

This parameter determines the number of duplicate ACKs that must be received for
the same sequence number of sent data before fast retransmit is triggered to
resend the segment that has been dropped in transit.
