SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to use the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
AddLine method to create new lines on your slides.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AddLine method uses the following syntax:

  .AddLine(BeginX, BeginY, EndX, EndY)

NOTE: The data type for all AddLine parameters is single.

AddLine Parameters
------------------

The AddLine method has four parameters:

  BeginX    The X coordinate (in points) for the starting point of the
            line. The coordinate is relative to the top left corner of the
            slide.

  BeginY    The Y coordinate (in points) for the starting point of the
            line. The coordinate is relative to the top left corner of
            the slide.

  EndX      The X coordinate (in points) for the ending point of the
            line. The position is relative to the bottom left corner of
            the slide.

  EndY      The Y coordinate (in points) for the ending point of the
            line. The position is relative to the bottom left corner of
            the slide.

The following sample Visual Basic procedure draws a horizontal line across the
middle of the first slide in a presentation.

  Sub DrawHorizontalLine()

        Dim longHeight As Long
        Dim longWidth As Long

        ' Get the slide height and width.
        longHeight = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideHeight
        longWidth = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideWidth

        With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes

           ' Create the line.
           .AddLine 0, (longHeight \ 2), longWidth, (longHeight \ 2)

        End With

     End Sub

The following sample Visual Basic procedure draws a vertical line down the middle
of the first slide in a presentation.

     Sub DrawVerticalLine()

        Dim longHeight As Long
        Dim longWidth As Long

        ' Get the slide height and width.
        longHeight = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideHeight
        longWidth = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideWidth

        With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes

           ' Create the line.
           .AddLine (longWidth \ 2), 0, (longWidth \ 2), longHeight

        End With

     End Sub

The following sample Visual Basic procedure draws two diagonal lines. The
diagonal lines form an X on the first slide in a presentation.

      Sub DrawDiagonalLines()

        Dim longHeight As Long
        Dim longWidth As Long

        ' Get the slide height and width.
        longHeight = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideHeight
        longWidth = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideWidth

        With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes

           ' Create line from top left to bottom right.
           .AddLine 0, 0, longWidth, longHeight

           ' Create line from top right to bottom left.
           .AddLine longWidth, 0, 0, longHeight

        End With

     End Sub

Using the Return Value
----------------------

The AddLine method returns a reference to a shape that you created. You can use
the reference to modify the properties of the line.

The following sample Visual Basic procedure uses the return value to change the
line color and weight.

  Sub ChangeLineColor()

        Dim longHeight As Long
        Dim longWidth As Long

        Dim MyLine As Shape

        ' Get the slide height and width.
        longHeight = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideHeight
        longWidth = ActivePresentation.PageSetup.SlideWidth

        With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes

           ' Get the return value and create the line.
           Set MyLine = .AddLine(100, 100, 300, 100)

           ' Change line weight to 50 point.
           MyLine.Line.Weight = 50

           ' Change line color to red.
           MyLine.Line.ForeColor.RGB = RGB(255, 0, 0)

        End With

     End Sub

NOTE: Because the AddLine method returns an object, use the Set command to get
the returned shape reference.
