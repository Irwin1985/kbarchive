SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard to migrate accounts to a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer, the following error may be generated in the
Application event log

  Event ID: 283
  Source: MSExchangeMIGDS
  Description: Could not remove object &lt;UserID&gt; because the directory
  service reported the following error: Changes cannot be written to
  this directory object. Try connecting to a Microsoft Exchange
  Server computer in the same site as this object.

where &lt;UserID&gt; is the ID of a user who already exists on the Microsoft
Exchange server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error may occur if you have insufficient rights or permissions to the
Microsoft Exchange Directory. In this case, make sure that you are logged into
the Windows NT domain as a user with sufficient access to the Microsoft Exchange
Directory.

This error may also occur if an existing mailbox or custom recipient is homed on
one server in a site and an attempt is made to migrate an account to a server in
a different site. Microsoft Exchange will attempt to remove the existing
recipient from the target server and replace it with a new mailbox for the
migrated account. Since the recipient does not actually exist on the target
server (it is homed on another server in another site), it cannot be removed. To
migrate these users, it will be necessary to remove the existing recipients from
their home server. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. Log on to the Windows NT domain using the Microsoft Exchange Service Account
  or an account that has administrative permissions for the Microsoft Exchange
  Server.

2. Use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to remove the custom
  recipient or mailbox object for the user that you are trying to migrate from
  the appropriate recipients container.

3. Allow time for directory replication to occur between the recipient's home
  server and the target server. This will remove the user from the Global
  Address List (GAL) of the target server. If you wish to force directory
  replication to occur, select the Update Now button located on the General tab
  of the target server's Directory Service Properties dialog.

4. Run the Microsoft Exchange Migration Wizard again.
