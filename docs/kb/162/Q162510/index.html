-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A patch for Monster Truck Madness has been released. The patch is available on
the Web at

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/monster/downloads.htm

This patch is required if you want to use the matchmaking features available on
Zone.com.

The patch requires the installation of DirectX.

The latest version of DirectX is available at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx

For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DirectX, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q179113 How to Download and Install DirectX

You must install DirectX before you install the patch.

NOTE: If you attempt to install the patch before you have installed DirectX, you
will receive a warning message. The patch will not be able to make the required
changes and the patch installation will be unsuccessful.

What the patch will fix
-----------------------

- Internet play freeze problems.

  NOTE: You should limit the total number of trucks to four or less, and the
  fastest computer should be the Host.

- Synchronization problems at the end of the game.
- Multiplayer support for add-in tracks.
- Multiplayer compatible with later patches.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At the beginning of the installation of the patch, you will receive the
following warning message:

  This patched version of Monster Truck Madness is not Multiplayer compatible
  with the retail version of Monster Truck Madness. To play multiplayer once
  you've installed the patch, your opponents have to install the patch too. Do
  you wish to continue?

The installation of the patch will make your version of Monster Truck Madness
(MTM) unplayable in a multiplayer mode with a retail version of MTM not using
the patch. You are warned at the time of download, at the time of installation,
and in the patched version of the Readme.txt in the Monster Truck Madness patch
section.

This patched and non-patched version incompatibility will not generate an error
message, you will simply not be able to see each other in any form of
multiplayer game. The solution is to either remove the patched version of
Monster Truck Madness and reinstall the program from the compact disc, or have
your opponent install the patch.
