Introduction
------------

This article discusses troubleshooting remote functionality in Microsoft Exchange
Clients and Schedule+. A user is considered remote if something other than a
physical network interface card (NIC) is being used to access Microsoft Exchange
Server (in most cases this means a modem is being used, but ISDN and wireless
solutions would also fall into this category).

The Exchange Client provides a number of slow-link optimizations, including the
ability to work offline. Users can download all of their mail or selectively
download items using the Remote Mail window, which lists only preview header
information for each message. In addition, users can choose to have only
important messages downloaded over the modem and download the other messages
when a LAN connection is available. Also available in the Remote Mail window is
the ability to set up scheduled connections that can remotely connect to an
Exchange Server computer at a pre-set time, download new mail, and disconnect
automatically.

Before you set up or test any Exchange Server remote functionality, set up a
persistent connection scenario. This quickly helps determine if the problem is
an underlying remote transport issue (RAS/DUN/Shiva/and so forth), or a problem
with something in the Exchange Client (configuration, OST, PST problems, and so
forth).

If it is determined that there are problems just connecting outside of Exchange
Server, contact the support group that handles the underlying transport before
you continue with Exchange Client troubleshooting. For Windows 95, the transport
is DUN, for Windows NT it is RAS, for Windows 3.x, it is Shiva. For additional
information about Shiva, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q158124 XCLN: ShivaRemote with Exchange - RAS Considerations

Types of Users
--------------

Before you configure Exchange Server to allow remote access to mail, determine
the type or types of users in your organization. This information helps
determine how you configure Exchange Server.

Users typically fall into one of the following categories:

- Laptop User: Typically works both from the office LAN (docked when at the
  office) and when away from the office, dials into the corporate network using
  the same computer.

- Desktop Home User: Works mostly from home but, when in the office, may log
  into the corporate network using a different computer.

- Roving User: Uses either multiple computers at the office and/or one computer
  at the office and a laptop when on the road.

- Hybrid User: A combination of two or more of the above.

Using Specific Remote Protocols
-------------------------------

NOTE: Because of the way named pipes passes the Windows logon credentials to
Exchange Server for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended that you remove
named pipes from the Exchange Server binding order. For additional information,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q146188 XCLN: Use Network Security Option not Working as Expected

NetBEUI:

NetBEUI is not routable. Therefore, the Primary Domain Controller (PDC), RAS
server, and the computer running Exchange Server must all be located on the same
network segment for the Exchange Client to connect over DUN with NetBEUI (only).
If the PDC, RAS server, and the computer running Exchange Server are one and the
same, NetBEUI is the best option.

Possible Exchange Server RPC bindings:

  Ncacn_nb_nb
  Netbios
  ncacn_np

TCP/IP:

The IP addresses of both the PDC and the computer running Exchange Server must
resolve over IP. After you connect by using DUN, attempt to ping the machine
name of the PDC and the computer running Exchange Server. If pinging the machine
name is unsuccessful, add the entries to the local Hosts file as a test.

Possible Exchange Server RPC bindings:

  ncacn_ip_tcp
  netbios
  ncacn_np

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q108295 TCP/IP Name Resolution

IPX/SPX:

For the Exchange Client to connect over IPX/SPX, there must be a Novell Server OR
File and Print Services for NetWare must be installed on a computer running
Windows NT Server to respond to the "find_nearest_server" query.

Possible RPC bindings:

  Ncacn_spx,
  ncacn_np (under Windows 95 only)

Modes of Operation
------------------

Two basic modes of operation are available for the remote use of Exchange
Clients: a batch connection and a persistent (continuous) connection.

Batch Mode:

Batch mode is useful for those users who either want to minimize phone connect
time charges or work with the Exchange Client when it is disconnected from the
network (for example, when the users are away from a LAN connection or flying on
a plane).

The Exchange Client and the Outlook client offer two solutions for mobile
computing: remote mail (downloading headers only and then selecting messages)
and offline folders. The Remote Mail feature is available for use with most
services, and offline folders are available ONLY for use with the Exchange
Server service.

Persistent Connection:

Establishing a persistent connection remotely simply means that you connect FIRST
with RAS/DUN or Shiva (for Windows NT, Windows 95, and Windows 3.x
respectively), and then you start the Exchange Client in Online mode over this
connection, exactly as if it were on the LAN.

In the persistent connection scenario, the Exchange Client reacts exactly as if
it is connected over an NIC. Deal with error messages that appear during the
initial modem connection BEFORE you troubleshoot any Exchange Server
remote-specific problems.

To test a persistent connection by accessing Exchange Server remotely:

1. Dial and connect with the underlying transport (RAS, DUN, Shiva, and so
  forth).

2. Create a new Exchange Server profile:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail, and then click Add.

  b. Add ONLY the Exchange Server Service.

  c. When you are prompted "Do you travel with this computer?" click No.

  d. Finish creating the profile.

  e. Set this newly created profile as the default profile.

Some troubleshooting steps for persistent connection problems are:

- Switch to a different protocol for testing.

- Change the RPC binding order for Exchange Server.

- Use utilities like Ping or "net use" to ensure that there is a valid
  connection after you dial the connection.

- Dial in to a different RAS Server (device) to ensure that the problem is not
  on the RAS server.

The following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles may also be helpful if the
Microsoft Exchange Client stops responding over a persistent connection:

  Q136516 Improving Windows Client Startup Times

  Q161626 Troubleshooting IPX/SPX Connections

  Q163576 Changing the RPC Binding Order

NOTE: Remember that when you troubleshoot any Exchange Client remote issues, you
must always test with the persistent connection method FIRST.

If you want both Exchange Client and Schedule+ to behave exactly as they do on a
LAN, you need to use a persistent connection. However, because the dial-up
connection must be connected the entire time that Exchange Client and Schedule+
are in use, the persistent connection is not a good idea when connection time
charges are a concern.

Remote Mail:

Remote mail enables you to connect remotely to your mail service. You can use it
with Internet Mail, Microsoft Mail, Exchange Server, and some online services.
One notable service that does not support remote mail (with Outlook) is the
cc:Mail service that ships with the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack.

The purpose of remote mail is to allow absolutely minimal total connection time.
Initially, remote mail connects and downloads only the message headers for
display in the mail preview window. Then specific messages can be marked for
full retrieval (either by leaving a copy on the server (mark to retrieve a copy)
or by downloading the message locally (mark to retrieve).

Calendar appointments, contacts, and other private folder information (except for
the Inbox) are not available by means of remote mail. This means that if there
are server-based rules that move messages to other private folders, these
messages are not retrievable using the remote mail option.

If you want to access information in folders other than the Inbox (public
folders, other private folders, calendar information in the case of Outlook, and
so on), use offline folders OR a persistent connection.

NOTE: For remote mail to work properly, a local personal store file (PST file)
must be present and delivery in the properties for Exchange Server must be set
to the PST file. If delivery is not set to a PST file, the Mark to Retrieve
option, which removes the mail from the server, leaves a copy on the server
instead.

To set up a profile for use with remote mail:

1. Test the persistent connection scenario as outlined above.

2. Add a personal folder to the existing profile; in Control Panel, double-click
  Mail, click Properties for the profile, click Add, and then click Personal
  Folders.

3. Click the Delivery tab, and in the Deliver New Mail to the Following Location
  box, type the name of the PST that was just added.

4. In the Properties for Microsoft Exchange Server, click "Choose Connection
  Type when Starting".

5. Start the client offline. On the Tools menu, click Remote Mail. In the Remote
  Mail window, click Connect.

6. Headers are downloaded into the remote window. Click to select either the
  "Mark to Retrieve" or "Mark to Retrieve a Copy" check box (this option leaves
  a copy on the server).

7. After the appropriate messages have been selected, click Connect again.

8. Close the Remote Preview window, and the marked messages now appear in the
  Inbox of the Exchange Client.

  NOTE: This process can be automated somewhat by using the Remote Mail tab in
  the properties of the profile.

Considerations for using remote mail:

- Use in conjunction with a PST file.

- If connection time charges are high you may want to use remote mail.

- Remote mail is also used for remote access with services other than those in
  Exchange Server, for example, Microsoft Mail, Internet Mail, and so on.

- If you only need access to the Inbox folder, use remote mail.

Offline Folders:

Offline Folders (OST files) are the recommended setup option for users who use
the Exchange Server service. Offline folders are not an option for people who
use the Internet service, Microsoft Mail, or other online information services.
The OST keeps a replica of all of the folders (public or private) on the server
that have been marked to be available when both online and offline (by default
these are the Inbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, and Outbox).

Offline folders allow a laptop user, for instance, to synchronize all folders
prior to leaving the office (while still connected with a fast LAN connection),
then reply, delete, and compose new mail while flying to the new destination,
then synchronize the folders by means of a modem when the laptop user reaches
the destination (or wait until the user returns to the office to synchronize
folders).

For additional information about offline folders, click the article numbers below
to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q161725 OL97: What Are Offline Folders and How Do You Use Them?

  Q161889 XCLN: OST and PST Quick Reference

Offline folders are the best option if:

- The Exchange Server service is being used.

- You need public folder information when you work offline.

- Ease of use is a priority.

NOTE: Create an OST either by answering YES to 'do you travel with this computer'
in the profile wizard, OR by clicking Offline Folder file settings in the
Advanced tab of the properties for Exchange Server. Note that you MUST
synchronize a new OST one time before you can use that OST (in other words,
start the Exchange Client OFFLINE). If you only have access to Exchange Server
by means of a modem, you must follow the steps for a persistent connection
first, and then synchronize the folders to make the OST useable.

NOTE: If you start the Exchange Client online, the client automatically
synchronizes only the folder hierarchy (just the folder names themselves) and
then sends any mail that was left in the Outbox when you were offline. Outlook
has an option to "synchronize folders on exit" - the Exchange Client does not.
The preview pane does have some OST features that some users may find useful.
For instance, you can set a schedule to dial every hour to synchronize folders.

Dial-Up Networking Solutions for Each Operating System
------------------------------------------------------

MS-DOS:

Use Shiva Remote version 3.59 from Exchange Client.

For additional information, click the article numbers below to view the articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q158074 XCLN: Using ShivaRemote w/ Exchange (MS-DOS/Real-Mode IPX)

  Q157740 XCLN: Using ShivaRemote w/ Exchange (MS-DOS/LanMan TCP/IP)

Windows 3.x, Windows for Workgroups 3.1x:

Use Shiva Remote version 3.59 from Exchange Client.

NOTE: For laptop users who want to be docked and undocked (require multiple
NICs), use Windows 95 or Windows NT so that you can use multiple hardware
profiles.

NOTE: The version of Remote Access Service (RAS) that ships with Windows for
Workgroups can be used to access a computer running Exchange Server; however,
the remote mail features of Exchange Server (offline folders and remote mail)
cannot be used with Windows for Workgroups RAS (Windows for Workgroups RAS does
not support the APIs necessary for remote mail). Also, if you use Windows for
Workgroups RAS, you must first make a connection with Windows for Workgroups RAS
before you start the Exchange Client.

  Q158111 XCLN: ShivaRemote with Exchange (WFW 3.11/WFW TCP/IP or NetBEUI)

Windows 95:

Use Microsoft Dial-up Networking (DUN) (included with the operating system).


Windows NT Server:

Use Microsoft remote access service (RAS) (included with the operating system).


Microsoft Schedule+
-------------------

Schedule+ has two modes of operation: offline and group-enabled mode.

Group-enabled mode requires a persistent (continuous) connection to the computer
running Exchange Server, (either on the LAN or with a persistent connection over
a modem). If a local .scd file is present, synchronization is performed
automatically by default every 15 minutes, or it can be performed manually (In
Schedule+, on the Tools menu, click Options, and then click Synchronize). Only
changes are sent over the wire during the synchronization process.

In Offline mode you work directly from the local .scd file. Free and busy time is
not available to users offline, and it is stored in a hidden public folder on
the computer running Exchange Server. If you start Schedule + offline,
synchronization cannot take place. You must quit and log off Schedule +,
establish a dial-in connection, and then start Schedule+ ONLINE to synchronize
the local .scd file with the server.

One of the major remote improvements in Microsoft Outlook is the Calendar. The
Outlook Calendar is now simply another folder. Because of this, you can set it
up to be synchronized with an offline folder, like any other private or public
folder. This makes synchronizing all of the data extremely easy.

NOTE: Whenever you start Schedule+ offline OR if problems prevent Schedule+ from
contacting the computer running Exchange Server, the "work primarily from local
file" check box is automatically selected and will remain selected until it is
manually cleared. Even if you start Schedule+ ONLINE, the local .scd file is
still displayed (which may not yet be synchronized).

Deliver Now
-----------

On the Tools menu, if you click Deliver Now, you download all of the new mail to
the Inbox and send any mail currently queued in the Outbox. The Deliver Now
command does NOT synchronize folders and is not nearly as efficient for use with
an OST as the Sync All/This Folder command. In fact, if delivery of mail is set
to an OST (instead of a PST), Deliver Now re-counts all of the messages in the
Inbox, even though they have already been downloaded; this can be time
consuming.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q165113 XCLN: Deliver Now from Client Counts Every Message

The Deliver Now command is appropriate if an Exchange Server profile has multiple
services and you want to force delivery through a specific service, for example,
fax or MSN.

If offline folders (OST) are being used, educated users about how to use the
"sync all/this folder(s)" option and not use the deliver now feature.

Remote Support for the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh Client
----------------------------------------------------------

The general conditions for dial-up access on an Exchange Macintosh client are:

TCP/IP:

1. The user must have valid TCP/IP set up on Macintosh. To facilitate name
  resolution, the network must have either Hosts files for each Macintosh or
  DNS servers.

  NOTE: DHCP is supported by Open Transport for dynamic IP addressing only; it
  does not support WINS name resolution, hence the need for DNS servers. It is
  strongly recommended that you use the latest versions of Open Transport on
  the Macintosh, MacOS 7.5.3 or later.

2. Connection must be established independently of Exchange Macintosh client.
  This is different than the Exchange Windows client that can automatically
  dial for you (on the Tools menu, click Sync Folders, or on the Remote Mail
  menu, click Connect). In other words, Macintosh "remote" support only works
  with the "persistent connection" scenario outlined above).

3. You must be able to ping servers by name (this is critical), including any
  public folder servers. (Remember, these are often separately named servers
  that you do not see.)

If any of the above conditions do not exist, the Exchange Client is unable to
connect.

Appletalk:

1. Connection must be established independently of Exchange Client (a persistent
  connection must be established, as outlined above).

2. You must be able to see Exchange Server (and public folder servers) in the
  Chooser.

Outlook and the Microsoft Exchange Client, version  5.0
-------------------------------------------------------

There are no major changes to Exchange Client version 5.0 in the way remote users
configure and use Exchange Client and Schedule+ remotely.

Outlook does have some major enhancements that can make remote operation easier
for users who need remote access to mail, calendar, and contact information.
Because the new Outlook Calendar and contact list are simply folders, they too
can be marked as available when online and offline and synchronized to the OST
(offline folder). The Outlook client does not have a separate "preview" window
for retrieving remote mail as Exchange Client does; instead it is integrated
into the Inbox itself.

Specific Windows 95 Remote Considerations
-----------------------------------------

Under Windows 95, if an NIC driver is loaded in addition to the dial- up adapter
in Control Panel Network, either remove the NIC driver or set up an additional
hardware profile for remote use.
