Here is the Readme.txt file from the updated Setup Wizard files, which includes
instructions to install the updated files and the problems addressed.

Setup Wizard Update Readme
--------------------------

The Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard has been updated to address a number of known
issues. This update runs only under version 5.0 of Visual FoxPro. Do not use it
in Visual FoxPro 3.0 or previous releases.

Use the following steps to install the Setup Wizard update:

1. Replace the existing files in the following locations with the updated
  files:

   File           Location
   ----           --------
   Wzsetup.app    \Vfp\Wizards
   Wizset32.dll   \Vfp\Distrib.Src\Setup
   Clireg32.exe   \Vfp

  NOTE: If these files are not installed, then first rerun the Visual FoxPro 5.0
  Setup, select Custom Install, choose Professional Applications, and choose
  the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Runtime and Setup Wizard component options.

2. Search your hard drive for other copies of Clireg32.exe and replace them with
  the new version. This file is a common component that other applications such
  as Visual Basic also use.

3. If you have already run the Visual FoxPro 5.0 Setup Wizard, delete the
  "\Vfp\Distrib" directory and all occurrences of the following files:

     Dkcontrl.dbf
     Dkcontrl.cdx
     Wzsetup.ini

The Setup Wizard will automatically re-create these the next time you run it.

Updated Features
----------------

The Setup Wizard accommodates the latest version of Clireg32.exe, which now
supports remote automation via Distributed COM (DCOM). There is a new option in
the Custom OLE Servers Details dialog box for selecting DCOM. If you select this
option, you must ensure that the machine onto which you are installing your
distributed application supports DCOM.

Known Issues Addressed
----------------------

1. The maximum number of files created for a disk image sometimes exceeds the
  DOS root directory limit. This affects only disk images that have more than
  112 files per image.


2. When using a Visual FoxPro 3.0 setup, the default directory in Step 5
  contains a drive letter. Generating disk images appends an extra drive letter
  to this directory, creating corrupt disk images. Tabbing into and out of the
  Default Directory text box also eliminates the problem.


3. Installation of newly created disk images sometimes fails if you select the
  Directory only option in Step 5 and choose a Program Item for a file on Step
  6.


4. The Setup Wizard now generates a Registry key for international platforms
  using localized versions of the runtime resource file (for example,
  Vfp5enu.dll). This bypasses potential problems when installing a localized
  (non-US) runtime resource file onto an operating system whose locale ID is
  different.

  NOTE: This issue does not affect disk images created using the Vfp5enu.dll
  resource file.


5. The Setup Wizard now generates registry keys to support certain ActiveX
  controls such as Microsoft's Web Browser when using ActiveX Dual Interface
  Support. See the SYS(2333) function.


6. The Setup Wizard has been updated to generate registry keys compatible with
  Microsoft Office 97.


7. A problem was corrected using SETUP /F with installs onto Novell networks.
  This involved using long names for Program Group and Program Item
  Description.

  NOTE: The Visual FoxPro version 5.0x setup wizard no longer supports the /F
  switch.


8. The Setup Wizard no longer generates disk images that prompt the user to
  select a location for ODBC Start Menu items. Access ODBC components through
  the Control Panel.
