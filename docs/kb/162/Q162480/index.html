SUMMARY
=======

In earlier versions of Word, WordBasic macro code could be hidden with the
MacroCopy command. This command makes a macro "execute-only." In this state, the
macro code cannot be viewed, but the macro can be run.

This technique is useful if you are distributing macro solutions to customers or
to coworkers, and you do not want the customers or coworkers to be able to
modify the macros. This design means that some macros in the template can be
"execute-only" while others remain viewable.

In the versions of Word listed at the beginning of this article, you can protect
only an entire project (that is, all of the code within a template or document
must be either locked or unlocked). When a project is locked, any Visual Basic
for Applications code within the template cannot be viewed.

The "More Information" section of this article discusses how templates containing
"execute-only" macros that were created in earlier versions of Word are
converted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Templates containing execute-only macros are converted differently depending on
whether these execute-only macros are in the Normal template (Normal.dot) or a
custom template.

Execute-Only Macros in Normal.dot
---------------------------------

Word will convert the Normal template (typically the first time Word is started
after you upgrade to versions of Word 97 or later) and will not convert any of
the execute-only macros. A backup copy of the original Normal.dot will be saved
with a default file name of "Backup of Normal.wbk" in the same directory or
folder where Normal.dot is located. This allows Word 97 and later versions of
the Normal template to be unprotected; you can record new macros and have all
the typical programming functionality that Word allows.

NOTE: The "Backup of Normal.wbk" file is only created the very first time Word is
run. If, after starting Word, you replace the Normal.dot file with an earlier
version of the Word Normal.dot file, the backup file will not be created.

Execute-Only Macros in a Custom Template
----------------------------------------

When any template other than Normal.dot is converted, all execute-only macros
remain in the template, and the entire template or project is locked (you cannot
edit code in it). This design means that custom solutions will still work and
the code will still be protected. A disadvantage is that formerly accessible
macros may no longer be accessible.

When you attempt to do any of the following:

- Edit a converted execute-only macro.

-or-

- View the project contents in the Visual Basic Editor Project Explorer.

-or-

- View the project properties in the Visual Basic Editor Project Explorer.

the following alert is displayed:

  Project is unviewable

To gain access to these macros, use either of the following methods:

- Access the original template in the earlier version of Word.

-or-

- In the earlier version of Word, remove all of the execute-only macros so Word
  will not protect the project during the conversion process.
