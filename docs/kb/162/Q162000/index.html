-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you click the Finish button in the Visual FoxPro for Macintosh Setup
Wizard, a WAIT WINDOW appears with the message "Copying the source code files .
. ." followed by the following error message:

  The Setup Wizard was unable to make a copy of your source files.
  Setup terminated.

But the source files are indeed copied and a new folder is created with the
original name of the source folder plus the word "copy." But the Setup Wizard is
terminated.

CAUSE
=====

This is known to happen if there are too many files in the source folder and
subfolders (called the Distribution Tree Folder in Step 1 of the Setup Wizard).
This problem is usually encountered when there is about 300 files in the source
folder or subfolders. The exact number has not been determined. This problem has
been seen when there were as few as 125 files in the source folder. It appears
that it is a combination of the number and size of the files.

RESOLUTION
==========

There can be a number of solutions to this problem, depending on the needs of
the application and the developer. Some possible solutions follow:

1. Reduce the number of files that the application uses.

  Sometimes developers distribute empty tables or report files as separate
  files. These can be marked as included files in the project and built into
  the executable file. If the table structure is needed, it can be copied out
  of the executable with the COPY TO command. The same is true with reports.
  The .frx file can be USEd (it is just a table) and the COPY TO command used
  to copy it out to a report file that is external to the executable so it can
  be modified. The implementation of this and the interface in the application
  is left to the developer.

2. Create two sets of installation disks. One set would have the executable and
  other supporting files included by selecting the various check boxes in Step
  #2 of the Setup Wizard. The other set of distribution disks would contain the
  numerous supporting files the developer needs for the application. They would
  be compressed by running the Setup Wizard but not choosing a platform nor any
  of the other options in Step #2 of the Setup Wizard. Both sets of
  distribution disks would be installed into the same folder.

3. Use one of the other commercially available setup programs. Two that
  Microsoft is aware of are InstallerMaker from Aladdin Systems Inc. and
  Installer VISE from Mind Vision Software. There should be others also. The
  Web site addresses for each are below:

  http://www.aladdinsys.com
  http://www.mindvision.com

  Aladdin Systems, Inc. and MindVision Software are vendors independent of
  Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding their
  products' performance or reliability.

4. Make sure that neither of the Visual FoxPro Support Library files are in the
  Distribution Tree folder (the source folder). They are automatically included
  when the platform is specified in step #2 of the Setup Wizard. Including one
  or both of those files has been known to cause this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this error message is received but the copy of the source folder is not
created, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q155890 PRB: FoxPro for Mac's Setup Wizard Can't Copy Source Files


One sign that there are too many files is to run the Setup Wizard, specifying the
source folder that is suspected to contain the excess files, but do not specify
a platform in Step #2 of the Setup Wizard. When a platform is not check, the
Setup Wizard should run to completion when it had failed previously with a
platform selected.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Run the Setup Wizard, specifying a source folder that contains more than 300
files.
