-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If an LUA SLI application issues an SLI_RECEIVE request and passes a data buffer
that is smaller than the size of the chain being received, the SLI interface
returns a primary_rc of LUA_UNSUCCESSFUL and secondary_rc = LUA_DATA_TRUNCATED.

The SNA Server 2.11 32-bit Windows LUA SLI interface was enhanced in Service Pack
1 (SP1), so an application does not have to preallocate the full buffer size
when receiving data using the SLI_RECEIVE API.

However, even with this enhancement enabled, the SLI interface might not return a
primary_rc of LUA_OK and a secondary_rc of LUA_DATA_INCOMPLETE (0x00000060)
under certain conditions.

CAUSE
=====

When the receive buffer for the SLI_RECEIVE is filled up with data the SLI
library should return the SLI_RECEIVE verb with a primary_rc of LUA_OK and a
secondary_rc of LUA_DATA_INCOMPLETE (0x00000060). However, there are certain
conditions in which the SLI interfaces carries on receiving data, even if the
passed buffer has been filled up until it received the entire chain of Request
Units.

Because the passed data buffer is smaller than the entire chain of RUs being
received, the SLI interface returns the SLI_RECEIVE verb with a primary_rc of
LUA_UNSUCCESSFUL and a secondary_rc = LUA_DATA_TRUNCATED.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 SP1 corrects this problem. The updated modules
are:

  Acssli.dll for OS/2
  Winsli.dll for Windows 3.x
  Winsli32.dll for Windows 95
  Winsli32.dll for Windows NT

REFERENCES
==========

please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 SP1.


A supported fix is now available for 2.11 SP1 , but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
