-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Office 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Office 97 on your computer, you may receive the
following error message when you open an image file in Microsoft Paint:

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
  problem persists, contact the program vendor.

If you click Details, you receive an error message similar to the Following
message:

  MSPAINT caused an invalid page fault in module MSPAINT.EXE at 0137:0042d3fe.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a conflict between Microsoft Paint and the
graphics import filters included with Microsoft Office 97.

The problem may occur when you open the following types of files:

  DRW
  EPS
  GIF
  JPEG
  JPG
  PCD
  PICT
  TGA
  TIFF

The problem may also occur when you open any other type of file that requires a
graphics import filter.

The problem does not occur when you open PCX (PC Paintbrush) or BMP (Windows
bitmap) image files.


RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 95
----------

1. Download the Paint95.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center to an empty
  folder.

2. Double-click the file you downloaded in step 1 to expand it.

3. Copy the Mspaint.exe file to the Program Files\Accessories folder.

4. Copy the three .dll files to the Windows\System folder.

5. Restart your computer.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

1. Download the Paintnt.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center to an empty
  folder.

2. Double-click the file you downloaded in step 1 to expand it.

3. Copy the .exe and .dll files to the Winnt\System32 folder.

  NOTE: You may not be able to copy the Msvcrt.dll file if it is in use. If this
  is the case, boot your computer to Windows 95 or MS-DOS and then copy the
  file. If your hard drive uses the NTFS file system, you must rename the file
  first, and then copy the new Msvcrt.dll file.

  If you receive an error message stating "Cannot rename Msvcrt: The specified
  file is being used by Windows" you must rename the original Msvcrt.dll file
  and copy the new version to the Winnt\System32 folder from a Windows NT
  command prompt.

4. Restart your computer.

Center:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: The Office 2000 .pcx filter also causes problems with Paint. Downloading
the updated MSPaint program resolves this.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The graphics import filters included with Microsoft Office 97 are not compatible
with the versions of Microsoft Paint included with Microsoft Windows 95 and
Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0.

If you have not installed the patch, do not attempt to open image files in
Microsoft Paint unless they are either PCX or BMP files.
