SUMMARY
=======

One of the new features of the Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT
4.0, and Windows 2000 user interface is the taskbar status area. This article
demonstrates how to use Visual Basic to add, modify, and delete status or
notification indicators in the taskbar status area.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The taskbar status area is located to the right of the Start button, and
provides you with status or notification indicators about your programs. Icons
with ToolTips are typically used as indicators in the taskbar status area. The
following are some examples of how to use the taskbar status area:

- You can adjust the consumption level of your laptop's batteries by clicking a
  vertical graph in the taskbar status area and adjusting it in the window that
  appears. The graph indicates the amount of power left in your laptop
  computer's batteries.

- You can track your favorite stock by creating an icon that changes when your
  stock changes price. Click the icon to display a chart of the stock.

- You can adjust the volume control on a multimedia device by clicking the icon
  and displaying more controls.

To manipulate an icon in the taskbar status area, use the Windows API function
Shell_NotifyIcon in the Shell32.dll file. This function allows you to add,
modify, delete, set a ToolTip string, and send a callback message to execute
mouse events. Visual Basic versions 4.0 and earlier do not directly accept
callback messages or functions. However, there are three ways to work around
this limitation:

1. The Hard Way: Create a control that accepts callbacks. Refer to the Microsoft
  Systems Journal article cited in the References section of this article for a
  way to create a control that accepts callbacks. To create this control, you
  need Visual C++.

2. The Easy Way: Use a third-party control that intercepts messages, such as the
  Message Blaster control.

3. The Simple Way: Use a Visual Basic intrinsic control to serve as a Window
  that reacts to the callback message. This article contains a sample program
  that uses this method. With this method, you want to use an event in a
  control that is rarely used. The event will be exclusively used to process
  the callback message.

In Visual Basic 5.0 and later, you can use the AddressOf Operator to call
callback functions.

The next section explains the Shell_NotifyIcon function and the requirements to
use this function.

Shell_NotifyIcon Function
-------------------------

You use the Shell_NotifyIcon function to send a message to a system to add,
modify, or delete an icon from the taskbar status area. The function returns
True if the message is sent successfully or False if the function is
unsuccessful. The arguments of the functions are as follows:

  dwMessage: A message to execute an action. This parameter can be one of
  the following values:

     NIM_ADD: Adds an icon to the status area.
     NIM_DELETE: Deletes an icon from the status area.
     NIM_MODIFY: Modifies an icon in the status area.

  The values of these messages can be found in the header file,
  Shellapi.h.

  pnid: A pointer to a NOTIFYICONDATA structure. To pass this argument to
  the function, create a user-defined data type called NOTIFYICONDATA
  (shown later in this section) and pass this data type by value.

The NOTIFYICONDATA structure contains the following elements:

  cbSize: Passes the size of the NOTIFYICONDATA data type.
     Data Type: Long.
     Value: Use the Len function with the variable declared as this data
     type as the argument.

  hWnd: Handle of the window used to receive the notification message.
     Data Type: Long.
     Value: The hWnd property of the control used to receive this message.

  uId: Identifier of the icon in the status area.
     Data Type: Long.
     Value: Any value within the limits of the Long data type. The sample
     program uses vbNull.

  uFlags: Array of flags that indicate which of the other members contain
  valid data.
     Data Type: Long.
     Value: Any combination of the following constants to indicate that
     the member of this structure is valid and will be used:

        NIF_ICON: Passing this flag indicates that the value for the
        hIcon will be the icon that appears in the taskbar status area.

        NIF_MESSAGE: Passing this flag indicates that the uCallBackMessage
        value will be used as the callback message.

        NIF_TIP: Passing this flag indicates that the value of szTip will
        be used as the ToolTip for the icon in the taskbar status area.

  uCallBackMessage: Identifier of the notification message sent to the
  window that is used to receive the messages.
     Data Type: Long.
     Value: The message used to identify that a mouse event has occurred
     within the rectangular boundaries of the icon in the taskbar status
     area.

  hIcon: Handle of the icon that is displayed in the taskbar status area.
     Data Type: Long.
     Value: The image that will be used as an icon in the taskbar status
     area. This can be the icon property of a control, an image from an
     image control, or any icon image.

  szTip: String to be used as the ToolTip text.
     Data Type: Fixed-length string 64 bytes long.
     Value: Any null-terminated string under 64 bytes.

The next section explains how to use this function in a sample program to
manipulate icons in the taskbar status area.

The Sample Program
------------------

The sample program consists of a form containing two command buttons and the
common dialog box control. When you click Add Icon, you set the values of the
NOTIFYICONDATA data type. In this data type, you set the following values:

  cbSize: The length of the variable that uses the Len function.

  hWnd: The handle of the window used to receive the callback messages. In
  the sample program, the form is used as the window to receive the
  messages.

  uId: The icon identifier. Although you can use any number, the sample
  program uses the vbNull constants.

  uFlags: Array flags indicate what members of this structure are valid.
  The sample program uses all the flags for maximum versatility.

  uCallBackMessage: The message that is sent when mouse activity occurs on
  the icon in the taskbar status tray. The mouse message that is sent maps
  to a mouse event in the control specified in the hWnd value. You should
  use a mouse message that can handle the messages exclusively. For
  example, the sample program uses the WM_MOUSEMOVE message because this
  message maps to the MouseMove event of the form. Rarely used in its
  intended form, the MouseMove event is a suitable event for this purpose.

  hIcon: The icon that is to be displayed in the taskbar status area. The
  sample program uses the form icon.

  szTip: The ToolTip string. The string must be terminated with a null
  character so the vbNullChar constant is concatenated to the string.

After setting the data, you then call the Shell_NotifyIcon function and pass the
NOTIFYICONDATA along with a message to add the icon to the taskbar status area.

When you pass the mouse pointer over the icon in the taskbar status area, the
form receives the message WM_MOUSEMOVE. This message maps to the form's
MouseMove event. The X argument is the product of one of the mouse constants
that indicates the mouse input (such as a left-click, right-click, single-click,
or double-click) and the TwipsPerPixelX property of the screen. The mouse input
is produced by dividing the X argument with this property. The mouse input is
then used in a Select Case statement to execute a series of instructions.

For example, when you double-click the icon, the common dialog box appears and
allows you to select a different icon. The hIcon value of the NOTIFYICONDATA
data type is changed to the new icon. The Shell_NotifyIcon function is called
with the new data type and a message to modify the icon in the taskbar status
area.

If you right-click the icon, you execute the InputBox function that changes the
ToolTip text. The new string is null terminated with the vbNullChar constant and
the szTip value is changed to the new string. The Shell_NotifyIcon function is
called with the new NOTIFYICONDATA data and a message to modify the icon.

When you click Delete Icon or exit the application, the Shell_NotifyIcon function
is called with a message to delete the icon.

Steps To Create Sample Program
------------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic. If it is already running, go to the File menu and click
  New Project.

2. Place two CommandButtons and a common dialog box control on Form1.

3. Copy the following code to the Form1 code window:

        'Declare a user-defined variable to pass to the Shell_NotifyIcon
        'function.
        Private Type NOTIFYICONDATA
           cbSize As Long
           hWnd As Long
           uId As Long
           uFlags As Long
           uCallBackMessage As Long
           hIcon As Long
           szTip As String * 64
        End Type

        'Declare the constants for the API function. These constants can be
        'found in the header file Shellapi.h.

        'The following constants are the messages sent to the

        'The following constant is the message sent when a mouse event occurs
        'within the rectangular boundaries of the icon in the taskbar status
        'area.
        Private Const WM_MOUSEMOVE = &amp;H200

        'The following constants are the flags that indicate the valid
        'members of the NOTIFYICONDATA data type.
        Private Const NIF_MESSAGE = &amp;H1
        Private Const NIF_ICON = &amp;H2
        Private Const NIF_TIP = &amp;H4

        'The following constants are used to determine the mouse input on the
        'the icon in the taskbar status area.

        'Left-click constants.
        Private Const WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK = &amp;H203   'Double-click
        Private Const WM_LBUTTONDOWN = &amp;H201     'Button down
        Private Const WM_LBUTTONUP = &amp;H202       'Button up

        'Right-click constants.
        Private Const WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK = &amp;H206   'Double-click
        Private Const WM_RBUTTONDOWN = &amp;H204     'Button down
        Private Const WM_RBUTTONUP = &amp;H205       'Button up

        'Declare the API function call.
        Private Declare Function Shell_NotifyIcon Lib "shell32" _
           Alias "Shell_NotifyIconA" _
           (ByVal dwMessage As Long, pnid As NOTIFYICONDATA) As Boolean

        'Dimension a variable as the user-defined data type.
        Dim nid As NOTIFYICONDATA

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           'Click this button to add an icon to the taskbar status area.

           'Set the individual values of the NOTIFYICONDATA data type.
           nid.cbSize = Len(nid)
           nid.hWnd = Form1.hWnd
           nid.uId = vbNull
           nid.uFlags = NIF_ICON Or NIF_TIP Or NIF_MESSAGE
           nid.uCallBackMessage = WM_MOUSEMOVE
           nid.hIcon = Form1.Icon
           nid.szTip = "Taskbar Status Area Sample Program" &amp; vbNullChar

           'Call the Shell_NotifyIcon function to add the icon to the taskbar
           'status area.
           Shell_NotifyIcon NIM_ADD, nid
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command2_Click()
           'Click this button to delete the added icon from the taskbar
           'status area by calling the Shell_NotifyIcon function.
           Shell_NotifyIcon NIM_DELETE, nid
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()
           'Set the captions of the command button when the form loads.
           Command1.Caption = "Add an Icon"
           Command2.Caption = "Delete Icon"
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Terminate()
           'Delete the added icon from the taskbar status area when the
           'program ends.
           Shell_NotifyIcon NIM_DELETE, nid
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_MouseMove _

               sFilter = sFilter &amp; "|All Files (*.*)|*.*"
               CommonDialog1.Filter = sFilter
               CommonDialog1.ShowOpen
               If CommonDialog1.filename &lt;&gt; "" Then
                  Form1.Icon = LoadPicture(CommonDialog1.filename)
                  nid.hIcon = Form1.Icon
                  Shell_NotifyIcon NIM_MODIFY, nid
               End If
               Case WM_RBUTTONDOWN
                  Dim ToolTipString As String
                  ToolTipString = InputBox("Enter the new ToolTip:", _
                                    "Change ToolTip")
                  If ToolTipString &lt;&gt; "" Then
