-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0, 4.01, 4.01 Service Pack 1, 4.01 Service Pack 2, 5 for Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The LANGPACK directories of Windows NT Workstation and Server version 4.0 add
additional language support for Internet Explorer (IE) version 3.0. Installing
files and adding input locales in Control Panel under either Regional Settings
or Keyboard enables IE to display foreign language characters. (The GUI for
Input Locale is shared by Regional Settings and Keyboard.)

The LANGPACK also enables EMS Client version 4.0 to display foreign language
characters included in the pack.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Log on to an account with Administrator privileges and start the Windows NT
  4.0 Explorer. Open the drive sharepoint \NTWKS\NTSVR 4.0 CD\Network, and then
  go to the LANGPACK directory.

2. Select &lt;language | group of languages &gt;.inf file(s) and click the
  file(s) with the RIGHT mouse button. On the menu that appears, click Install.

3. You will be prompted for your Windows NT compact disc (or network driver) if
  some of the files needed are in this directory (\LANGPACK) and the remaining
  files are in the normal Windows NT distribution directories (for example,
  \i386). Change to the location on the compact disc or network sharepoint
  where the requested file resides, such as D:\i386 for a compact disc (where D
  is a CD-ROM drive) or J:\winnt.nt\winnt40.srv\retail\i386 (where
  \\productsx\relsys is accessed as drive J and J is a network drive).

4. It is necessary to reboot after installing the following languages: Japanese,
  Korean, and TChinese(Traditional Chinese).

  The following is a list of the .inf files and a brief list of the language
  support that each includes:

   - Arabic.inf - Arabic code page conversion and NLS API support (no IE 3.0
     viewer support)

   - Cyrillic.inf - Cyrillic-based language support

   - European.inf - Latin-based European language support

   - ExchSrvr.inf - All code page conversion tables for Exchange Server

   - Greek.inf - Greek language support

   - Hebrew.inf - Hebrew code page conversion and NLS API support (no IE 3.0
     viewer support)

   - Japanese.inf - Japanese code page conversion, NLS API support, and font

   - Korean.inf - Korean code page conversion, NLS API support and font

   - TChinese.inf - Traditional Chinese code page conversion, NLS API support,
     and font

   - Thai.inf - Thai code page conversions and NLS API support (no IE 3.0
     viewer support)

   - Turkish.inf - Turkish language support

   - US_Eng.inf - U.S. English language support

   - Vietnam.inf - Vietnamese code page conversions and NLS API support (no IE
     3.0 viewer support)

5. In Control Panel, open either Regional Settings or Keyboard, select the Input
  Locales tab, and click the Add button. The Add Input Locale window will
  appear. Select a language and then click OK.

6. If want to make the highlighted language the Default Input Locale, click Set
  As Default.

7. Choose a keystroke combination (Left ALT+SHIFT or CTRL+SHIFT) for switching
  locale settings, if desired. This enables you to switch the locale by
  pressing the keystroke combination you selected.

8. Check the Enable Indicator On Taskbar box so the locale indicator will appear
  on the taskbar.

Internet Explorer 3.0
---------------------

9. In Control Panel, click Internet then select the General tab. Click Fonts
  Settings and then select the language you want and the character sets for
  that language. Click OK several times to exit. Alternately, you can make the
  change directly in IE 3.0. Open IE 3.0 and on the taskbar select View, then
  click Options. Next, select the General tab and click Fonts Settings, then
  select the language you want and the character sets for that language. Click
  OK several times to exit. (Both ways of changing this setting lead you to the
  same GUI.)

For some language characters implemented in Single Byte Character Set (SBCS), a
category that includes most European languages, you can key in the characters
immediately after you complete the above steps.

But to enter any character of a language of Double Byte Character Set (DBCS),
such as all Far East locales, you must install a proper Input Method Editor
(IME) for the language. The LANGPACK only enables you to display those DBCS
languages included in the LANGPACK in IE 3.0, EMS 4.0, and Windows NT 4.0.

With the LangPack installed, Internet Explorer 4.0 users can install and use the
Japanese/Korean Input Method Editor (IME) for Windows 95 &amp; Windows NT 4.0.
This will allow users to not just display but also input Japanese and Korean
text into Web forms and Outlook Express 4.0 e-mail messages. For more
information, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
