MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is the best method to use to share documents between Word 97 and Word
  6.0 or 7.0?

  A. The best method is to use the Word 97 import converter for Word 6.0 and
  7.0. When you use the Word 97 import converter, Word 6.0 and Word 95 can read
  Word 97 documents directly. There are several advantages to this method:

   - The file size does not increase. That is, the file will be no larger than
     when you saved it from Word 6.0, Word 7.0, or Word 97.

   - You will not have to remember to use the Save As command to save the file
     in a different format. You just save the document as a Word Document. With
     the converter, you can use Word 97 to open Word 6.0 and Word 7.0 documents
     easily, and you can use Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 to open the Word 97 documents
     easily. Because you won't have to save the document in a different format,
     you will also avoid the prompts that ask you if you want to overwrite the
     existing format with a new format.
   - Using the Word 97 import converter is the best way to preserve formatting
     from Word 97 documents. This will give you the best results when you move
     documents from Word 97 to an earlier version of Word.

2. Q. Where can I get the Word 97 import converter?

  A. The converter is available in the "wrd97cnv.exe" file. This file, a
  self-extracting executable file, automatically installs the converter on your
  computer.

  For additional information about how to obtain the Word 97 converter, please
  see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q162214 How to Obtain the Word 97 Converter

3. Q. How does the Word 97 import converter work?

  A. You can work on a document in Word 97 and save it as a "Word Document"
  (Word 97 native format). You can then take this document to another computer
  running an earlier version of Word with the Word 97 import converter
  installed. You can open the Word 97 document in the earlier version of Word
  directly. You can work on it, and when you save the document, save it as a
  "Word Document" (Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 native format). Because Word 97 can
  read Word 6.0 and Word 7.0 files without a converter, you can then take the
  document back to the computer running Word 97, open the document, work on it,
  and once again save the document as a "Word Document" (Word 97 native
  format). On both computers, you will be saving in native Word Document
  format, without having to change the file type.

4. Q. When I double-click Wrd97cnv.exe, a Setup program is run. What files does
  this Setup program install?

  A. Depending on the version of Word you're using, Word installs either the
  Mswrd832.cnv file (32-bit version of the converter for people running Word
  7.0) or the Ms.cnv file (the 16-bit version of the converter for people
  running Word 6.0). This Setup program also installs a Readme file called
  "Wrd97cnv.doc " and it updates the necessary registry settings. For more
  information, see the Readme (Wrd97cnv.doc) file installed with the Word 97
  converter.

5. Q. In Word 97 I can use the Save As command and save a file in the Word
  6.0/95 format. When is this a good method to use?

  A. This is a good method to use if you do not have the Word 97 import
  converter installed on the computers running the earlier versions of Word.
  Some disadvantages to this method are that

   - The document generated when you save a Word 97 document using the Save As
     Word 6.0/95 option can have a significantly larger file size than the
     original Word 97 document.

   - The Word 6.0/95 export converter generates a Rich Text Format document
     with a .doc file extension. This file extension may cause confusion when
     you exchange files because Word will prompt you with questions about
     overwriting one file format with another.

6. Q. Why is the Word 6.0/95 file larger than the original file?

  A. When you save a document from Microsoft Word 97 for Windows to Word 6.0/95
  format, you generate a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. RTF is a text
  representation of a binary file. It is the format that most converters are
  based on. Because of its nature, RTF inherently generates a larger file than
  the original binary file when the document includes a great deal of
  formatting, pictures, or other objects.

  Relatively small documents containing little formatting and few objects may
  actually be smaller in Rich Text Format than in the native Word Document
  format.

  An updated version of the Word 6.0/95 export converter is now available. This
  converter will allow you to save from Microsoft Word 97 into a true Word 6.0
  or 7.0 binary format.

  To obtain the updated export converter, do one of the following:

Install Office 97 Service Release 2

7. Q. What is RTF (Rich Text Format)?

  A. The Rich Text Format (RTF) standard is a method of encoding formatted text
  and graphics for easy transfer between MS-DOS, Windows, Windows 95, OS/2, and
  Apple Macintosh applications.

  The RTF standard provides a format for text and graphics interchange that can
  be used with different output devices, operating environments, and operating
  systems. RTF uses the ANSI, PC-8, Macintosh, or IBM PC character set to
  control the representation and formatting of a document, both on the screen
  and in print. With the RTF standard, you can transfer documents created under
  different operating systems and with different software.

8. Q. What happens when I save a document as Word 6.0/95 from Word 97 and what
  types of problems will I see?

  A. If you are working on a document in Word 97 and then decide to save the
  file in Word 6.0/95 format, you save the file as a modified RTF document with
  a .doc extension. If you then open this document in Word 6.0 or Word 7.0, you
  may notice the following behaviors:

   - If the "Confirm Conversions" option is enabled, a dialog box will appear
     asking you to convert from Rich Text Format rather than the Word Document
     format you may expect. This occurs because Word can detect that the
     document is actually an RTF file even though it has a .doc extension.

   - If the "Confirm Conversions" option is not enabled, you may notice a
     message on the status bar stating that Word is converting the document.
     Because the document is an RTF file, a conversion is needed to convert it
     to the Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 format even though the file has a .doc
     extension.
   - If you click the Save As option on the File menu, you may notice that Word
     is proposing a file type of Rich Text Format (.rtf) and is suggesting a
     new file name with an .rtf extension. You have a few options at this
     point:

  Option 1: Change the "Save file as type" option to "Word Document (.doc)."

  This change will save the new version of your document over your previous
  version and change the file format to Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 format. Because
  Word 97 has a built in converter that allows it to read Word 6.0 and Word 7.0
  files , this is the best solution in most situations.

  Option 2: Choose OK.

  The updated version of your document will be saved with the new file name with
  an .rtf extension. You can save your work to this file and continue to use
  this file with the .rtf extension.

  NOTE: By default, Word only lists files with a .doc extension in the Open
  dialog box. You must change the "List files of type" option to "Rich Text
  Format (.rtf)" to see .rtf documents.

9. Q. Why can't I just save my file in Rich Text Format?

  A. There are several advantages to saving in Word 6.0/95 format over saving in
  Rich Text Format:

   - The Word 6.0/95 export converter preserves more formatting than the
     standard RTF export converter. To preserve the most formatting possible,
     use the Word 97 import converter with Word 6.0 or Word 7.0.

   - The Word 6.0/95 RTF file that is generated is actually smaller than the
     RTF file that is generated by the standard Rich Text Format export
     converter.

10. Q. Where can I find more information about the Word 6.0/95 Save option and
  the Word 97 converter?

  A. Additional information about file converters is available from the
  following sources:

   - The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit (ORK). The ORK is available on the
     Microsoft Web site at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/

     in Canada.

   - The WDREAD8.TXT readme file. This file is installed in the \Program
     Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder when you run the Office 97 Setup
     program.

11. Q. Where can I find more information about formatting that is retained
  through the conversion process?

  A. Click the Office Assistant, type "Save as Word 7.0" click Search, and then
  click to view "Results of saving Word 97 documents in other formats."
