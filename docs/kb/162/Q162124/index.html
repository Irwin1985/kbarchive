This article is the first of two articles that provide troubleshooting
information for Clip Gallery. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q162128 CG3: Clip Gallery General Troubleshooting Tips Part 2 of 2

If your topic is not covered in this article, query on the article title in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although you can start with any of the following troubleshooting techniques,
Microsoft recommends that you start at the top of the list and continue
troubleshooting until your problem is resolved or diagnosed.

Does Clip Gallery Function Correctly in Another Program?
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Start WordPad. To do this, click the Start button, point to Programs, point
  to Accessories, and click WordPad.

  NOTE: You can use any program that has an Insert Object command to run the
  tests. In this article, WordPad was chosen to perform the Clip Gallery tests
  because it comes with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.

2. On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip Gallery.
  Click OK.

If Clip Gallery starts from another program, Clip Gallery is functioning
properly. Your troubleshooting steps should now focus on the client program (the
program you are trying to use Clip Gallery with). Please consult your
documentation to troubleshoot the client program.

If Clip Gallery does not start, proceed to the next section.

Does Clip Gallery Run from the Compact Disc?
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you have Publisher 97 on floppy disks, proceed to the "Test for a
Corrupted Artgalry.cag File" section of this article.

1. Insert the Publisher 97 or Office 97 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.

2. Start Windows Explorer and switch to the Shared\Artgalry folder on the
  compact disc. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is drive D, go to
  D:\Shared\Artgalry.

3. Double-click Artgalry.exe from the compact disc. This registers the program
  as a shared application in the registry of the operating system.

  NOTE: If you receive an error message when you try to register Artgalry.exe
  from the compact disc, you may be experiencing problems with the registry or
  with the compact disc.

4. Start WordPad. To do this, click the Start button, point to Programs, point
  to Accessories, and click WordPad.

5. On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip Gallery.
  Click OK.

6. If Clip Gallery starts from the compact disc, the copy of Artgalry.exe on
  your hard disk may be corrupted.

  To copy the contents of the Artgalry folder to your hard disk, follow these
  steps:

  a. Copy the contents of the Shared\Artgalry folder (except the Artgalry.cag
     file, which is already on your hard disk), to the Program Files\Common
     Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry folder.

  b. Double-click the Artgalry.exe file to register the copy on your hard disk.

7. To see if Clip Gallery now runs from your hard disk, follow these steps:

  a. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and click
     WordPad.

  b. On the Insert Menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip Gallery.
     Click OK.

If Clip Gallery does not run, proceed to the next section.

Test for a Corrupted Artgalry.cag File
--------------------------------------

1. Rename the Artgalry.cag file. To do so:

  a. Find the Artgalry.cag file. This file is usually located in the Program
     Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry folder.

  b. Right-click the file icon, click Rename on the shortcut menu, and then
     enter a new name, such as Artgalry.old.

2. Try starting Clip Gallery again. To do so:

  a. Start WordPad. To do this, click the Start button, point to Programs,
     point to Accessories, and click WordPad.

  b. On the Insert menu, click Object.

  c. In the Object Type list, click Microsoft Clip Gallery, and then click OK.

  NOTE: If the Artgalry.cag file is missing, Clip Gallery creates a new one when
  you start Clip Gallery. Artgalry.cag is a database file that stores the clip
  preview images and catalogs the location of each image. Clips you may have
  manually added to Clip Gallery from other sources are now unavailable.
  However, this does not remove clipart from Office 97, PowerPoint 97, or
  Publisher 97, because these programs use concurrent databases and are not
  affected if you delete the Artgalry.cag file.

  For more information on creating a custom Artgalry.cag, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q161718 CG3: Creating Clip Gallery Packages

If Clip Gallery does not run, proceed to the next section.

Check the Registry Entries for Clip Gallery
-------------------------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

If you are running Windows NT or Windows 2000, you should also update your
Emergency Repair Disk (ERD).

NOTE: The following steps assume you are running Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, or
Windows 2000. (If you are running Windows NT 3.51, substitute regedt32.exe in
step 1.)

1. On the Start menu, click Run. Type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) in
  the Open box, and then click Open. This starts the Registry Editor.

2. Locate the following registry key:

     My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MS_ClipArt_Gallery\CLSID

  a. Double-click the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key. The key looks similar to a folder
     you would see in Windows Explorer.

  b. Double-click the MS_ClipArt_Gallery key. You may need to scroll through
     the Registry Editor window to find the key.

  c. Click the CLSID key.

  d. Verify the value of the key. The MS_ClipArt_Gallery\CLSID key should have
     the following data value:

         Name        Data
         ----        ----
         (Default)   "{00030026-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}"

3. Locate the following registry key:

     My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MS_ClipArt_Gallery\protocol\ 
     StdFileEditing\server

  Verify the value of the key. The MS_ClipArt_Gallery\protocol\
  StdFileEditing\server key should have the following data value:

     Name        Data
     ----        ----
     (Default)   "C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\ARTGALRY\ARTGALRY.EXE"

4. Locate the following registry key:

     My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MS_ClipArt_Gallery.2\CLSID

  Verify the value of the key. The MS_ClipArt_Gallery.2\CLSID entry should have
  the following data value:

     Name        Data
     ----        ----
     (Default)   "{00021290-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}"

5. Locate the following registry key:

     My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MS_ClipArt_Gallery.2\protocol\ 
     StdFileEditing\server

  Verify the value of the key. The MS_ClipArt_Gallery.2\protocol\
  StdFileEditing\server entry should have the following data value:

     Name        Data
     ----        ----
     (Default)   "C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\ARTGALRY\ARTGALRY.EXE"

  The Data value should be the path to your Artgalry.exe file.

  NOTE: The path uses MS-DOS names. This is why you are seeing PROGRA~1 instead
  of the long name: Program Files.

6. Locate the following registry key:

     My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\ 
     {00021290-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\LocalServer32

  Verify the value of the key. The LocalServer32 entry should have the following
  data value:

     Name        Data
     ----        ----
     (Default)   "C:\PROGRAM FILES\COMMONFILES\ 
                 MICROSOFT SHARED\ARTGALRY\ARTGALRY.EXE"

  This path uses long file names.

7. Export the Clip Gallery Keys.

  If any registry entries for Clip Gallery are invalid (for your specific
  computer and its drive structure) or are missing, you should remove the
  complete registry keys for Clip Gallery, and then restore them.

  NOTE: If all Clip Gallery registry keys are correct, proceed to the next
  section.

  a. Locate the following key:

         My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\ 
         {00021290-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

  b. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File. The Export Registry File
     dialog box appears.

  c. Save the Registry file on your desktop, and name it Clsidcag3.reg or
     something similar.

  d. Locate the following key:

         My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MS_ClipArt_Gallery

  e. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

  f. Save the Registry file on your desktop. Use a name, such as Cag1.reg.

  g. Locate the following key:

         My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MS_ClipArt_Gallery.2

  h. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

  i. Save the Registry file on your desktop and name it Cag2.reg.

8. Delete the Clip Gallery Keys.

  NOTE: If you have not exported the Clip Gallery Keys, follow the instructions
  in step g of this section, and export the keys before you continue.

  a. Locate the following key:

         My Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ 
         CLSID\{00021290-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

  b. Press DELETE, and then click Yes on the Confirm Key Delete dialog box to
     delete the entry.

Does Clip Gallery Work in Safe Mode? (Windows 95 only)
------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you are running Windows NT, skip this section and proceed to the "Check
the Dates of the OLE32 DLL Files" section.

1. Quit any programs you are running.

2. Click Start, and then click Shut Down to display the Shut Down Windows dialog
  box.

3. On the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click Restart The Computer.

4. When you see "Starting Windows 95" as the computer starts, press F8 to
  display the Microsoft Windows 95 Startup Menu.

5. Choose item #3 (Safe mode) on the menu. This starts Windows 95 in Safe Mode
  without network support. After you are running in Safe Mode, the words Safe
  Mode appear in all four corners of the screen.

  NOTE: If you are running a shared copy of Microsoft Office, choose item #4
  (Safe mode with network support) to test the problem.

6. After Windows 95 starts in Safe mode, open WordPad. Click Start, point to
  Programs, point to Accessories, and then click WordPad.

7. Start Microsoft Clip Gallery.

  a. On the Insert menu, click Object.

  b. In the Object Type list, click Microsoft Clip Gallery, and then click OK.

  If Clip Gallery does not start, skip to the "Check the Dates of the OLE32 DLL
  Files" section. If Clip Gallery starts, then restart Windows 95, letting it
  restart normally.

8. Change your Display Adapter to VGA.

  Safe mode bypasses the current real-mode configuration and loads a minimal
  protected-mode configuration, disabling Windows 95 device drivers and using
  the standard VGA display adapter.

  If Clip Gallery starts in Safe mode, you may be experiencing a conflict with
  your display adapter. Use the following test to determine if a conflict
  exists with your display adapter.

  a. After Windows 95 restarts, click Start, point to Settings, and click
     Control Panel.

  b. In Control Panel, double-click the Display icon.

  c. Click the Settings Tab, and then click Change Display Type.

  d. Write down your Adapter Type and its Manufacturer so you will be able to
     properly reset it after this troubleshooting step.

  e. Click Change (to the right of the Adapter Type entry), and then click Show
     All Devices. Scroll to the top of the Manufacturers list and click
     Standard Display Types to select Standard Display Adapter(VGA). Click OK,
     and then click Close in the Change Display Type dialog box. Click Apply in
     the Display Properties window. Click Yes when you are prompted to restart
     Windows.

  f. After Windows 95 starts with VGA screen resolution, start WordPad. Click
     the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
     WordPad.

  g. Try starting Clip Gallery again. On the Insert Menu, click Object, and
     then click Microsoft Clip Gallery. Click OK.

If Clip Gallery starts, you may be experiencing problems with the display driver
for your video card. Contact the manufacturer of your display card or computer,
or contact Windows 95 Technical Support or the OEM Manufacturer that
pre-installed Windows 95 for an updated version of the video driver.

If Clip Gallery still does not start, proceed to the "Check the Dates of the
OLE32 DLL Files" section.

NOTE: To restore your original video driver settings, follow steps 8a, 8b, and
8c. In step 8e, select the Adapter Type and Manufacturer that you wrote down
previously. If your driver isn't on the list, click Show All Devices and scroll
up the list until you find it. Click OK, and then click Close on the Change
Display Type dialog box. Click Apply in the Display Properties window. Click Yes
when you are prompted to restart Windows. Your computer should restart with the
original driver, and you can adjust the display settings to your original
resolution and color depth.

For additional information on Safe Mode, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q156126 Troubleshooting Windows 95 Using Safe Mode


Check the Dates of the OLE32 DLL Files
--------------------------------------

Clip Gallery requires several OLE32 files. If any of these files are corrupted or
missing, Clip Gallery will not function properly. The following table lists the
OLE32 files initially installed by the three operating systems under which Clip
Gallery can run.

  OLE32 File        Win95      Win NT 3.51     Win NT 4.0
  --------------------------------------------------------

  Compobj.dll      7/11/95       5/26/95        8/2/96
  Ddeml.dll        7/11/95       5/26/95        8/2/96

  Typelib.dll      7/11/95       5/26/95        8/2/96

NOTE: The above dates are for a clean installation of each operating system.
System updates, service packs, and other component upgrades install files with
the same names, but with different dates. Refer to the Readme file that
accompanied the system update, service pack, or upgrade to compare with the
dates in the table.

If any of the files do not have appropriate dates for your operating system and
system upgrades, you may have damaged files or an incompatibility because of
mismatched DLL files.

Follow these steps to replace your OLE32 files:

1. Restore the DLLs from the Sysbckup folder (Windows 95 only).

  Some of the OLE32 files can be restored from the Sysbckup folder. This must be
  done in MS-DOS mode because Windows may be using some of the files for other
  operations.

  NOTE: The system backup (Sysbckup) folder is located in the folder in which
  you installed Windows 95. (Windows NT does not have a Sysbckup folder.)

  a. Click Start, and then click Shut Down. This opens the Shut Down Windows
     dialog box.

  b. On the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click "Restart the computer in MS-DOS
     mode?" to restart your computer in MS-DOS mode.

  c. Switch to the Windows\Sysbckup folder and type the following command:

         COPY *.DLL C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\*.DLL

     This copies the DLL file in the Windows\Sysbckup folder to the
     Windows\System folder. This may contain the mismatched DLLs that are
     causing the problem.

  d. After you copy the files, restart your computer, and let Windows 95 start
     normally.

  e. Test to see if Clip Gallery starts within WordPad.

     Start WordPad from the Start menu and start Microsoft Clip Gallery from the
     Insert menu.

     If Clip Gallery does not start, then the replacement files did not fix the
     problem. You must rename the DLL files and either manually extract the
     files from your original installation source or reinstall Windows 95.

2. Extract the OLE32 DLL files from your Windows compact disc.

  WARNING: The following procedure involves manually replacing DLLs. If you are
  not experienced with manual extraction procedures or have an OEM installation
  of Windows 95, you may want to simply reinstall Windows 95. Incorrectly
  replacing OLE modules can result in more problems than it resolves. If you
  are unsure of the following steps, please contact Windows 95 Technical
  Support or the OEM Manufacturer that pre-installed your operating system.

  Extract the files into the Windows\System folder, replacing every file in the
  OLE32 file table.

  files, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

a. After you copy the files, restart your computer, and let Windows 95 start
  normally.

b. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click WordPad.

c. On the Insert menu, click Object.

d. In the Object Type list, click Microsoft Clip Gallery, and then click OK.

If Clip Gallery still does not start, then the problem is most likely with the
operating system. This might require that you reinstall Windows 95 or you may
have to reformat your hard disk and reinstall all of your programs. At this
point, Microsoft recommends that you contact Windows Technical Support or the
OEM Manufacturer that pre-installed Windows on the computer.
