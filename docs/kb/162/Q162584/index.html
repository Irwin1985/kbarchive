SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses some of the issues to consider when you distribute a
run-time application.

These issues are discussed in general terms, and may not apply to your particular
situation; also, there may be issues you need to consider in your own situation
that are not mentioned in this article. The purpose of this article is to
present tips for successfully deploying your application and implementing an
upgrade strategy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Developing a well thought-out plan for distributing or upgrading your run- time
application is arguably the most important step toward a successful deployment
of the application. When you create your distribution plan, consider the
following topics.

Testing
-------

In general, the more time you allow for the testing phase of your application,
the better your finished product will be. Consider these issues when you create
a plan to test your application:

- Develop a systematic plan for testing each feature of the upgraded
  application.

- If possible, emulate the production environment in your test environment so
  you can test the application in a user environment.

- Enlist assistance from users when testing your application; the way you
  perform a task in the application may be different from the way a user will
  do it.

- Try to stress test the application with multiple users before you distribute
  the upgrade so you can resolve any performance or locking issues that arise.

- Arrange to conduct pilot tests of your Setup program in a production
  environment to be sure the application can be installed smoothly.

User Environment
----------------

Consider the production environment in which you will set up your application:

- Make sure all of your users have the minimum required software and hardware
  to run your application.

- Notify users of the installation in advance, so they are aware of it and are
  expecting it.

- Time the installation so it does not add unnecessary stress by conflicting
  with other user activities, such as end-of-month responsibilities.

Upgrading an Existing Application
---------------------------------

Following are some general considerations when you are ready to upgrade your
application.

- Always create a current backup of the existing application before you
  upgrade.

- Microsoft Access converts most databases without difficulty; however, be sure
  to allow time to resolve unexpected issues that may arise when you convert
  your database.

- If all users will not upgrade at the same time, devise a systematic strategy
  for distributing the upgrade.

- If users need additional training, schedule the training to coincide with the
  distribution of the upgrade.

- If possible, plan for someone to be on site when you first distribute the
  upgrade so you can address any setup issues that arise.
