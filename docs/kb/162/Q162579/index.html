-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Word 97 does not retain the scaling (size) information for a linked graphic.
That is, the graphic reverts to its original size (100 percent).

NOTE: This also applies to other linked embedded objects.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

- The "Link to file" check box is selected (the check box has a mark in it).

  -and-

- The "Save with document" check box is not selected (the check box is clear).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

Use one of the following methods to work around the problem.

Method 1: Use This Method When Inserting New Graphics
-----------------------------------------------------

Enable the "Save with document" check box when you insert the graphic by
following these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, point to Picture, and then click From File.

2. In the Insert Picture dialog box, select the desired graphic.

3. Click the "Link to file" and "Save with document" check boxes so both have
  check marks. Then, click OK.

NOTE: This means that the graphic is stored in the Word document as opposed to
being stored outside of the file only. The size of the file will be larger. This
does not cause the file size to grow as much as it did in earlier versions of
Word. The new graphic compression feature keeps the file size much smaller. To
test this, create a document in an earlier version of Word and include several
screen shots. Save it and note the size. Create a similar document in Word 97
and note the size--it will be much smaller compared to size of the file created
an earlier version of Word.

Method 2: Use This Method to Correct Graphics in Existing Documents
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Use this method to correct existing graphics in existing documents.

1. Open the document.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. Click the View tab.

4. Enable the Field Codes check box.

5. Look in the document for INCLUDEPICTURE field codes.

6. For each INCLUDEPICTURE field code, locate and delete the "\d" switch.

7. With your insertion point still inside the field code, press the F9 key on
  your keyboard to update the field.

8. Save and Close the document.

NOTE: In place of steps 2-7 above, you can run the following macro:

Dim ofield As Object

     Sub FindField()
         ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes = True
         For Each ofield In ActiveDocument.Fields
             ofield.Select
             If ofield.Type = "67" Then 'INCLUDEPICTURE field
                 With Selection.Find
                    .MatchWholeWord = True
                    .MatchSoundsLike = False
                    .MatchWildcards = False
                    .MatchAllWordForms = False
                    .Execute findtext:=" \d ", replacewith:=" ", _
                     replace:=True
                     .Wrap = wdFindStop
                 End With
                 ofield.Update
             End If
         Next ofield
         ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes = False
     End Sub

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q172475 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you link a picture in Word 97 with the "Link to file" option in the Insert
Picture dialog box, any changes you make to the size of the graphic will not be
retained when the file is saved, closed, and reopened.

This problem only occurs when the "Save with document" check box is not
selected.

NOTE: This problem is not influenced by cropping the graphic or selecting the
"Float over text" check box.
