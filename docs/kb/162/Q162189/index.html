-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT MacFile server with multiple Macintosh volumes, Macintosh
clients may experience wait times showing network busy (-&gt;&lt;-) for varied
lengths of time while Afp calls requiring an exclusive lock retry. This issue
can be verified in a network trace where Macintosh clients are seen to be
issuing retry calls AfpGetFileDirParms and AfpCloseFork until an exclusive
volume lock on the MacFile server is released.

CAUSE
=====

Where multiple volumes exist, as file status changes were being processed across
various Macintosh volumes, an exclusive and volume-specific lock was being
applied during volume change notify processing. In a particular instance, a
volume-specific lock was not being released. This lock was released as more
volume changes were processed; however, wait times varied.

RESOLUTION
==========

The issue was addressed in a code change that manages the change notify
processing more efficiently and resolves the held lock condition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition, performing the following actions can have a positive impact on
Macintosh performance:

1. Disabling the Catsearch Function - this requires the hotfix for Windows NT
  version 3.51 or Service Pack 3 or later for Windows NT version 4.0 and a
  registry change.

2. Disabling EnableOplocks on the NT Server (registry change only).

3. Reducing AppleTalk Traffic by using a 3rd party application called Less Talk
  on the Mac client.

4. If Microsoft Mail is being used -- reset the PC Polling interval on the MS
  Mail client to reduce the frequency of polling for new mail.

5. Apply a hotfix that resolved a record locking issue -- "Record Unlock After
  PC Release" (this fix should be included in the hotfix under item number one.
