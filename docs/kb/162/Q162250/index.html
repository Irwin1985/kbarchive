-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack on a Dual Processor Compaq
System with a Compaq SSD installed, the computer may stop responding at the
Windows NT logon screen, without displaying any error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The Compaq SSD was used to upgrade the system to a multiprocessor system. The
SSD correctly installs the files required for multiprocessing support, but
incorrectly modifies the line in the Setup.log file that refers to the Hal.dll
file. The Hal.dll line references the single processor version of the Hal.dll
file, while the NTOSKRNL line references the multiprocessor version of the
kernel. As a result, the Windows NT service pack installs the multiprocessor
kernel file, and the single processor version of the Hal.dll file. When the
system restarts after the service pack installation, the Windows NT kernel load
screen reports 1 system processor; Multiprocessor Kernel. Windows NT continues
loading, but will stop responding at the logon screen without any errors.

RESOLUTION
==========

Prior to installing the service pack:

Manually edit the Setup.log file located in %SystemRoot%\Repair to reflect the
following changes:

On a Compaq Proliant 4500 or other System Pro Compatible System:

  Original Line
  \winnt\system32\hal.dll = "\HAL.DLL","f337"

Modify this line to the following:

  \winnt\system32\hal.dll = "halsp.dll"."f337"

On a Compaq Proliant 1500, 5000 or other MPS Compatible System:

  Original Line
  \winnt\system32\hal.dll = "\HAL.DLL","1a01c"

Modify this line to the following:

  \winnt\system32\hal.dll = "halmps.dll"."1a01c"

After installing the service pack, perform the following steps:

If Windows NT is installed on a FAT Partition
---------------------------------------------

1. Start the computer with a DOS disk.

2. On a Proliant 4500 or other System Pro Compatible computer, manually copy the
  Halsp.dll file from Service Pack 2 to %SystemRoot%\System32\Hal.dll.

  On a Proliant 1500, 5000, or other MPS Compatible computer, manually copy the
  Halmps.dll file from Service Pack 2 to %SystemRoot%\System32\Hal.dll.

3. The computer should start normally now.

4. To prevent the problem from happening in the future, follow the earlier steps
  to modify the Setup.log in the repair directory. You must also change the
  file checksum from f337 to 1b36e, or from 1a01c to 125d8.

If Windows NT is installed on an NTFS partition
-----------------------------------------------

1. Perform a second installation of Windows NT in a different directory.

2. After the installation is complete, start the second installation and:

  On a Proliant 4500 or other System Pro compatible computer, manually copy the
  Halsp.dll file from Service Pack 2 to the original
  %SystemRoot%\System32\Hal.dll directory.

  On a Proliant 1500, 5000, or other MPS compatible computer, manually copy the
  Halmps.dll file from Service Pack 2 to the original
  %SystemRoot%\System32\Hal.dll directory.

3. Restart the original installation of Windows NT.

4. Delete the second installation of Windows NT.

5. To prevent the problem from happening in the future, follow the earlier steps
  to edit the Setup.log file in the repair directory. You must also change the
  file checksum from f337 to 1b36e, or from 1a01c to 125d8.

As an alternative to a second installation, you can modify the contents of the
emergency repair disk (ERD) by performing the following steps:

1. Remove the attributes from the Setup.log file by typing the following at the
  command-line prompt:

  attrib -r -h -s a:\SETUP.LOG

2. In the Setup.log file, add the following line to the files.WinNt section:

  On a Proliant 4500 or other System Pro compatible computer:

     \Winnt\System32\hal.dll = "halsp.dll","f337","\",
     (continued line)  "nt351 repair disk","halsp.dll"

  On a Proliant 1500, 5000, or other MPS compatible computer:

     \Winnt\System32\hal.dll = "halmps.dll","1a01c","\",
     (continued line)  "nt351 repair disk","halmps.dll"

  NOTE: \Winnt represents the directory where Windows NT is installed.

3. Copy the Halmps.dll or Halsp.dll file from the Windows NT 4.0 service pack
  source media to the root directory of the ERD.

4. Restart your computer with the three Windows NT 3.51 Setup disks.

5. Select R to Repair your Windows NT.

6. Select only "Verify Windows NT System Files" and continue.

7. If prompted to insert Windows NT setup disk #4, press ESC to continue with
  the Repair process.

8. After you replace the Hal.dll file with the file from the Windows NT 4.0
  service pack, press F3 to exit Repair. Restart the computer, and then restart
  Windows NT.

9. To prevent the problem from happening in the future, follow the earlier steps
  to edit the Setup.log file in the repair directory. Also, you must change the
  file checksum from "f337" to "1b36e" for Halsp.dll, or from "1a01c" to
  "125d8" for Halmps.dll.
