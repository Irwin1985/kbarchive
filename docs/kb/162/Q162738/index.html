  incorrect.

- TCP/IP may be improperly bound to the Dial-Up Adapter.

- The modem signal may be too low for the remote server to detect.

and TCP/IP components.

3. Click TCP/IP again, and then click Remove, repeating this step until all
  TCP/IP components are removed.

4. Click each Dial-Up Adapter component, click Remove, and then click OK.
  If you are prompted to restart the computer, click No.
