SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a macro that was recorded to find and replace formatting, the
"Replace With" formatting will be applied to the text located at the insertion
point.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the Find or Replace commands on the Edit menu, you can specify
formatting by choosing that formatting item from one of the built-in toolbars.

For example, to find all paragraphs formatted for Center alignment:

1. In the Find and Replace dialog box, click the Find What box.

2. Click the Center Alignment button on the Formatting toolbar.

This will apply center alignment as a search criteria.

When you record a macro to perform these steps, the action of clicking on the
formatting button is recorded as part of the Edit or Replace command as
expected. However, these actions are also recorded as separate commands in the
macro. When the recorded macro is run, this results in the Replace With
formatting being applied to the area where the search begins.

For example, if you have the following text in your document

  This is paragraph one that is Left Aligned.
              This is paragraph two that is Center Aligned.
  This is paragraph three that is Left Aligned.

and, for this example,

1. The search criteria in the recorded macro for Find What is set to Center
  Alignment.

2. The Replace With criteria is set to Right Alignment.

3. The insertion point is in the first paragraph prior to running the macro.

the result will format both paragraphs one and two with right alignment, as in
the following example:

                         This is paragraph one that was Left Aligned.
                         This is paragraph two that was Center Aligned.
This is paragraph three that is Left Aligned.

Method 1: Use the Format Button in the Find and Replace Dialog Box
------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Find And Replace dialog box, use the Format button to set the Find What
and Replace With criteria (the Format button is located at the bottom of the
Find and Replace dialog box).

Method 2: Edit the Recorded Macro and Remove the Extra Commands
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can remove or disable the formatting commands that were applied when you
recorded the macro.

To edit the macro, use the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

2. From the list of available macros, select the macro to edit.

3. Click the Edit button.

4. In the Visual Basic Editor window, scroll through the macro until you see
  commands similar to the following:

     Selection.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphCenter
     Selection.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphRight
     Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
     Selection.Find.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphCenter
     Selection.Find.Replacement.ClearFormatting
     Selection.Find.Replacement.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = _
        wdAlignParagraphRight
     With Selection.Find

5. Comment the two lines of code prior to Selection.Find.ClearFormatting by
  adding an apostrophe at the beginning of the lines.

  For example:

     'Selection.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphCenter
     'Selection.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = wdAlignParagraphRight
     Selection.Find.ClearFormatting

6. On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.
