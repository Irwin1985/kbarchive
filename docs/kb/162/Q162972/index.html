The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The Backup program included with Windows NT (Ntbackup.exe) is a basic tape
backup program. It can back up mapped network drives, local drives, and the
registry. Backups can span multiple tapes. Backup does not support backing up to
removable media other than tape.

This article describes how to troubleshoot problems with Backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Tape Drive Is Not Recognized
----------------------------

The most common reason for this is a problem with the SCSI bus. Verify that the
cables are properly attached to the tape drive and that the SCSI bus is
correctly terminated.

Error Writing to Tape
---------------------

This may be due to a problem with the SCSI bus or a bad tape. When you reuse
tapes, be sure to erase them first. Format and retension the tape before reuse
if you can.

Invalid Media
-------------

Check to be certain you have inserted the correct type of tape for your tape
device. This may also be an indication that the tape is bad and needs to be
replaced.

Skipped Files
-------------

Backup cannot back up files that are locked open by another process. If the file
does not become available in 30 seconds, the file is skipped.

Close as many running programs as you can before you perform a backup. There are
some third-party backup programs that allow you to back up open files.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q104169
  TITLE : Files Skipped with Windows NT Backup

Fatal Error on Drive 1
----------------------

This is usually caused by either incompatible hardware or out-of-date firmware on
the tape device or controller. Consult the Hardware Compatibility List to make
sure your hardware is supported, then check with the manufacturer to see if
there is a firmware update available.

------------------------------------------

This error can be caused by firmware or incorrect SCSI termination. Verify that
the SCSI bus is correctly terminated. Contact the manufacturer of your tape
device for an updated firmware revision.

Poll Driver Failed: Severe Error Shutting Off Poll Drive
--------------------------------------------------------

This is a SCSI bus issue resulting from improperly set SCSI ID numbers, faulty
termination, or cable issues. Consult the SCSI Troubleshooter for help
diagnosing problems with the SCSI bus.

  TITLE : Error Running NTBACKUP on NCR System 3000 Model 3410

Cannot Load Catalog from Tape
-----------------------------

There may be a problem with the SCSI controller driver. You may need to replace
the controller with a supported model, or update the driver.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q122440
  TITLE : Err Msg: Cannot Load Catalog from Tape

Unknown Firmware Error
----------------------

Your tape device has incompatible firmware. Contact the manufacturer to obtain
the latest firmware for your tape device.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q123110
  TITLE : Err Msg: Unknown Firmware Error with Archive 5580 Tape Drive

Tape Drive Has Been Detected But the Driver Has Failed to Load or Is Not
Started -or- Error 0020: Could Not Find Device Specified
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tape device is not configured correctly for use with Windows NT Backup.
Consult the tape device manual or contact the manufacturer for correct
settings.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q124379
  TITLE : Err Msg: Tape Drive Has Been Detected But Driver Has Failed

Tape Drive Error Detected: A Tape Device Has Been Detected, and the Tape Driver
Started. However, the Tape Device Is Not Responding. Check That

Tape Device Power Is On and Cables Are Properly Connected.
----------------------------------------------------------

This may be caused by incorrect firmware versions, or by incorrect SCSI BIOS
settings. Check your computer's SCSI BIOS settings to verify that SCSI
Disconnect is enabled. Contact the manufacturer for an updated firmware
revision, if necessary.

Tape Device Reports an Error on a Request to Change Physical Block Size.
The Tape Device Reported an Error on a Request to Read the Tape. Hardware
Failure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SCSI controller does not properly support the tape device. There may be a
software configuration solution, or you may need to contact the manufacturer for
an updated firmware revision.

Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q131618
  TITLE : Tape Drive Error Detected with Qlogic Fast SCSI IQ PCI Adapter

STOP: 0x0000000A IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
---------------------------------------

This can occur on a multiple-processor computer using fault-tolerant NTFS drives.
There is a fix for this issue included in Service Pack 2 for Windows NT version
3.51.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q137002
  TITLE : STOP 0x0000000A May Occur on Multi-processor Computers

This Set Is Compressed and Cannot Be Viewed or Restored
-------------------------------------------------------

The backup set was created in a backup program that supports compression. Windows
NT Backup does not support software compression for backup sets.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q138116
  TITLE : NTBACKUP Cannot Catalog and Restore Compressed Data from Tape

The Backup Set Is Not Completely Cataloged
------------------------------------------

This occurs when the catalog file on the hard disk contains incomplete
information. Quitting and restarting Backup may resolve the issue. If not,
locate the catalog file on the hard disk and either rename it or delete it, and
then re-catalog the tape.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q138117
  TITLE : Err Msg: The Backup Set is Not Completely Cataloged

You Do Not Have Permission to Access Portions of Data. Please See the
Owner or Administrator to Get Permission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This indicates that you do not have appropriate permissions for the folder you
are attempting to back up or to which you are restoring files.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q110481
  TITLE : Backup Doesn't Back Up Entire Hard Disk or Create Log File

  ARTICLE-ID: Q142671
  TITLE : Backup Fails on Certain Directories Due to Lack of Permissions

  ARTICLE-ID: Q157979
  TITLE : NT/RDR: "Access Denied" with Windows NT 4.0 Ntbackup

Catalog Information: Unable to Load Catalog Data from Tape -or- Catalog
Error: Error Writing a Catalog File, Check Available Space
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These error messages can be generated by trying to restore to a full hard disk.
The catalog files are stored in a compressed format and need to be expanded on
the hard disk at the beginning of the restore operation. You can resolve these
errors by either freeing disk space on the target drive, or by replacing the
hard disk with a larger drive.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q153839
  TITLE : Tape Backup Restore Fails on Extremely Full Volumes

Foreign Tape: The Tape In the Drive Must Be Erased Before It Can Be Used
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This occurs with a backup set from another backup program, or one that was
created in Microsoft Windows 95.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q155979
  TITLE : Windows NT Backup Does Not Recognize Windows 95 Backup Tapes

Tape Drive Error Detected: A SCSI Tape Device Has Been Detected, But the
Tape Driver Has Either Not Been Installed, or Failed to Start. Make Sure
That the Appropriate Driver Has Been Installed Using the Tape Devices
Option in Control Panel.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
