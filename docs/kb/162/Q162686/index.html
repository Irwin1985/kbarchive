- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying any service pack to a computer outfitted with a #9FX Reality 332
video card that requires a third-party driver, the computer restarts to a black
screen and stops responding. This will also happen if an Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD) is run against the computer for repair purposes. Starting the computer to
VGA mode allows the computer to start; however, using the Last Known Good
Configuration will not.

Some Dell Dimensions XPS Pro 200 computers come with this video card, and exhibit
this problem.

The problem occurs if both of the following conditions are true:

- Windows NT 3.51 was initially installed using the third-party video driver.

- The video card is set for at least 1280 X 768 resolution and 256 colors.

CAUSE
=====

The #9FX Reality 332 video card is based on the S3 chipset and uses a set of
drivers with the same name as the standard S3 compatible video card; S3.sys and
S3.dll. However, the drivers that come with Windows NT 3.51 and its service
packs are not 100 percent compatible with this video adapter. When applying the
service pack or running an ERD, these files are replaced by the standard S3
drivers, which cause the computer to fail. When Windows NT 3.51 is preinstalled
by the manufacturer, the standard S3 driver is not used. The Last Known Good
startup option does not work because the last successful restart included
drivers with the same name as the failed attempt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Obtain the correct drivers from Number Nine Visual Technology. You can obtain
  these drivers by connecting to http://www.nine.com/drivers.html and
  downloading the 325n3009.exe file.

2. Start the computer to VGA mode.

3. Install the newer drivers.
