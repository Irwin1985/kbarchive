SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Visual Basic for Applications StoryRanges collection to return
a word count for Comments, as in the following example,

     x = ActiveDocument.StoryRanges(wdCommentsStory).Words.Count

you may not receive the results you expect.

For example, if the author name for a comment is two words long and the comment
contains four words, the total word count returned is 6 (instead of 4 as
expected).

CAUSE
=====

The number of words returned includes the names of the commenting authors.

In addition, this count is cumulative. That is, if there are two comments in a
document, the number of words in the comment author's name will be counted for
each comment. For example, if each comment contains 4 words and John Doe is the
author of both comments, the total word count returned is 12 instead of 8 as
expected.

warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

The following example will return the number of words found in all comments in a
document, but will exclude the number of words in the comment author's name:

     Sub CountWordsInAllComments()
        Dim ctComment As Comment
        Dim lWordCount As Long
        For Each ctComment In ActiveDocument.Comments
           lWordCount = lWordCount + ctComment.Range.Words.Count
        Next
        MsgBox lWordCount
     End Sub

For more information about the Comment Object, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "Comment Object" (without the quotation marks),
click Search, and then click to view "Comment Object."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
