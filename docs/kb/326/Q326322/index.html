-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server uses the Internet Mail Service to communicate with other mail
servers by means of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). When the Internet Mail
Service receives an SMTP extended Hello (EHLO) protocol command from a
connecting SMTP server, the Internet Mail Service responds by sending a status
reply that starts with the following line:

  250-&lt;Exchange_Server_ID&gt;Hello&lt;connecting_server_ID&gt;

In that line:

- &lt;Exchange_Server_ID&gt; is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the
  Exchange Server computer.

- &lt;connecting_server_ID&gt; is either the FQDN of the server that initiated
  the connection, or the IP address of the server that initiated the
  connection. The FQDN is used if the Exchange Server 5.5 Internet Mail Service
  can resolve this information by doing a reverse Domain Name System (DNS)
  lookup. The IP address is used if a reverse DNS lookup is not possible or
  does not resolve the connecting server's IP address.

A security vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer in the Internet
Mail Service code that generates the response to the EHLO protocol command. If
the total length of the message exceeds a particular value, the data overruns
the buffer. If the buffer is overrun with random data, the Internet Mail Service
stops responding. However, if the buffer is overrun with carefully chosen data,
an attacker may be able to run code in the security context of the Internet Mail
Service, which runs as the Exchange Server 5.5 service account.

IMPORTANT: Note that the attacker cannot simply send data to the Internet Mail
Service to overrun the buffer. Instead, the attacker has to create a set of
conditions that cause the Internet Mail Service to overrun its own buffer when
it generates the EHLO response. Specifically, the attacker has to ensure that a
reverse DNS lookup not only succeeds, but provides an FQDN with a length that is
sufficient to cause the buffer overrun.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to systems
that you determine are at risk of attack. Evaluate your computer's physical
accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other factors to determine
the degree of risk to your computer. See the associated Microsoft Security
Bulletin (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms02-037.asp) to
help determine the degree of risk. This fix may receive additional testing. If
your computer is sufficiently at risk, Microsoft recommends that you apply this
fix now.

To resolve this problem immediately, download the fix by clicking the download
link later in this article or contact Microsoft Product Support Services to
obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone
numbers and information about support costs, please visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

Installation Information
------------------------

This update supports the following switches:

- /x Generates a list of the packaged files. You can select the files that you
  want to extract and the location.

- /s Performs a silent installation. This switch stops services and installs
  the fix with no prompts or user interface (UI). Allow sufficient time for the
  fix to be installed, because this switch returns control to the command
  prompt well before the installation is finished. Make sure that the fix is
  installed. The graphical user interface (GUI) fix package Q&lt;xxxxxx&gt;.exe
  should be running in the task manager properties (where &lt;xxxxxx&gt; is the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q number and name of the fix).

- /z This switch is the same as the /x switch, but the /z switch automatically
  restarts the computer. Do not use the /z switch unless you want to
  automatically restart the computer.

- /m Prompts you for the folder locations. You can select the folder locations
  of the Microsoft Windows folder, the System folder, the System32 folder, the
  Temp folder, the Source folder (which is usually the Temp folder), the System
  Windows folder, and the Language folder.

For example, the following command line installs the update without any user
intervention and then does not force the computer to restart:
