The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Under certain error conditions, when the SNA Server service tries to open a
connection, the Exchange Identifiers (XIDs) that are exchanged between two link
stations to establish a connection cannot be negotiated. This behavior causes a
perpetual XID negotiation deadlock situation.

In the Host Integration Server 2000 Management Console snap-in, the affected
connection shows a "pending" status. If a client application is started at this
time, the application is queued up. However, the application stops responding
because it is not notified that the connection cannot be established.

By using the fix that is described in the "More Information" section, you can add
a counter, so that you can stop this XID negotiation after a set number of
tries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A supported feature that modifies the product's default behavior is now
available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to modify the behavior that is
described in this article. Apply it only to systems that specifically need it.
This feature may receive additional testing. Therefore, if your system is not
severely affected by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Product Name service pack that contains this feature.

To obtain this feature immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use
the Time Zone tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
After you apply this fix, you can manually add a registry entry to turn on this
functionality. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and then click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaDlcx\Parameters\ExtraParameter

  where x stands for the appropriate instance of the Link Service, (for example,
  SnaDlc1).

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

Value name: XIDAbortCounter
Data type: REG_DWORD
DWORD: 1 - 20 (Decimal)

4. Quit Registry Editor.

When you set this DWORD, XID negotiation stops after the specified number of
completed XID negotiation attempts if the link connection cannot be established.
When negotiation stops, an Event 23 that has Outage code 0x29 is logged in the
Application Event log.

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.
