-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you manually force Intrasite Directory Replication (update the directory
from within the site), you may receive the following error message:

  The requested operation failed due to a permission problem encountered while
  accessing a remote directory. Check that your account has permission to
  perform this operation. Then check that the directory service on this server
  has permission to set up replication on a remote directory. Both directory
  services must be running under the same service account, and the service
  account must have the Service Account Admin role on the site object.
  0xc1030b22

Additionally, the following event ID message is logged in the Application event
log:

  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSExchangeAdmin
  Event Category: (4)
  Event ID: 2019
  Description:
  An error occurred updating the replica of naming context '/o=ORGANIZATION' on
  server 'SERVER'. The replica will be updated on server 'SERVER' during the
  course of any normal replication updates. 0xc1030b22 - The requested
  operation failed due to a permissions problem encountered while accessing a
  remote directory. Check that your account has permission to perform this
  operation. Then check that the directory service on this server has
  permission to set up replication on a remote directory. Both directory
  services must be running under the same service account, and the service
  account must have the Service Account Admin role on the site object.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the account that you use to run the Microsoft
Exchange Server Administrator program does not have "Modify Admin Attributes"
permission on the Configuration container.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Make sure the Permissions tab is visible for all objects.

  a. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Permissions tab.

  b. Click to select the "Show Permissions page for all objects" and "Display
     rights for roles on Permissions page" check boxes.

  c. Click OK.

3. Right-click the Configuration container, click Properties, and then click the
  Permissions tab.

4. Click the user account that manually forces Intrasite Directory Replication,
  and then click to select the "Modify Admin Attributes" permission check box.

NOTE: Instead of editing the permissions, you can directly grant the user account
the Administrator Role, which automatically has the following permissions:

- Add Child
- Modify User Attributes
- Modify Administrator
- Attributes
- Delete

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Access Category property of an attribute determines the permissions that a
user must have to modify the attribute. The Access Category property value
definitions are as follows:

- 0: Only the system can modify the attribute

- 1: Users with Modify Admin Attributes permission can modify the attribute

- 2: Users with Modify User Attributes permission can modify the attribute

- 3: Users with Modify Permissions rights can modify the attribute

For example, the Exchange Phone Number attribute, which is mapped to the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) telephoneNumber attribute, has an
Access Category value of 2, which means that users with "Modify Users
Attributes" permission on the object can change the value.

To discover all of the properties you can modify according to a permission,
follow the procedure described in this section. WARNING: If you use the raw mode
of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin /r) incorrectly, serious
problems may occur that may require you to reinstall Microsoft Windows NT
Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems that result from using raw mode incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode
at your own risk.

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by typing the
  following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. On the View menu, click Raw Directory.

3. In the right pane, double-click Schema.

4. Double-click the attribute that you want to modify.
