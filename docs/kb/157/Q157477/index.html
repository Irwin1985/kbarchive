SYMPTOMS
========

When authoring Web pages in Word, you can use many familiar Word features, such
as spelling and grammar checking, AutoText, and tables. Some features are
customized to make Web authoring easier, such as graphic bullets and lines.
Features that are not supported by HTML are not available for authoring Web
pages. The list below explains which features are changed or unavailable when
you are authoring Web pages.


                     Available
Feature               or changed     Notes
-------               ----------     -----

Columns               See Notes      Newspaper columns are not supported
                                    in HTML, but you can use tables to
                                    create a multicolumn effect.

Comments and Track    See Notes      Word comments and track changes
Changes                              features are not supported in HTML.
                                    You can use strikethrough formatting
                                    to represent text that might be
                                    deleted. For comments, you can format
                                    text with the Comments style.
                                    Comments will not appear in Web
                                    browsers.

Highlighting          No             Highlighting is not available in
                                    HTML.

Font sizes            See Notes      Fonts are mapped to the closest HTML
                                    size available in the &lt;FONT SIZE&gt;
                                    tag, which ranges from size 1 to 7.
                                    These numbers are not point sizes but
                                    are used as instructions for font
                                    sizes by Web browsers. Word displays
                                    the fonts in sizes ranging from 9
                                    to 36.

Bold, strikethrough,  Yes            Special underline effects, such as
italic, underline                    dotted underline, are not available.

Animated text         See Notes      Animations are not available. For an
                                    animated effect, insert scrolling
                                    text.

Emboss, shadow,       No             These font effects are not supported
engrave, small caps,                 in HTML
all caps, double
strikethrough, and
outline effects

Tabs                  No             Tabs are not available because they
                                    are often displayed by Web browsers
                                    as spaces. To control the layout of
                                    your page, use a table.

Ruler                 See Notes      The ruler does not appear by default
                                    because margin settings, indents, and
                                    tabs differ in the Web page authoring
                                    environment. You can point to the
                                    gray area at the top of the document
                                    to display the ruler.

Equations, charts,    See Notes      When you save charts, equations,
other OLE objects                    organizational charts, and other OLE
                                    objects in HTML format, a graphic
                                    image is created. You can use these
                                    graphics on your Web pages, but you
                                    won't be able to update the data they
                                    represent. If you need to later
                                    update data in a chart or equation
                                    that you're displaying on a Web page,
                                    save a backup copy of your file as a
                                    Word document (.doc format).

                                    Once you close your document, the
                                    graphic becomes a GIF image, and you
                                    will not be able to update it using
