SYMPTOMS
========

When you play one of the games listed at the top of this article, you may

articles discusses how to troubleshoot sound issues you may encounter when

RESOLUTION
==========

If the games listed at the top of this article do not play sound properly, first
verify that:

- Your speakers are on and turned up.
- The Windows volume control is enabled and turned up, and that the Mute

If the games listed at the top of this article still don't play sound properly,
verify that Windows can play .wav files:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Sounds icon.

3. Under Events, click an event that has a loudspeaker icon next to it.

4. In the Name text box, be sure that the three-letter file extension is ".wav".

5. Under Preview, click the Play button. You should hear a sound.

If you don't hear any sounds, or if Windows is not able to play a .wav file,
check to see that a sound driver is enabled:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the plus sign next to Sound, Video And Game Controllers.

5. If there is no Sound, Video And Game Controllers entry, or you have no sound
  card listed under this entry, contact the manufacturer of the computer or
  sound card and request help reinstalling the sound card drivers.

1. Start one of the games listed at the top of this article.

2. On the Start Up screen, click Options, and then click Sound.
