1. Common Upgrading Questions About Win NT 3.51 Resource Kit
------------------------------------------------------------

I have the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit and Windows NT 3.51.

1. Is there a Resource Kit for Windows NT 3.51?

2. Should I upgrade to the new Resource Kit?

Many utilities in the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit are specifically designed for
the Windows NT 3.5 operating system. Several Windows NT 3.5 utilities will not
work properly under Windows NT 3.51 or later. An update to the Resource Kit is
now available that provides updated utilities and information about Windows NT
3.51. If you are using Windows NT 3.51, you should purchase the "Windows NT
Resource Kit Version 3.51 Update."

Is there more than one update to the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit?

In addition to the first update for Windows NT 3.51, Microsoft has produced a
second update titled "Windows NT Resource Kit Version 3.51 Update 2." This
second update volume contains new information about Windows NT 3.51, including

- A beta draft of "Windows NT Workstation Deployment Planning Basics"

- Using Windows NT topics including information regarding

- The Windows NT File System (NTFS)

- Fault tolerance for disks

- Printing

- Corrections and additions to previous Resource Kit utilities and text and
  more

OK. There are two updates so far. Do I need both, or just the latest update
volume?

The update volumes are incremental. The information in Update 1 is not covered in
Update 2, so you need to purchase both update volumes if you want all of the
Resource Kit information.

How can I get an upgrade for the Resource Kit without paying full price?

The Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit consists of the original four Windows NT 3.5
Resource Kit volumes plus an additional fifth volume that covers new issues
specific to Windows NT 3.51.(It also includes update corrections to the previous
four volumes). A new Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit utility CD-ROM is included
with the update. You can order the full set or just the 3.51 update volume and
the updated CD-ROM by calling Microsoft Press Sales at 800-MS-PRESS or by
visiting your local bookstore.

2. NT 3.5 Resource Kit "Remote Command Installation" Instructions
  Do not Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following installation information is stated in the "Tools for Windows NT"
help file for the "Remote Command Installation" utility:

- After installation of the resource kit, the necessary files will have been
  copied to the system directory.

- In Program Manager, Control Panel, Network, Add Software, select "Remote
  Command Server".

However, there is no "Remote Command Server" option present.

Comments/correction:
There is a mistake in the documentation. To install the Remote Command Server,
you must first copy the following files from your RESKIT directory to your
SYSTEM32 directory:

  RCMD.EXE
  RCMDSVC.EXE
  OEMNSVRC.INF

After these files are copied to your SYSTEM32 directory, the Remote Command
Server option will be available and will work properly. From this point, you can
follow the installation instructions as written.

3. Installing Windows NT Resource Kit Utilities to Different
  Operating Systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Windows NT Resource Kit CD-ROM and disks are designed specifically for use
with the Windows NT operating system. Due to many differences in the internal
structure of Windows and Windows NT, the CD-ROM and the disks are not compatible
with other operating systems in the Windows family (e.g., Microsoft Windows 3.1,
Microsoft Windows 95).

To install the contents of the CD-ROM on your computer, you must have the
appropriate version of Windows NT. For the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit, you can
only install the utilities on a computer running Windows NT 3.51. Please note
that many Resource Kit utilities are also version specific and will not work
with a newer (or older) version of Windows NT.

4. Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit Mail Server Update/Usage Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following information will help clarify the installation and configuration of
the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit utilities for SMTP and POP3 service:

The Mail Server bundled in the NT Resource Kit 3.51 is a very basic SMTP and POP3
service and should not require much configuration to function.

There are, however, a few things to be aware of:

GENERAL:
--------

1. There is a patch to the Mail Server that can be obtained by connecting to
  ftp.microsoft.com. We highly recommend implementing this patch.

  NOTE: As of November 7, 1995, the directory and file name for this patch is:

  ftp://microsoft.com!bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt351/MAILSRV.EXE

  After downloading the file, execute MAILSRV.EXE -d
  (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/MAILSRV.EXE -d) to
  uncompress the patch files for the four platforms of NT, including the
  original directory structure. To install the patch, please follow the
  instructions in the README.TXT file that will be available after
  uncompression.

2. The Administrative service is planned for a future revision and has not yet
  been implemented.

INSTALLATION:

1. The Mail Server must be installed on a local drive.

2. The local drive must be formatted using the NTFS.

  NOTE: If you attempt to install to a network or non-NTFS drive you will
  receive the following error:

  The data area passed to a system call is too small.

CONFIGURATION:

1. To get mail to flow smoothly it might be necessary to alter the Mail Server's
  rule set. Please refer to the Mailsrv topic in the RKTOOLS.HLP file. (These
  rules are very similar to the rules used for any SMTP server.)

2. In order to receive mail, a user must have a valid LOCAL account in the LOCAL
  NT user database. A mail directory with secured permissions will be created
  for the user the first time the user checks his or her mail or the first time
  the user's account is sent mail.

NOTE: When adding user names, please make sure to use the LOCAL USER DATABASE
with LOCAL USER ACCOUNT. One of the most common problems is adding a name like
DOMAIN\userX which will not work by design. Instead you need to create a local
user called userX.
TROUBLESHOOTING:
The RESKIT 3.51 Mail Server might work after installing the DHCP server and by
manually adding a DhcpDomain name to the registry.

5. POSIX Utilities Q&amp;A
----------------------

I have been unable to get any output from "grep" or any of the other UNIX-like
commands. What do I have to do to get these utilities to work on Windows NT 3.51
servers?

The most likely cause of problems when using the POSIX utilities provided with
the NT Resource Kit is mismatched versions. Please make sure you are using the
Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit utilities on a machine running Windows NT 3.51.
Windows NT 3.5 utilities do not typically work in Windows NT 3.51 and vice
versa.

Please remember that the POSIX utilities are provided AS IS. This is why the
source code for the utilities is included with the executables.

I'm attempting to play with the Posix subsystem using the utilities supplied on
the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit, and I've noticed a couple executables missing.
My attempts to compile the included source files have been unsuccessful.

CC, MAKE, and a few other POSIX utilities are only provided in source code.

These utilities require some changes to be fully POSIX.1 compliant and have not
been tested enough to be provided with the Windows NT Resource Kit in compiled
form.

The original BSD UNIX source code is provided with the Resource Kit for those who
wish to make the necessary code changes. You must have a separate C compiler
(such as Microsoft Visual C++ version 4) in order to compile these utilities
including any changes you make to provide POSIX.1 compatibility.

6. Alternative Sources for Obtaining Windows NT Resource Kit Utilities
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As of November, 1995, most of the Windows NT Resource Kit is available in
electronic form via the Microsoft TechNet CD-ROM. This includes the Windows NT
Resource Kit utilities. For more information regarding the Microsoft TechNet
program, please call Microsoft Sales at (800) 426- 9400.

The Windows NT Resource Kit utilities are not available free of charge via FTP,
CIS, MSN, or any other online source. However, a limited number of the utilities
and even a few sources (PERL, REXX, and POSIX ports) are available on the
Microsoft FTP server ftp://microsoft.com.

If you have further questions regarding the Windows NT Resource Kit, please feel
free to e-mail RKINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM.

7. TELNETD Telnet Server Update for Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following information is located in the Readme.wri file of the Windows NT
3.51 Resource Kit:

"Due to last minute problems, the Telnet Server Service did not ship
with this release as was originally planned. This service is referenced
in the Windows NT Update 1 book in Chapter 4, "Internet Servers and
Security." It is listed on the first page of that chapter and described
in the "Telnet Server Service" section. Those references are not valid
for this release."
&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
As of March 1996, the Windows NT Resource Kit team is still working
to include this utility in a future update to the Windows NT
Resource Kit. The Resource Kit team is aware that this functionality is
very important to Resource Kit readers.

8. NT 3.50 Creadme.wri replaces Readme.wri
------------------------------------------

The Creadme.wri file (which is correctly installed as the README icon for the
Resource Kit) contains new information added after the old Readme.wri was
created. Customers should refer to Creadme.wriinstead of Readme.wri for this
CD-ROM.

9. NT 3.5 ResKit Net2Com, AppleTalk, and Animated Cursor utilities
  missing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net2Com and the AppleTalk utilities are no longer part of the NT Resource Kit
(and won't be for the near future). The Readme.wri incorrectly references these
tools. The Creadme.wri file (which is correctly installed as the README icon for
the Resource Kit) properly omits these utilities and discusses other utilities
added after the old Readme.wri was created.

The animated cursors were removed from the Resource Kit because they are included
with the Windows NT 3.5 software.

10. Support of the Windows NT Resource Kit
------------------------------------------

Microsoft does not guarantee the performance of the Windows NT Resource Kit
utilities, response times, or bug fixes to the tools. Microsoft does, however,
offer customer assistance on the utilities by either sending e-mail to
RKINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM or by calling Microsoft Product Support Services. For a
listing of Microsoft telephone support numbers, please refer to "Your Guide to
Service and Support" included with Windows NT.

11. Notes on the WAIS Internet Toolkit and EMWAC
------------------------------------------------

The WAIS toolkit for Windows NT was created by EMWAC (the European Microsoft
Windows NT Academic Center). If you need to contact EMWAC for further
information regarding the Internet utilities, here are some handy addresses
(updated Feb. 08, 1996):

e-mail:

  emwac@ed.ac.uk
  http://emwac.ed.ac.uk
  ftp://emwac.ed.ac.uk

12. NT 3.51 INSTSRV and SRVANY programs try to install FLOPPYLOCK.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Instsrv was originally authored to install the FLOPPYLOCK service, and thus most
of its visual information will make reference to this. However, text messages
aside, it is a great tool for installing almost any service.

The misleading information was corrected in The Windows NT 3.51 Update 2 release,
making INSTSRV and FLOPPLOCK completely separate.

Sincerely,

Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit team RKINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM
