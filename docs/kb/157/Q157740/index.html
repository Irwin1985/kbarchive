The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A white paper on ShivaRemote is located on Microsoft TechNet and can also be
found on the following World Wide Web location:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ExchangeSupport/

This article shows you how to use ShivaRemote 3.59 with the Microsoft Exchange
MS-DOS client and LAN Manager version 2.2c with TCP/IP.

Note that because the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client does not provide remote
functionality, you have to run Connect.exe first to establish the connection
before starting Microsoft Exchange Server or accessing network resources.

Conventional memory must be optimized in order for the configuration in this
article to work (with LanMan TCP). This configuration will not work if
Doublespace/Drvspace is implemented, because of the additional conventional
memory requirements for the compression drivers. Use the Config.sys,
Autoexec.bat, and Protcol.ini files shown at the end of this article as models.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Server Considerations
---------------------

Configure the Remote Access Server (either Windows NT or a Shiva LanRover) to
allow remote clients to request a predetermined IP address. To use this option
in Windows NT:

1. In Control Panel, click the Network icon.

2. Click RAS, click Network, and click Server Settings.

3. Click TCP, and select the "Allow remote clients to request a predetermined IP
  address" check box.

Client Configuration
--------------------

Install LAN Manager version 2.2c software on the client computer. This is located
on the Windows NT 3.51 Server compact disc in the
Clients\Lanman\Disks\Disk1\Setup directory.

NOTE: If Lanman has already been installed, run Setup.exe from the LanMan
installation directory (Lanman.dos by default).

1. Configure Lanman with the following options:

   - TCP/IP (only) bound to the network card driver

   - A static IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway

   - DHCP disabled

2. Manually add entries for the Microsoft Exchange Server computer name and IP
  address in the HOSTS file. This file is located in the
  &lt;drive&gt;:\Lanman.dos\Etc directory, where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of
  the local hard disk drive where LanMan is installed.

3. Configure Lanman with the following options:

   - Username and HostName in the Advanced dialog box

   - Windows Sockets enabled in the Advanced dialog box

   - Computername, Username, and Domain in the Workstation Settings dialog box

4. Install the Microsoft Exchange client for MS-DOS. By default, the
  installation will install the ShivaRemote files in the same directory that
  the Microsoft Exchange client for MS-DOS is installed in.

5. In the Config.sys file, manually add the following line:

  " DEVICE=C:\EXCHANGE\DIALNDIS.EXE(after DEVICE=...\PROTMAN.DOS
  /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS)" (without the quotation marks)

6. In the Config.sys file, remark out or remove the line that loads the network
  card driver.

7. In the \Lanman.Dos\Protocol.ini file, manually edit the following:

     [TCPIP_XIF]
     ;BINDINGS = "LAN Card Driver"     Remark out this line
     BINDINGS = SDIALIN$               Add this line

     [SDIALIN$]                        Add this line
     DriverName = SDIALIN$             Add this line

8. Restart the computer and press F5 when the "Starting MS-DOS" text message is
  displayed. This will bypass the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files if you are
  using MS-DOS 6.xx.

9. Run Connect.exe from the Microsoft Exchange client installation directory to
  bring up the ShivaRemote Connect window.

10. On the Tools menu, click Port Setup to configure the modem port. (You may
  receive an Out of Memory message if you attempt to select a port/modem
  without first booting with an F5.)

11. Click the Options button to select the IP protocol and type the static IP
  address of the client computer. For more information on creating and saving
  a connection file, refer to the ShivaRemote Online Guide.

12. Save the new connection information and quit the Connect.exe utility.

13. Restart the computer again. If you receive any error messages during
  startup, resolve these before continuing.

14. Open the connection file you want and click the Connect button. After the
  connection has been established, quit the Connect program. You should see
  the message regarding the static IP address. Make sure this is the same IP
  address which is statically assigned to the client computer.

15. Next, attempt to PING the Microsoft Exchange server computer's IP address
  and host name. The PING.EXE utility is located in the \LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG
  directory. If PINGing the host name fails, but PINGing the IP address works,
  the HOSTS file must be modified (see Step 2 above). This step is necessary
  for the Microsoft Exchange client to connect to the server.

16. Start the Microsoft Exchange client.

NOTE: To disconnect, either run Connect.exe again and select Disconnect or type
"connect /d" (without the quotation marks) from the command line.

Updated modem scripts for use with ShivaRemote can be found on Shiva's web page
at www.shiva.com under "support"/modem scripts.

Additional configuration information can also be found in the Config.hlp file
installed during installation of the ShivaRemote software.

Sample Configuration Files
--------------------------

NOTE: In order to format these samples for the Web, some line breaks had to be
changed. In the Config.sys example, the following line should be part of the
line that preceded it (this occurs twice):

  /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS

In the Autoexec.bat example, the following line should be part of the line that
preceded it:

  2.2a

Use these Config.sys, Autoexec.bat, and Protcol.ini files as models.
