SUMMARY
=======

The WordPerfect 5.x converter included with Word 97 is designed to take
advantage of features and conversion capabilities specifically available in Word
97. For best results converting to and from Word 97, use the WordPerfect 5.x
converter that comes with Word 97.

Converting a file from Word format to WordPerfect format and back again may cause
the loss of some formatting (for example, fonts, justification, styles, and mail
merge) unless you load, paginate, and save the converted file in WordPerfect
before converting back to Word.
