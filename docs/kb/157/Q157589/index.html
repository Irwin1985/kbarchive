-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Program Group Control (PGC) and Windows 95 in a trusted domain,
Windows 95 client computers do not receive shared applications. This problem
occurs if the Windows 95 client computer is validated in a master user domain
and Systems Management Server is located in a resource domain. A Windows 95
client computer can receive PGC applications if it is validated in the resource
domain.

CAUSE
=====


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date       Time                 Size   File name    Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  11/13/98   05:17pm              84,304 Nadapi16.dll (x86)
  11/13/98   05:18pm              72,800 Nadapi95.dll (x86)
  11/13/98   05:17pm              72,288 Nadapi32.dll (x86)
  11/13/98   05:12pm             163,600 Nadapi32.dll (ALPHA)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Replace the following files in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;platform&gt;.bin
  directory with their hotfixed versions:

  Nadapi16.dll
  Nadapi95.dll
  Nadapi32.dll

  On its next work cycle, Maintenance Manager will replicate these files to the
  Systems Management Server logon servers.

2. After that occurs, the clients may be updated. To update the clients, either
  manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or follow the instructions in the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
