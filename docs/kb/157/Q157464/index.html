The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Word 97 stores all of its settings in the Windows registry; Word 97 no longer
stores information in an .ini file or in the Winword.opt file the way earlier
versions of Word did.

This article lists which settings in the Windows Registry pertain to Word 97 for
Windows. This article is divided into the following sections:

- Main locations of Word settings

- Settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

- Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common

- Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MS Setup (ACME)

- Settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools

- Miscellaneous settings

- Using the RegOptions macro

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

MAIN LOCATIONS OF WORD SETTINGS
-------------------------------

Most settings in Word are stored here:

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

Changes made to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER key are also mirrored in the following
registry key:

  
  HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

The difference between the two locations is that the first one applies only to
the current user of the system, and the other is the default for all users.
However, Word entries are the same for both, so any change made to one is
automatically updated in the other.

For the remainder of this article, all references to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER
subtree apply also to the HKEY_USERS subtree, except where noted.

Settings in the WORD key
------------------------

The settings that you may need to examine during troubleshooting are located in
the following key:

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

NOTE: The Data subkey and the Options subkey are the most frequently changed
areas.

Data Subkey:

The Word 97 for Windows equivalent to the Word 6.x Winword.opt file is the Data
subkey and is located as follows:

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Data

This subkey contains binary information for MRU lists, including the MRU file
list and the MRU address book list. It also contains the same information as was
stored in the Winword.opt file in Word for Windows 6.x, such as Track Changes
settings (Revision settings in Word 6.x) and Edit settings.

Default Save Subkey:

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Default Save

This subkey sets the default format for saving documents. You can change the
default format Word 97 uses by changing the Save Word Files As setting in Word.
To locate this option in Word, click Options on the Tools menu, and then click
the Save tab.

Help Subkey:

This subkey contains the paths for Word's Help files. Word Help, WordPerfect
Help, and Visual Basic Help paths are found here.

The settings here are:

                         Email.dot).

extension, name, and path here.

NOTE: Three uncommon converters registered here are the Schedule Plus converter,

contact lists through the Microsoft Word mail merge feature. If these keys are

merge. The paths are:
