Cannot Edit a Word Document Embedded Object in Word 95
------------------------------------------------------

When you insert a Word document as an embedded object in a document in Word 97,
save the document in the Word 6.x/95 format or Rich Text Format, and then open
the document in Word 95, you may receive the error message "Word cannot edit the
object" when you double-click the object to edit it. This occurs because when
you save the document created in Word 97 in the Word 6.x/95 format or Rich Text
Format, the embedded object is not saved as a Word 95 document object. To edit
the object, you must have Word 97 installed on your computer.

Cannot Edit an Embedded Object Created in a Word 95 Document after Saving in Word 97
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you create an embedded object in a Word 95 document, open the document in Word
97, and then save the document in Word 6.x/95 format or Rich Text Format, the
embedded object is updated to a later version of the OLE object server program
on the computer running Word 97. If you reopen the document in Word 95 on a
computer that does not have Word 97 or Office 97 installed, you may not be able
to edit the object.

This can occur with any OLE object, including objects created in Word 97
documents. To see a list of OLE server programs installed on your computer, view
the list in the Object dialog box (Insert Menu).
