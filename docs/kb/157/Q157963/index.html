SUMMARY
=======

When an administrator attempts to secure the Microsoft Windows NT system by
changing the default Windows NT file system (NTFS) file and directory
permissions set up on the &lt;%systemroot%&gt; and/or the default system
directories and subdirectories, some functions, such as users' ability to log on
to the network, may be impaired. In extreme cases, the system may display a blue
screen error message on startup.

In Windows NT version 3.5x, it was possible to reset the default permissions on
the system files using the Setacl.exe command. This is not possible in Windows
NT version 4.0.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q153094
  TITLE : Restoring Default Permissions to Windows NT System Files


MORE INFORMATION
================

The process that Windows NT Setup uses to create an NTFS partition and set the
default permissions was changed in Windows NT 4.0. In Windows NT 3.5x, Setup
would schedule two programs to run during the final reboot phase. The first
program, Autoconv.exe, would convert the file system to NTFS format. The second
program, Setacl.exe, would set the default permissions on the newly created NTFS
system partition. These programs run independently from Setup and, therefore,
could be rescheduled as noted in the above article.

In Windows NT 4.0, Setup was changed. The conversion to NTFS still works the same
way, by scheduling Autoconv.exe. However, this is done at the end of the
Text-mode portion of Setup so that the conversion happens when Setup is booting
into GUI-mode before Setup finishes copying all files into the system. At the
very end of GUI-mode, Setup calls a function that sets the default permissions
based on the Perms.inf file. This function is not a program that runs
independently from the Setup process; therefore, it cannot be rescheduled like
previous versions. This is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Reinstall Windows NT into a separate directory. This will allow you to restore
your operating system files %systemroot% from a backup tape that contains the
correct default permissions to allow the operating system to boot and function
normally. After Windows NT is restored and restarted, you can delete the
parallel copy of Windows NT.


-OR-

Use the NT v4.0 Resource Kit utility called FIXACLS.EXE.

FIXACLS.EXE can be found in the NT v4.0 Resource Kit Supplement Two.

When system permissions have been lost, FIXACLS can restore default permissions
to the system files. For example, the Windows NT convert command only converts
your file system to NTFS. It does not set the default permissions after the
conversion. FIXACLS fills this gap.

To use FIXACLS, your user account needs "Backup files and folders" privileges on
the computer where the files and folders are stored, and you must be logged on
as a member of the Administrators group for the domain or computer where your
user account is defined. Otherwise, "Access denied" error messages may occur.

FIXACLS sets the permissions to the values defined in %SYSTEMROOT%\INF\PERMS.INF.
Therefore, access to this file is also required to run FIXACLS.
