SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange client, the client may
temporarily stop responding or you may be prompted multiple times for domain
credentials. These credentials are for the domain where the Microsoft Exchange
site that owns the Organization Forms folder is located (for example, let's call
it Site B). The domain credentials dialog box also appears when you attempt to
open a read receipt, delivery receipt, or non- delivery report (NDR). (For a
more complete description of the symptoms, see the More Information section
below.) This behavior is by design. When the client logs on to Site A, there is
an attempt to locate a forms library and to bind to it if it exists within the
Microsoft Exchange Organization. If the only instance of the Forms Library
exists in Site B and affinity is set, the Microsoft Exchange client attempts to
connect to a server (containing the Forms Library) in Site B.

NOTE: If no Organization Forms folder instances are available in the Site, but
there is at least one Site available with instances, the affinity to the Sites
is used to rank the order in which connections to the Sites will be attempted.
The affinity is set on the site Public Folder Affinity page. Clients must have
RPC connectivity to the servers in the affinity sites. Otherwise, the clients
will not be able to access the Public Folders in the other sites, even though
the affinity has been correctly set, thus causing possible client slowdown. Do
one of the following:

- Remove the affinity to the site that owns the Organization Forms folder (Site
  B).

  -or-

- Create a local site instance of the Organization Forms folder by replicating
  the folder from Site B to Site A.

If an Organizations Forms folder is created within the organization, it is
recommended this folder is replicated to Sites that may not have a physical
connection (ie dial up connection) or are connected via slow link to the
Organization Forms folders Home Site. For more information, refer to the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152958 Organizational Forms Unavailable to Other Servers in Site

  Q154941 How to Determine Which Public Folder Replica is Used


MORE INFORMATION
================

You will be prompted for domain credentials when all of the following conditions
are met:

- An Organization Forms Folder has been created.

- A Public Folder Affinity has been established between the sites.

- No local instance of the Organization Forms folder exists.

The symptoms of this problem may include:

- Microsoft Exchange clients in Site A are slow when attempting to open a read
  receipt, delivery receipt, or non-delivery report but Microsoft Exchange
  clients in Site B open them at normal speed.

- When affinity is set to Site B, but the Microsoft Exchange client in Site A
  has no physical LAN connection to servers in Site B, Microsoft Exchange
  clients in Site A and Site B are slow when attempting to open a read receipt,
  delivery receipt, or non-delivery report.

- When the server containing the only instance of the Organization Forms folder
  is not available. Microsoft Exchange clients in Site A are prompted for
  Domain credentials but Microsoft Exchange clients in Site B are not prompted.

- When a trust does not exist between Site A Windows NT Domain and Site B
  Windows NT Domain, the following symptom occurs. When a Site A client
  attempts to access the Organization Forms folder on a server in Site B, it is
  prompted for domain credentials for a valid Windows NT account in Site B.
