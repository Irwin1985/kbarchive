SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows, a small amount of text may be sent to the local printer.
When this occurs, the printer may or may not eject the page after the text is
printed. The text varies, but typically includes extended or unintelligible
characters. The printer may also display an error code. On Hewlett Packard
LaserJet printers, error code 22 may be displayed and the printer may stop
responding (hang). When you attempt to print a document, you may receive a
message that the printer is offline or out of paper.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Drvwppqt.vxd virtual device driver is loaded or
if you are not using an IEEE 1284 printer cable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the Drvwppqt.vxd virtual device driver from being loaded, use the
following steps. NOTE: Do not implement this resolution if you have a tape
backup device connected to a parallel (LPT) port on your computer. Also, if you
are using the incorrect printer cable, replace it with an IEEE 1284 printer
cable.

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

2. In the Named box, type "drvwppqt.vxd" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Find Now.

3. Rename all instances of the file by changing the file name extension to .old.
  To change the file name, right-click the file, click Rename, and then rename
  the file name extension to .old. Note that you must change the file name
  extension to prevent the driver from being loaded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This file is installed by Seagate (formerly Arcada) Backup software and is
typically located in the Windows\System\Iosubsys folder as well as in the
Arcada\System folder.

This driver is also installed by the Windows 98 Backup utility. The Backup
utility is installed when you upgrade to Windows 98 if you have a previous
version of the Backup utility installed before you upgrade to Windows 98, or if
you choose to install the Backup utility by using the Custom installation
option.

The driver detects tape devices that are connected to a parallel port. During the
detection process, a string of text is sent through the parallel port to be
interpreted by tape devices. Some printers interpret this string as printable
text. The output may also be sent to the printer during modem or port
detection.


This issue is also known to occur with the following printers:

- Canon BJC-5000

- Canon MultiPASS 5000

- Canon BJC-4300

- Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 540

- Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 690C

- Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4M+
