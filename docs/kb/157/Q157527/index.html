When 'ss properties &lt;file name&gt;' is run, it gives information about a

    Comment: This is the comment for adding file.txt to the database

Properties Using the Visual SourceSafe Explorer
-----------------------------------------------

Similar Properties information can be found on the General Tab when the
properties dialog is invoked from File-&gt;Properties menu option. The
properties dialog can also be invoked with the ALT+ENTER key combination.

About Using the Command Line
----------------------------

When 'ss about' is run, it gives the following information about Visual
SourceSafe:

  Microsoft (R) SourceSafe Version 4.00
  Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp. 1994-1995. All rights reserved.
  Version 4.00 (Build 831)

About Using the Visual SourceSafe Explorer
------------------------------------------

Similar About information can be found under the Help-&gt;About menu option.

Pin Using the Command Line
--------------------------

When 'ss pin &lt;file name&gt; -V#' is run, it stops development of the file
temporarily at the version number given in the command. When users GET a copy of
the file, they will receive the contents of the file when it was at the version
indicated by the pin command. Unless the -G- switch is used, pinning
automatically does a GET on the file. Shared files can be pinned. A file cannot
be pinned if it is checked out. Users will not be able to check out the file
while it is pinned. If a file is pinned and a check out is attempted, the
following message is returned:

  "You are using an old version of &lt;file name&gt;, and cannot change it.
  Rollback to make that version the most recent if you need to change it."

Pin Using the Visual SourceSafe Explorer
----------------------------------------

Pin is a button available from the History dialog of a file. The History dialog
can be invoked by right-clicking the file and choosing Show History..., or by
using the Tools-&gt;Show History... menu option.

Unpin Using the Command Line
----------------------------

When 'ss unpin &lt;file name&gt;' is run, it will remove the pin and the file can
then be checked out and modified.

Unpin Using the Visual SourceSafe Explorer
------------------------------------------

Unpin is a button available from the History dialog of a file. The file must
already be pinned for the Unpin button to appear. The History dialog can be
invoked by right-clicking the file and choosing Show History... or by using the
Tools-&gt;Show History... menu option.

Merge on GET
------------

This functionality allows a user to merge the version that is in Visual
SourceSafe into their local writable file. It is primarily invoked when one user
does a check out on a file for editing. Meanwhile, other users check out, change
and check in their changes. The version that is in Visual SourceSafe is now
different than the version the first user did a check out on. Therefore, the
first user can do a merge on GET to update the local file without losing the
changes.

To accomplish this, hold down the SHIFT key while doing a GET on the file. This
should bring up a dialog box with an Advanced&gt;&gt; button. Click the
Advanced&gt;&gt; button, and change the Replace Writable textbox to Merge. Then
click the OK button.

NOTE: The administrator of the Sourcesafe database must have "Allow Multiple
Checkouts" enabled. Click OK.

Universal Naming Conventions (UNC's)
------------------------------------

In previous versions of SourceSafe, drive letters needed to be used to refer to
path names. Now UNC's can be used. This allows for more flexibility in
connecting to and using Visual SourceSafe.

Drag and Drop Sharing
---------------------

Users can now drag and drop a file to share it. This is more intuitive than using
the menus. In addition, if the right mouse is held down during the drag and drop
process, a menu will appear giving the user a choice of Share, Share and Branch,
or Cancel.

Additional Accelerator Keys
---------------------------

More shortcut keys have been added for convenience. For more information, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q138387 Visual SourceSafe Viewer Accelerator Keys

Integration
-----------

Visual SourceSafe 4.0 integrates with Visual Basic 4.0 Standard, Professional,
and Enterprise Editions, and with Visual C++ 4.0 Professional. This allows users
to do basic Visual SourceSafe functionality from within Visual Basic or Visual
C++. For more information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q136019 FAQ: Visual SourceSafe Integration with Visual C++ 4.0
