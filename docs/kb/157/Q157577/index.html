The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Soccer, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article includes troubleshooting steps to resolve Soccer display problems
you may encounter if your system is not configured correctly. This article also
includes a list of video drivers that are not compatible with Soccer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Soccer uses DirectX 2.0 technology. In some cases, the DirectX video driver may
not work correctly with your video driver. If you experience display problems,
contact your video card manufacturer for the latest DirectX drivers. If you
continue to experience problems with DirectX, try the following procedures:

1. Restart Windows in Safe mode. To do so, follow the steps in the appropriate
  section below:

  Microsoft Windows 95
  --------------------

  Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

  Microsoft Windows 98
  --------------------

  Restart your computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after your computer
  completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Safe Mode from the
  Startup menu.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Display.

4. Click the Settings tab.

5. Click Change Display Type.

  NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2),
  click Advanced Properties, and if you are using Microsoft Windows 98, click
  Advanced.

6. Under Adapter Type, click Change.

  NOTE: If you are using Windows 98, click the Adapter tab, and then click
  Change.

7. In the Select Device dialog box, select the DirectX-compatible video driver
  suggested by your video card manufacturer. If you do not have a
  DirectX-compatible video driver, contact your video card manufacturer for an
  updated video driver.

  NOTE: If you are using Windows 98 step through the Update Device Driver wizard
  and select an appropriate driver for your video adapter.

8. Restart your computer to apply the change you have made, and then start
  Soccer.

9. Reinstall your video drivers. Note that Soccer does not run without DirectX
  drivers.

If you consistently cannot get a game started, DirectX may be having problems
with your video drivers. Contact your video card manufacturer for updated
DirectX drivers. See the "Video Cards That Don't Support Soccer" section of this
article to see which video cards have problems with Soccer.

If you have one of the cards on the list or you continue to have display
problems, you may want to download and install the latest version of DirectX.

NOTE: Most DirectX related problems have been resolved in the latest version of
DirectX. Download the latest version of DirectX or, if you own a game that
installs a later version of DirectX, install DirectX from the newer game's
CD-ROM.

The latest version of DirectX is available at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx

For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DirectX, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q179113 How to Download and Install DirectX

The Nexgen 586 system may not support DirectX, and therefore may not run Soccer.
To resolve this issue, contact Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to inquire about a
fix for this issue.


Video Cards That Do Not Support Soccer
--------------------------------------

If you are using any of the following cards or processors, you may experience
problems when playing Soccer. Note that this list may not include all cards that
do not run with Soccer. If you experience display problems, please contact your
hardware manufacturer for the latest DirectX video drivers:

- Matrox Millennium video card: download Matrox's latest DirectX driver and
  latest video driver from:

  http://www.matrox.com/

- Boca SXVGA5-CLGD5424

- Trident 9440

- Diamond Stealth 64 Video 3400XL S3 Vision 868

- SDIS Weitek 9100

- Any video card using the Hornet Tender Pro video chip

- Some video cards using the Nvidia chip

- Matrox Impression causes display problems

- The ATI Mach 64 PCI video card ships with the ATI Graphics Xpression driver
  that will not run DirectDraw. Update this driver to the ATI Mach 64 PCI
  (macxw4) DirectDraw driver version 4.02 from ATI Tech Enhanced.

- The Edge 3D PCI Video card and device driver that comes with the Nvidia NV1
  chipset will not run DirectX. Update this driver to the Diamond Edge 3D PCI
  VGA Compatible Device Driver version 4.0 from Diamond Multimedia Systems to
  run DirectX. The Diamond Multimedia Systems World Wide site is:

  http://www.diamondmm.com/

- The Orchid Technology Kelvin Video 64 PCI card with the Alliance Pro Motion
  6410 chipset causes display problems. The DirectDraw driver has trouble
  changing resolutions when running Windows with a resolution of 1152 x 864 x
  256 or higher. Change your Windows resolution to 1024 x 768 before running
  Soccer, and check the manufacturer for an updated DirectDraw driver.

- The Ark 2000 PV PCI Windows Accelerator has trouble with the cursor if the
  default Windows mode is not 256-color. The mouse display driver does not
  handle bit-depth changes properly, so the game switches the screen to
  256-color mode. Change your default Windows mode to the 256-color mode.
