MORE INFORMATION
================

4.0 NOTES FOR USERS OF VISUAL SOURCESAFE 4.0

Users of Visual SourceSafe 4.x will note a number of major changes to the
product. New features are listed separately above, but some of the important
miscellaneous changes are listed below.

4.1 No 16-bit Support

Versions 4 and earlier of Visual SourceSafe came with "16-bit versions" which
could run in MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows 3.1, and Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups. These versions are no longer built with Visual SourceSafe 5.0, or
with any future versions. This means that Visual SourceSafe 5.0 will not run
under DOS or Microsoft Windows 3.x. Windows 95 (or above) or Windows NT 3.51 (or
above) is required.

Your 16-bit users can continue to use Visual SourceSafe 4.0a: the format of the
SourceSafe database did not change between these two releases. These users will
not have the benefit of the new 5.0 features, but they will be able to continue
working with your code. The "SS_16Bit" subdirectory on the SourceSafe CD
contains executables that these users can work with. Note that you must have a
license for every user on your system, whether they use the 5.0 or 4.0 version
of the product.

If users are running SourceSafe 4.0 directly from the server, your 5.0 upgrade
will overwrite their on-line help files. They will no longer be able to bring up
context-sensitive help from within the SourceSafe Explorer.

4.2 Get --&gt; Get Latest Version

The command previously referred to as "Get" is now called "Get Latest Version."

4.3 Results Display

The results of a Visual SourceSafe command (which files were retrieved after a
Get operation) used to be displayed in the "results window," a floating dialog
that appeared, displayed information, and then disappeared. This has now been
replaced with the "results pane," a permanent resident on the bottom of the
Visual SourceSafe main screen (below the project tree and file list).

4.4 Multiple Project Support in Visual Basic/Visual C++ Integration

If you chose the "Prompt for Connect" option in Visual Basic or Visual C++
integration with Visual SourceSafe 4.0, you were given the opportunity to choose
a SourceSafe database whenever you added a project to SourceSafe for the first
time, or retrieved a project from SourceSafe for the first time. (If you are not
familiar with what this paragraph is referring to, you can skip this note.) You
specified a database by typing in a special string which went in your
Srcsafe.ini file after the Data_Path variable.

This ability is no longer supported in Visual SourceSafe 5.0, having been
replaced with the (much friendlier) "Open Databases" dialog. The new
functionality is quite different from the old, because it involves choosing a
SRCSAFE.INI file instead of a Data_Path line. Therefore, it may require some
changes on your part to get the new system to work properly. These changes are
described below.

4.4.1. If you had different SourceSafe installations, with different Srcsafe.ini
files for each Data_Path, you do not need to take any extra steps initially. The
first time you are prompted for a database, you will "Browse" to find the
alternate Srcsafe.ini file. Thereafter, you will simply be able to choose a
database from a list whenever you add or retrieve a project for the first time.

4.4.2. If you had only one Srcsafe.ini file, you will need to create more than
one: one for each Data_Path directory. You can simply copy your existing
Srcsafe.ini file, remove all the Data_Path entries except one, and remove the
parentheses for that one. So each Srcsafe.ini file should have only one
Data_Path, pointing to one data directory. Then, once again, you can browse for
these paths in the "Open Database" dialog. The recommended place for putting the
new Srcsafe.ini file is immediately above the DATA directory it refers to: for
instance, for directory \\code\public\vss\data, create
\\code\public\vss\srcsafe.ini. If the SRCSAFE.INI is not in this location, the
"Run SourceSafe" option in your development environment may not work properly.

5.0 VISUAL SOURCESAFE HOME PAGE

Microsoft Visual SourceSafe has a home page on the Internet. This home page
features a variety of information including articles on SourceSafe, a self-
running demo that you can download and run, a collection of helpful SourceSafe
utilities, and much more. The URL for the home page is:
