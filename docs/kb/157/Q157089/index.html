                                         to a page or paragraph, have
                                         wrap-around text, and are
                                         located in tables, parallel
                                         columns, or headers/footers are

                                         overlapping. In most cases,
                                         these boxes become drawing layer
                                         objects in Word. Graphic lines
                                         become solid lines. Text that is

                                         there may be a combination of
                                         attributes that cause
                                         inconsistent conversion.

                                         characters are converted. If one
                                         or more of these fonts are not
                                         available, some characters may
