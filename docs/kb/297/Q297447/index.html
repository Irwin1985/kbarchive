-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You try to sign in to MSN Internet Access using MSN Explorer 6.0. A dial-up
connection is established, but you get one of the following error messages:

  "We were not able to sign you in. There may be problems with our servers, or
  problems with your Internet connection. Please try again later."

  "Slow Connection Speed. Problem with you modem or connection settings."

CAUSE
=====

Any of the following could cause this issue:

- Passport server issues

- Corrupted network components on your computer

- Temporary access number outages

- Modem connection speed is set too low

- Problems with the phone line

- Your Internet Explorer Cipher strength is set for 0 bit.

RESOLUTION
==========

First, confirm your Internet Explorer version.

To confirm your Internet Explorer version

- Start Internet Explorer, click Help, and then click About Internet Explorer.

If the version of Internet Explorer you currently have is 5.5 or below, download
the latest version of Internet Explorer at: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie.
If you have the most current version of Internet Explorer, call Internet
Explorer Technical Support at 425-635-7123.

Next, insure your modem speed is set correctly.

To confirm settings

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then click Phone and
  Modem Options.

2. Select the Modem in use and click Properties.
  Note: Modem settings should be as follows:
   - 56k: 115200

   - 33.6k: 57600

   - 28.8k: 38400

3. Click Ok.
  Note: Line quality can be a factor. Your phone line must be capable of
  handling 28.8 kilobits per second (Kbps). If you are unsure of your phone
  line capabilities, please contact your telephone company.

Next, confirm that your dial-up connection is still active.

To confirm that your dial-up connection is active

1. Check to see that the connection icon next to the clock on your computer (in
  the "system tray" area) is still present.

2. Start Internet Explorer and try to view Web sites.

To troubleshoot further, remove your current connection file from Dial-up
Networking so MSN Explorer can reconnect you.

To remove your connection file from Dial-up Networking

1. On the desktop double-click the My Computer icon, and then double-click
  Dial-up Networking.
  Note: For Windows 2000 and Millenium, double-click Control Panel, then
  double-click Dial-up Networking.

2. Delete the MSN Internet Access connection.
  Note: For DellNet users the connection is called DellNet by MSN, and for
  Compaq users, the connection is called MSN for Compaq.

3. Start MSN Explorer and try to connect again.

If you continue to experience this issue, there may be temporary issues with the
access number that you are using to connect. You may simply choose another
access number to resolve your issue.

To choose another access number

1. In upper-right corner of the Welcome screen, click Connection Settings.

2. In the lower-left corner, click Advanced Options.

3. Click Verify the phone numbers to connect to the Internet.

4. Click Next, and then click Change.

5. Clear the Use box next to the first access number listed, and then click
  Done.
  This will force MSN Explorer to use the next number in the list.

6. Click Accept, click OK, and then click OK again.

7. Try to sign in to MSN Explorer.
  If you can't sign in, repeat the steps above to use the next number in the
  connections list. MSN Explorer may have up to four numbers stored in the
  connection settings. If the above steps do not work, the issue may be with
  the access numbers in the area.

To try an access number from another region

1. Click Change Where I am Dialing From.
  Note: If this option is not present, then click Change How to Connect to the
  Internet and select the appropriate connection device, depending on the
  version of MSN Explorer you are using:
   - For the standard version of MSN Explorer, click MSN Internet Access.

   - For DellNet by MSN, click DellNet by MSN using modem.

   - For the Compaq version, click MSN for Compaq using modem.

2. Type the area code and telephone number you are dialing from and then click
  OK.
  Note: It is not enough to change one of the last four digits of the phone
  number to force MSN Explorer to choose another number. You must modify either
  the area code or the prefix (first 3 numbers of the telephone number) to
  force MSN Explorer to select a new number.

3. On the Connection Settings screen, click OK.

4. Click the user tile you want to sign in with, type your password, and then
  click Sign In.
  MSN Explorer will dial a 1-800 number to detect local access numbers for your
  area. MSN Explorer will sign out and return you to the Welcome screen after
  it detects the access numbers.

5. Click the user tile and sign in again.
  A message appears stating "Your internet connection has been improved".

6. Click Next.
  A list of access numbers detected for your area appears.

7. Do one of the following:
   - If the numbers are local and correct, click Accept.

   - If the numbers are not local and correct, click Change.
     This allows you to uncheck any numbers which may be long distance, and to
     change the dialing properties for the numbers (such as dialing 1 or the
     area code).

- After the settings are correct, click Done, then click Accept.
  MSN Explorer will now dial the first of the new access numbers and sign you
  in.

If you still can't sign in, you may have forgotten your password or you may be
mistyping it. Consider resetting your password.

To reset your password

- Follow the instructions in Knowledge Base article Q297420to reset your
  password, and then sign in again.

If you can't surf the Web, then the issue may be with your Internet Connection.
In this case, do the following:

- Clear the Temporary Internet Files and History.

- Uninstall and reinstall network components (dial-up adapter and TCP/IP)--see
  Knowledge Base article Q294853.
  Note: This should only be done if you have a Windows CD.

- Try another access number.

To try another access number

1. On the Welcome screen, click Connection Settings.

2. In the lower-left corner, click Advanced Options.

3. Click Verify the phone numbers to connect to the Internet.

4. Click Next, and then click Change.

5. Clear the Use box next to the first access number listed, and then click
  Done.
  This will force MSN Explorer to use the next number in the list.

6. Click Accept, click OK, and then click OK again.

7. Try to sign in to MSN Explorer.
  If you can't sign in, repeat the steps above to use the next number in the
  connections list. MSN Explorer may have up to four numbers stored in the
  connection settings.

If you still can't connect, there may be a temporary issue with the access
numbers in your area. Follow the below instructions to try a phone number from a
different area.

To select an access number from a different area

1. In upper-right corner of the Welcome screen lick Connection Settings.

2. Click Change Where I am Dialing From.

  OK.

  number to force Explorer to select a new number. You must change either the
  area code or the prefix (first three numbers of the telephone number).

  click Sign In.

  your area. MSN Explorer will sign out and return you to the Welcome screen
  once the access numbers have been detected.

6. Click the user tile and sign in again.
  This time you will see a box appear stating "Your internet connection has been
  improved".

7. Click Next.
  You will now see a list of the access numbers detected for your area.

     you to uncheck any numbers which may be long distance, and to change the
     dialing properties for the numbers (dialing 1 or the area code).

  in.

If you still can't sign in, a Passport server issue may be causing the "Unable to
Log on to Network" error in MSN Explorer. In this case, Contact Customer Service
at 1-800-386-5550.
