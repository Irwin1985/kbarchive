-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3), Mailbox Manager deleted mail based
on the delivery date and time of the mail in a mailbox. In Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 4 (SP4), mail is deleted based on the last modified date and time.
Therefore, mail that has been moved around is not being deleted even though the
delivery date and time is past the age limit.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Mailbox Manager

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Mbclean.exe | 5.5.2654.98 |

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.5 Service Pack 4.
