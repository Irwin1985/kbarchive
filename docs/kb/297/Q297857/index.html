-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Client Setup may not start on a Windows 2000-based domain controller because the
replication of the SMS#_&lt;DCname&gt; account creation takes longer than 60
minutes on a large Windows 2000 Active Directory site. The same symptoms occur
if the replication for the temporary bootstrap account succeeds in time and the
SMS#_&lt;DCname&gt; client service account is created.

CAUSE
=====

includes an incorrect Ccm.dll file.

RESOLUTION

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft

may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

later:
