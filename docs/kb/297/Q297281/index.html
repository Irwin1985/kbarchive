SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an e-mail message to a mailbox that has the Out Of Office
Assistant functionality enabled, the Out Of Office Assistant does not send an
Out Of Office reply. This issue occurs with messages that originate both
internally and externally.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the mailbox has an alternate recipient configured on the
server and the "Deliver messages to both recipient and alternate recipient"
option is not selected. In this scenario, the incoming message does not arrive
in the recipients mailbox, and the Out Of Office Assistant is not initiated.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248456 XADM: Out Of Office Assistant Does Not Start If a Rule Is Set to Stop
  Processing Other Rules

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, click Microsoft Exchange, and then click
  Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. Open the properties for the mailbox that has the alternate recipient
  configured.

3. Click the Delivery Options tab.

4. Click "Deliver messages to both recipient and alternate recipient".

5. Click Apply, and then click OK.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do not want the incoming messages to be stored in your mailbox, you can
replace Out Of Office Assistant and alternate recipient message forwarding with
traditional client-side rules. In this case, if you remove the Alternate
Recipient setting from the mailbox on the server, all message forwarding is
handled through rules on the client. Configure one rule to send the Out Of
Office notification, and a second rule to forward the message to the alternate
recipient.
