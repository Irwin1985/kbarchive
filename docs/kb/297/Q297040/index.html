Version(s): 4.0,4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): 
Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT 4.0-based server with a recent post-SP6a hotfix, or a Windows NT
4.0 Terminal Server with a recent post-SP6 hotfix, may stop responding (hang) if
it attempts to make a TCP connection with an IP address that is nonexistent.

For example, if a Windows NT 4.0-based server with an address of 129.68.72.10
attempts to connect by using Telnet to an address of 129.68.72.40, and that
address is either nonexistent or unavailable, the server may hang. This is a
"hard" hang with no mouse control and no CTRL+ALT+DELETE functionality
available. The server is unresponsive from the console and cannot be pinged on
the network.

For this hang to occur, the TCP/IP SynAttackProtect registry value must be set.
For additional information about this registry entry, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q142641 Internet Server Unavailable Because of Malicious SYN Attacks

CAUSE
=====

Under certain circumstances, the spinlock for the TCP/IP connection table lock
is acquired but not released; this causes the server to hang.
