SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse to an existing Active Server Pages (ASP) page, the browser may
return the "HTTP 500 - Internal server error" or "Server Application Error"
error message. If you review the server's System Event Log after you receive the
error message, two entries appear:

  Source: W3SVC
  Error: Configured identity is incorrect

  -and-

  Source: DCOM
  Error: Unable to logon IWAM_ComputerName

If you enable only Basic Authentication for the application and set the
Application Protection to Low, the application starts to work again as expected.
In addition, if you create a new ASP application after you receive this error,
you can browse to it without any errors.

Related Error Messages:

You may also receive the following error messages:

In your browser:

  HTTP 500 - Internal server error

  -or-

  Server Application Error
  The server has encountered an error while loading an application during the
  processing of your request. Please refer to the event log for more detail
  information. Please contact the server administrator for assistance.

In the System Event Log:

  Source: DCOM
  Error: DCOM got error "Logon Failure: unknown username or bad password" Unable
  to logon .\IWAM_SERVERNAME in order to run the server.

  -and-

  Source: W3SVC
  Error: "The server failed to load application '/LM/W3SVC/1/Root/op.' The error
  was 'The serverprocess could not be started because the configured identity
  is incorrect. Check the username and password.

  -or-

  Source: W3SVC Error: "The server failed to load application
  '/LM/W3SVC/4/Root'. The error was 'c000003b'."

  -and-

  Source: W3SVC Error: "The COM Application
  '{3D14228D-FBE1-11d0-995D-00C04FD919C1}' at '/LM/W3SVC/4/Root' failed to
  activate out of process."

CAUSE
=====

User names and passwords for the IUSR_ComputerName and IWAM_ComputerName
accounts are stored in three locations:

- Internet Information Server (IIS) metabase
- User Manager for Domains (Windows NT) or Local Users and Groups (Windows
  2000)
- Microsoft Transaction Server (Windows NT) or Component Services (Windows
  2000)

If the user names and/or passwords are not synchronized among these three
locations, you receive the above-mentioned error messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must make sure that the passwords for the IUSR and
IWAM accounts are synchronized in all three of the above-mentioned locations.
There are two ways to achieve this: you can set the password for IWAM and IUSR
accounts in User Manager (Windows NT) or Users and Groups (Windows 2000) and
change the passwords in IIS metabase to reflect the same password, or vice
versa. Use one of the following methods to synchronize the passwords.

NOTE: Please refer to the "More Information" section for instructions on how to
use the Administration Script Utility (Adsutil.vbs) and how to change the
password in Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) or Component Services.

Method 1: Change the Passwords in User Manager or Users and Groups to Match the IIS Metabase Password:

1. In the Command window, locate the folder that contains the Adsutil.vbs file.
  Use the Adsutil.vbs tool to obtain the passwords for the IWAM and IUSR
  accounts from the IIS metabase.

2. To change the IUSR and/or IWAM passwords in Windows NT, follow these steps:

  a. From the Start menu, point to Programs point to Administrative Tools, and
     then click User Manager for Domains. In User Manager for Domains, you can
     change the account information for all Windows NT user accounts and
     groups.

  b. Double-click the IUSR_ComputerName and/or IWAM_ComputerName users, and
     modify the passwords so that they reflect the IIS metabase password that
     you obtained in step 1.

  To change the IUSR and/or IWAM passwords in Windows 2000, follow these steps:

  a. From the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
     then click Computer Management.

  b. Under the System Tools node, click to expand the "Local Users and Groups"
     and "Users" nodes. In the User node, you can change the account
     information for all Windows 2000 user accounts and groups.

  c. Right-click the IUSR_ComputerName and/or IWAM_ComputerName accounts, and
     then click Set Password.

  d. Modify the passwords so that they reflect the IIS metabase password that
     you obtained in step 1.

3. Browse to the ASP page that returned the error message to check if the
  problem has been resolved.

Method 2: Change the IIS Metabase to Match the IUSR and/or IWAM Passwords:

1. To change the IUSR and/or IWAM password in Windows NT, follow these steps:

  a. From the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
     then click User Manager for Domains. In User Manager for Domains, you can
     change the account information for all Windows NT user accounts and
     groups.

  b. Double-click the IUSR_ComputerName and/or IWAM_ComputerName accounts, and
     type new passwords.

  To change the IUSR and/or IWAM password in Windows 2000, follow these steps:

  a. From the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and
     then click Computer Management.

  b. Under the System Tools node, click to expand the "Local Users and Groups"
     and "Users" nodes. In the User node, you can change the account
     information for all Windows 2000 user accounts and groups.

  c. Right-click the IUSR_ComputerName and/or IWAM_ComputerName accounts, and
     then click Set Password. Type new passwords.

2. In the Command window, locate the folder that contains the Adsutil.vbs file.
  Use the Adsutil.vbs utility to set the passwords for the IWAM and IUSR
  accounts in the IIS metabase.

3. Browse to the ASP page that returned the error message to check if the
  problem has been resolved.

NOTE: Although the passwords in Microsoft Transaction Server (Windows NT) and
Component Services (Windows 2000) usually match the IIS metabase, update the
IWAM password in Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) or Component Services if the
problem still occurs. For more information, see the "How to Change the Password
in MTS or Component Services" portion of the "More Information" section.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Use Adsutil.vbs
----------------------

IIS provides a script file named Adsutil.vbs that you can use to obtain or set
the passwords of the IUSR and IWAM accounts to or from the IIS metabase. In
Windows NT 4.0, Adsutil.vbs is usually located in the
&lt;Drive&gt;\WINNT\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples folder. In Windows 2000,
Adsutil.vbs is located in the &lt;Drive&gt;\Inetpub\Adminscripts folder.

The following table lists the syntax for different functions of the Adsutil.vbs
utility:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Function                         | Syntax                                                         | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Obtain the IUSR account password | cscript.exe adsutil get w3svc/anonymoususerpass                | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Obtain the IWAM account password | cscript.exe adsutil get w3svc/wamuserpass                      | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Set the IUSR account password    | cscript.exe adsutil.vbs set w3svc/anonymoususerpass "password" | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Set the IWAM account password    | cscript.exe adsutil.vbs set w3svc/wamuserpass "password"       | 
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: When you try to obtain the password in Windows NT 4.0, the password appears
as clear text; however, the password appears as asterisks in Windows 2000. To
obtain the password in clear text in Windows 2000, you must modify Adsutil.vbs
so that it displays the unmasked password. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Notepad, open Adsutil.vbs.

2. On the Edit menu, click Find, type "IsSecureProperty = True" (without the
  quotation marks), and then click Find Next.

3. Change "IsSecureProperty = True" to "IsSecureProperty = False".

4. Save the changes to Adsutil.vbs, and then close Notepad.

How to Change the Password in MTS or Component Services
-------------------------------------------------------

Windows 2000:

IIS 5.0 provides the Synciwam.vbs file to update the starting identity of all IIS
COM+ application packages that run out-of-process. The Synciwam.vbs script is
located in the &lt;Drive&gt;\Inetpub\AdminScripts folder. You can use CScript or
WScript to run Synciwam.vbs.

To use Synciwam.vbs, type the following command at a command prompt:

  "cscript.exe synciwam.vbs -v" (without the quotation marks)

You may need to restart IIS for all changes to take effect. To restart IIS, from
the Start menu, click Run, type "iisreset" (without the quotation marks), and
then click OK.

NOTE: Using Synciwam.vbs resets all out-of-process applications (Medium and High
isolation) to IWAM_ComputerName.

Windows NT 4.0:

IIS 4.0 does not supply any tools such as Synciwam.vbs script. You must use MTS
Explorer to manually change the IWAM password for each of your applications that
are running in Separate Memory Process. To do this, follow these steps:

1. From the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Windows NT Option
  Pack 4, click Microsoft Transaction Server, and then click Transaction Server
  Explorer.

2. In the Transaction Server Explorer, click to expand the Microsoft Transaction
  Server, Computers, My Computer, and Packages Installed nodes.

3. Right-click one of the installed packages, and then click Properties.

4. On the Identity tab, if the package is running under the IWAM_ComputerName
  User identity, type the password to match the IIS metabase, and then click
  OK.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each of the packages installed.

6. Restart IIS for these changes to take effect. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. From the Windows Start menu, click Run, type "cmd" (without the quotation
     marks), and then click OK.

  b. At a command prompt, type the following commands sequentially:

      - net stop iisadmin /y
      - net start w3svc
      - net start msftpsvc (Use this command if you are running FTP Server)
      - net start smtpsvc (Use this command if you are running SMTP Server)
      - net start cisvc (Use this command if you are running Index Server)
