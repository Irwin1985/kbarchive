The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released a rollup package for Internet Information Services (IIS)
5.0 and Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 that includes the functionality
from all security patches released to date for IIS 5.0, and all patches released
for IIS 4.0 since Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.

This article provides a timeline and the fixes included with each release.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: These patches do not include fixes for vulnerabilities involving non-IIS
products, such as the Front Page Server Extensions and Index Server, even though
these products are closely associated with IIS and typically installed on IIS
servers. There is, however, one exception for the August 15, 2001 release. The
fix for the vulnerability affecting Index Server which is discussed in Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS01-033
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-033.asp) is included in
this patch because of the seriousness of the issue for IIS servers. At the time
this article was written, the Microsoft Security Bulletins that discuss these
vulnerabilities are as follows:

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-043
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-043.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-025
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms01-025.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-084
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-084.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-006
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-006.asp)

NOTE: The fixes for the following vulnerabilities that affect IIS 4.0 are not
included in the patch because they require administrative action instead of a
software change. Administrators should ensure that in addition to applying this
patch, they also take the administrative action discussed in the following
bulletins:

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-028
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-028.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-025
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-025.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-025
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-025.asp) (which
  discusses the same issue as Microsoft Security Bulletin MS98-004)
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms98-004.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-013
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-013.asp)
