Microsoft Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade 
Release Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction:

The Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade (DUN 1.4) provides additional features for the
Dial-Up Networking components that were first introduced in Windows 95. The 1.4
release includes all of the features of all previous DUN releases, as well as
those included in the ISDN 1.1 release. DUN 1.4 features include PPTP client
support, 128-bit encryption, support for internal ISDN adapters, multilink
support, and connection-time scripting to automate non-standard login
connections. The DUN 1.4 upgrade can be applied to any version of Windows 95. It
will not install on any other version of Windows, such as Windows 98.

1.1 New Features in DUN 1.4

- 128-bit encryption supported with the Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade.
- The Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade includes several fixes to improve the
  stability of PPTP connections.
- A Year 2000 fix for the DHCP Client has been included in the DUN 1.4 Upgrade

1.2 Installation Notes

Execute the MSDUN14.exe file and follow the instructions. The installation
process will require you to reboot the machine, and may ask for your Windows 95
installation disk (if you originally installed Windows 95 from a CD). If you
encounter a "do you want to keep a newer file" dialog, always keep the newer
file.

Once the installation is complete, you will be able to remove the Dial-Up
Networking 1.4 Upgrade by using the install/uninstall tab of the "Add/Remove
Programs" icon in the setup folder. This will remove all of Dial-Up Networking
from your system. After this, you can add the original Windows 95 version of
Dial-Up Networking by using the windows setup tab of the "Add/Remove Programs"
icon. Alternately, you can re-install the 1.4 upgrade by executing the
MSDUN14.exe file.

Note: An uninstall of the Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade will completely remove
Dial-Up Networking from your system, including any features that depend on it.
For example, an uninstall would remove Direct Cable Connection and Virtual
Private Networking in addition to the ability to dial out over modems or ISDN
devices. If you have installed an ISDN device, removing Dial-Up Networking will
logically remove the device and any information that you entered for it. This
information will not be restored when you re-install Dial-Up Networking.

Always use the "Add/Remove Programs" icon in the setup folder in order to add or
delete Dial-Up Networking from your system. Do not add or remove individual
Dial-Up Adapter or Virtual Private Networking Adapter components via the Network
Control Panel applet or from the Device Manager tab of the System applet.

NOTE: The Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade relies on features in a more recent
version of the Microsoft TCP/IP stack. For that reason, installation of the
upgrade will replace your current TCP/IP protocol stack (or add the stack if you
do not already have it installed.) If you have applications that rely on a third
party stack, you may want to discontinue this upgrade. If you choose to perform
the upgrade, and certain applications stop working, you will have to reload
these applications.

2. Feature Overview:

2.1 ISDN Support

MSDUN includes the support for internal ISDN adapters that was previously
delivered in the ISDN 1.1 Accelerator Pack. To assist in the setup process, an
ISDN Configuration Wizard is automatically installed in the Start menu under
Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;ISDN Tools.

2.2 Multilink Support

Multilink support enables your computer to use two communications ports as if
they were a single port of twice the bandwidth. Multilink is enabled from the
Properties page of any connection icon in the Dial-Up Networking folder.

2.3 Scripting

Some Internet Service Providers require a terminal interaction with the user at
the start of a dial-up connection. The Scripting feature included in this
Dial-Up Networking upgrade allows you to automate this interaction. Scripting is
enabled from the Properties page of any connection icon in the Dial-Up
Networking folder.

2.4 PPTP Client

2.4.1 PPTP Tunneling Windows Dial-Up Networking uses the Internet standard
Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to provide a secure, optimized multiple-protocol
network connection over dialed telephone lines. PPTP adds the ability to treat
the Internet as a point-to-point Dial-Up Networking connection. All data sent
over this connection can be encrypted and compressed, and multiple network level
protocols (TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and IPX) can be run concurrently. Windows NT Domain
Login level security is preserved even across the Internet. PPTP can also be
used to connect to an Intranet that is otherwise isolated from the Internet,
even if this same Intranet has Internet address space conflicts.

PPTP appears as new modem type (Virtual Private Networking Adapter) that can be
selected when setting up a connection in the Dial-Up Networking folder. The VPN
Adapter type does not appear elsewhere in the system. Since PPTP encapsulates
its data stream in the PPP protocol, the VPN requires a second dial-up adapter.
This second dial-up adapter for VPN is added during the installation phase of
the Upgrade in addition to the first dial-up adapter that provides PPP support
for the analog or ISDN modem.

2.4.2 PPTP Connections

The "Make a New Connection" wizard (in the Dial-Up Networking folder) will guide
you through the steps needed to create connection icons for either normal
dial-up (modem) calls or PPTP (virtual private network) calls. You indicate use
of PPTP by selecting VPN rather than a modem as your device type.

2.4.2.1 Dial-up PPTP Connections

The most typical application for PPTP involves a dial-up PPP connection to the
Internet followed by a separate PPTP connection to a remote tunnel server. This
"two call" sequence requires two connection icons in the Dial-Up Networking
folder, and two "dialing" actions by the user. The results of a successful
tunnel over the Internet are two network connections on your PC: one to the
Internet, and one to the target network served by the tunnel server.

2.4.2.2 LAN-based PPTP Connections

A second application for PPTP involves a tunnel over a LAN to which your PC is
already attached. In this case, only a single connection icon is required, and
only a single "dialing" action is used to initiate the tunnel. Under this
scenario, it is not necessary to have a Dial-Up Networking connection to the
Internet to support PPTP. The ability to route packets correctly to the PPTP
tunnel server over an IP network is the only requirement for a PPTP connection.

2.5 Per-Connection Encryption Settings

The DUN 1.4 upgrade adds the ability to require encryption for a specific
connection. A checkbox on the Server tab of the connection's property page has
been added, allowing you to require encryption for a successful connection. If
the server proposes 40-bit encryption, such a client would respond by requesting
128-bit encryption. A 128-bit capable server would accept the client's request.
Note that a server which is capable of only 40-bit encryption would not be able
to accept a client request for 128-bit encryption. A connection request of this
type would fail.

2.6 Other Features in the DUN 1.4 Release

- Limited server functionality for a dialup Point to Point IP connection is
  enabled.
- Additional information is available to the connection status display. You can
  click "Details" after getting connected and see what type of authentication
  was negotiated and whether data encryption, software compression, or
  multilink was negotiated.
- You can turn on an improved PPP logging option on a per connection basis.
  Results are logged to PPPLOG.TXT in your Windows directory.

3. Product Limitations and Related Issues:

There are network routing issues and product limitations that affect network
behavior when you are using Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking. Network routing
issues are discussed in the Default Routing to Remote TCP/IP Networks section
below. Product limitations and related issues are discussed in this section.

3.1 Name Resolution Issues

The original release of Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking had limited support for
WINS and DNS name resolution when a PC was connected to multiple networks. The
Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade resolves all of the WINS limitations, and applies
a Winsock upgrade to resolve the remaining DNS limitations.

Microsoft has also released Winsock2, a complete redesign of the Winsock
architecture. Winsock2 is fully compatible with the Dial-Up Networking 1.4
Upgrade. If Winsock2 has already been installed, the Dial-Up Networking 1.4
Upgrade will not overwrite it. If you wish to install it, Winsock2 is available
from the Microsoft web site at Windows Socket 2 Update
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadmintools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/default.asp).

3.2 Static IP Address, WINS, and DNS Settings

In almost all cases, you should allow the network to define your PC's IP address
and to provide WINS and DNS server addresses automatically. This occurs when you
boot your machine on a LAN, or when you successfully establish a PPP or PPTP
connection to a remote network. In the rare cases where an ISP or systems
administrator requires you to set an IP address or to define addresses for WINS
and/or DNS servers, you should do this in the appropriate connection icon. (Use
the TCP/IP Settings button on the Server Type tab of the Properties page for the
icon.)

Generally, you should not set TCP/IP properties for dial-up adapters from the
Network icon in the control panel. Values set via the control panel are global
settings that override the settings in individual connection icons, and may
override any dynamic information established during a dial-up or PPTP
connection. In particular, setting a static WINS address on a LAN adapter will
prevent dynamic WINS assignments on dial-up or PPTP connections. Setting a
static DNS address on the LAN adapter does not have this effect. So additional
DNS addresses will be obtained on a successful connection to a remote network.

NOTE: There have been cases where cable modem installation instructions required
the user or installer to use the network control panel applet to define a DNS
server and to define a DNS domain suffix search order for the LAN card serving
the cable modem. (This information is on the TCP/IP properties sheet for the
affected LAN card.) Defining a DNS suffix search order will cause timeout delays
when a tunnel is used to reach another network unless the suffix for that
network is included at the top of the list.

3.3 Remote Access after Physical Disconnection from a LAN

An addressing problem can occur when a computer that has been directly connected
to a private TCP/IP network is physically disconnected and then attempts a
dial-up or PPTP connection. (This can happen, for example, when a laptop user
disconnects an Ethernet connection from the corporate network and then tries to
dial in from home.) If the network card is still installed, TCP/IP may be
configured so that the computers that could be reached through the netcard still
appear reachable through the netcard. Even after a modem Dial-Up Networking
connection or a PPTP connection is established back to the same network, TCP/IP
will continue to send all traffic for computers on the local network out the
netcard.

The workaround, if the computer originally booted from DHCP, is to run the
winipcfg utility and select the Release option. If this does not fix the
problem, the netcard may have been manually configured through the control
panel, and will have to be disabled through the control panel.

3.4 Accessing Network Shares Across Private Networks

In the special case where two networks are under Windows NT domain login security
and they are in different, non-trusted domains, it is not possible to tunnel
across one network to reach hosts or servers on the second network. Windows 95
logs into the first domain and cannot log in to a second domain. The workaround
is to skip the initial domain login (Cancel) and log into the second network
when the PPTP connection is established.

Note that since the Internet does not employ domain login security, this problem
will not occur when tunneling across the Internet.

3.5 Multi-homed IPX Support in Microsoft Client for Networks

A PC which uses the Client for Microsoft Networks may have problems communicating
with a remote IPX network over PPTP if IPX is simultaneously bound to a LAN
adapter. These problems do not occur in an ordinary dial-up connection. These
problems do not occur in a PC which is running the Client for NetWare Networks.

3.6 ISDN1.0 Accelerator Pack Drivers

Windows 95 now supports ISDN NDISWAN drivers that are compatible with Windows NT.
This has been the case since the release of the ISDN Accelerator Pack 1.1, which
required the use of Windows NT-compatible ISDN 1.1 drivers. Consequently, most
ISDN vendors supply ISDN 1.1 drivers with their hardware. Drivers compatible
with the Windows 95 ISDN Accelerator Pack 1.0 no longer work.

See http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn
(http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn) for a list of known vendor drivers.

3.7 ISDN Driver Installation

Many vendors bundle the old ISDN1.1 Accelerator Pack with their own device
drivers on their installation diskette to simplify the installation process. As
a result, if a vendor's install procedure is run on a system that has been
upgraded to DUN 1.4, the install procedure may overwrite some of the upgraded
files and leave various portions of the system unusable. Typically, the vendor
install will ask you if it is OK to install ISDN 1.0 or ISDN 1.1. You should say
"no".

If you think that the vendor's install has overwritten Dial-Up Networking, you
should immediately re-run the Dial-Up Networking 1.4 Upgrade installation.

3.8 Multilink Operation

After your additional devices are configured using the procedure outlined in the
previous section, you are ready to dial your Multilink connection. When you dial
the connection, Dial-Up Networking dials the primary number of the primary
device specified for the connection. Once the first connection is established,
Dial-Up Networking will then dial the other devices specified in the Additional
Devices list.

Once the connections are established, you can view status information about the
link by double clicking on the "communicating computers" icon displayed in the
taskbar, or you may disconnect the connection. The status information includes
the number of bytes sent and received, the network protocols negotiated for use
on the connection and a list box showing each of the additional devices. As you
highlight a device in the list box, a "Suspend" or "Resume" button is displayed.
If a Suspend button is displayed, then the device is now in use and "bundled"
into the Multilink connection. Clicking on the "Suspend" button disconnects that
line and removes the line from the bundled connections. If the "Resume" button
is displayed, then click on "Resume" to dial that connection and add that line
to the bundle. You may suspend and resume individual links without dropping the
connection.

3.9 Limited IP-IP Dial-in Server

Previously, Windows 95 could only act as a dial up server for IPX and NetBEUI
traffic. This new feature lets a Windows 95 machine answer a dial up call for
machine to machine applications such as Microsoft NetMeeting (which supports
application sharing, chat, video conferencing, and IP based telephony). The
Dial-Up client is always assigned 192.168.55.2, and the server is always
192.168.55.1. The Point to Point IP Server is enabled by default, and can be
enabled/disabled in the advanced properties for the Dial-Up Adapter.

4. Security Related Notes:

PPTP employs existing PPP features to enable secure, encrypted access to a
private network for selected clients on the Internet without providing access to
all of the potential clients on the internet. The PPTP tunnel server controls
this access by authenticating connection requests from the clients that request
tunnel connections to the private network. Security can be further enhanced by
enabling static PPTP filtering on the tunnel server, or by placing the tunnel
server behind a firewall, or by enabling IP filtering on a Windows NT4 tunnel
server equipped with the Routing and Remote Access service. See the User and
Administrator Guide on Installing, Configuring and Using PPTP with Microsoft
Clients and Servers located at:
http://www.microsoft.com/communications/morepptp.htm
(http://www.microsoft.com/communications/morepptp.htm) for further information.

4.1 MSCHAP V2

This release supports a new MSCHAP (MSCHAP V2) which provides the following
security features:

- Mutual authentication, based on random challenges from both server and client
- Stronger initial data encryption keys, generated from both the user's
  password and the random challenges from the server and the client
- Separate initial encryption keys for encrypting the transmit and receive
  paths
- Drops support for the MSCHAP password change V1
- Drops use of the LMHASH encoding of the password

An updated DUN client will negotiate MSCHAP V2 before negotiating the original
MSCHAP. The Windows NT 4.0 server will also negotiate MSCHAP V2 first, so
networks with updated clients and servers will shift entirely to MSCHAP V2
authentication. To ensure that no clients authenticate using MSCHAP, the server
can be set to require MSCHAP V2. This will prevent legacy clients from
presenting their credentials in an MSCHAP or PAP or CHAP exchange, and is a
likely configuration for networks that require the most secure authentication
method.

4.2 PPTP Connections Through Firewalls

Some networks utilize GRE messages for internal operations and have set their
routers to prevent GRE packets from entering or leaving the network. PPTP
traffic uses TCP port 1723 and routing protocol 47. If the PPTP tunnel is
configured correctly, but transmits no data, your Internet Service Provider may
be screening GRE packets, or the necessary port may be blocked. Contact your ISP
to resolve this issue.

5 Network Routing Behavior:

All TCP/IP host computers (including your Windows 95 PC) share a routing
limitation that will be important for Dial-Up and PPTP users accessing remote
TCP/IP networks. Host computers rely on a routing scheme called default gateway
routing. This mechanism is simple: to reach any computer not on the local
network, and not specified by any other routing table entries, forward the
traffic to a specified default gateway router. The gateway router generally
knows how to forward the traffic correctly. This approach has the advantage that
your Windows 95 computer can connect to millions of other computers without
complex routing tables. This approach has the disadvantage that it assumes that
there is only a single connection to all of the external networks it may wish to
reach.

The default gateway concept works particularly well for a stand-alone PC that is
dialing into a remote network. When a dial-up connection is established, a
default gateway is assigned to route traffic through that connection.

The concept breaks down when your PC already has a default gateway, and a second
default gateway is assigned by Dial-Up Networking to reach a new network. This
could happen, for example, if your computer had a default route for its local
LAN and then dialed an additional connection into a remote network. It could
also happen if your computer dialed into the Internet and then made a second
PPTP connection to a remote tunnel server. In both of these cases, the first
gateway is replaced by the most recent gateway, and computers that were
reachable though the first gateway will no longer be visible. Note that a DNS or
WINS name server that may be one of the computers that is hidden. This will
result in the inability to resolve computer names on the affected network.

In summary, TCP/IP default gateway routing is designed to work with computers
that connect to a single network. A PPTP connection over a Dial-up link, or a
Dial-Up connection from a LAN-based PC, result in two network connections.. In
each case, the default route will point to the most recent connection. When the
PPTP or Dial-Up connection is released, all connectivity to the first network
will be restored.

6 Additional Information for Advanced Users:

6.1 LMhash Suppression

This release also provides a registry variable which prevents the client from
sending the LM response to a legacy MSCHAP challenge, as defined below. By
default, this variable is absent, meaning that the client should send the LM
response (in order to maintain compatibility with legacy servers). The value of
this variable is checked just before a connection is attempted.

NOTE: Most users will not need to use this registry variable. The new secure mode
MSCHAP V2 will not send the LMHash response, so this registry value is most
useful when connecting to older access servers which use the original MSCHAP.

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess

  DWORD: UseLmPassword
  Default: 0x00000001

  0x00000000 = Do not send LM challenge response (send only NT challenge response)
  0x00000001 = Send LM challenge response

6.2 The SecureVPN Flag

If there are special circumstances in which you wish to ensure that your PC uses
only the new MSCHAP V2 for all VPN connection attempts, a new client-side
registry flag, SecureVPN, can be used to force this behavior. When this flag is
set, your PC will only accept MSCHAP V2 authentication for any VPN connections.
In addition, this flag will require data encryption for all VPN connections.
Dial-up connections are not affected.

NOTE: Most users will not need to use the Secure VPN flag. This flag should be
used with care because it will affect the behavior of all VPN connections from
your machine. In general, the required use of MSCHAP V2 and data encryption can
be enforced more easily on the server.

The registry setting which will force a Windows 95 client to use only the new
MSCHAP V2 secure mode and require data encryption for PPTP connections is
defined below. By default, this registry variable is absent, meaning "do not
force secure mode on PPTP connections". The value of this variable is checked
just before a connection is attempted.

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess
  Default: 0x00000000

  DWORD: SecureVPN
  Value: 0x00000001 == Force secure mode (MSCHAP V2 plus data encryption) on all PPTP connections
  Value: 0x00000000 == Do not force secure mode on PPTP connections

6.3 The Force Strong Encryption Flag

A new registry variable, ForceStrongEncryption, has been provided to allow the
client to require strong encryption. The registry flag which forces strong
encryption is defined below. By default, the flag is absent. The value of this
flag is checked just before a connection is attempted.

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess

  DWORD: ForceStrongEncryption
  Default: 0x00000000

  0x00000000 = No effect; does not force strong encryption
  0x00000001 = Requires 128-bit encryption for any connection which already requires encryption

Note that data encryption is negotiated during the CCP (Compression Control
Protocol) phase of the connection. Consequently, the properties sheet for a
connection must enable either compression or encryption (below) in order for the
encryption negotiation to succeed. This is rarely an issue since compression is
enabled by default.

6.4 PPTP Historyless Mode

A historyless mode for encryption and compression over PPTP connections is
available. This mode solves performance problems encountered using PPTP in high
latency networks or networks that experience significant packet loss. To
negotiate historyless mode, both the PPTP client and server must support the new
mode. If either side refuses the new mode, normal MPPE compression and
encryption will be negotiated. Be sure that servers supporting historyless
clients are running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later, or Windows 2000.

6.5 Modem Pool Access

PPTP can be also used as a method for a LAN-based PC to make a dial-up connection
to a remote computer or network through a modem pool on an appropriately
configured access server. To initiate such a connection, simply establish a PPTP
connection whose tunnel address is specified as
"AccessServer&lt;space&gt;PhoneNumber". AccessServer is the DNS name or IP
address of the PPTP-enabled access server; PhoneNumber is the set of digits to
be dialed to reach the other site. The access server will bring up a dial-up PPP
connection to the digits supplied. On connection, your PC will behave as if it
had dialed directly into the remote site. Authentication will be performed by
the remote site

Note: This feature is only supported by access servers which support "compulsory
tunneling". These are servers which receive an ordinary dial-up PPP call, then
create a tunnel on the caller's behalf, and then insert the PPP traffic into the
tunnel. Windows NT RAS does not presently support this feature

6.6 Packet Size Adjustment

The IP Packet size for dial-up connections is automatically adjusted based on
connection speed. The setting toggles between "Small" (576) for Dial-Up
connections of 128kbps and below and "Large" (1500) for faster Dial-Up
connections or LAN connections. In addition, the PPTP frame size is adjusted
based on the Maximum Transit Unit (MTU) in order to avoid fragmentation. One can
manually set both the dial-up and PPTP MTU sizes to a specific size. These are
configurable under the advanced properties for the Dial-Up Adapter.
