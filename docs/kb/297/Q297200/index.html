- MSPRESS Microsoft Enterprise Learning Library: Step by Step Interactive Version 4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Error message occurs when trying to access Microsoft Press Step by Step
Interactive software including Office 2000 and Office XP
Error message:
"A server-side database error has occurred.
Data may not have been saved or retrieved.

See your system administrator for assistance."

"getseti.asp"

CAUSE
=====

Note that SQL7 SP3 comes in two parts, one for database components, one for
OLAP.
Install the OLAP part - but if OLAP wasn't already installed, you can not apply
that part of the SQL7 SP3.
It's an optional component - one that doesn't get installed by default.
NOTE: During the SP3 upgrade procedure, it strongly warns the user to change
default authentication from mixed (with sa and no password) to NT
Authentication. The default is changing authentication to NT authentication.

RESOLUTION
==========

Go into SQL Enterprise Manager, and right-click the MSPress database, changes
the logon scheme from NT authentication to SQL authentication (with the original
parameters used - likely sa and no password)

WORKAROUND
==========

You not only need to reselect the unadvised mixed-mode during setup, but you
must check the 'no password' checkbox - despite it warning you against that for
security reasons.

STATUS
======



MORE INFORMATION
================

NT authentication was starting to be used as opposed to mixed mode (sa and no
password) which would mean that the setup, which likely was used with the
defaults (mixed mode) no longer worked as the database logon scheme was changed.
