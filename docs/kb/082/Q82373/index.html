SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a swap file, you may receive an error message similar to the
following:

  The partitioning scheme used on your hard disk prevents the creation of a
  permanent swap file.

This error message can display whether you use the Virtual Memory dialog box
during a custom Windows Setup, or the 386 Enhanced option in Control Panel to
create swap files.

CAUSE
=====

This message can result from one of the following:

- A partition manager

- A virus

- Uninitialized fields in the partition table

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows is very careful about what hard disks it uses when it creates permanent
swap files. Windows would cause serious disk errors and data loss if it
incorrectly modified a disk that is formatted with special software. To prevent
damaged disks and lost data, Windows makes absolutely sure that it understands
the exact format of the disk.

One of the checks performed by Control Panel (and Setup, because Setup uses
Control Panel to create a swap file when a custom setup is performed) is to look
for disk partitioning software, such as Disk Manager or SuperStor. This is done
by examining the partition table on the disk.

If partitioning software is found, Control Panel displays an error message. This
message does not imply that the partitioning software is incompatible with
Windows; it simply means that a permanent swap file cannot be created on that
disk.

The following conditions can cause Control Panel to mistakenly detect
partitioning software:

- Another operating system is installed on the computer and happens to use the
  same partition type number (there are only 255 partition type numbers
  available); that partition is detected as one using partitioning software.
  There is no way to work around this problem if this is the cause.


- The machine is infected with a virus. Some viruses create their own "foreign"
  disk partitions and set themselves up as the boot operating system (for
  example, the Michelangelo virus). If no other explanation for the disk
  partition error can be found, the disk should be scanned for viruses. When
  the virus is removed, Windows should be able to create the permanent swap
  file.

- The disk drive may have been partitioned in the past with partitioning
  software, and was later repartitioned using MS-DOS version 4.01 or 5.0 FDISK.
  MS-DOS and FDISK support only four partitions on a disk, while some partition
  software supports more than four. Therefore, FDISK does not reset partitions
  in the extra entries. As a result, Windows interprets these invalid entries
  as an incompatible disk partition.

- Ontrack Software Disk Manager-N utility partitions and formats part of a hard
  drive as a Novell file server. When a machine configured with Disk Manager-N
  is started, the Novell utility attached to the master boot record (MBR) loads
  and gives you the option of starting the system on the MS-DOS partition or to
  the Novell file server partition. If your hard disk has been partitioned with
  Disk Manager-N, you cannot create a permanent swap file under Microsoft
  Windows 3.1.

  The following text was taken from the Disk Manager README file:

  DISK MANAGER - N

  DISK MANAGER - N is a disk installation utility tailored specifically for the
  NOVELL local area network. This utility replaces the COMPSURF utility from
  NOVELL. DISK MANAGER - N installs disks running under NETWARE 86, ADVANCED
  NETWARE 86, and ADVANCED NETWARE 286.
