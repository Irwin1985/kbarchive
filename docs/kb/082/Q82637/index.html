SUMMARY
=======

There are a number of Windows independent software vendor (ISV) applications and
some hardware installation programs that install their own Windows
communications drivers to replace the Windows-provided drivers. Most of these
replacement drivers are Windows 3.0 compatible. To use them in Windows 3.1 386
enhanced mode, the following switch is required in the [386enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI: "commdrv30=true". These drivers should work in standard mode without
any modifications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a Windows 3.0 communications driver has been installed and you try to access
a communications port, Windows 3.1 displays a full-screen MS-DOS box warning you
that a Windows 3.0 compatible communications driver is installed and to use the
aforementioned switch. It is recommended that you use this switch and the
Windows 3.0 compatible drivers only if the Windows 3.1 communications drivers
fail to work.

Most replacement drivers typically replace three key device lines in the
SYSTEM.INI file. Below is a sample listing of the relevant portions of
SYSTEM.INI. If any of these device lines look different from what is listed
below, it is a good indication that a replacement communication driver has been
installed.

     [boot]
     comm.drv=comm.drv

     [386Enh]
     device=*vcd
     device=*combuff

The following ISV applications and hardware installation programs are known to
install Windows 3.0-compatible replacement communications drivers:

  MicrophoneII v1.0 and 2.0

  FAXit all versions, but only if an external FAX/Modem is connected through the
  communications port

  TurboCom all versions. This is actually only a set of replacement
  communications device drivers.

  Hayes ESP/Dual Enhanced Serial Port installation program
