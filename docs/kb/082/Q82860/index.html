The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 WIN.INI [Compatibility]
section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compatibility bits are defined in the [Compatibility] section of the WIN.INI
file for the following applications:

- Microsoft Publisher

- Microsoft Money

- Microsoft Works

- WordPerfect

- Lotus Freelance

- CC Mail

- Microsoft Visual Basic

- Ami Pro

- Pixie

- ObjectVision

- Cricket Presents

- Just Write

- ExploreNet

- Aporia

- Packrat

- Microcourier

- Guide

- Microsoft Excel

- Ascend

- MGX Draw

- AccPack

- Charisma

- Persuasion

- Ingress

- Lotus Notes

- Microsoft Draw

- Turbo Tax

When an application loads under Windows 3.1, KERNEL.EXE checks to see if the
application was compiled exclusively for Windows 3.1. If the application was
compiled for Windows 3.0, and will therefore run under Windows 3.0 or 3.1,
KERNEL.EXE checks the module name and determines if any bits are defined for
that name in the [Compatibility] section of the WIN.INI file.

The following is a detailed explanation of compatibility bits. The symbolic name
is defined in WINDOWS.H. The problem, listed for each application, will be fixed
if the compatibility bit is defined. If these switches are in the
[Compatibility] section of the WIN.INI file then these problems will not occur.
The Windows 3.1 Setup program automatically inserts these switches into the
WIN.INI, regardless of whether or not that application is on the machine.

The symbolic names are internal only, they are not in the WINDOWS.H that ships
with the Software Development Kit (SDK).

Bit: 1
------

Symbolic name: GACF_IGNORENODISCARD
Meaning: Ignore NODISCARD flag if passed to GlobalAlloc(). C 6.x
        Runtime install library was allocating global memory
        improperly by incorrectly specifying the GMEM_NODISCARD bit.
Apps:
  Publisher
     WIN.INI Line: notshell=0x0001
     Problem: Setup for MS apps. does not work on 1M 286 machine.
  Money
     WIN.INI Line: notshell=0x0001
     Problem: Setup for MS apps. does not work on 1M 286 machine.
  Works
     WIN.INI Line: notshell=0x0001
     Problem: Setup for MS apps. does not work on 1M 286 machine.

Bit: 2
------

Symbolic name: GACF_FORCETEXTBAND
Meaning: Separate text band from graphics band. Forces separate band
        for text, disallowing 3.1 optimization where Text and
        Graphics are printed in the same band. Word Perfect was
        assuming text had to go in second band.
Apps:
  WordPerfect
     WIN.INI Line: WPWINFIL=0x0006
     Problem: Can't print graphics in landscape mode. The
              compatibility switch doesn't completely fix the
              problem, just fixes it for certain memory
              configurations.
  Freelance
     WIN.INI Line: rem=0x8022
     Problem: Freelance couldn't print presentation (.pre) files.

Bit: 4
------

Symbolic name: GACF_ONELANDGRXBAND
Meaning: One graphics band only. Allows only one Landscape graphics
        band. Take as much memory as possible for this band. What
        doesn't fit in that band doesn't print.
Apps:
  WordPerfect
     WIN.INI Line: WPWINFIL=0x0006
     Problem: Can't print graphics in landscape mode. The
              compatibility switch doesn't completely fix the
              problem, just fixes it for certain memory
              configurations.

Bit: 8
------

Symbolic name: GACF_IGNORETOPMOST
Meaning: Ignore topmost windows for GetWindow(HWND,GW_HWNDFIRST)
Apps:
  CCMail
     WIN.INI Line: ccmail=0x0008
     Problem: CCMail would GP fault when running any Windows applet
              from CCMail because it assumed the applet it starts
              will be at the top of the window list when winexec
              returns. Because of the addition of TOPMOST windows in
              Win 3.1, this isn't the case.  The compatibility bit
              fixes this so GetWindow doesn't return a topmost
              window.

Bit: 10
-------

Symbolic name: GACF_CALLTTDEVICE
Meaning: Set the DEVICE_FONTTYPE bit in the FontType for TT fonts
        returned by EnumFonts().
Apps:
  Ami Pro
     WIN.INI Line: Amipro=0x0010
     Problem: Font mapping problems, described below.
  WordPerfect
     WIN.INI Line: win2wrs=0x1210
     Problem: WordPerfect was assuming TT fonts enumerated by the
              printer would have the device bit set. TT fonts are not
              device fonts, so this bit wasn't set. There were
              various font mapping problems, such as TNR appearing in
              Script or Symbol.

Bit: 20
-------

Symbolic name: GACF_MULTIPLEBANDS
Meaning: Manually break graphics output into more than one band when
        printing.
Apps:
  Freelance
     WIN.INI Line: Rem=0x08022
     Problem: Freelance wouldn't print graphics when there was enough
              memory and unidrv used only one band for printing. If
              the first band was the entire page, it didn't issue any
              graphics calls, thinking it was the text only band.
              This forces unidrv to use multiple bands.

Bit: 40
-------

Symbolic name: GACF_ALWAYSSENDNCPAINT
Meaning: SetWindowPos() must send a WM_NCPAINT message to all
        children, disallowing the 3.1 optimization where this message
        is only sent to windows that must be redrawn.
Apps:
  Pixie
     WIN.INI Line: pixie=0x0040
     Problem: File window overlaps the toolbox and doesn't repaint
              when a new file is opened.  Pixie used the receipt of
              WM_NCPAINT messages to determine that they may need to
              reposition themselves at the top of the list.  Win 3.0
              used to send the messages to windows even when they
              didn't need to be sent; in particular if the window was
              within the bounding rect of any update region involved
              in a window management operation.
  ObjectVision
     WIN.INI Line: Vision=0x0040
     Problem: Repaint problems with dialog boxes left on the screen
              after file.open or file.new operations.
  Cricket Presents
     WIN.INI Line: cp=0x0040
     Problem: Tool window is not available when opening the app.

Bit: 80
-------

Symbolic name: GACF_EDITSETTEXTMUNGE
Meaning: Strings that are passed to Edit Controls by WM_SETTEXT are
        forced to upper case. Just Write was expecting this
        behavior, which was a bug in 3.0.
Apps:
  Just Write
     WIN.INI Line: JW=0x42080
     Problem: Just Write wouldn't change the extension in the
              file.open dialog when opening a file of a different
              format. Just Write calls SetDlgItemText to set the
              default extension in edit controls during WM_INITDIALOG
              processing. SetDlgItemText ultimately calls text
              insert routine which had a bug in 3.0 where it
              converted the case of the text passed in dependent on
              edit control style. Thus, under 3.0, SetDlgItemText
              was (wrongly) modifying the string passed in. The app
              has worked around the bug in 3.0 and is now failing in
              3.1 since the bug has been fixed. The compatibility
              bit reverts to 3.0 behavior.

Bit: 100
--------

Symbolic name: GACF_MOREEXTRAWNDWORDS
Meaning: Add 4 to the extra bytes (CBWNDEXTRA) in the window instance
        and class instance structures. In Windows 3.0, even if you
        didn't allocate extra window/class words, you could still
        access them and corrupt Windows internally. In Windows 3.1,
        you are prevented from accessing extra words you didn't allocate
        so that apps won't corrupt windows. This switch forces
        extra words for all classes/windows created by the given
        application.
Apps:
  Compton's MM Ency
     WIN.INI Line: TME=0x0100
     Problem: Crashes choosing atlas. Caused by not initializing the
              WNDCLASS.cbWndExtra field.
  ExploreNet
     WIN.INI Line: netset2=0x0100
     Problem: Application error selecting update in "Input Form"
              window. Caused by the app specifying 0 extra bytes
              when creating the window class.
  Aporia 1.4
     WIN.INI Line: aporia=0x0100
     Problem: Aporia icons don't appear on the desktop. Hangs the
              system. App says it wants 1 extra byte in the
              RegisterClass, then does a SetWindowWord (2 bytes),
              then GetWindowLong (4 Bytes).

Bit: 200
--------

Symbolic name: GACF_TTIGNORERASTERDUPE
Meaning: Don't enumerate Duplicate bit map fonts for TT fonts. Times
        New Roman was displayed and printed as a vector font. We
        install bit map fonts for Arial and Times New Roman at sizes
        8,10 (EGA resolution). When we enumerate fonts for face names
        Arial and Times New Roman, we would enumerate the sizes
        available in the bit map fonts and one size for the
        corresponding true type font. This confused the font mapper
        in WordPerfect. It would somehow get confused into believing
        that a TNR font was available for only the two bit map sizes
        and map a request for a larger size to a Roman vector font.
Apps:
   Word Perfect
     WIN.INI Line: Win2wrs=0x01210
     Problem: Some fonts displayed as vector fonts. GDI will not
              enumerate raster fonts which have the same face or
              family name as a TT font if TT is enabled and the
              compatibility bit is set.
   Visual Basic
      WIN.INI Line: vb=0x0200
      Problem: Reports duplicate font sizes.

Bit: 800
--------

Symbolic name: GACF_DELAYHWHNDSHAKECHK
Meaning: Don't check hardware handshaking on SetCommState(). Do not
        check hardware handshaking (CTS and DSR) on SetCommState().
        (Reverts to 30 behavior.) Packrat could not Dial. It only
        checked for DSR, but this is not set until carrier detect. A
        bug existed in win30 where SetCommState never checked DSR and
        CTS. If a serial printer was off-line, data would be sent to
        the COM port anyway, causing lost data.
Apps:
   Packrat
     WIN.INI Line: packrat=0x0800
     Problem: Packrat didn't dial using modem on COM2.
   Microcourier
     WIN.INI Line: mcourier=0x800
     Problem: Couldn't connect to modem using COM2.

Bit: 1000
---------

Symbolic name:  GACF_ENUMHELVNTMSRMN
Meaning: Enumerates TmsRmn and Helv. Some apps are broken because they
        relied on 3.0 fonts Helv and Tms Rmn by name. Font
        Substitution covers much of these problems but we cannot
        legally enumerate Helv and Tms Rmn for future apps, so it was
        dropped. We still have the exact same fonts, but now under
        the names MS Sans Serif and MS Serif, and will enumerate them
        as Helv and Tms Rmn when this bit is set. (We are allowed to
        do this for backwards compatibility.)
Apps:
   Spinnaker +
     WIN.INI Line: plus=0x01000
     Problem: Text alignment and spacing problems in buttons and
              titles. Fix only works if Smallfonts come after serif
              and sans serif entries. Setup does this automatically.
   Milestones, etc.
     WIN.INI Line: milesv3=0x1000
     Problem: Text is unreadable when the app is started. App does
              its own font mapping and gets confused when it can't
              find Tms Rmn.
   Guide
     WIN.INI Line: guide=0x1000
     Problem: Text problems.
   Excel
     WIN.INI Line: Excel=0x1000
     Problem: Can't get past point where you have to enter a point
              size in the tutorial.
   WordPerfect
     WIN.INI Line: win2wwrs=0x1210
     Problem: Uses a vector font for TmsRmn.

Bit: 2000
---------

Symbolic name:  GACF_ENUMTTNOTDEVICE
Meaning: Turns off DEVICE_FONTTYPE. Some apps fail to enumerate more
        that one size of true type fonts because they interpret the
        DEVICE_FONTTYPE flag incorrectly. They assume the font must
        be device resident and disregard the case where the font is
        downloaded (as TT can be).  Therefore, when TT is correctly
        enumerated with the device bit set, the apps check the device
        capabilities to see if the printer can scale fonts. If the
        device cannot, the app assumes one size of for the current
        font. This problem is not seen on postscript printers which
        can download and scale fonts, nor on dot matrix printers
        which cannot download fonts. This Compatibility bit simply
        checks all the above conditions and selectively turns the
        DEVICE_FONTTYPE off.
Apps:
   Pagemaker 4.0
     WIN.INI Line: pm4=0x2000
     Problem: Not all point sizes listed for some printers.
   Designer 3.1
     WIN.INI Line: designer=0x2000
     Problem: Font size reverts to 6 point when selecting a TT font
              in the font dialog.
   Ascend 3.1
     WIN.INI Line: planner=0x2000
     Problem: TT fonts only allow one point size.
   MGXDraw 3.0
     WIN.INI Line: draw=0x2000
     Problem: Shows no font sizes for TT fonts.
   AccPack
     WIN.INI Line: winsim=0x2000
     Problem: Lists only one point size for TT fonts.
   Charisma
     WIN.INI Line: charisma=0x2000
     Problem: Not all point sizes listed for some printers.
   Persuasion
     WIN.INI Line: pr2=0x2000
     Problem: Lists only one point size for TT fonts.
   Just Write
     WIN.INI Line: jw=0x42080
     Problem: Lists only one or two point sizes for TT fonts.

Bit: 4000
---------

Symbolic name:  GACF_SUBTRACTCLIPSIBS
Meaning:  This flag affects the way window invalidation works for non-
         WS_CLIPSIBLINGS parent windows and their children (e.g.,
         dialog boxes and dialog controls). Normally, if two
         children of a non-WS_CLIPSIBLING parent overlap, and an area
         that contains both of those windows is invalidated (either
         by a call to InvalidateRect or through window
         rearrangement), both of the windows will get invalidated,
         even if one or both is WS_CLIPSIBLINGS. With
         GACF_SUBTRACTCLIPSIBS, any sibling window underneath a
         WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window will not be invalidated in the part
         of the window that is beneath the WS_CLIPSIBLINGS window.
         This situation arises most commonly when windows that are
         supposed to appear overlapped don't seem to overlap
         properly. Applications that implement drop down combo boxes
         as child windows of dialog boxes will exhibit this problem
         (e.g., Lotus Notes 2.1 drive drop downs). It's often hard to
         tell whether a drop down is implemented as a top-level
         window (e.g., the Windows system combo boxes) or as a child
         window -- if there seem to be overlapping problems, then
         GACF_SUBTRACTCLIPSIBS could be the solution.
Apps:
   Lotus Notes 2.0 &amp; 1
     WIN.INI Line: _BNOTES=0x24000
     Problem: Pull down drive list box pops down behind a list box
              which is already on the screen.
   Ingress
     WIN.INI Lines: wagl=0x4000
                    waglr=0x4000
     Problem: Overlapping child controls.

Bit: 8000
---------

Symbolic name: GACF_FORCETTGRAPHICS
Meaning:
Apps:
   Freelance
     WIN.INI Line: rem=0x8022
     Problem: Freelance wouldn't print TT unless print TT as graphics
              was selected.

Bit: 10000
----------

Symbolic name: GACF_NOHRGN1
Meaning:  This bit affects applications that depend on a bug in the
         3.0 GetUpdateRect() function. Under 3.0, GetUpdateRect
         would not always return the rectangle in logical DC
         coordinates: if the entire window was invalid, the rectangle
         was sometimes returned in window coordinates. This bug was
         fixed for 3.0 and 3.1 apps in Windows 3.1: coordinates are
         ALWAYS returned in logical coordinates. This bit re-
         introduces the bug in GetUpdateRect(), for those
         applications that depend on this behavior.
Apps:
   MSDraw
     WIN.INI Line: ED=0x00010000
     Problem: Canvas not redrawn properly opening specific MSDraw
              objects in Winword.

Bit: 20000
----------

Symbolic name: GACF_NCCALCSIZEONMOVE
Meaning: 3.1 optimized WM_NCCALCSIZE if a window was just moving,
        where 3.0 always sent it. This bit causes it to be sent
        always, as in 3.0.
Apps:
   Lotus Notes
     WIN.INI Line: _BNOTES=0x24000
     Problem: Navigator bar of window fails to redraw when the window
              is moved across the desktop.

Bit: 40000
----------

Symbolic name: GACF_SENDMENUDBLCLK
Meaning: Passes double-clicks on a menu bar on to the app. With this
        bit set, if the user double clicks on the menu bar when a
        menu is visible, we end processing of the menu and pass the
        double click message on to the application. This allows Just
        Write to detect double click on the system menu of a
        maximized MDI child.    The normal (and expected) behavior is
        for Windows to detect the double click on a sys menu of a
        maximized child and send the app a WM_SYSCOMMAND SC_CLOSE
        message which is what happens with a non-maximized MDI child
        window.
Apps:
   Just Write
     WIN.INI Line: JW=0x00042080
     Problem: Sub-editors (such as footer and header editors)
              couldn't be closed by double-clicking the system menu.

Bit: 80000
----------

Symbolic name: GACF_30AVGWIDTH
Meaning: Changed the way we calculate avg width, this fixes it for
        postscript. Scale all fonts by 7/8. This flag has been
        added for TurboTax for printing with pscript driver. Turbo
        Tax has hard coded average width it uses for selecting fonts.
        Since we changed the way we calculate avg width to match what
        is in TT, Turbo Tax is broken.
Apps:
   TurboTax
     WIN.INI Line: turbotax=0x80000
     Problem: 1040 tax forms wouldn't print correctly.

If a third party vendor fixes the problems in their application, they can
recompile it so that it requires Windows 3.1; the compatibility bits will not be
used. If the third party vedor wants their application to run under Winodws 3.0
and 3.1, then they can change the module name or edit the WIN.INI.
