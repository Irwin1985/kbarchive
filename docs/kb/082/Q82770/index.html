SUMMARY
=======

When a Setup error message contains an error code, it also includes some text
indicating what Setup was trying to do, for example, copying a file. The text of
the error message indicates whether the error is fatal or not. In some non-fatal
cases, Setup may be performing an operation (such as copying a file) that is
needed in order to run Windows. Other times the error may prevent some specific
feature of Windows from operating properly.

In many cases, the error code is an MS-DOS extended error code. These error codes
are between 0 and 100. Setup-specific error codes have two different formats,
depending on whether the error occurs during the character (MS-DOS) mode or the
Windows graphical user interface (GUI) mode portion of Setup. The character mode
Setup-specific error numbers are in the format "Snnn", where "nnn" is any three
digits. The GUI mode error numbers have codes greater than 200.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Character Mode Setup Error Codes
--------------------------------

  S001

  Could not open SETUP.INF. SETUP.INF should reside on the first Windows Setup
  disk for first-time installations or upgrades and should reside in the
  WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory when Setup is used to change the system
  configuration after Windows has been set up. If you are changing the
  configuration, make sure SETUP.INF does not exist in the WINDOWS directory
  and copy SETUP.INF from the first Windows Setup disk to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
  subdirectory and try again. If it is a first-time installation or upgrade,
  make sure to set the current drive and directory to the location of the Setup
  program and then run Setup from the MS-DOS prompt.

  S002

  Could not load SETUP.INF. Usually due to lack of memory. May also be due to a
  corrupt SETUP.INF. Should not occur during a first-time installation or
  upgrade. After making sure that there is enough memory, follow the
  instructions for S001.

  S004

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [winexec].krnl386. Should not occur during
  first-time installation or upgrade. Setup has probably found an invalid
  SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S005

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [winexec].krnl286. Setup has probably found an
  invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S006

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [winexec].dosx. Setup has probably found an
  invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S007

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [special_adapter].cdrom. Setup has probably
  found an invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for
  S001.

  S008

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [winexec].exechimem. Setup has probably found
  an invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S009

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [winexec].himemcmd. Setup has probably found an
  invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S010

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [data].welcome. Setup has probably found an
  invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S012

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [machine] &lt;line&gt;. Setup has probably
  found an invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for
  S001.

  S013

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [machine] &lt;line&gt;. Setup has probably
  found an invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for
  S001.

  S014

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [winexec].execstd. Setup has probably found an
  invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S015

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [winexec].execcmd. Setup has probably found an
  invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S016

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [user] section. Setup has probably found an
  invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S017

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [user] section empty. Setup has probably found
  an invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for S001.

  S018

  Entry not found in SETUP.INF: [user] section corrupt. Setup has probably
  found an invalid SETUP.INF on the user's system. Follow the instructions for
  S001.

  S019

  WIN.COM not created. This may be due to missing files, a bad SETUP.INF or
  OEMSETUP.INF, lack of disk space, or an inability to create or modify the
  WIN.COM file. When you first install Windows or change display drivers, Setup
  creates the file WIN.COM from the file WIN.CNF and displays the dependent
  logo files, usually named *.lgo and *.rle. The logo files are specified in
  the .INF file for the chosen display.

  Make sure you do not have virus-protection software that does not allow
  executables to be modified. Try changing the display after exiting Windows
  and running Setup from the MS-DOS prompt. If you are selecting an original
  equipment manufacturer (OEM) display, try one of the display drivers that are
  shipped with Windows 3.1 to see if the OEMSETUP.INF file is not valid or if
  it specifies files that do not exist. If selecting a supplied display driver
  does not work, make sure the SETUP.INF file is valid (see error S001 above).

  S020

  SYSTEM.INI was not correctly updated. This will occur when attempting to
  configure Windows with a new device or for a new system software
  configuration. The main reason for this problem occurring is lack of memory
  or a corrupt SYSTEM.INI file. It is also possible to get this error because
  of a corrupt .INF file. Make sure there is enough memory and that the
  SYSTEM.INI file is of a reasonable size (not much more than 5K) and try the
  operation again. Try selecting a different component (for example, select No
  Network instead of the network selected or select VGA instead of the display
  that is selected). If this succeeds, copy the SYSTEM.INI file to a backup
  disk and try again. If not, the SYSTEM.INI or SETUP.INF file is probably
  corrupted.

  S021

  SYSTEM.INI was not correctly updated. See S020 above.

  S022

  Setup did not save its state in the SYSTEM.INI file. This is due to either
  insufficient memory or a corrupt SYSTEM.INI file.
