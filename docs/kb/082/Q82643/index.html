SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows version 3.1, Terminal and other Windows communications
applications work as described in the following paragraphs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Applications open and initialize an available communications port using the
  standard Windows application program interface (API). Windows keeps track of
  what ports are in use by other applications, and will return an error code if
  a requested port is already in use.

  Windows applications do not need to know how to access specific types of
  communications hardware; this is handled in a device independent fashion by
  the communications API and driver.

  Windows applications can select bit rates up to 57.6 kilobits per second
  (Kbps) via the communications API.

2. Windows applications send/receive data to/from the COM port using the
  standard Windows API documented in the SDK.

  To service active port connections, Windows applications should set a timer or
  use the EnableCommNotification() API. EnableCommNotification() will send a
  window message to the application when data buffers are filled or empty. This
  prevents the application from unnecessarily clogging the system when waiting
  for data transmissions. Applications should NOT rely on PeekMessage() when
  servicing open ports.

3. Windows sends/receives application data to/from the communications driver
  (COMM.DRV). In Windows 3.1, the data is sent and received between Windows and
  the driver in blocks, rather than individual characters. This reduces
  transmission overhead and improves performance. Windows 3.00 used individual
  characters.

4. The communications driver sends/receives data to/from the COM port. The COM
  driver supports 8250 compatible universal asynchronous receiver transmitters
  (UARTs). Also, the Windows 3.1 COM driver enables the FIFO buffer of 16550A
  compatible UARTs in order to reduce interrupt overhead and improve data
  throughput. Special communications devices may require a replacement
  communications driver to support extra features or a different hardware
  interface.

5. In enhanced mode, the virtual communications device (VCD) virtualizes COM
  port hardware to arbitrate access by multiple applications. The VCD notifies
  virtual machines (VMs) when their COM ports require servicing.

  In enhanced mode, COMBUFF buffers data between the communications driver and
  physical port. This prevents multitasking applications from losing data when
  they do not currently have CPU time.

6. Finally, data is received and transmitted by the physical COM port to/from
  the attached device (for example, modem, direct connection, fax card, and so
  on.). Some COM ports have onboard data buffers, such as those using the
  16550A UART, to improve communications throughput and reduce errors.
