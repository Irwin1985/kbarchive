2. Click Organize Folders.

4. Now click Archived Mail and select each e-mail that you want to keep.

5. Click the Put in Folder button and select the new folder you just created.

6. Quit MSN Explorer

To locate the folders.dbx file, you must first adjust your computer's settings so

4. Select the first file in the Name list, click File on the main menu, and then
  click Open Containing Folder.
  A new window should opens displaying all files in the folder.

5. Right-click the file named folders.dbx.

6. Rename the file "folders.dbx.old" (without the quotes).

7. Click x in the upper-right corner to close the folder. Note: you may have to
  repeat steps 4 through 6 if more than one hotmail.ini file appears.
  This can happen if you have uninstalled MSN Explorer or if the you have

8. Sign in to MSN Explorer and click the E-mail button.
  MSN Explorer will re-synchronize all of your folders with the folders that are
  stored on the MSN Explorer server.

Mail Folder

1. Start MSN Explorer and sign on.

2. Once on the Home page, click the E-mail icon.

3. Click Organize Folders.

4. Click the temporary folder to which you moved all your archived to, and then
  select all e-mails that you wish to move to the Archived Mail folder.
