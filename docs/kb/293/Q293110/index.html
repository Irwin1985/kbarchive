SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Internet Standards and Protocols, ISBN
1-57231-692-6.

The following topics are covered:

- Page 96: UTF-8 Clarification

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 96: UTF-8 Clarification
----------------------------

On page 96, under the section titled UTF-8, the following corrections can be made
to the first paragraph.

Change:
"Universal Transformation Format, 8-bit form (UTF-8) converts a 16-bit Unicode
character into a series of from 2 to 5 bytes, with the lead byte detailing how
many bytes follow. The number of bytes depends on the value of the particular
Unicode character, and all characters with ASCII values (from 0 through 127) are
represented in a single byte following the lead byte. UTF-8 is considered fairly
efficient, but when searching for a particular character in the middle of a byte
stream, one might have to parse backward up to 4 bytes in order to find the
start of a character. UTF-8 is also reversible (just like UTF-7); the original
Unicode data can be obtained by doing a reverse transformation."

To:
"Universal Transformation Format, 8-bit form (UTF-8) converts a 31-bit ISO 10646
character into a series of from 1 to 6 bytes, with the lead byte detailing how
many bytes follow. The number of bytes depends on the value of the particular
ISO 10646 character, and all characters with ASCII values (from 0 through 127)
are represented in a single byte following the lead byte. UTF-8 is considered
fairly efficient, but when searching for a particular character in the middle of
a byte stream, one might have to parse backward up to 5 bytes in order to find
the start of a character. UTF-8 is also reversible (just like UTF-7); the
original ISO 10646 data can be obtained by doing a reverse transformation."


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
