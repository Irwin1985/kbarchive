-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Terminal Server Administration (Tsadmin.exe) to view all computers
running Terminal Server, you may experience slow network performance. The server
running Tsadmin.exe may also be unresponsive for short periods of time.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the view in Terminal Server Administration is
refreshed every five seconds by default. Network problems can occur because of
the amount of traffic that is generated when the view is refreshed.

For example, Citrix Metaframe clustering creates a virtual connection among
numerous Terminal Server-based computers for load balancing. Terminal
Server-based computers in trusted domains are also visible. The number of
servers in the environment can grow until, for example, dozens of Terminal
Server-based computers are contacted every five seconds.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use any of the following methods:

- Quit Terminal Server Administration when it is not in use.
  Terminal Server Administration is not designed to run continuously. It is
  designed to let administrators view current settings for troubleshooting or
  to take a snapshot of the Terminal Server-based environment.

- Change the detail level for the Terminal Server Administration view.
  On the View menu, click the appropriate view for the level of detail you want.
  For example, if you want to see if all Terminal Server-based computers are
  running, click the "Collapse to Server" view. When you want more detail on a
  server, click the server, and then click the plus sign (+) next to the name
  of the server. To conceal the supporting detail, click the minus sign (-).

- Change the Terminal Server Administration refresh rate:

  1. On the Options menu, click Preferences.

  2. In the Processes List Refresh section, click the appropriate value in the
     "Refresh every n seconds" box, where n represents the number of seconds
     between refreshes.

NOTE: If Tsadmin.exe is running for longer than a snapshot view, set the "Refresh
every n seconds" value to a higher number. Slower networks or slower Terminal
Server-based computers should be set to 30 seconds or higher to avoid the high
volume of network traffic every five seconds.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use Terminal Server Administration to view all of the Terminal
Server-based computers on the network for the current domain and trusted
domains.
