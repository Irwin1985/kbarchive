-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

- The information store service becomes unresponsive. Users are unable to log
  onto mailboxes, and Performance Monitor may show %Processor Utilization for
  Store.exe at 0 percent.

- The directory service becomes unresponsive. Various operations, such as
  resolving a name to a mailbox in the global address list, or checking a name
  during creation of a mailbox profile stop responding (hang) when users
  attempt to perform them. In addition, Performance Monitor may show %Processor
  Utilization for Dsamain.exe at 0 percent.

CAUSE
=====

ESE (Jet) hangs because all threads are waiting to acquire a resource that is
owned by another thread. The decision used by threads as to which resources to
acquire is based in part on a timestamp, and the timestamp comparison is being
performed incorrectly. This incorrect comparison can cause the owning thread not
to release the lock on the resource and leave all threads waiting.

The symptoms noted above are usually dependent on system uptime. Although this
problem is not reproducible, documented cases encountered this problem on
Exchange Server computers running for 30 days or more.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
