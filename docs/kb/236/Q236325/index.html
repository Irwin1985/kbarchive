The following files are available for download from the following Microsoft Web
sites:

NOTE: These downloadable files are Web patches only, and are designed to update
an SMS 2.0 SP1 source.

IMPORTANT: You must have a SP1-applied source directory before you run these
executable files.

- Sms20sp2i.exe: Components of SP2 for Intel-based computers

- Sms20sp2a.exe: Components of SP2 for Alpha-based computers

These files are also available on the following Microsoft Web site, and to locate
them:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/

2. Click Downloads.

3. Within the paragraph description at the top of the Web page, click the
  Download Service Pack link.

Installing SMS 2.0 SP2
----------------------

To install SMS 2.0 SP2:

1. Copy the contents of the Systems Management Server 2.0 SP1 CD-ROM to a local
  folder on the hard disk. For this example, the folder is named SMS20SP2. This
  folder can be created on a local workstation or on your primary site server.
  If you create the folder on the site server, the folder must not share the
  same drive as the SMS site installation. The SMS Setup program does not run
  from the same drive as the site installation.

2. Share the SMS20SP2 folder.

3. Download one of the files that is listed earlier in this article, and then
  copy it into the new SMS20SP2 folder.

4. Open the SMS20SP2 folder, and then double-click the file you downloaded. For
  example, if your computer has an Intel-based processor, you would download
  the Sms20sp2i.exe file, and then double-click that file to start the SMS 2.0
  SP2 Service Pack Wizard.

The file is unzipped to the %Temp% folder. By default, this is the c:\temp
folder. A message stating that the unzip was successful is generated, and the
Service Pack Setup Wizard then starts.

The Service Pack Wizard prompts you to provide the location of the SMS 2.0 SP1
image. If you have not already created the SMS 2.0 SP1 image on a network drive,
the wizard can create one for you. If you have already created the SMS 2.0 SP1
image, select the second option:

"The SMS 2.0 SP1 CD Image is already on a local or network Drive".

Click Browse, and then point to the location of the folder you created in step
1.

NOTE: The SMS 2.0 SP2 Setup program cannot be run from the same drive where SMS
2.0 has been installed. The new SP2 source must be created on a different
drive.

After the wizard finishes, the new SP2 installation source is created. Open the
new SP2 source folder, and then double-click the Autorun.exe file to start the
Setup wizard. Follow the instructions on the screen to upgrade your site to SP2.
