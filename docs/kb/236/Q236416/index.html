- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange Server Replication Service
after you configure the Interorg Replication Utility, you may receive the
following error message:

  Could not start the Exchange Replication Service service on
  \\&lt;Server&gt;.

  Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

The following event is also logged in the Windows NT application log:

  Event ID: 114
  Source: Exchsync
  Type: Error
  Description: Unable to read configuration file [], not a valid configuration
  file or file is corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the installer creates an Exchsync.ini file, and when
a computer has Terminal Services installed, this file is placed in the Windows
folder in the currently logged on user's Profile folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is known to occur when the computer on which the Exchange Server
Replication Service has been installed is also running Terminal Services.

The Exchange Server Replication Service must be installed using the installation
mode in Terminal Services.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the Exchange Server Replication Service has been installed, perform the
following to remove it:

  Open Exssrv.exe on the computer where the Exchange Server Replication Service
  is installed, and click Remove to uninstall the service.

To install using the Terminal Server installation mode, install the application
using one of the following methods:

- In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs and ensure that the "All
  users begin with common application settings" option is selected in the
  Installation wizard.

-or-

- Type a "Change User /Install" (without the quotation marks) command at an
  MS-DOS command prompt.

  NOTE: The command should return "User session is ready to install
  applications."

  1. Run Exssrv.exe again, and click Install to reinstall the service.

  2. After installation has completed, run the following command at the command
     prompt:

  "Change User /Execute" (without the quotation marks)
