IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook user changes the Windows
NT or Windows 2000 password either by clicking "Change Password" in the "Enter
Password" dialog box or on the Tools menu, clicking Options, on the Security
tab, clicking "Change Settings", and then clicking Password, one of the
following error messages is displayed:

  The Windows NT Domain password could not be changed. A required action was
  not successful due to an unspecified error.

  The Windows NT password could not be changed. Please check the information
  and try again.

NOTE: The error messages begin with "The Windows 2000..." when you change a
Windows 2000 password.

CAUSE
=====

The client is not logged on to the domain that the password is changed in, or to
a trusted domain. Therefore, the client cannot establish a remote procedure call
(RPC) connection to the Local Security Authority (LSA) to change the password.

The following clients have this problem:

- Clients that use the NetWare Client software.

For additional information about how NetWare Clients change passwords, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q148420 XCLN: Can't Change Password on Novell Client

- Clients that use Macintosh messaging clients.

For additional information about how Macintosh messaging clients change
passwords, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q156182 XCLN: Changing Windows NT 4.0 Password in Microsoft Exchange

- Clients that use Banyan Vines protocol.

For additional information about Banyan Vines protocol, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140641 Updated Samsrv.dll Supports AppleTalk and Banyan Vines Clients

- Clients that log on to an untrusted Windows NT domain or a workgroup.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: Normally, registry entries are not case sensitive. However, these entries
are case sensitive. When you add any of these new keys, be sure to match the
case exactly.

Add the following registry values to the PDC in a NT Domain or the PDC-Emulator
in a Windows 2000 Domain:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

4. Add one of the following values, depending on which protocol is shared
  between the clients and the PDC:

  NetWareClientSupport

  TCPIPClientSupport

  VinesClientSupport

  AppletalkClientSupport

5. In the Data Type field, select REG_DWORD, and then click OK.

6. In the DWORD editor, in the Data field, type "1" (without the quotation
  marks).

7. Click OK. The new value appears.

8. You must restart the PDC for the changes to take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an Outlook client changes a Windows NT or a Windows 2000 password, the
client asks the Exchange Server computer for the name of the PDC in a NT 4.0
domain or the PDC-Emulator in a Windows 2000 domain. The client then establishes
an RPC connection with the LSA on the PDC or PDC-Emulator.

To locate the server running the PDC-Emulator role use the NETDOM tool from the
Windows Support tools on the Windows 2000 Server CD and execute the following
command.

  "NETDOM QUERY FSMO" (without the quotation marks)

Note the server name listed next to the line labeled PDC Role will be the server
to get the registry values added.

The LSA, by default, has no endpoint mapped for TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, or
Banyan Vines. It does not have this problem with named pipes. Clients that log
on to the same domain as the PDC have no problem making a named pipes connection
and changing their passwords.

This registry change mentioned in the "Resolution" section of this article should
be made on the server running the PDC-Emulator role in a Windows 2000 Domain. If
the Role of the PDC-Emulator moves to another Domain Controller in the Windows
2000 Domain, the registry on the new Domain Controller will need to be updated
with the registry change.
