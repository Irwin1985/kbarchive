-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you log on to two or more network providers, after you successfully log on to
the primary provider, your secondary provider may generate a message that says
you need to change your password. Windows 95 prompts you with a Change Password
dialog box, and then uses the old and new passwords that you provide to
synchronize your updated password on all password providers. After your primary
provider password is updated successfully, you may receive the following error
message:

  Your old password is incorrect. Try typing it again.

Also, this problem may occur even if your old password is correct, and your
secondary provider may have successfully updated your password. However, your
logon to the secondary network provider may be disconnected without any notice
or error message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when password caching has been disabled, and the
Mprserv.dll file has been updated to version 4.00.952-4.00.962.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time    Version      Size            File name 
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  03/23/99  7:20pm  4.0.0.963    126,976 bytes   Mprserv.dll

do so, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base :

  Q137826 Disabling Password Caching and Changing Passwords

  Q140709 How to Cache Your Windows NT Domain Password in Windows 95/98

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem can occur regardless of which network provider is the primary
provider. For example, this problem can occur if your primary logon provider is
set to Novell, and your Microsoft Windows NT domain password has expired. This
problem can also occur if your primary logon provider is a Windows NT domain,
and your Novell password has expired. The third-party products discussed in this
article are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no

reliability.
