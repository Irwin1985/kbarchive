-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Terminal Server user session is validated by a Microsoft Windows NT
4.0-based server domain controller with Service Pack 4 (SP4) applied and
RestrictAnonymous set to 1, your Terminal Server home folder is mapped to the
default location, even though your administrator specified a different path in
User Manager for Domains.

Additionally, when you are validated by the same domain controller, your Terminal
Server profile path points to the default location, even though your
administrator specified a different path in User Manager for Domains.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you apply SP4 to a domain controller that has the
RestrictAnonymous entry added and a value of 1.

Terminal Server attempts to retrieve custom fields from the Security Accounts
Manager (SAM), which is the Terminal Server profile path. When the attempt is
unsuccessful, Terminal Server uses the standard Windows NT profile path.

If you are in a multiple domain model, another cause could be that the "access
this computer from the network" user right is not enabled for Everyone or
Authenticated Users.

Ensure that the user right has the appropriate accounts to access the domain
controllers from the network.

Ensure that the RestrictAnonymous is not set on the resource domains as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA

3. Locate the following entry:

  Value name: RestrictAnonymous
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1

4. Change the value to 0.

5. Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

NOTE: You can also delete the RestrictAnonymous value to work around this
behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.
