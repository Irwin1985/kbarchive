- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

In Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, the default setup for a Web
application is to run as "out-of-process pooled" or medium application
protection. This means that if the application should stop for some reason, IIS
itself is not affected.

Because COM+ must run an out-of-process application with some identity, in the
case of IIS, IWAM_&lt;MACHINE NAME&gt;is used. In IIS 5.0, the IWAM_&lt;MACHINE
NAME&gt; account is a very low privilege account, just as in IIS 4.0. This was
done for security reasons. The side-effect of this is that some ISAPI
applications that require the process account to have localsystem-like
capabilities will fail. The most common are those that use reverttoself() to
perform some highly trusted function. The code following a call to
reverttoself() in an out-of-process application in IIS 5.0 (the default) may
fail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Who is affected?

- If your Web server does not use any custom ISAPI applications, you should not
  be affected.

- Any code that worked correctly in an IIS 4.0 out-of-process application will
  also work in IIS 5.0.

- If you use custom authentication ISAPI applications, you may be affected. The
  errors you may see are based on how the ISAPI application is written.

What should you do?

- If you see no errors, then do nothing. IIS 5.0 is running in its optimal
  configuration.

- If you do see an error and you feel the ISAPI application is the point of
  failure, then try the following:

  1. Run the application in-process. If that works, then contact your ISAPI
     application vendor to see if they have an update that runs out-of-process
     pooled.

  2. Run the application out-of-process and give the IWAM account "Act as part
     of operating system" and "Increase application quota" privileges. If this
     succeeds, then contact the ISAPI application vendor for an updated
     version.

- If you are a developer writing ISAPIs or any functionality relying on
  localsystem after a reverttoself(), then you should start testing your code
  on the released version of Windows 2000 and IIS 5.0.
