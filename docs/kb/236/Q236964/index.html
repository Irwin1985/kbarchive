The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP6 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP6

SYMPTOMS
========

The problem described in this article is difficult to identify. One way to check
for the problem if you suspect you are experiencing it is to calculate the
number of files open on the Window NT-based computer and look at their size. If
you have approximately 180 gigabytes (GB) of open files that are not being
closed continuously or are opened and closed rapidly in a looping condition, you
may be experiencing this problem. Also, your programs may be receiving an
INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES error message when attempting to open, create, or extend
a file.

This problem can be intermittent. If you try the operation again it is possible
for it to succeed. This behavior occurs because it is possible to have a program
create and close files faster than Windows NT can clean up. When this occurs it
is possible for the operation to succeed if retried.

Another method that you can use to identify the problem is to start Task Manager
and click the Performance tab. At the bottom of the tab, locate the Kernel
Memory section and watch the value for Paged Memory. You may experience the
problem when that value reaches approximately 190. If this value goes back down
immediately, you should be able to retry the operation that caused the error
message and have it succeed (if the system has enough resources to fulfill the
program's request).

CAUSE
=====

In Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), optimization was added to the cache
manager and the NTFS file system that allows NTFS to return a FALSE response
when the cache manager tries to acquire a file for "lazy" writing. NTFS does
this when it is in the middle of a clean checkpoint, because clean checkpoints
can take time to finish. This allows the cache manager to move on to other files
on other volumes instead of waiting for the clean checkpoint to finish.

In this case, NTFS needs to free recently deallocated clusters. NTFS does this by
forcing a clean checkpoint. In this particular situation, the cache manager
should wait for the checkpoint to finish instead of moving on to work on other
files, because it is not really a clean checkpoint and should not take very
long.

The solution is not to let NTFS return a FALSE response to the cache manager when
it is performing a clean checkpoint as a result of needing recently deallocated
clusters freed.

RESOLUTION
==========
