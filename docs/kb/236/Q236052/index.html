- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to recover Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
clients when the SMSClient_&lt;SiteCode&gt; account password is changed and the
clients are no longer able to connect to a Client Access Point (CAP) server.

This situation can occur if only one client connection account exists and its
password is changed in User Manager for Domains. Clients store passwords locally
in an encrypted value in the registry. After the password is changed, clients
are unable to connect to the CAP to update their configuration with the new
password.

When you view the Ccim32.log file on the client, the following error message is
displayed:

  Warning - could not read files from site TB1 (#2147942405)
  $$&lt;CCIM32&gt;&lt;Tue Jan 04 15:19:23.375 2000&gt;&lt;thread=112

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the following methods to recover from this situation:

- Run Smsman or Smsls on the client.

- Set the "Site Config Last Checked" registry value.

- Enable the guest account on CAP servers.

NOTE: These methods assume that the currently logged on user does not have local
administrative privileges on the workstation.

Run Smsman.exe or Smsls.bat on the Client
-----------------------------------------

NOTE: You must enable Windows NT Logon Discovery and/or Windows NT Logon
Installation to use this method.

1. You can run Smsman.exe to perform an installation, using either of the
  following methods:

   - Open the \\&lt;LogonPointServer&gt;\smslogon\x86.bin\00000409 folder and
     run Smsman.exe.

   - Open the %WinDir%\MS\SMS\Core\Bin\00000409 folder locally on the client
     computer and run Smsman.exe (if a local copy of Smsman.exe is available,
     you can use it in place of the copy from the logon point server)

2. Uninstall and reinstall the client by running Smsman.exe with the /u switch
  from either of the following locations:

  \\&lt;LogonPointServer&gt;\smslogon\x86.bin\00000409
  %WinDir%\MS\SMS\Core\Bin\00000409

  NOTE: This action uninstalls the client from the site. You can also specify
  the /q switch for quiet mode so no dialog boxes are displayed on the client.

Set the "Site Config Last Checked" Registry Value
-------------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: This method causes the client to consider itself an orphan, which causes
the client to uninstall all SMS components. The next time you run an
installation, the client is reinstalled.

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Locate the following registry key on the client:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Sites\Shared\&lt;SiteCode&gt;

  NOTE: Where &lt;SiteCode&gt; is the three-letter site code for your site.

3. Double-click the Site Config Last Checked value and change the date to
  reflect a value older than 60 days.

4. Stop and start the SMS Client service or restart the workstation.

5. After the client restarts, the SMS components are uninstalled. After this
  process is finished, run an installation method to reinstall the SMS client.

Enable the Guest Account
------------------------

This method uses the Windows NT guest account to connect to the CAP server. When
you use this method, you must enable the guest account for a duration that is
long enough for the clients to attempt a connection to the CAP.

NOTE: Enabling a guest account creates potential security issues that you should
carefully consider in your environment. Configure the guest account to have
access to the CAP servers for only the minimum duration necessary so the SMS
clients can retrieve the new client connection account information and reinstall
themselves to the site.

1. Make sure that another client connection account is created in User Manager
  for Domains and added in the SMS Administrator console under Site
  Settings|Connection Accounts|Client. For additional information, click the
  article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q237759 SMS: Avoiding Client Lockouts When Using Client Connection Accounts

2. Delete the current SMSClient&lt;SiteCode&gt; account to which the clients
  cannot connect from User Manager for Domains and from the SMS Administrator
  console.

3. Enable the guest account on the domain if you have any CAPs that are located
  on domain controllers, and then place the guest account in the Domain Users
  group to give that account appropriate permissions to the CAP.

4. Enable the guest account for each member server on which a CAP is located.
  Place the guest account in the Local Users group on the member server.

5. Disable the guest account after all clients have connected and updated their
  connection account information.

In SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), the only time you are unable to recover an
orphaned client with logon, is if the client is orphaned and you upgrade the
client's site. In this situation, the client runs the logon script, detects that
it needs to be upgraded, and stops the process (typically waiting until CCIM
hits the CAP). In this situation, the client either has to wait 60 days before
it uninstalls itself, or must use another method.

If the site and client are already upgraded to SP2, you can recover an orphaned
client using the same methods in SP1.
