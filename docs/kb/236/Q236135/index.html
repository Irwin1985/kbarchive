IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

The password change DLL has been updated to implement a retry mechanism if it is
unable to contact the master Windows NT Password Synchronization service.

When you use the SNA Server Host Security feature to synchronize passwords
between a host and a Windows NT domain, the password change DLL (Snapwchg.dll)
is responsible for intercepting password changes made to Windows NT accounts in
its Windows NT domain and passing them on to the Windows NT Password
Synchronization (SNAPMP) service.

In multiple domain environments, the password change DLL and the master (primary)
SNAPMP service may reside on primary domain controllers (PDCs) in different
Windows NT domains. In environments such as these, password changes will be lost
if the password change DLL is unable to contact the master SNAPMP service
running on the PDC in the other Windows NT domain.

The password change DLL is not designed to provide any type of retry mechanism if
it fails to communicate with the SNAPMP service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the update, the password change DLL writes all password change
notifications it intercepts into a memory queue. After the password change
notification is written to the memory queue, the dispatch thread of password
change DLL dequeues the first password change notification and immediately
attempts to contact the SNAPMP service to propagate it. If the SNAPMP service
cannot be contacted, the password change DLL attempts to send the password
change notification stored in the memory buffer a total of five times. The
initial attempt, is then followed by up to four retries. The password change DLL
stops retrying if the total retry time exceeds five minutes. The actual interval
between retries may vary depending on specific network situations.

In addition, the password change notifications are written to an encrypted file
if the five attempts to contact the SNAPMP from the memory buffer fail or if the
retry time exceeds five minutes. If the message queue file is enabled, the
password change DLL attempts to contact the SNAPMP service every five minutes to
propagate the password changes that are queued in the file. The password change
DLL only attempts to send the password change notification once for each
five-minute period. After a password change notification is successfully sent to
the SNAPMP service from the message queue file, the next password change
notification in the message queue file is sent immediately and it is attempted
up to five times. It is not resent for another five minutes if the fifth attempt
fails or if the maximum retry time of five minutes is exceeded.

The following registry entry is used to specify the path and name of the
encrypted file that the password changes messages will be written to.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNA Server
  \CurrentVersion\HostSecurity\PasswordChange

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: MsgQueFileName
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  Value: &lt;path\filename&gt;

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: The message queue file can be located in any path on the local computer
running Windows NT Server and can have any valid file name. However, it is
recommended that the file be located in the folder where the SNA Server Host
Security software is installed. For example, if the host security software is
installed in the C:\Hostsec folder, the recommended location and name of the
message queue file is:

  C:\HostSec\HSSystem\SnaMsgQueFile

If the path and file name in the registry is incorrect, the password change
notifications will only be queued in the memory queue.

The following registry entry has to be added to disable the use of the message
queue file:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNA Server
  \CurrentVersion\HostSecurity\PasswordChange

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: MsgQueFileWriteToFile
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 0

4. Quit Registry Editor.

If a message queue file is not used, the password change notifications are
discarded after the fifth attempt to contact the SNAPMP service from the memory
buffer.

The following are some other items related to this new retry functionality:

- The memory buffer queue can contain a maximum of 1000 password change
  notifications. The message file queue can contain a maximum of 10,000
  password change notifications. The queue sizes are not configurable at this
  time.

- If a new password change notification arrives when either the memory buffer
  or message queue file is full, the new password change notification is
  discarded, and one of the following events is logged in the application event
  log:

  Event ID: 668
  Source: SNA Host Security
  Description: Password Change DLL -- The message queue file is full.

  Event ID: 676
  Source: SNA Host Security
  Description: Password Change DLL -- The memory password change message queue
  is full.

- Before writing a password change notification to the message queue file, the
  password change DLL searches the message queue file for a notification with
  the same user name and replaces the old password change message with the new
  one if a previous entry is found.

- After a password change notification fails to be propagated to the SNAPMP
  service, all subsequent password change notifications are appended to the end
  of the message queue file. The password change DLL does not propagate
  password change notifications from the memory buffer until all pending
  password change notifications in the message queue file are successfully sent
  to the SNAPMP service.

- The message queue file is encrypted using 128-bit encryption.

- The password change DLL tries to verify the integrity of the encrypted
  message queue file when the DLL is initialized. If, for some reason, the
  encrypted message queue file is corrupted, memory-only message dispatch is
  used. Deleting the corrupted message queue file and restarting the system
  results in a new message queue file being created.

This feature is available in the latest service pack for SNA Server version 4.0.
