The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An APPC Transaction Program configured to run on SNA Server may receive a BIND
from the Host indicating support for the Already Verified (AV) and Persistent
Verification (PV) in the BIND Security Support Indicators.

During subsequent conversation processing, if the Transaction Program changes
conversation security from AP_NONE to AP_SAME in subsequent ALLOCATES, the APPC
session may fail with a Primary Return Code : 0003 (AP_ALLOCATION_ERROR),
Secondary Return Code : 080F6051 (AP_SECURITY_NOT_VALID), and the following
event may be logged in the Windows NT Application Log:

  Event ID: 63
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: Incorrect password received from client for logged on user.
  EXPLANATION
  An invalid password was specified for a signed-on PV user (user ID: user).
  This password will be forwarded to the host to verify. If the password has
  changed, then the host will accept the new password, and the conversation
  will continue without persistent verification.
  ACTION
  If host rejects password, then check password, and try again.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server fails to correctly implement user credential manipulation when the
APPC conversation security is changed between ALLOCATE verbs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2. This problem was first
corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is that when both AV and PV are specified, SNA Server treats the
message as a hybrid of both.

In the APPC library, the password is stripped out because it is AV. In the SNA
Server, as a result of the issue discussed in the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base article:

  Q222121 Enhanced Security When Using Persistent Verification

the Attach is rejected because SNA Server thinks it is PV, but there is no
password. SNA Server rejects the Attach by stripping out the security indicator
and letting the Host deal with it. The correct behavior when the Host accepts AV
and PV, and the application specifies security=AP_SAME, is specified in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q180866 Persistent Verification Support for APPC Sessions

Namely, if SNA Server doesn't recognize that the user is signed on to the Host,
it sends an Attach with the AV bit set and the PV bits set to "sign-on
requested." The Attach does not include a password. If SNA Server recognizes the
user as signed on, SNA Server sends an Attach with the AV bit set and the PV
bits set to "already signed on." Again, the Attach doesn't include a password.
