The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT users or groups that have been assigned Read (View Only) rights to
the SNA Server Configuration file (Com.cfg) by SNA Server Manager may still be
able to perform the following functions:

- Update and save changes to the SNA Server configuration.
- Start and Stop SNA Server services.

NOTE: SNA Server Manager indicates that it is opened with "View Only" mode in the
lower right-hand corner of the Manager status line when it is opened by one of
these users.

These users can also use the SNA Server Command Line Configuration utility
(Snacfg.exe) to make changes to the SNA Server configuration.

Users and groups with Read (View Only) permissions are only supposed to be able
to view (or read) the SNA Server configuration using SNA Server Manager or
Snacfg.exe.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Manager components do not correctly check security settings to
prevent users from getting Read/Write access to the SNA Server configuration
file.

This problem occurs when the Windows NT users or groups that have been assigned
Read (View Only) rights for SNA Server administration also have the "Manage
auditing and security log" user right assigned to them in Windows NT User
Manager for Domains.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


SNA Server 3.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+-----------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time    | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Snaadmin.dll | 06/29/99 | 12:06PM | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Snacfg.dll   | 06/29/99 | 12:05PM | 
+-----------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

Remove the "Manage auditing and security log" user right from the users or
groups that are assigned Read (View Only) permissions for the SNA Server
configuration file.
