The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to remotely control a Systems Management Server (SMS) client, you
may be unable to successfully use the mouse in the session, or you may be unable
to remotely control the computer at all. The client
%windir%\MS\SMS\Logs\Remctrl.log file may contain the following entry:

  

  ...
  ********** RCSvcs - Starting Remote Control Services Manager **********  &gt;
  RCSvcs:  Commanded to Install NT5 Device Drivers. Loaded SetupAPI.DLL and
  all function pointers to NT 5.0 DDK Setup API.  
  RCSvcs - Installation of NT 5.0 device drivers starting.  
  RCSvcs - Could not create new Device Info Structure. Not installing Mouse device driver.  
  Creating and Starting Win32 Remote Control Agent Service.
  ...

NOTE: In some cases, the Remote Control component may display an Installed or
Repair Pending status. The key indicator to determine if you have this problem
is to review the Remctrl.log file.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can be caused by either of the following conditions:

- The "Load and Unload Device Drivers" user right has not been granted to the
  SMSCliToknAcct (for member servers or workstations) or the
  SMS&amp;_&lt;domain controller name&gt; account on domain controllers.

- Some of the rights and permissions were not migrated to a Microsoft Windows
  2000 Group Policy during the upgrade process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use the appropriate method.

Add User Rights
---------------

- If the affected client is on a Microsoft Windows NT-based computer, ensure
  that SMSCliToknAcct has the "Load and Unload Device Drivers" right in User
  Manager.

- If the affected client is on a Windows 2000-based computer, review Group
  Policy settings, and ensure that SMSCliToknAcct is defined as a user that has
  the right to "Load and Unload Device Drivers". Alternatively, you could set
  the Group Policies back to the default setting of "Not defined" for the "Load
  and Unload Device Drivers" user right which would also allow SMSCliToknAcct
  to install the SMS virtual mouse.

NOTE: If you are attempting to install the SMS client on domain controllers,
substitute SMSCliToknAcct with SMS&amp;_&lt;domain controller name&gt; in the
previous steps. Also, note that both the SMSCliToknAcct and SMS&amp;_&lt;domain
controller name&gt; accounts are members of the SMSInternalCliGrp. As such, the
option of granting rights to the SMSInternalCliGrp instead of individual
accounts is available.

Permissions Not Migrated
