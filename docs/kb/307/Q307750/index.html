-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 End User Client may not function properly
after you run the SNA Resource Location Wizard to make a configuration change to
the End User Client.

Symptoms may vary but may include the following:

- Failure to connect to an HIS 2000 or SNA Server system to obtain a host
  session after making a configuration change.

- Configuration changes made in the SNA Resource Location Wizard revert back to
  their previous settings.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Resource Location Wizard incorrectly sets the following registry entry
to a NULL value under some circumstances:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNA
  Server\CurrentVersion\Setup:FinalXID

WORKAROUND
==========

You can correct this problem by running the SNA Resource Location Wizard in
Admin mode from a command prompt by using the following syntax, as documented in
the HIS 2000 Readme.doc:

  "HICLICFG /a" (without the quotation marks)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example scenario of the problem described in this article:

1. Use the SNA Resource Location Wizard to configure the End-User Client to
  Locate servers using Active Directory.

2. Stop SnaBase.exe (if it is running).

3. Use the SNA Resource Location Wizard to configure the End-User Client to
  Locate servers using a Subdomain.

4. In the Locate Servers dialog box, select Locate servers by Server Name.

5. Type one or more server names for the sponsor servers in the Locate servers
  by Server Name dialog box.

6. Finish the configuration and close the Wizard.

7. Start SnaBase.exe and note that Active Directory is still being used to
  locate HIS 2000 servers.

In this example, the configuration change was not implemented when you used the
SNA Resource Location Wizard in non-Admin mode because the FinalXID registry
entry was incorrectly set to a NULL value. If the FinalXID registry entry was
correctly defined by the SNA Resource Location Wizard, the configuration change
would have taken effect.

NOTE: The FinalXID registry entry was not supposed to be modified by using the
steps outlined here, but its value affects whether other configuration changes
are saved.
