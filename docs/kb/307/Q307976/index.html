-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FrontPage 2002 
- FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions from Microsoft 
- Microsoft FrontPage 2000 
- FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions from Microsoft 
- Microsoft Visual InterDev, versions 1.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the FrontPage client to connect to a Web site or to publish
a Web site, you receive the following error message, and the Web site is not
opened:

  The Web server at &lt;http://address&gt; does not appear to have the
  FrontPage server extensions installed.

where &lt;http://address&gt; is a server having the following configuration:

- The server is running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).
- The FrontPage Server Extensions are installed on the server.
- The URLScan utility is installed.

CAUSE
=====

When you install the URLScan utility, the Urlscan.ini file that lists default
settings is installed. The default settings deny requests from FrontPage to
access the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the FrontPage Server Extensions if you edit the settings in the
Urlscan.ini file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Locate the Urlscan.ini file in Windows Explorer. By default, this file is
  created in the following folder:

  &lt;Drive&gt;:\WINNT\System32\Inetsrv\urlscan

  where &lt;Drive&gt; represents the drive letter of your hard disk.

2. Create a copy of the file and name it Urlscan.old.

3. In Notepad, open the original copy of the Urlscan.ini file.


4. Locate the [Options] section. Change the AllowDotInPath=0 setting to
  AllowDotInPath=1.

5. Locate the [AllowVerbs] section. Change the ;OPTIONS verb to OPTIONS.
  (Removing the semicolon uncomments the line.)

  NOTE: If URLScan 2.1 is installed, you do not need to make this change. This
  was corrected in URLScan 2.1. URLScan 2.1 is available at the following
  Microsoft web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/security

  If you have URLScan 2.0, you need to make this change. Version 2.0 is included
  on the compact disc.

6. Save the file to replace the original.

7. Stop and restart IIS services.

For additional information about how to restart IIS services, click the article
numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q185382 How to Manually Stop or Start the Inetinfo Process

  Q236166 Using NET STOP and NET START Commands to Force IIS Services to
  Re-Read the Registry

  Q202013 Internet Information Services 5.0 Command-Line Syntax for
  Iisreset.exe

8. Test the ability to connect with FrontPage.

If you encounter further difficulties with other IIS functionality while URLScan
is running, set EnableLogging=1 in the [Options] section of Urlscan.ini and then
restart IIS. If any errors occur, check the last entries in the Urlscan.log file
for information about what requests are being rejected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

URLScan protects your server from attacks by turning off functionality that is
not being used by the server. The default settings in the Urlscan.ini file,
included in the downloadable file, assume that the server is serving only Active
Server Pages (ASP) and static content, such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
pages and images. It also assumes that you are not using the following
technologies:

- CGI (.exe) executables
- WebDAV
- Index Server
- Internet or HTTP-based printing
- Server Side Includes (SSI)

If you need to use any of these technologies, you will need to change the
Urlscan.ini file accordingly.

article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q307608 INFO: Availability of URLScan Version 2.5 Security Tool

  Q309394 HOW TO: Use URLScan with FrontPage 2000

Other Settings That May Affect FrontPage:


- Specifying an AlternateServerName prevents FrontPage from connecting or
  publishing, even if it is configured to return the actual Web server name.

- Setting RemoveServerHeader=1 also prevents FrontPage from connecting or
  publishing.

- For the CGI-based FrontPage Hit Counter Web component to function, you need
  to enable the use of files with the .exe extension in the Urlscan.ini file.
  Because this allows other CGI applications to execute as well, the
  administrator should consider using an ISAPI or ASP-based hit counter. For
  additional information about using an ASP-based hit counter with FrontPage,
  click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q309008 HOW TO: Use the ASP PageCounter Component in FrontPage 2000

  To allow requests for files with the .exe extension, set one of the following
  configurations:

   - If you set UseAllowExtensions=0, then comment out or remove .exe from the
     [DenyExtensions] section of the Urlscan.ini file.

     -or-

   - If you set UseAllowExtensions=1, then add .exe to the [AllowExtensions]
     section of the Urlscan.ini file.

- Setting AllowLateScanning=1 loads URLScan as a low priority filter. This
  allows URLScan to be loaded below the FrontPage down-level compatability
  filter, Fpexedll.dll.
