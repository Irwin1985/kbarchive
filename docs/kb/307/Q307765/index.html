SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot and diagnose remote procedure call
(RPC) error messages.

You may encounter any one of the following symptoms:

- When you open Event Viewer or any program that relies on RPC, you receive the
  following error message:

  RPC is too busy to complete the transaction

- The computer is very slow to log on to or off from.

- You cannot ping the server from the network.

- RPC-related requests fail.

These symptoms continue to occur even after you apply the RPCrt4.dll hotfix that
is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q277776 Services Access Violation Because of Heap Damage

MORE INFORMATION
================

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Follow the directions in the "Troubleshooting RPC" section in the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q197814 HOWTO: Troubleshoot RPC Errors

2. Disable all third-party services.

3. Attempt to ping the computer from the network.

4. Attempt to open Event Viewer, or the Control Panel Services program.

If you cannot successfully complete each of these steps, an invalid string entry
in the SRVCOMMENT value may exist.

This registry value is not present by default; the key and value may be added by
any service and the added values are not recognized by the operating system
until the next reboot, which is typically when this behavior is first noticed.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters

3. On the Security menu, click Permissions. Make sure that the Everyone group
  has only read-only permissions, check for any other accounts other than
  System and set those to read only, and then click OK.

4. Open the value and make sure that a valid character exists. Also, check by
  backspacing across any entry to find out if a valid character or empty field
  is in the string. This string can be an empty string. By following these
  steps, you can monitor event logging to capture the failed write attempt by a
  third-party program.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. Restart the computer.

Sample Registry Values
----------------------

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters
   "NullSessionPipes"=hex(7):43,4f,4d,4e,41,50,00,43,4f,4d,4e,4f,44,45,
  00,53,51,4c,5c,51,55,45,52,59,00,53,50,4f,4f,4c,53,53,00,4c,4c,53,52,50,43,
  00,45,50,4d,41,50,50,45,52,00,4c,4f,43,41,54,4f,52,00,00,61,6c,65,72,74,
  6d,61,6e,61,67,65,72,00,00
   "NullSessionShares"=hex(7):43,4f,4d,43,46,47,00,44,46,53,24,00,00
   "Size"=dword:00000003
   "Lmannounce"=dword:00000000
   "IRPStackSize"=dword:00000007
   "CachedOpenLimit"=dword:00000000
   "srvcomment""" &lt;&lt;== THIS VALUE IS NOT INSTALLED BY DEFAULT

Notes:

NullSessionShares

  The hex value varies depending on the configuration of the server or third-
  party programs that are installed. The registry sample represents what may be
  in the strings value, but is not true for all configurations.

"SRVCOMMENT"

  The /SRVCOMMENT:"text" section is a descriptive comment about the server. The
  comment can have as many as 48 characters. Enclose the text in quotation
  marks.

Additional Troubleshooting Information:

In troubleshooting this symptom, you would typically want to save the specified
registry key by exporting the key. In this scenario, if you do not have a tape
backup of the entire registry, you will not be able to import the key to
reproduce the issue after testing.

A tape backup copies the registry and keeps all malformed characters intact,
whereas exporting the registry key from another source allows the value to be
corrected to a valid character.

When you troubleshoot this issue, navigate to the specified registry location. In
the default view in Registry Editor, you may observe that the string value for
SRVCOMMENT seems to be only an open quote followed by a closed quote. No value
appears to be specified.

When you double-click the SRVCOMMENT key, you access the string editor, and it is
at this point the malformed character in the string may become visible.
