Introduction
------------

The Microsoft Jet database engine is used by a wide variety of applications so it
is possible that an application installation, or, more likely, an application
uninstallation could adversely affect other applications on your computer. This
article details steps you can take to make sure that Microsoft Jet is correctly
installed on your computer.

The document is divided into three sections, (a) Troubleshooting the Access
Method, which covers making sure the DAO, ADO, and ODBC drivers are installed
correctly, (b) Troubleshooting Microsoft Jet, which covers the Jet DLLs and
registry settings, and (c) Resource Data, which lists registry keys that would
make the body of the article difficult to read.

Please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for a continuation of
this article, which includes Part C, the Resource Data:

  Q245524 HOWTO: Ensure Jet 3.5 Is Installed Correctly (Part II)

Troubleshooting the Access Method
---------------------------------

Before troubleshooting the Jet installation, you need to make sure that the
access method is correctly installed. The following sections cover DAO, ODBC,
and ADO.

Data Access Objects (DAO):

DAO is the most common Jet access method. The following steps can be used to make
sure that it is properly installed:

1. Make sure you have the following file:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao\Dao350.dll

NOTE: The drive letter may be different if your copy of Windows is installed on a
drive other than drive C:.

2. If your project references the Microsoft DAO 2.5/3.5 (or 3.51) Compatibility
  Library instead of the Microsoft DAO 3.5 (or 3.51) Library, then you need to
  make sure the following file is installed:

C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao\Dao2535.tlb

3. You need to make sure that the registry keys for DAO exist. The registry keys
  are listed in the Microsoft DAO Registry Settings section later in this
  article. Use the RegEdit program to verify that the registry keys exist. If
  the registry keys are missing or pointing to a nonexistent file, you can
  manually unregister and re-register the Dao350.dll file by running the
  following two commands from the Windows Start button, and then select Run or
  from the MS/DOS command prompt use this command:

  Regsvr32.exe /U 
  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao\Dao350.dll"

  Regsvr32.exe
  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Dao\Dao350.dll"

  Note that the earlier two commands have a line break for readability. You
  should run each command on one continuous line.

  Alternately, you can edit the registry directly. Instructions for applying the
  values through a .reg file are given in the Microsoft DAO Registry Settings
  section.

4. Once the file and registry settings are in place, you can test the DAO
  installation through code. Make a reference to the Microsoft DAO 3.5 (or
  3.51) Library in your project and run the following statement:

  Debug.Print DBEngine.Version

  If the statement works, yet your application still fails, you should continue
  with the "Troubleshooting Microsoft Jet" section.

  If the preceding test code causes this run-time error message:

  '429': ActiveX component can't create object.

  check to see if the DAO design-time license key exists on your computer. The
  following three lines may be saved to a file with the .reg extension and
  imported into the registry through the RegEdit program:

REGEDIT4
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Licenses\F4FC596D-DFFE-11CF-9551-00AA00A3DC45]
@="mbmabptebkjcdlgtjmskjwtsdhjbmkmwtrak"

5. If the code fails with an access violation, some of the support files may be
  out of date, typically:

Oleaut32.dll
Msvcrt.dll

The latest version of these files can be obtained by installing the latest
version of:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC)

from the World Wide Web. Run it on your computer to install the latest support
files.

NOTE: Installing this file may overwrite the Microsoft Access ODBC drivers as
outlined in the following section. If you have programs that use these drivers,
you should be cautious about upgrading them.

6. Occasionally, an access violation may result from a mismatch between the
  version of Dao350.dll and some of the other Jet or support DLLs. For example,
  if you have a 3.50 version of Dao350.dll and Jet 3.51, you might have
  problems. Upgrading to a 3.51 version of Dao350.dll might help.

Microsoft Access ODBC Drivers:

Installing Microsoft Access 2000, Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 SP3, Microsoft
Windows 2000, ADO 2.1 or later, and other products may break programs that use
the Microsoft Access ODBC driver. These applications replace the Microsoft Jet
3.5 ODBC drivers with Microsoft Jet 4.0 ODBC drivers. These drivers have
different capabilities and may cause your application to fail under certain
circumstances. You can check the version numbers of the following files:

Odbcjt32.dll 
Odbcji32.dll 
Odexl32.dll
Oddbse32.dll 
Odpdx32.dll 
Odtext32.dll 
Odfox32.dll

These files are located in your Windows\System (or Winnt\System32 for Windows NT)
folder. The file version should start with 3.5 or 3.51.

If the version number starts with 4.0, then the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base article deals specifically with this problem:

  Q237575 Reverting to the Access 97 ODBC Driver After Installing MDAC

The article can also be used if the files do not exist at all. Once the drivers
are in place, you should be able to view them in the ODBC Administrator in
Control Panel (or Administrative Tools, if you are using Windows 2000), create
DSNs to MDB and ISAM files, and compact a Microsoft Access database. If the
article does not resolve the problem and you can use other ODBC drivers without
experiencing a problem, continue to the Troubleshooting Microsoft Jet section.

ActiveX Data Objects (ADO):

1. First verify that you can use ADO with a provider other than the OLEDB
  Provider for Microsoft Jet. If not, then you need to verify that ADO is
  properly installed and registered. The following Microsoft Knowledge Base
  article helps you to troubleshoot the Microsoft Data Access Components:

  Q232060 HOWTO: MDAC Setup Troubleshooting Guide

  After ADO is installed and working properly proceed with the following steps
  to verify that the OLEDB provider for Microsoft Jet is properly installed and
  registered.

2. The OLEDB provider for Microsoft Jet 3.5 consists of the following two
  files:

  C:\Windows\System\Msjt4jlt.dll     (Winnt\System32 for Windows NT or Windows 2000)
  C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Ole Db\Msjtor35.dll

  Msjt4jlt.dll is Jet 3.52, a special version of Jet 3.5 specifically for ADO.
  It does not support linked files, stored queries, or the Installable ISAM
  drivers. It does rely on some of the other Jet 3.51 core files, specifically
  Msjter35.dll and Msjint35.dll, also located in the system directory.

  If these files do not exist, you can obtain them by downloading MDAC 2.0 from
  the following location on the Web, or from Visual Basic 6.0 (versions prior
  to SP3). MDAC 2.1 and later do not contain these files.

  If you do not have MDAC 2.1 or later on your computer, you can download the
  MDAC 2.0 version of the MDAC_TYP.exe file and run it to install these
  components. This MDAC 2.0 version of the MDAC_TYP.EXE file can be found at
  the following location:

  http://microsoft.com/data/download_20300223.htm

  If you do have a 2.1 or later version of MDAC on your computer, copy the MDAC
  2.0 MDAC_TYP.exe file to a clean directory and run the following command: "
  mdac_typ.exe /c /t:C:\MDAC20 " (without the quotation marks) This extracts
  the files into the C:\Mdac20 folder without installing them on your system.
  You can then copy the Msjt4jlt.dll and Msjtor35.dll files from this location
  to the directories indicated below in the REGSVR32 commands.

3. Register the files in the following order:

  Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\System\Msjt4jlt.dll  (Winnt\System32 for Windows NT or Windows 2000)

  Regsvr32.exe "C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\Ole Db\Msjtor35.DLL"

  If these steps do not resolve the problem, continue with the Troubleshooting
  Microsoft Jet section.

Troubleshooting Microsoft Jet
-----------------------------

If you have reached this step, then you should be experiencing problems with
Microsoft Access, the Microsoft Visual Basic data control, the VISDATA add-in,
other applications, and your own DAO, RDO, and ADO code.

Core Jet Files:

1. In order for Microsoft Jet to operate, you need a minimum of the following
  files installed on your computer, all in the C:\Windows\System directory
  (Winnt\System32 for Windows NT or Windows 2000):

Msjet35.dll
Msjter35.dll
Msjint35.dll
Vbajet32.dll
Expsrv.dll       (this was introduced with Vbajet32.dll 6.x versions)

2. The Microsoft Jet registry keys are given in the Microsoft Jet Registry
  Settings section at the end of the article. Verify the registry keys exist.
  If not, the section gives instructions on creating them through a .reg file.

3. After completing these steps, you should be able to use Microsoft Jet to open
  Microsoft Jet 3.x database files. If you still have problems, some of the
  dependencies may be out of date. You can update them as detailed in the next
  section.

Jet Dependencies:

Microsoft Jet has a number of file dependencies:

Msvcrt.dll
Oleaut32.dll

Older versions of the Oleaut32.dll file especially can be problematic. The
Expsrv.dll file will not work properly with older versions. You can obtain the
latest version of these DLLs by downloading the latest Microsoft Data Access
Components from the Web. If you need the 3.5 version of the Microsoft Access
ODBC drivers, you will have to restore them, as detailed in the Microsoft Access
ODBC Drivers section earlier in the article, after upgrading the Microsoft Data
Access Components.

Jet Installable ISAM Drivers:

If your application uses Jet 2.x or earlier MDB files, dBase files, Excel
spreadsheets, or any of the other installable ISAM file formats, then you need
to install one or more of the following files to the Windows\System
(Winnt\System32 for Windows NT or Windows 2000) directory:

Msrd2x35.dll           Jet 2.x IISAM
Msexcl35.dll           Excel IISAM
Msexch35.dll           Exchange IISAM
Msltus35.dll           Lotus 123 IISAM
Mspdox35.Dll           Paradox IISAM
Mstext35.dll           Text file IISAM
Msxbse35.dll           dBase/FoxPro IISAM

The registry keys are given in the Microsoft Jet Registry Settings section at the
end of the article. Verify the registry keys exist. If not, the section gives
instructions on creating them through a .reg file.

You can also register them with the following commands:

Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\Msrd2x35.dll
Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\Msexcl35.dll
Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\Msexch35.dll
Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\Msltus35.dll
Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\Mspdox35.dll
Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\Mstext35.dll
Regsvr32.exe C:\Windows\Msxbse35.dll
