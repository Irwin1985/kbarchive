The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing a Windows NT password in an accounts domain (for example a Windows NT
domain that contains user accounts) that is configured to replicate (or
synchronize) password changes with a host (for example a mainframe or AS/400)
using the SNA Server's Host Security Integration feature may fail. The PDC in
the accounts domain logs the following event in the Windows NT application event
log for each password change that cannot be replicated:

  Event ID: 671
  Source: SNA Host Security
  Description: Password Change DLL was unable to send the RPC message. Error:
  STI - RpcSendConnection could not find an alternate server resource to send
  the rpc message to.

When this occurs, the user's Windows NT password is successfully changed;
however, the new password is not propagated to the host system. The user
receives an error indicating an invalid user name or password the next time they
try to log on to the host system using the SNA Server Single Sign-On (SSO)
feature.

Note: This only occurs when a Master or Multiple Master Domain model is used with
the SNA Server Host Security components. In these environments, the PDCs of the
accounts domains have the SNA Windows NT Account Synchronization (SNAPMP)
service installed in a secondary (or backup) role.

CAUSE
=====

The Password Change DLL (Snapwchg.dll) does not attempt to locate a new master
(or primary) SNAPMP service in the Windows NT domain that contains the Host
Security Domain if the original master SNAPMP service is no longer available.
This only occurs if the master SNAPMP service is running in a Windows NT domain
other than the one where the Password Change DLL exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

Restarting the PDCs in the accounts domains re-initializes the Password Change
DLL, which allows it to locate the new master SNAPMP service in the Host
Security Domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a master (or multiple master) domain topology that uses the SNA Server Host
Security components, the typical configuration includes a resource domain that
contains the SNA Server computers and the Host Security Domain that is defined
to handle the user ID/password mapping and/or replication to the host system.

In this environment, the master SNAPMP service is installed on the PDC of the
resource domain as is the SNA Host Account Cache (snadatabase) service.
Secondary (or backup) instances of these services are typically installed on one
or more BDCs in the resource domain. The SNAPMP service will only start on a
PDC, so the secondary SNAPMP services do not actually start on the BDCs.

The SNAPMP service also needs to be installed in a secondary role on the PDCs of
the accounts domains that will be participating in the Host Security Domain. The
SNAPMP service does not start on these PDCs as it is configured in a secondary
role. However, the Password Change DLL is initialized on these PDCs to detect
any Windows NT password changes for users that are members of the Host Security
Domain. The Password Change DLL intercepts the password change requests and then
attempts to forward them to the master SNAPMP service so that they can be
replicated to the host system, if the user is configured for password
replication.

If the PDC with the master SNAPMP service becomes unavailable for any reason, a
BDC can be promoted to PDC and then the SNAPMP service on this newly promoted
PDC can be started as the "new" master SNAPMP for the Host Security Domain.

The problem described here occurs when a BDC in the resource domain is promoted
to PDC and the SNAPMP service is started as the new master. The Password Change
DLL in the accounts domain does not attempt to locate the new master SNAPMP once
it fails to connect to the original master SNAPMP service.

Note: This does not occur if the user accounts exist in the same Windows NT
domain as the master SNAPMP service, because the Password Change DLL is able to
locate a new master SNAPMP service when all of the components are running in the
same Windows NT domain.
