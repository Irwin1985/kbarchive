Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me):

To reinstall the Msvcrt.dll file under Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95, Windows 98, or

  f. On the Start menu, click Shut Down.

  g. In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click "Restart in MS-DOS mode" and

5. Click the Office 2000 product that you installed on the computer, and then
  click Add/Remove.

2. Open the following folder in Windows Explorer:

  C:\Winnt\System32\dllcache

  Right-click the Msvcrt.dll file, and then click Rename on the shortcut menu.

3. Type "msvcrt.old" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

4. Obtain a copy of the Msvcrt.dll file from the Microsoft Office 2000 Service
  Release 1 (SR-1) CD, or from the administrative installation on your network.

5. Copy the Office 2000 SR-1 version of the Msvcrt.dll file to the
  C:\WINNT\System32\dllcache folder.

6. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Command
  Prompt.

7. Type the following

  cd system32

  and then press ENTER.

8. Type the following

  ren msvcrt.dll msvcrt.old

  Msvcrt.dll file with the "backup" from the C:\WINNT\System32\dllcache folder.
