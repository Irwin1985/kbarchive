- Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library setup on Windows NT
4.0 Terminal Server Edition or Windows 2000 with Terminal Services installed,
the following error may appear at the end of setup:

  MSDN Setup Error : CloseCollection g_ccolCollection.Save() dwError = 1

When you try to launch the MSDN Library following the failed installation, the
following error appears:

  Cannot open the file: %MSDN Library path%\msdn*.col

CAUSE
=====

The MSDN Library was installed in Terminal Server's Execute mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually clean the failed installation off of the computer. See the MORE
INFORMAITON section for details on how to manually clean the failed installation
off of your computer.

The Terminal Server requires that you install applications in Install mode. This
can be done by using the Add/Remove Programs application in the Control Panel.
The Add/Remove Programs application can find and start Setup.Exe off of the MSDN
Library Disc 1. There are many other considerations when installing the MSDN
Library on Terminal Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

When the MSDN Library is installed on Terminal Server in Execute mode, no
information is written to HHCOLREG.DAT. However, files and registry keys have
been added to the computer and must be removed before correctly installing the
MSDN Library. This section describes how to remove these files without effecting
the other HTML Help collections on the computer. A quicker and easier process is
to remove all HTML Help collections off of the computer. If you are willing to
reinstall all HTML Help collections on the computer, see the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article.

  Q240350 HOWTO: Manually Uninstall the MSDN Library

To only remove the failed installation on Terminal Server, follow these steps.

NOTE: First, remove all of the files that the failed MSDN Library installation
placed on system.

1. If the failed MSDN Library installation was the MSDN Library that shipped
  with Visual Studio 6.0, locate and delete the following directory (this is
  the default):

  %Program Files%\Microsoft Visual Studio\MSDN98

2. If the failed MSDN Library installation was a quarterly release, locate and
  delete the installation folder using these steps:

  a. Find the root folder where all MSDN Library quarterly releases are
     installed to. The default is %Program File%\Microsoft Visual Studio\MSDN.

  b. In root folder, find the directory of the failed installation and delete
     it. For example, the July 99 MSDN Library is place in a 99jul directory.

Next, use RegEdit.Exe to remove the registry entry related to this failed
installation.

1. Open the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

2. Delete the subkey with the name of the MSDN Library you are removing.

3. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTML Help Collections\Developer
  Collections

4. Under this key, there are a series of keys with language IDs that will differ
  depending on what language version of the MSDN Library is installed. (For
  Example English is 0x0409). Expand these language ID keys, and navigate
  through all of their subkeys.

5. As the subkeys are selected, look in the right-pane at the (Default) value.
  Find the subkey that contains a (Default) value that names the version of the
  MSDN Library you are removing. Delete that subkey.

Examine the rest of the registry entries under the
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTML Help Collections\Developer
Collections" registry key. If there are no other versions of the MSDN Library
listed there, the cleanup of the failed MSDN Library installation is complete.

If other versions of the MSDN Library are listed under this key, more steps are
needed to restore the computer. When the MSDN Library is accessed from other
applications, the registry is examined to determine which MSDN Library to
display. That MSDN Library is called the preferred collection. The following
steps reset the preferred collection to one of the remaining MSDN Libraries on
the system:

1. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTML Help Collections\Developer
  Collections

2. Expand the same language ID keys, and navigate through all of their subkeys.

3. In the right-pane, examine the (Default) value that contains the name of the
  MSDN Library the key refers to. Decide which MSDN Library version you want to
  select as the preferred collection.

4. Copy that subkey name. For example, the subkey name for the July 99 MSDN
  Library is 0x0375ccd80.

5. Select language ID key above the preferred collection that you chose.

6. In the right-hand pane, change the Preferred value to be the collection ID
  that you just copied.

7. Select the Developer Collections key again (the key selected in the first
  step).

8. Verify that the Language value is pointing to the Language ID key value that
  contains your preferred collection. If not, change it. For example, if the
  preferred collection of the MSDN Library was an English version, the Language
  key should be set to 0x0409.

At this point, you can properly install the MSDN Library using the Add/Remove
Programs application. This is described in the RESOLUTION section of this
article.
