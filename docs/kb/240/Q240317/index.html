SUMMARY
=======

Because the Microsoft Jet database engine has a read cache and lazy writes, you
can get duplicate values in your custom counter field if two applications add
records in less time than it takes for the cache to refresh and the lazy-write
mechanism to flush to disk. This article presents a method that takes these
factors into account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Jet database engine provides a Counter (AutoIncrement) field.
Starting with Jet 4.0, you can specify a starting value and an increment value.
This solves most of the need for using a custom counter that users of earlier
versions of Jet had. However, if your counter is a text value or does not
increase in a fixed amount, the steps outlined in this article may benefit your
application.

Microsoft Jet has a read-cache that is updated every PageTimeout milliseconds
(default is 5000ms = 5 seconds). It also has a lazy-write mechanism that
operates on a separate thread to main processing and thus writes changes to disk
asynchronously. These two mechanisms help boost performance, but in certain
situations that require high concurrency, they may create problems.

The Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLEDB provider and the Microsoft Jet and Replication
Objects type library provide two methods to ensure that your application has
current data:

- JetEngine object's RefreshCache method.

- "Jet OLEDB:Transaction Commit Mode" Connection property.

JetEngine object's RefreshCache Method
--------------------------------------

There is a separate read-cache for each connection object. Calling the
RefreshCache method of the JetEngine object, as exposed by the Microsoft Jet and
Replication Objects type library, immediately refreshes the read-cache for the
Connection objects passed as a method argument. The read-cache for all other
Connection objects in the application are not affected.

"Jet OLEDB:Transaction Commit Mode" Connection Property
-------------------------------------------------------

In Microsoft Jet 2.x and earlier, all writes were immediately committed. With
Win32 and multi-threading, Microsoft Jet introduced a lazy-write mechanism.
Setting this property to a value of 1 causes all transaction commits to be
written immediately to disk for that Connection object. All other Connection
objects are unaffected.

These methods are preferable to modifying registry values to get the same effect
because you can precisely control where you need this value and they are more
deterministic in operation. Global registry programs will adversely affect
engine performance in other areas and in other applications.

EXAMPLE

The following example provides a function for generating custom counter numbers
and handling the concurrency and locking issues that result from the process. It
involves the use of a second table to store the next available key value. This
is used for performance reasons and also to avoid adversely affecting users who
would just need to read data.

The main function is NextKeyValue. It accepts three arguments:

- Connection object

- Table name

- Increment value

Increment value is optional and defaults to 1. The function opens the table using
a server-side cursor, a transaction, and pessimistic locking and then reads the
value from the first field of the first record. This is the key value returned.
It then increments the value for the next user and releases the table.

When you set the initial value in the table, this is the first value returned by
the function.

The error handling is designed to handle locking problems opening the table. If
the locks time-out, the function returns -1 as the next key value. If any other
error occurs, the function raises a run-time error that the main application
will need to trap.

Because most people leave their registry settings untouched, Microsoft Jet will
usually have a 100ms delay between lock-retries. If all instances of Jet have
the same delay, this could result in a race situation and cause your application
to time-out more than is necessary. The NextKeyValue function sets the lock
retry to a random interval between 60 and 150 milliseconds to reduce the chance
of a race condition occurring. The test application is responsible for using the
RANDOM statement to seed the random number generator.

The test application adds 100 records to the table. It does not implement any but
the most basic error handling to handle lock timeouts between the program and
others like it.

Database Setup
--------------

1. In Microsoft Access, open the NWind.MDB file, and create the following
  tables:

          Table: KeyStore
     Field Name: NextValue
           Type: Number, Long Integer

     Field Name: Dummy
           Type: Number, Long Integer

          Table: KeyTest
     Field Name: ID
           Type: Number, Long Integer

     Field Name: Description

           Type: Text, 50

2. Open the KeyStore table and add a record. Set NextValue to the amount from
  which you want your counter to start. For example: 3.

3. Save the record and close Microsoft Access.

Test Program
------------

1. Open a new Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications project with a Form
  (Form1) and a Module (Module1).

2. From the Project menu, choose References and add a reference to the Microsoft
  ActiveX Data Objects 2.1 (or later) Library and the Microsoft Jet and
  Replication Objects 2.1 (or later) Library.

3. Add the following code to the Module:

  Option Explicit

  Private Const MAX_RETRIES = 10

  Function NextKeyValue(cn As ADODB.Connection, _
                        ByVal TableName As String, _
                        Optional Increment As Long = 1) As Long
  Dim OldCommitMode As Long, rs As Recordset, ErrorCount As Long
  Dim TempKeyValue As Long, Jet As JRO.JetEngine, InTrans As Boolean
    NextKeyValue = -1   ' returns this if the routine times out
    OldCommitMode = cn.Properties("Jet OLEDB:Transaction Commit Mode")
    cn.Properties("Jet OLEDB:Transaction Commit Mode") = 1
    cn.Properties("Jet OLEDB:Lock Delay") = 90 + Int(Rnd * 60)
    Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
    Set Jet = New JRO.JetEngine
    On Error GoTo NKV_Error
    rs.Open TableName, cn, adOpenDynamic, adLockPessimistic, adCmdTableDirect
    cn.BeginTrans
    InTrans = True
  NKV_InnerRetry:
    If rs.EditMode Then rs.CancelUpdate
    rs!Dummy = 0            ' lock the record
    Jet.RefreshCache cn     ' get current data
    TempKeyValue = rs(0)    ' .UnderlyingValue gives an error
    rs(0) = TempKeyValue + Increment
    rs.Update
    InTrans = False
    cn.CommitTrans
    rs.Close
    cn.Properties("Jet OLEDB:Transaction Commit Mode") = OldCommitMode
    NextKeyValue = TempKeyValue
    Exit Function
    
  NKV_Abort:
    On Error Resume Next
    If rs.EditMode Then rs.CancelUpdate
    cn.RollbackTrans
    rs.Close
    cn.Properties("Jet OLEDB:Transaction Commit Mode") = OldCommitMode
    Exit Function

  NKV_Error:
    Select Case Err.Number
      Case &amp;H80004005
        ' Various locking errors (above)
        ErrorCount = ErrorCount + 1
        If ErrorCount &lt; MAX_RETRIES Then
          Resume NKV_Abort
        ElseIf InTrans Then
          Resume NKV_InnerRetry
        Else
          Resume
        End If
      Case Else   ' unhandled errors
        Err.Raise Err.Number, Err.Source, Err.Description
    End Select
  End Function

4. Add a command button (Command1) and a text box (Text1) to the form.

5. Add the following code to the form:

  Option Explicit

  Dim cn As ADODB.Connection

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
  Dim SQL As String, I As Long
    For I = 1 To 100
      SQL = "INSERT INTO KeyTest VALUES (" &amp; _
            NextKeyValue(cn, "KeyStore", 10) &amp; _
            ",'Test Record " &amp; Me.hWnd &amp; " " &amp; Time &amp; "')"
      On Error GoTo C1_Error
      cn.Execute SQL, , adExecuteNoRecords
      On Error GoTo 0
      Text1 = CStr(I)
      Me.Refresh
    Next I
    Exit Sub
    
  C1_Error:
    Resume
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
    Randomize
    Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
    cn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=\\moonbase\public\northwind40.mdb"
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    cn.Close
  End Sub

6. In Visual Basic, compile the application to an EXE. Run the application from
  multiple computers and click Command1 at the same time. It will run to
  completion (barring any unhandled errors) and then add records without
  duplicate ID numbers.

NOTES
-----

- The KeyStore table does not require an index. You will get better performance
  and have fewer problems if you do not add (or allow Microsoft Access to add)
  and index or Primary Key to the table.

- The fewer indexes on the KeyText table, the better. Indices have a negative
  effect on the ability to lock and update data quickly. If you have problems
  in your application, try reducing the number of indices.

- Unlike Data Access Objects (DAO) or Remote Data Objects (RDO), ADO does not
  have an Edit method. In order to turn on pessimistic locking, the program
  modifies the "Dummy" field in the record to get the same effect. This field
  has been added to the table solely for this purpose and does not contain any
  useful information.
