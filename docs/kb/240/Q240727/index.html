SUMMARY
=======


This article explains how to use the FTP utility, which is included with Windows

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTES:

- The FTP utility is run from the command prompt.
- After each description of how to perform a step in the typical FTP session is
  sample screen output from that part of the session.
- All FTP commands are case sensitive.

Opening an FTP Site
-------------------

To open an FTP site, perform the following:

1. At the command prompt, type the following:

  ftp ServerName

  Note that the prompt changes to ftp&gt;.

2. Type "anonymous" (without the quotation marks) when prompted for the user.

3. Type any password.

Note: The "anonymous" user name is typically used to log on to FTP sites,
particularly those that are not set up for users to copy files to. Usually, any
text can be supplied for the password, including no text (just press the ENTER
key when prompted for the password).

  C:\&gt;ftp &lt;ServerName&gt;
  Connected to &lt;ServerName&gt;.
  220 &lt;ServerName&gt; Microsoft FTP Service (Version 4.0).
  User (&lt;ServerName&gt;:(none)): anonymous
  331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
  Password:
  230 Anonymous user logged in.
  ftp&gt;

Browsing the List of Files and Folders
--------------------------------------

To view the list of files and folders, type "dir" (without the quotation marks)
at the ftp prompt.

  ftp&gt; dir
  200 PORT command successful.
  150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.
  08-29-99  08:11PM                   35 File1.txt
  08-29-99  08:11PM       &lt;DIR&gt;          Folder1
  226 Transfer complete.
  98 bytes received in 0.00 seconds (98000.00 Kbytes/sec)
  ftp&gt;

Changing Folders
----------------

To change to a different folder (also known as the working directory), use the
"cd" (without the quotation marks) command.

Note: To change to the root folder, type either "cd /" (without the quotation
marks) or "cd \" (without the quotation marks). To change to the parent folder,
use two periods ("cd .." (without the quotation marks)).

  ftp&gt; cd folder1
  250 CWD command successful.
  ftp&gt;

Copying a File From the FTP Site to Your Local Computer
-------------------------------------------------------

To copy a file from the FTP site to your local computer, use the "get" (without
the quotation marks) command.

  ftp&gt; get file1.txt
  200 PORT command successful.
  150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for file1.txt(35 bytes).
  226 Transfer complete.
  35 bytes received in 0.16 seconds (0.22 Kbytes/sec)
  ftp&gt;

Copying a File from your Local Computer to the FTP Site
-------------------------------------------------------

To copy a file from your local computer to the FTP site, use the "put" (without
the quotation marks) command.

Note: Most sites only allow users to do this if they have logged on using a
specific, preassigned user name, NOT the "anonymous" user.

  ftp&gt; put myfile.txt
  200 PORT command successful.
  150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for MyFile.txt.
  226 Transfer complete.
  36 bytes sent in 0.00 seconds (36000.00 Kbytes/sec)
  ftp&gt;

Ending an FTP session
---------------------

To end the FTP session, use the "bye" (without the quotation marks) command.

  ftp&gt; bye
