-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a user is a member of more than 64 global groups, that user may be unable to
gain access to the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Systems Management Server
(SMS) Administrator Console nodes using class permissions inherited from global
group membership.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because SMS Provider incorrectly enumerates the global
groups of which the user is a member and may not get the global group to which
the permissions are applied.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, grant explicit class rights to user accounts
instead of to global groups.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the Systems Management
Server site server.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: You can only use this method on I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q241734.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the Systems Management Server Administrator
  console.

4. Run Q240155.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Stop the Systems Management Server Site Component Manager, Systems Management
  Server Executive, and Windows Management services on the site server.

2. Replace the Baseutil.dll file in the
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\bin\&lt;platform&gt; folder with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

3. Restart the Systems Management Server Site Component Manager, Systems
  Management Server Executive, and Windows Management services.
