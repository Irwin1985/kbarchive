-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is now possible to connect two separate GroupWise mail systems over Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.5 as a backbone with the latest Microsoft Exchange Connector
for Novell GroupWise (available with Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3). This
article describes the idea and limitations of this procedure, as well as
step-by-step instructions for implementing it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For general information regarding the features and configuration of the Exchange
GroupWise Connector, please refer to the documentation in the Gwconn.rtf file
provided with the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 CD, or located in the
Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Docs folder after installation. This article assumes
that the reader has a good understanding of the Exchange Server 5.5 mail server
and the Exchange GroupWise Connector.

For the purpose of this article, assume the following scenario: Two separate
GroupWise mail systems and one Exchange Server site with two Exchange Server
computers. The requirement is to send e-mail between all mail systems and
maintain a global directory list in both mail systems spanning all users in the
organization.

+-------------------------------------------------+
| GroupWise domain name:               | GWDOM1   | 
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GroupWise post office name:          | GWPO1    | 
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Exchange Server foreign domain name: | EXCHANGE | 
+-------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------------------+
| GroupWise domain name:               | GWDOM2   | 
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GroupWise post office name:          | GWPO2    | 
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Exchange Server foreign domain name: | EXCHANGE | 
+-------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------+
| Exchange Server site name:  | EXCHSITE1 | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| Server connected to GWDOM1: | EXCHSRV1  | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| Server connected to GWDOM2: | EXCHSRV2  | 
+-----------------------------------------+

Directory Synchronization
-------------------------

The default mapping rules for the Exchange GroupWise Connector can synchronize
all Exchange Server mailboxes and non-GroupWise custom recipients (CRs) with
each GroupWise mail system. To be able to synchronize GroupWise CRs from GWDOM1
into GWDOM2, the mapping rules and tables need to be modified. For more
information on mapping rules, please refer to the Appendix section of the
GroupWise documentation.

Apply the following steps to both Exchange Server computers with Exchange
GroupWise Connectors:

1. Using Notepad, open the Mexamap.tbl file. The mapping tables are in the
  Dxagwise folder located under Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn.

2. Add the following line to the end of the list of attributes:

GWISEADDR2      128 Secondary-Proxy-Addresses(gwise:)

The resulting file should look similar to the following:

DN	        256 Obj-Dist-Name
TA	        256 Target-Address
ACCOUNT          32 Assoc-NT-Account
ALIAS            64 Mail-nickname
FULLNAME        128 Display-Name
FIRSTNAME        64 Given-Name
INITIALS          5 Initials
LASTNAME         64 Surname
COMPANY          64 Company
DEPARTMENT       64 Department
TITLE            32 Title
OFFICE           64 Physical-Delivery-Office-Name
PHONE            33 Telephone-Office1
FAX              33 Telephone-Fax
MOBILEPHN        33 Telephone-Mobile 
USNCREATED       12 USN-Created
GWISEADDR       128 Proxy-Addresses(GWISE:)
GWISEADDR2      128 Secondary-Proxy-Addresses(gwise:)

3. Open the Mapgwise.tbl file and add the following line:

GWISEADDR2      = "EXCHANGE." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT

The resulting file should look similar to the following:

TA              = "GWISE:" DOMAIN "." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT
DN              = DOMAIN "." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT
ALIAS           = OBJECT
FULLNAME        = ISEQUAL(FIRSTNAME AND(" ", LASTNAME), "", ISEQUAL(FIRSTNAME, "", ISEQUAL(LASTNAME, "", OBJECT, LASTNAME), FIRSTNAME), TRIM(FIRSTNAME AND(" ", LASTNAME),"B"))
FIRSTNAME       = FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME        = LASTNAME  
DEPARTMENT      = DEPARTMENT
TITLE           = TITLE
PHONE           = PHONE
FAX             = FAX
GWISEADDR2      = "EXCHANGE." POSTOFFICE "." OBJECT

4. Open the Mapmex.tbl file and change the following line

  GWADDR          = GWISEADDR

  to the following:

GWADDR          = ISEQUAL(STRIP(GWISEADDR,".","L","R"), "EXCHANGE",GWISEADDR,GWISEADDR2)

5. Save all changes.

The Exchange GroupWise Connector controls directory synchronization (dirsync) by
checking that any changes to the GroupWise system are sent only if the GroupWise
object belongs to the Exchange foreign domain. This is determined by the
Exchange Foreign domain name field specified in the Options tab of the
connector. By default, this name is EXCHANGE.

The changes in the mapping tables will automatically generate secondary GWISE
proxy addresses for all GroupWise CRs by concatenating EXCHANGE as the domain
address and the GroupWise user's original GroupWise mailing address. For
example, a user from GWDOM1 will have the following GWISE proxies

GWISE:GWDOM1.GWPO1.GWUSER1
gwise:EXCHANGE.GWPO1.GWUSER1

where GWDOM1.GWPO1.GWUSER1 is the primary target GWISE address and
EXCHANGE.GWPO1.GWUSER1 is the secondary GWISE address. This secondary address is
the GWISE proxy address that is sent over to the other GroupWise system
(GWDOM2).

After you change the mapping tables, perform a full dirsync reload from GroupWise
to Exchange Server on both Exchange GroupWise Connectors. Check that the
GroupWise CRs now have a secondary GWISE proxy address with EXCHANGE as the
domain field. Running a full dirsync reload from Exchange Server to GroupWise
populates the GroupWise mail system with GroupWise users from the second
GroupWise mail system.

Messaging
---------

The default mail routing for the Exchange GroupWise Connector assumes that all
mail destined for a GroupWise mail system traverses only one connector. Each
GroupWise connector address space entry needs to be modified from the default
GWISE:* address to a unique GWISE address. For example:

EXCHSRV1-GroupWise Connector Address Space Entry

+-----------------------+
| Type:    | GWISE      | 
+-----------------------+
| Address: | GWDOM1.*.* | 
+-----------------------+
| Cost:    | 1          | 
+-----------------------+

EXCHSRV2-GroupWise Connector Address Space Entry

+-----------------------+
| Type:    | GWISE      | 
+-----------------------+
| Address: | GWDOM2.*.* | 
+-----------------------+
| Cost:    | 1          | 
+-----------------------+

If additional GroupWise domains are present, they need to be added to the address
space list.

In each GroupWise mail system, a second foreign domain representing the other
GroupWise domain needs to be added. Note that current foreign domain EXCHANGE
should already be in the GroupWise system. If GWDOM1 was the primary GroupWise
domain, then GWDOM2 and EXCHANGE will be the two foreign domains for that
GroupWise mail system. The GroupWise link configuration also needs to be
modified so that this second foreign domain is linked to the API gateway.

For more information on creating a foreign domain in GroupWise and linking it to
the GroupWise API gateway, please refer to the Exchange GroupWise Connector
documentation (Gwconn.rtf).
