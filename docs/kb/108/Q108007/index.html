The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

The Wollongong Group's Pathway Runtime and Pathway Access version 1.2, which
comes with an RFC-compliant NetBIOS interface, can be used with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11. Pathway Runtime is the Wollongong TCP/IP stack, and Pathway
Access is a set of TCP/IP utilities provided by Wollongong. (The TCP/IP stack is
a real-mode stack and operates with NDIS 2 drivers.)

This article provides the steps needed to install Pathway Runtime 1.2 on Windows
for Workgroups 3.11.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install Pathway Runtime on Windows for Workgroups, do the following:

WARNING: Although this procedure allows you to run Pathway Runtime with Windows
for Workgroups version 3.11, it disables the NetBEUI protocol. As a result, your
machine won't be able to view or access any other Windows for Workgroups
machines or LAN Manager servers on the network that are running NetBEUI
exclusively.

1. Install Windows for Workgroups with the default NetBEUI transport.

2. Install Pathway Runtime using PWSETUP.EXE from the setup disk supplied with
  the Wollongong product.

3. Complete the installation using the complete NDIS installation option. (For
  more information, please refer to the Pathway Runtime manual.)

4. After the installation is complete, change the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that the
  NET INIT command is executed immediately before the NDIS command. Replace the
  PWBIND command with the NET START NETBIND command, which comes before the
  PWTCP command. Remove the NET START line added by Windows for Workgroups. The
  following is an example of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file after these changes:

  rem #----------------------- The Wollongong Group --------------------#
  rem # The following lines are for Pathway Runtime setup. Please DO NOT#
  rem # modify or remove any of them. If you DO want to, please run the #
  rem # setup program to modify or deinstall Pathway for DOS.           #

  SET PATH=C:\PATHWAY;%PATH%
  c:\pathway\PWCONFIG -N:65
  net init
  c:\pathway\ndis -I:5 -D:3
  net start netbind
  rem if you are not using the bootp protocol comment out the bootp line.
  c:\pathway\bootp -d
  c:\pathway\pwtcp
  c:\pathway\netbios
  rem #----------------------- The Wollongong Group --------------------#

5. Make sure that the -I option for the NDIS command matches the IRQ being used
  by the network card. The -D option refers to the section number in the
  PROTOCOL.INI file referring to the network card.

6. Run NETBIOS.EXE after PWTCP.EXE. (NETBIOS.EXE is the RFC-compliant driver.)

7. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows directory and make the following
  changes:

  a. In the [386enh] section, change the line

  transport=netbeui.386,nwlink.386,nwnblink.386

     to:

  transport=nwlink.386,nwnblink.386

  b. In the [network drivers] section, change the lines

            transport=ndishlp.sys,*netbeui
            LoadRMDrivers=No

     to:

            transport=ndishlp.sys
            LoadRMDrivers=Yes

  These changes indicate that the real-mode protocol stack will use Lana 0.
  (Pathway Runtime can use Lana 0 only).

8. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and remark out (using the REM command) the entries
  added by the Pathway Access installation program:

  rem #---------------------- The Wollongong Group ----------------------#
  rem #  The following lines are for Pathway Runtime setup. Please DO NOT#
  rem #  modify or remove any of them. If you DO want to, please run the#
  rem #  setup program to modify or deinstall Pathway for DOS.          #
  rem DEVICE=C:\PATHWAY\PROTMAN.EXE /i:C:\PATHWAY\LANMAN
  rem DEVICE=C:\PATHWAY\LANMAN\ELNK3.DOS
  rem #---------------------- The Wollongong Group ---------------------#

  The only entry needed is:

        Device=c:\Windows\ifshlp.sys
      

9. Reboot and start Windows.

You can now install Pathway Access by following the instructions provided by
Wollongong.
