The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If Backup, Undelete, and/or Anti-Virus were not on your system when you
installed MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up, but you now want the MS-DOS 6.2 versions of these
programs and you are using Stacker version 3.11, the procedure in the MS-DOS 6.2
Step-Up README.NOW file for installing them does not work correctly. To work
around this situation, follow the steps below.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Use the MS-DOS Expand utility (EXPAND.EXE) to expand the required files
  (using the table below for reference) from the original MS-DOS 6 Upgrade
  disk.

  NOTE: If you expanded the Backup or Anti-Virus files in step 1, skip to step
  4. If you expanded the MS-DOS-based or Windows-based version of Undelete, go
  to step 2.

2. Run 62STAC.EXE, or run Debug as described below in the section titled
  "Changing the Stacker Version Number in Memory" to change the Stacker version
  number from 3.11 to 3.10 in memory.

3. Run MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up to update the files.

4. Manually create the MSTOOLS group and icons in Microsoft Windows if you
  expanded the Windows-based versions of Backup, Anti-Virus, and/or Undelete.

Changing the Stacker Version Number in Memory
---------------------------------------------

To change the Stacker version number in memory (so you can run MS-DOS 6.2
Step-Up), contact STAC Electronics to obtain the 62STAC.EXE file, or follow the
procedure below. You can order the 62STAC.EXE file from STAC Electronics, or you
can download it from the STAC Electronics bulletin board service at (619)
431-7405.

If you do not obtain 62STAC.EXE, you can work around this problem by using the
Debug program to make the Stacker driver report version 3.1 instead of 3.11. The
following procedure uses Debug to change the memory location that Setup looks at
to determine the Stacker version.

1. If you have not already done so, exit SETUP by pressing F3. If necessary,
  boot from the Uninstall Disk 1 and follow the instructions on the screen to
  return to your previous version of MS-DOS.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following command and press ENTER:

  " mem /c /p" (without the quotation marks)

3. Check the name column for the STACKER or STACHIGH program.

4. Using the program name found in the previous step, type the appropriate
  command below and then press ENTER:

  " mem /m:stacker" (without the quotation marks)

  -or-

  " mem /m:stachigh" (without the quotation marks)

  Make note of the segment address displayed by this command (for example,
  0025F). You will need this address in a later step.

5. At the MS-DOS command prompt, enter the following command and press ENTER:

  " debug" (without the quotation marks)

  This should bring you to the Debug hyphen (-) prompt.

6. At the Debug prompt, type the following command and press ENTER

  " s &amp;lt;ssss&amp;gt;:0000 ffff 5a a5" (without the quotation marks)

  where &amp;lt;ssss&amp;gt; is the last four digits of the segment address
  displayed in step 4. For example, if the segment address from step 4 was
  0025F, type:

  " s 025f:0000 ffff 5a a5" (without the quotation marks)

  Debug displays a segment:offset pair, for example, 025F:0A4A.

7. Type the following command at the Debug prompt and then press ENTER

  " d &amp;lt;ssss:oooo&amp;gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  where &amp;lt;ssss:oooo&amp;gt; is the segment:offset displayed by step 6. For
  example:

  d 025f:0a4a

  Debug displays a block of information similar to the following:

      025F:0A40                                5A A5 37 01 D0 00
      025F:0A50  08 01 14 01 03 02 76 10-00 00 03 00 A4 09 20 6D
      025F:0A60  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 0A 00 00 00 0A 00 00
      025F:0A70  20 63 00 00 00 02 00 40-E0 69 3A 00 CD 13 CD 14
      025F:0A80  CD 01 CD 03 1A 00 02 03-00 00 81 07 03 01 14 00
      025F:0A90  CA 00 00 80 5E 19 00 00-00 00 00 00 53 57 41 50
      025F:0AA0  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07-08 03 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
      025F:0AB0  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17-18 19 00 00 B0 03 F9 01
      025F:0AC0  00 00 00 00 00 00 24 01-01 01

  Looking across the top row of this block, you should see the "5A A5 37 01"
  pattern. If you see this pattern, proceed to step 8.

  If you do not see this exact pattern and more than one segment:offset pair was
  displayed by step 6, repeat step 7 for each segment:offset pair until you
  locate the memory block that contains this pattern.

  If you do not see this exact pattern and you have checked all segment:offset
  pairs displayed by step 6, exit Debug by pressing Q and ENTER. Contact STAC
  Electronics to obtain the 62STAC.EXE file.

8. After locating the pattern as described in step 7, type the following command
  at the Debug prompt and press ENTER

  " e &amp;lt;ssss:oooo&amp;gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  where &amp;lt;ssss:oooo&amp;gt; is the segment:offset pair used in step 7. For
  example:

  e 025f:0a4a

  In this example, Debug displays the following (the segment:offset varies):

  025F:0A4A 5A.

9. Press the SPACEBAR two times. Debug displays the following:

  025F:0A4A 5A. A5. 37.

  IMPORTANT: If you do not see the "5A. A5. 37." pattern, press ENTER to return
  to the Debug hyphen prompt. Then press Q and ENTER to quit Debug. Contact
  Microsoft MS-DOS Technical Support for further assistance.

10. Type "36" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER. This returns you to
  the Debug hyphen prompt.

11. Press Q and ENTER to quit Debug.

  DO NOT restart your computer. If you do, you must go through this procedure
  again.

12. Run the MS-DOS 6.2 Setup program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At the time MS-DOS 6.2 was released, the current version of Stacker was 3.1.
Microsoft ensured MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade and MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up can detect and
install correctly over Stacker versions 3.1 and earlier.

Since Microsoft cannot guarantee how MS-DOS will interact with future versions of
Stacker, MS-DOS 6.2 Setup was not designed to detect and install over versions
of Stacker later than 3.1.

STAC Electronics has released Stacker version 3.11; however, the box and disks
still indicate version 3.1. You can tell the difference between Stacker 3.1 and
3.11 by the file dates and sizes. The file date for Stacker version 3.11 is
9/08/93, and the files are marked with the time 3:11 A.M. The problems described
above occur with Stacker 3.11.
