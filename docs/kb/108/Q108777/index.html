SUMMARY
=======

This article contains the READ.ME file for the Canon BJC-600 version 1.0 printer
driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Copyright 1993 Canon Information Systems, Inc., Canon Inc.

BJC-600 Windows Printer Driver Version 1.0 READ.ME File:

June 1993
*************************************************************************

Congratulations on your purchase of the Canon Color Bubble Jet Printer BJC-600.
We are sure you'll appreciate its exceptional print quality using both color and
black inks, flexible paper handling, fast printing speed, and trouble-free
operation.

As with most software and hardware products, information is made available after
the development of the manual. Updated information regarding the BJC-600 is
provided in this readme file. Should the information in this readme file be
inaccurate or you require further explanation, please contact Canon's Help Desk
at 1-800-423-2366.

Printing Envelopes
------------------

When printing envelopes with the BJC-600 and the auto-sheet feeder, move the
paper thickness selection lever on the auto-sheet feeder to the forward
position. This will result in the best paper handling for envelopes. Also, make
sure to print with the option 'Print Current Page' or set the print range to be
from '1' to '1'. This will ensure that the application will not prompt you to
insert a second envelope after printing.

Windows System Options
----------------------

When setting up your Windows system to print with the BJC-600, please consider
the following options to optimize your printing performance.

- Fast Printing Direct to Port: This option, available from within Printers in
  the Windows Control Panel, should always be ON for best printing results.

- Use DOS 5.0 or higher &amp; HIMEM command to make 550 K of 'real' memory
  available.

- Ensure a minimum of 4 to 8MB of permanent Windows SWAPFILE.

- Increase your RAM memory to more than 8MB. Increasing RAM memory will result
  in faster printing and reduce compatibility problems with applications. If
  you must print in a low memory situation, and are having problems with your
  application, try turning off screen-matched color or reducing resolution to
  correct the problem.

- ATI display driver. If you are using ATI's display driver version 1.5 and are
  experiencing problems when printing, do the following:

  1. Run the program "FlexDesk Control Panel" supplied with your ATI driver.

  2. Click on the "Advanced..." button on the main dialog.

  3. Select "Off" for the "Device Bitmaps" selection.

  4. Press "Ok" to exit "FlexDesk Advanced Settings" dialog.

  5. Press "Ok" to exit "FlexDesk Control Panel".

  6. You will be prompted to restart Windows. Press "Yes" to this query.

Operation under Windows 3.0
---------------------------

If you are installing the BJC-600 driver under Windows 3.0 and you wish to use
its on-line help, you need to manually copy a newer version of the file
WINHELP.EXE from the BJC-600 Installation diskette to your Windows directory.
For instance, if your Windows directory is C:\WINDOWS and your BJC-600
Installation diskette is in drive A:, under DOS you would type:

  copy a:\winhelp.exe c:\windows

Alternatively, you can use the Windows file manager to copy this file.

Application Notes
-----------------

This section contains the latest information about using your BJC-600 with
various Windows application programs.

Corel Draw 3.1 (Corel Corp.):

If a print job is canceled from within Corel Draw 3.1, an extra page may be
ejected from the printer after the canceled job is ejected.

Excel 4.0 (Microsoft):

In Excel, changes to the Page Setup in the Print menu do not take effect
immediately. After closing Page Setup, re-open the dialog box and select the
same options again to ensure that Excel recognizes the change and implements
it.

Freelance Graphics 1.0 (Lotus Development Corp.):

When printing grayscale documents from Freelance, gradients used in the document
may appear as solid colors. This is due to a problem in Freelance 1.0.

Image-In 3.1a (Image-In Corp.):

When printing .bmp images from Image-In 3.1a, the file may be printed upside down
when Portrait orientation is selected. When printing from Image-In and using the
Fit to Page option and Landscape orientation, some horizontal lines may appear
in the output. Try scaling the image with the BJC-600 driver rather than using
Fit to Page.

IntelliDraw 1.0 (Aldus Corp.):

When printing with IntelliDraw in low memory conditions, IntelliDraw may cause a
general protection fault error. Try increasing the RAM memory to greater than
4MB.

Persuasion 2.0 (Aldus Corp.):

When printing from within Persuasion, a white line may appear across the page.
This is due to a problem in Persuasion.

PhotoFinish 2.0 (Zsoft):

PhotoFinish has an option within its printer setup called 'Use PhotoFinish
halftone'. This option should not be used with the BJC-600 printer. Always
select 'Use Printer's Halftone' when printing from PhotoFinish.

PhotoStyler 1.1a (Aldus Corp.):

When printing using the Fit to Page option within PhotoStyler, the bottom and
right sides of the document may sometimes be cut off. Try scaling the image with
the BJC-600 driver rather than using Fit to Page. Also, multiple copies cannot
be printed from within PhotoStyler. Each copy must be printed individually. This
is due to the fact that the application is not correctly communicating with the
printer driver about how to print multiple pages.

Picture Publisher 3.1 (Micrografx):

When printing a color image from Picture Publisher using Black &amp; White print
mode within the BJC-600 driver, the Intensity control does not function. This is
due to a problem in Picture Publisher.

Ventura Publisher 4.01 (Ventura):

When importing PCX files into Ventura, the file will be printed as grayscale even
if it contains color data. This is due to a problem with Ventura Publisher
4.01.

Word 2.0 (Microsoft Corp.):

When printing envelopes from Word 2.0, the message 'The margins of section 1 are
set outside the printable area of the page. Do you want to continue?' may
appear. Click OK and the envelope will print correctly.

WordPerfect 5.2 (WordPerfect Corp.):

When printing with WordPerfect in low memory conditions, some graphic elements
may not appear on the printed page that are present in the document or they may
print as grayscale rather than color. This can be solved by lowering the
resolution of the print, lowering the color depth, turning off screen-matched
color, setting the "Fast Graphics Printing" option off within WordPerfect's
Print Preferences, or increasing the RAM memory of your computer. The message
'The Windows printer driver did not accept the requested paper size. Document
will print on paper size the printer did not select.' may appear when printing
envelopes from WordPerfect. The envelope will still print correctly.

Works 2.0 (Microsoft):

Due to a problem within the printing mechanism of Works, make sure you change the
BJC-600's print resolution, color format, paper size, media type, paper source,
print quality, and Landscape/Portrait orientation using Printers from the
Control Panel. If Works is launched, and any of the settings previously
mentioned is changed from within Works, the output from the BJC-600 will not be
correct.
