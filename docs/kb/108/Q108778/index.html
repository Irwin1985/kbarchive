MORE INFORMATION
================

***************************************************
Features of the HP LaserJet 4 Family Printer Driver

The Hewlett-Packard LASERJET 4 FAMILY PRINTING SYSTEM version
31.V1.26 includes support for the HP LaserJet 4/4M, 4L, 4ML,
4Si/4Si MX, &amp; 4P/4MP printers and the following features:

Support for Graphics Quality
----------------------------

  For the LaserJet 4/4M, 4Si/4Si MX, and 4P/4MP at 600 dpi mode
  the driver supports 600, 300, and 150 dpi. For the LaserJet 4/4M,
  4L, 4ML, 4Si/4Si MX, and 4P/4MP, at 300 dpi mode the driver supports
  300, 150, and 75 dpi. The actual graphics resolution settings are
  denoted by the descriptive terms of High, Medium, and Low rather
  than the actual dpi.

Support for the Internal Intellifont Typefaces
----------------------------------------------

  All the internal Intellifont typefaces in the HP LaserJet 4/4M,
  4L, 4ML, 4Si/4Si MX, 4P/4MP printers are supported in the 19U symbol
  set.

Support for HP-GL/2
-------------------

  Support for HP-GL/2 is in the HPPCL5E PRINTER DRIVER. Under the
  Options Dialog in the Printer Setup, an option of "Graphics Mode" is
  available. Two options are present: HP-GL/2 or Raster. The first
  choice enables HP-GL/2 and raster printing which optimizes print
  performance. The second choice uses raster only. The default graphics
  mode is set to raster for the HP LaserJet 4L. The default mode is set
  to HP-GL/2 for the HP LaserJet 4/4M, 4ML, 4Si/4Si MX, and 4P/MP. Default
  settings for "Graphics Mode" optimize print speed for the given printer.

  If you encounter print difficulties in HP-GL/2 Graphics Mode, it is
  recommended that you change the mode to Raster and try your print job
  again. Additional information on this topic may be found in the help
  files that accompany this driver. Choose Help from the driver dialog
  screens or the HP font installer screens to access the HELP information.

Support for EconoMode (Supported by the LaserJet 4L, 4ML, and 4P/4MP)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Support for EconoMode is in version V1.20 or later within the
  Options Dialog. There are two options available, on or off. With
  EconoMode enabled the output will resemble draft mode, using fewer
  dots in order to conserve toner.

Support for Print Density
-------------------------

  (Supported by the LaserJet 4L, 4ML, and 4P/4MP)

  Print density support is provided in the Options Dialog. Adjust
  the density of the printer according to the desired density. The
  density range is one (lightest) to five (darkest). Dialog Support for
  REt. Another feature added to the Option Dialog is the REt (Resolution
  Enhancement technology) box. The options here are: Light, Medium, Dark,
  and Off for the HP LaserJet 4L, 4ML, and 4P/4MP. Printer Default,
  Light, Medium, Dark, and Off for the HP LaserJet 4/4M. Printer Default,
  ON, and OFF for the LaserJet 4Si/4Si MX. Dialog Support for Resource
  Saving (Supported only by LaserJet 4Si/4Si MX)   This feature, added
  to the main setup dialog box, allows the user to tell the printer
  driver how much memory is set aside for each printer personality
  (PCL and PostScript). This memory is used for saving printer resources
  between printer language switching. The range is 0KB to 99900KB.

Version Information Resources
-----------------------------

  This feature in version 31.V1.20 and later, added to the printer
  driver and its dynamic link libraries, helps eliminate a possible
  mismatch of driver and driver resource files when installing previous
  drivers. If a potential mismatch is detected during driver
  installation, a dialog box that contains a warning is displayed.

Custom Media Size
-----------------

  Custom Media is also supported by this driver for the HP LaserJet
  4ML and 4P/4MP. The size of the custom media in most cases must be set
  in both the application's page setup and the driver setup. For more
  information about minimum and maximum page size, see your users manual.

User Hints
----------

On-line help files are included for the HPPCL5E PRINTER DRIVER and the
HP font installer screens. Choose Help from these screens to access the
HELP information.

System Update Information (Changes to Version 31.V1.26)

Cartridge Support
-----------------

  This driver does not have built-in support for HP font cartridges.
  Font cartridge support is still available by installing the fonts for
  the font cartridge from the autofont support disk shipped with the font
  cartridge,  by contacting Hewlett-Packard's Driver Distribution Center
  by calling 303-339-7009, Monday through Saturday, 24 hours a day. Fax:
  303-330-7655,  or by downloading the PCM (printer cartridge metric)
  files from the HP Peripherals Forum library on CompuServe. The filename
  for the PCM files is L4PCM.EXE. After extracting the files,  the PCM
  files can be installed from the HP Font Installer which is accessed
  from the Control Panel,  Printers,  Setup,  Fonts,  Add Fonts option in
  Windows. Detailed installation instructions are included with the PCM
  files.

300 DPI Compatibility
---------------------

  Additional compatibility has been added to this driver to insure
  compatibility between documents printed with this driver and documents
  printed with the LaserJet III Family drivers. This compatibility is
  automatically enabled when a document is printed with the resolution
  field set to 300 DPI.

Driver Supports Microsoft Draw Image Imported in Word in Monochrome
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  Graphics can be imported as both black and white or as monochrome.
  Monochrome is actually purple and white. The driver has been modified
  to accepted monochrome as well.
