The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Telephony Software Development Kit (SDK), version 1.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, on platform(s):
      - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

TAPI.DLL will pre-validate the device ID parameter before passing it onto the
service provider. However, the ATSP sample source code provided with the TAPI
(Telephony application programming interface) SDK, returns LINEERR_BADDEVICEID
for calls that take device IDs as a parameter:

     TSPI_lineNegotiateTSPIVersion
     TSPI_lineConfigDialog
     TSPI_lineGetAddressCaps
     TSPI_lineOpen

The documentation correctly indicates LINEERR_BADDEVICEID is not a valid return
value for these functions.

SYMPTOMS
========

None. Because TAPI.DLL catches the bad device ID before it is passed to the
service provider, the code in ATSP is never executed.

CAUSE
=====

The code in the ATSP sample is an artifact of an earlier (beta) version of
TAPI.DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not put code that returns LINERR_BADDEVICEID in your service provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In general, TAPI pre-validates many parameters, and the documentation explicitly
indicates only those cases where a parameter is not pre- validated. Even so,
there are certain places in the sample service provider in which the return
codes still exist for pre-validated parameters. For example, line handles are
supposed to be pre-validated, but functions in the sample service provider still
have code that returns LINEERR_INVALLINEHANDLE.

This code is to handle rare race conditions where TAPI.DLL "thinks" that a line
handle is still valid but the service provider doesn't think that the line
handle is still valid. This race condition occurs only if the provider issues
the LINE_CLOSE message, indicating the provider has closed the line, and still
has messages in TAPI.DLL's internal queue waiting to be processed. If this
happens while TAPI.DLL is processing a function call from an application that
uses a handle that the provider made invalid when the provider issued the
message, TAPI.DLL will validate the handle from the application, and therefore
think the handle was OK, and the provider would have to reject the handle.

This situation should be a very rare occurrence because issuing LINE_CLOSE
messages is very rare, and because the situation is most likely to occur only as
the result of the user modifying the driver setup through the Control Panel. It
is unlikely that some other TAPI function would be called for that same line at
the same instant.
