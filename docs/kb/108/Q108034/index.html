The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information about installing Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 with a Banyan VINES network. The following versions of Banyan VINES
network operating system software are supported with Windows for Workgroups
3.11:

  Banyan VINES 4.11 (rev.5)
  Banyan VINES 5.00 (rev.5)
  Banyan VINES 5.52 (rev.5) (Token Ring and Ethernet Support)

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 provides no files to support connectivity to the
Banyan VINES network. To upgrade your current installation to Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, you must first have an existing working connection to a Banyan
VINES server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before installing Windows for Workgroups 3.11, the Banyan server must be updated
with all the appropriate patches and modifications. Banyan patches are available
on CompuServe in the Banyan forum (type "go banyan" [without the quotation
marks] at the ! prompt). If you have any questions about Banyan-related files,
or if you are not sure if you have the latest patches available for your
installation, call Banyan VINES technical support.

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup recognizes Banyan VINES connectivity and
maintains it as the secondary network. Installation should be seamless with no
further action required by the user.

As with previous versions of Windows, it is necessary to be able to log on to
Banyan VINES from MS-DOS before Windows connectivity can be ensured.

The load order of the drivers in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is important for
maintaining VINES connectivity. If there are any problems during the upgrade
and/or the Banyan login screen does not appear as usual after rebooting, check
for error messages during the boot process and check the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to
ensure the Banyan VINES files are loading and are in the correct order. The
correct files and their order in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file are:

Order in AUTOEXEC.BAT       Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------

C:\WINDOWS\NET INITIALIZE   This command is for Windows for Workgroups
                           3.11. It allows loading the files into memory
                           without invoking them.

CD\&lt;BANYAN FILES&gt;           This command changes to the directory where
                           the Banyan files are located. This is necessary
                           because Banyan cannot read the full path and
                           must be in the appropriate directory to load
                           the file.

BAN /NC                     Loads BAN.EXE without initializing Banyan's
                           communications hardware on the system.

NDISBAN                     Loads the NDIS-specific portion of the VINES
                           software.

                           NOTE: If you are using a Token Ring network
                           and Banyan VINES 5.52 (rev.5) you should use
                           NDTOKBAN.COM instead of NDISBAN.COM. For more
                           information on query on the following words in
                           the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

                              WORKGROUPS and NDISBAN.COM

REDIRALL                    Loads REDIRALL.EXE, which is redirector support
                           for all versions of DOS.

C:\WINDOWS\NET START        This command from Windows starts the network
                           software.

ARSWAIT                     This command "Address Resolution Server Wait,"
                           holds further processing until your computer
                           has been assigned a network address by a
                           server. After it sees that your computer has
                           received a network address from the network, it
                           exits and allows your computer to continue.
                           This function is normally built into VINES
                           native drivers, but NDIS requires that this
                           functionality be added after the NDIS driver
                           BAN.EXE is loaded.

Z:LOGIN                     Brings up the Banyan VINES login screen.

If there are no error messages at startup, but you are having problems in Windows
for Workgroups with VINES connectivity, check the SYSTEM.INI file.

SYSTEM.INI File Entries
-----------------------

The following entries should be made to the SYSTEM.INI file when you install
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with Banyan VINES connectivity:

  [boot]
  secondnet=Z:vines.drv

  [boot.description]
  secondnet.drv=Banyan VINES (version x.xx(x))

  [386Enh]
  secondnet=z:vvinesd.386

  [Network]
  multinet=vines411
