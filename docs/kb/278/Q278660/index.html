-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Client User Token account (SMSCliToknAcct&amp;) may be locked out of your
domain.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Systems Management Server (SMS) client workstation
contains certain third-party drivers. This issue is not caused by SMS; instead,
this issue is caused by drivers that attempt to access resources across the
network. These drivers attempt to locate files on the local computer. If the
files cannot be found, the drivers continue to search the location that the
system path variable points to. If the system path contains references to any
network locations, these locations are searched as well.

This issue can also occur if an account lockout policy is enabled in the domain.
In this case, the &lt;Domain&gt;\SMSCliToknAcct&amp; account is locked out
because the local and domain accounts have different passwords.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, capture network traffic, frames, or packets to
determine which files the drivers are attempting to locate. You can also use
Network Monitor to perform a trace. For additional information about how to use
Network Monitor, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q148942 How to Capture Network Traffic with Network Monitor

  Q232247 Using Network Monitor to Capture Traffic Using a Remote Agent

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following audio drivers have been reported to cause this issue:

- Crystal Audio

- Yamaha

- Creative

- ESS

NOTE: Not all versions of these drivers exhibit this issue.

For additional information about how audio drivers are used with the
SMSCliToknAcct account, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248880 SMS: SMSCliToknAcct Account Accesses Network from Computers with
  Compaq's Auddrive.sys Driver Installed

You can use the SMSCliToknAcct&amp; account to create user tokens on client
computers. On computers that are not domain controllers, SMS grants permissions
to this account as they are needed and deletes these permissions immediately
after they are used. On domain controllers, the permissions for this account
persist as long as the SMS client services exist in the site. This account is
used to start installations in several specific situations:

- If the "Run with administrative rights" option is enabled for a program that
  is not also configured to use the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 client software
  installation account.

- If the program is set to run even if the user is not logged on and the
  program is not configured to use the Windows NT client software installation
  account.

- If the program is set to run only when users are not logged on and the
  program is not configured to use the Windows NT client software installation
  account.
