-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) to forward or reply to a message
and the message travels over an Internet Mail Service connector, the message may
not arrive at the destination address. You also may not receive a non-delivery
report (NDR).

The following message may be logged in the Application event log on the Internet
Mail Service computer:

  Event ID: 4123
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Description: A message passing through the Internet Mail Service has been
  intentionally dropped. This is most likely an admin notification (message
  describing mail failure) and out of office notification (OOF), or an
  automatic reply from a user's mailbox. Dropping of OOF messages and automatic
  replies is configurable in the admin pages. The gateway must always drop
  notification to the administrator, since they often cause mail loops.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because, by default, the Internet Mail Service is set not
to allow autoforwarded messages to external addresses. When OWA forwards or
replies to a message that was autoforwarded, OWA leaves a field on the message
of PR_Auto_Forwarded. The Internet Mail Service detects the PR_Auto_Forwarded
field and does not let the message through.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Outlook Web Access
