SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to remove corrupted public folder views that multiple
users share without deleting the view for all users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a public folder, you can set custom views. These views exist in
the information store as associated messages for the public folder. The user who
creates the shared view is the owner of that view. When a view becomes
corrupted, you can run Microsoft Outlook with the /cleanviews switch to delete
this view. If the owner of a shared view runs this switch, it removes that view
for all users who share that view.

To run the /cleanviews switch and not delete that view for everyone, you must
first remove permissions from the owner:

1. From the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, right-click the
  public folder where the view was created, click Properties, and then click
  Client Permissions.

2. If this user is the only owner of the folder, add another user as the owner.

  NOTE: This step is temporary.

3. After you grant ownership to another user, remove the original owner. Ensure
  that the user does not have permissions, which includes Group Membership.

4. Verify that the user does not have ownership to any public folders where
  shared views have been created by that user.

5. Run Outlook with the /cleanviews switch.

  IMPORTANT: It is critical to ensure that the user does not have permissions;
  if the user has permissions, any views that were created by this user are
  removed.

6. After you run the /cleanviews switch, add the original user with ownership
  permissions.
