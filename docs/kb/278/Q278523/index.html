-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Enterprise Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server or Exchange 2000 Enterprise
Server (hereafter referred to collectively as Exchange 2000), a special account
is created that was previously used to facilitate the processing of event
synchronization scripts. The account name is EUSER_EXSTOREEVENT, and the
password is set to a simple hard-coded password. If you attempt to deploy
Exchange 2000 in environments with complex password requirements, you may
experience failures during Setup, and you may receive the following error
message:

  [14:22:18] bad member index -1 CAtomBaseMDB::ScCreateStoreEventAccount
  (K:\admin\src\udog\exsetdata\components\server\a_basemdb.cxx:290) Error code
  0XC00703E5 (997): Overlapped I/O operation is in progress.

CAUSE
=====


The Setup failure is caused because the hard-coded password does not meet the
password complexity requirements in some environments. You will experience this
failure when you attempt to install an affected version of Exchange 2000 (see
the "Status" section for version details) on a domain controller or member
server with a strong password policy enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before You Run Setup
--------------------

To minimize the security risk that this account represents, manually create an
account that uses the same name, EUSER_EXSTOREEVENT, before you run Setup, and
give the account a password that meets the password complexity requirements of
your company. During installation, Setup will detect that this account already
exists and will not attempt to create it or change the password.

When You Install Exchange 2000 on a Member Server:

Create the account as a disabled local user account. The following steps outline
how to create an account in the local account database:

1. Start the Computer Management MMC snap-in by clicking Start, pointing to
  Programs, pointing to Administrative Tools, and then clicking Computer
  Management on the member server that Exchange 2000 will be installed on.

2. Expand the Local Users and Groups container, and then click the Users
  container.

3. On the Action menu, click New User.

4. In the New User dialog box, fill in the following information:

  Username: EUSER_EXSTOREEVENT
  Password: &lt; A password that meets you company's complexity policy&gt;

5. Click to select the "Account is disabled" check box, and then click Create.

When You Install Exchange 2000 on a Domain Controller:

Create the EUSER_EXSTOREEVENT account in Active Directory, and then disable the
account. The following steps outline how to create an account in Active
Directory:

1. Start the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap-in by clicking Start,
  pointing to Programs, pointing to Administrative Tools, and then clicking
  Active Directory User and Computers on the domain controller for the domain
  in which Exchange 2000 will be installed.

2. Click the Users container.

3. On the Action menu, click New, and then click User.

4. In the New User dialog box, fill in the following information:

  Full Name: EUSER_EXSTOREEVENT
  User Logon Name: EUSER_EXSTOREEVENT

5. Click Next.

6. Provide a password that meets your company's password complexity policy, and
  then confirm it.

7. Click to select the "Account is disabled" check box.

8. Click Next, and then click Finish to create the specified account.

After Setup
-----------

Manual Procedure:

After you complete Exchange 2000 Setup, Microsoft recommends that you delete this
account to minimize the potential security risk that the well-known account
represents. If you are using this account for other reasons, at a minimum, reset
the account password to ensure the security of this account.

Tool to Automate Procedure:

As an alternative to the manual process described above, you can obtain the
following tool from the following link to automatically correct this security
vulnerability: The following file is available for download from the Microsoft
Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Q278523engi.exe now
  (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=25866)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

- This tool requires the currently logged-on user to have either Administrator
  privileges to the local computer for member servers, or Domain Administrator
  privileges for domain controllers. This tool extracts itself into the C:\Temp
  folder. After it has been extracted, follow the directions outlined after the
  extraction is complete.

- For member servers: This tool searches the local account database, and
  deletes the account in question. Microsoft recommends that you run the
  utility from each member server on which Exchange 2000 has been installed.

- For a domain controller with Exchange 2000 installed: Run this utility on a
  domain controller. It deletes the account from Active Directory. In
  environments with multiple domain controllers, this account may continue to
  exist on other domain controllers until Active Directory replication has
  completed.

IMPORTANT: This tool only deletes the account in question. It does not prevent
the original setup error from occurring. You must still follow the manual
process of creating, and then disabling the account before you run Setup to
avoid the setup error. After Setup is complete, you can manually delete this
account or remove it using the tool provided.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Exchange 2000. This problem
was first corrected in Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server Service Pack 1.

The following Exchange 2000 installation media are affected by this
vulnerability:

- Exchange 2000 Server CDs without "Rev A" printed on the CD on the line below
  the Part No. (see upper right quadrant)

- Exchange 2000 Enterprise Server CDs without "Rev A" printed on the CD below
  the Part No. (see upper right quadrant)

- Exchange 2000 Server and Exchange 2000 Enterprise Server included with the
  October 2000 Select CD shipment

For the Exchange 2000 evaluation edition, and as another method to test for this
vulnerability, please use the Filever.exe tool, available with Exchange 2000, to
check the version of Exsetdata.dll. If the version is equal to 6.0.4417.5, you
are affected by the vulnerability.

Example of Filever.exe usage:

  &lt;CD drive&gt;\Support\Utils\I386&gt;filever \setup\i386\exsetdata.dll

If the resulting output contains the following version number (in bold below),
you are affected by this vulnerability:

  -r--- W321&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;DLL ENU&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;6.0.4417.5 shp&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;2,507,024 08-16-2000 exsetdata.dll

In addition, Exchange 2000 Service Pack 1 includes an additional check for this
account and if detected, it will delete the account.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This account represents a security vulnerability if you deploy Exchange 2000
because the account name is well known. In the released version of Exchange
2000, this account is no longer necessary to process event scripts, and should
be deleted after Setup is completed.
