SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to optimize performance in Microsoft Combat Flight
Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To optimize performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2, find the best balance for
your computer between game performance and sound and video quality.

Performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2 depends on both the features that you
select and the configuration of your computer. A set of features that you select
on one computer may not result in the same level of performance as an identical
set of features on a different computer.

A computer with a fast Pentium processor, a large amount of memory, a 3-D
accelerator video adapter, and updated device drivers can maintain a higher
level of performance than a computer that barely meets the minimum system
requirements.

To optimize performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2, use the following methods.

Quit Unnecessary Programs
-------------------------

To increase the amount of available system resources, quit all unnecessary
programs that are running on your computer before you start Combat Flight
Simulator 2.

To quit all unnecessary programs, use the appropriate method for your version of
Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

2. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or Systray
  (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End Task.

  If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not responding,
  click End Task again.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on
  your computer.

Microsoft Windows 2000:

1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC.

2. On the Applications tab, click any program, and then click End Task.

  Repeat this step to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your
  computer.

3. Quit Windows Task Manager.

NOTE: Some programs start automatically every time you restart your computer. For
information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
documentation for the program.

Optimize Your Hardware Configuration
------------------------------------

To optimize your hardware configuration:

1. Contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to inquire about how to obtain
  and install the latest video driver for your video adapter.

2. Contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain
  and install the latest sound driver for your sound card.

For information about how to contact the manufacturers of your video adapter and
your sound card, click the appropriate article number below to view the article

Configure the Program for Optimal Performance
---------------------------------------------

To configure Combat Flight Simulator 2 for optimal performance, reduce scenery
complexity and display preferences in Combat Flight Simulator 2 to their minimum
settings. To do this:

1. On the Combat Flight Simulator 2 startup screen, click Settings.

2. Click "Scenery library".

3. Move the "Scenery object density" slider to the left to change the setting to
  Sparse.

4. In the "Areas list" box, click a line under the "Scenery area" column, and
  then click Move Up or Move Down to change the Priority level for that scenery
  area.

5. Click OK.

6. Under Display, click Advanced Settings.

7. Click the Hardware tab.

8. Make sure that the "Enable hardware acceleration" check box is selected, if
  it is available.

  If the Enable Hardware Acceleration check box is not available, your video
  adapter may not support 3-D hardware acceleration. Contact your hardware
  manufacturer for more information.

  NOTE: Hardware acceleration may affect performance in different ways,
  depending on the video adapter that is installed in the computer. If you
  disable hardware acceleration in Combat Flight Simulator 2, performance may
  improve with some video adapters, and performance may decline with other
  video adapters.

9. Click "No filtering".

10. Click to clear the following check boxes:

   - MIP mapping
   - Anti-alias
   - T and L

11. In the Resolution box, click a lower resolution setting.

12. Click the "Image quality" tab.

13. Click to clear the following check boxes:

   - Aircraft shadows
   - Ground scenery shadows
   - Detail texturing
   - High detail virtual cockpit

14. Move the following sliders to the left to reduce the corresponding settings:

   - DEM density level
   - Max terrain texture size
   - Terrain complexity level
   - Max object texture size
   - Maximum visibility level
   - Effects quality

15. Move the "LOD target frame rate" slider to the right to increase the setting
  to 24 FPS or higher.

16. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Enable Features or Increase Settings in the Program
---------------------------------------------------

To complete optimizing performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2, monitor the
frame rate in the game as you increase one graphic quality setting or enable one
graphic feature at a time. For information about how to change graphic settings,
please see the "Configure the Program for Optimal Performance" method in this
article. Start with your favorite features, and stop before the minimum frame
rate decreases to a level that you consider unacceptable.

The frame rate is the speed at which images or frames are drawn on the screen,
and is measured in frames per second (fps). As the frame rate increases, so does
the realism and smoothness of motion in the game.

To monitor the frame rate in Combat Flight Simulator 2, press SHIFT+Z twice. The
frame rate is displayed as a number in the upper left corner of the screen. When
you press SHIFT+Z, Combat Flight Simulator 2 cycles through the following
displays:

- Coordinate data, heading, and speed
- Frame rate
- Coordinate data, heading, speed, and frame rate
- Turn off the coordinate and frame rate display

Games such as Combat Flight Simulator 2 create the illusion of motion by drawing
a sequence of still images on the screen so rapidly that the human eye sees only
one continuous moving picture. The illusion of motion (also known as persistance
of vision) begins at around 15 fps. Below 15 fps, the illusion of motion breaks
down, and the game begins to resemble a fast slide show. Most silent movies run
at 18 fps, theatrical movies run at 24 fps, and television runs at 30 fps.

NOTE: The fastest frame rate that you can achieve is determined by the refresh
rate of your monitor. If your monitor's refresh rate is set to 72 Hz, your
maximum viewable frame rate is 72 fps. If the calculated frame rate on your
screen is higher than the refresh rate of your monitor, take advantage of that
extra computing power by increasing your graphic quality settings until the
calculated frame rate matches or falls below the refresh rate for your monitor.

To determine the graphic settings that you want to increase and the graphic
features that you want to enable, refer to the following list of graphic
settings and features, which are sorted by their effect on performance.

Settings and features that can increase performance:

- Full Screen mode:

   - Description: To increase performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2, run the
     game in Full Screen mode instead of Window mode.
   - To switch screen modes: Press ALT+ENTER.

     enable the "Trilinear filtering" option, the "No filtering" and "Bilinear
     filtering" options are automatically disabled.

- MIP mapping:

   - Description: Improves image quality without reducing performance by using
     textures with different levels of detail. Nearby objects are rendered with
     large, detailed textures, and remote objects are rendered with small,
     sketchy textures.
   - Possible issues: With some 3-D video adapters, textures and screen text in
     the game may be missing, distorted, discolored, or blurred when "MIP
     mapping" is enabled.
   - Video support: Most 3-D video adapters and 3-D accelerator cards.
   - Location: On the Hardware tab of the Display Settings screen.

   - Notes: For best appearance when you enable "Aircraft shadows", select a
     Resolution setting that uses a 32-bit color palette.

- Detail texturing:

   - Description: Enable this feature to improve the depth and continuity of
     ground textures in the game.
   - Possible issues: With some video adapters, ground textures may flash or
     blink when this feature is enabled, and you may see texture seams or
     square patterns on the ground.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To enable: Click to select.
   - Notes: Some 3-D video adapters work better when this feature is enabled.

- Effects quality:

   - Description: Adjusts the level of special effects detail in the game.

     effects such as smoke, aircraft damage, and explosions.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Move the slider to the right to increase the setting, or to the
     left to decrease the setting.

Settings and features that may moderately affect performance:

- Resolution:

   - Description: Changes the resolution and color palette of the game screen.
   - Performance: Moderate affect on performance when you select a different
     screen resolution. Slight affect on performance when you select a
     different color palette.
   - Location: On the Hardware tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Click a different screen resolution setting in the Resolution
     box.
   - Notes: Cockpit instruments look best at a resolution of "800 x 600 x 16"
     or higher, and the terrain always looks better as you increase the
     resolution. If you experience significant performance problems, reduce the
     resolution to "640 x 480 x 16".

- DEM density level:

   - Description: Determines the maximum level of detail for terrain elevation
     data in the game. Increasing this setting improves terrain elevation
     accuracy.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Move the slider to the right to increase the setting, or to the
     left to decrease the setting.

- Max terrain texture size:

   - Description: Determines the maximum size of the terrain textures in the
     game. Increase this setting to improve terrain appearance.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Move the slider to the right to increase the setting, or to the
     left to decrease the setting.

- Max object texture size:

   - Description: Determines the maximum size of the object textures in the
     game. Increase this setting to improve the appearance of aircraft in the
     game.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Move the slider to the right to increase the setting, or to the
     left to decrease the setting.

- Maximum visibility level:

   - Description: Adjusts the maximum visibility distance in the game.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Move the slider to the right to increase the setting, or to the
     left to decrease the setting.

   - Description: Enable this feature to make ground objects in the game cast
     their shadows on the terrain.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To enable: Click to select.

- High detail virtual cockpit:

   - Description: Increases the level of cockpit detail and improves the
     readability of your aircraft's instruments when you use the Virtual
     Cockpit view.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To enable: Click to select.

Settings and features that may severely affect performance:

- Anti-alias:

   - Description: Smooths the edges of objects in the game by rendering the
     screen at a higher resolution than the actual screen resolution setting,
     and then reducing the rendered image to the actual screen resolution
     before displaying the image on the screen.
   - Possible issues: With some 3-D video adapters, the game may quit
     unexpectedly or stop responding (hang) when the "Anti-alias" feature is
     enabled.
     In addition, you may see color banding in the sky with some video adapters.
     To resolve this issue, change the Resolution setting in the game to use a
     32-bit color mode. For example, click "800 x 600 x 32" in the Resolution
     box.
   - Video support: Supported only by 3-D video adapters based on the 3Dfx
     Voodoo5 or later chip set, the ATI Radeon or later chip set, or the nVidia
     GeForce2 or later chip set.
   - Location: On the Hardware tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To enable: Click to select.
   - Notes: This feature can severely decrease performance.

- Terrain complexity level:

   - Description: Adjusts the complexity of the terrain on the screen. When you
     decrease terrain complexity, you increase the probability that the terrain
     displayed on the screen may not match the terrain elevation data. When you
     increase terrain complexity, you increase the detail of the the terrain
     displayed on the screen, and improve the accuracy of the match between the
     terrain displayed on the screen and the terrain elevation data.
   - Possible issues: When you set terrain complexity to a low level, you may
     notice that the terrain shifts and pops more often as the program attempts
     to make the terrain match the terrain elevation data. To resolve this
     issue, increase the "Terrain complexity level" setting.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Move the slider to the right to increase the setting, or to the
     left to decrease the setting.
   - Notes: When you increase this setting, do so in small increments. This
     setting can have a drastic effect on performance.

Settings and features that you can use to acheive a specific level of performance:

- LOD target frame rate:

   - Description: This setting automatically adjusts the LOD for the textures
     and objects on the screen to maintain the selected frame rate. When you
     increase this setting, the game decreases the LOD for the textures and
     objects on the screen to increase performance to the selected frame rate.
     When you decrease this setting, the game increases the LOD for the
     textures and objects on the screen to reduce performance to the selected
     frame rate. Combat Flight Simulator 2 determines the default "LOD target
     frame rate" setting automatically, based on your configuration.
   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
   - To adjust: Move the "LOD target frame rate" slider to the frame rate that
     you want to use.
   - Notes: To use this setting, you must select the "Auto-performance
     adjustment (affects graphics)" check box on the main Settings screen in
     Combat Flight Simulator 2.
