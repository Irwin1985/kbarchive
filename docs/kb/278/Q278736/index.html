-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.0 SP1, 5.0 SP2, 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The article describes two methods that you can use to work around the move
mailbox command in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator Program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Before you begin either of the methods described in this section, make
sure that you have a verified backup in place. Also, it is recommended that you
test the methods first with a test mailbox.

Method One: Using Header.exe
----------------------------

This workaround is useful if you have only a few users.

NOTE: Header.exe is a BackOffice Resource Kit tool. Refer to the Resource Kit
Support Policy in the last section of this article for more information about
support limitations. It is recommended that you read the documentation to this
tool.

1. Start Microsoft Outlook, and then move of the contents of the mailbox to .pst
  files.

2. Export the mailbox's rules:

  a. Click Inbox, and then click Rules Wizard on the Tools menu.

  b. Click Options, and then click Export Rules.

  c. Type the path and a file name where you want to save the set of rules, and
     then click Save.

3. Export the folder properties for this mailbox:

  a. Start Header.exe that is located in the BackOffice Resource Kit.

  b. Mark all available attributes.

  c. Click Add, click File, and then type the path and the file name.

  d. Click Open, and then click Generate.

  e. Start the Administrator program.

  f. On the Tools menu, click Directory Export.

  g. Click the home server of the mailboxes that you want to export.

  h. Click Export file, type the name and path of the file that you have just
     created by using Header.exe, and then click Open.

  i. Click the Recipients container, and then click OK.

  j. In the Export objects section, click to select the Mailboxes check box,
     and then click Export.

  k. Open the export file using Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Notepad, and then
     delete all the entries for mailboxes that you do not want to move.

  l. Change the home server, home-MDB and home-MTA to the appropriate server,
     and then save the file.

4. Delete the appropriate mailbox on the source server after you verify that you
  have successfully completed the preceding steps.

5. Import the mailbox properties on the new home server:

  a. Go to the Administrator program, and then click Directory Import on the
     Tools menu.

  b. Enter the domain of the source server, and then as the Exchange Server
     computer, enter the source server.

  c. Click Import File, type the name and the path of the file that you
     modified in Notepad or Excel, and then click Import.

6. Use Outlook to import the data of the .pst file.

7. Use the Rules Wizard in Outlook to import the rules.

Method Two: Using Exmerge.exe and Header.exe
--------------------------------------------

This method is useful if you are moving a large number of users (over 50).

NOTE: Exmerge.exe is a BackOffice Resource Kit tool. Refer to the Resource Kit
Support Policy in the next section for more information about support
limitations. It is recommended that you read the documentation to this tool.

1. Log on using an Exchange service account.

2. Export the properties of the mailbox (to do so, refer step three in the
  preceding method).

3. Start Exmerge.exe on the source server, and then click Two steps method.

4. Click the source server and the mailboxes that you want to move, and then
  click Next.

5. Click a folder, and then use the default settings.

6. Delete the mailbox on the source server.

7. Import the properties of the mailbox on the target server (to do so, refer to
  step five in the preceding method).

8. Send mail to each of the new mailboxes to activate them. After you activate
  the mailboxes, the mailboxes are displayed in the Exmerge window (the second
  step of Exmerge.exe).

  NOTE: If you want to use localized names for the Outlook folders (for example
  Inbox), modify the Exmerge.ini file. The following example describes German
  translations:

  [EXMERGE]
  MapFolderNameToLocalisedName = 1
  [Folder Name Mappings]
  Inbox = Posteingang
  Delete Items = Geloschte Objekte
  Sent Items = Gesendete Objekte
  Outbox = Postausgang

  For more information, refer to Exmerge.doc.

9. Mark the mailboxes, and then type the name of the folder where you saved the
  Exmerge files (&lt;Filename&gt;.pst).
