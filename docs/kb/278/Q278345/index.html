The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In a large Windows 2000-based Active Directory or in a Windows NT-based domain
environment, the Systems Management Server (SMS) Client service may not start on
a Windows 2000-based or Windows NT-based domain controller. Additionally,
account and policy replication traffic may increase.

CAUSE
=====

When the SMS Client service starts on a domain controller, the Client service
modifies the SMSCliToknAcct&amp; user account group membership, user rights, and
account comment. The Client service then waits for the synchronization of the
comment to verify that the account and user rights are properly set for this
account. This account is used to obtain a token to start the SMS Client
processes, such as the Software Inventory and Software Distribution agents.

In a large Windows 2000-based Active Directory or in a Windows NT-based domain
environment, replication may take longer than expected to complete. Another
domain controller client may start the SMS Client service which also modifies
the shared SMSCliToknAcct&amp; user account. When this modification occurs, the
first client does not receive the replicated comment information and the Client
service may stop responding (hang).

If the Client service hangs, other SMS Client services on other domain
controllers may not start and may generate additional replication traffic.

NOTE: Although this article primarily references replication traffic issues in a
Windows 2000-based Active Directory environment, similar behaviors can occur in
a Windows NT 4.0-based domain environment that has a large number of domain
controllers.
