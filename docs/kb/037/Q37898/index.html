This article summarizes selected textbooks from Microsoft Press and
other sources that are useful references for BASIC programmers. This
information applies to QuickBASIC versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, 2.00,
2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS; to Microsoft BASIC
Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2; and to
Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00
and 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2. Some references also apply to
Microsoft GW-BASIC versions 3.20, 3.22, and 3.23.

The following book applies to general Microsoft BASIC:

   "BASIC Computer Adventures"
   by David Ahl, published by Microsoft Press (1986)

   This book contains 10 sample programs (games) to demonstrate general
   concepts of BASIC programming. All of the programs in this book are
   written in standard Microsoft BASIC for IBM PC compatibles
   (including Microsoft GW-BASIC, IBM BASICA, and COMPAQ BASICA). The
   programs also work in Microsoft BASIC for the Apple Macintosh.

The following newsletter applies to GW-BASIC and BASICA:

   "The BASIC Teacher"
   2814 19th Street
   San Francisco, CA  94110

   This monthly newsletter discusses learning and teaching BASIC. Each
   issue contains tutorials, problems, solutions, and reviews. The
   newsletter material is written by the authors of the following
   book:

   "GW-BASIC Made Easy"
   by Bob Albrecht and Don Inman, published by Osborne McGraw-Hill
   (1989)

The following Microsoft Press books apply specifically to QuickBASIC
for IBM Personal Computers and compatibles:

1. "Microsoft QuickBASIC Programmer's Toolbox"
   by John Clark Craig, published by Microsoft Press (1988)

   Contains more than 250 subprograms and functions that address common
   and unusual programming tasks, including the following:

   a. ANSI.SYS screen control.
   b. Mouse support.
   c. Pop-up windows.
   d. Graphics.
   e. String and bit manipulations.
   f. Editing routines.
   g. Engineering, mathematical, statistical, and random-number
      functions.
   h. Calendar and time routines.
   i. Demonstrations and useful routines written in Microsoft C.
      (This book shows how to write and compile C routines and how
      to create a Quick library from those routines.)

2. "Microsoft QuickBASIC," 2nd Edition
   by Douglas Hergert, published by Microsoft Press (1988)

   This is the best resource for programming with QuickBASIC version
   4.00 for IBM PC compatibles. It provides a concise survey of the
   new features of QuickBASIC version 4.00. Special emphasis is placed
   on the editing environment, record structures, user-defined TYPEs,
   constants, additional loop and decision structures, and recursion.
   There are six programs to help illustrate QuickBASIC commands,
   functions, and techniques.

3. "Microsoft QuickBASIC"
   by Douglas Hergert, published by Microsoft Press (1987)

   This book provides a good introduction to QuickBASIC versions 2.00,
   2.01, and 3.00 for IBM PC compatibles. It covers modular
   programming, subroutines, include files, and general programming
   practices.

4. "Microsoft QuickBASIC: Programmer's Quick Reference"
   by Kris Jamsa, published by Microsoft Press (1989)

   For every Microsoft QuickBASIC statement and function, this quick
   reference contains a brief description, complete syntax, details on
   parameters, and usually a sample program fragment.

5. "Learn BASIC Now"
   by Halvorson and Rygmyr, published by Microsoft Press (1990)

   This book includes the QuickBASIC interpreter (QBI.EXE) on disk,
   and provides step-by-step instructions for learning BASIC
   programming.

6. "The Waite Group's Microsoft QuickBASIC Bible"
   by Mitchell Waite, published by Microsoft Press (1990)

   This is the definitive reference for Microsoft QuickBASIC versions
   through 4.50 (940 pages) for both novice and professional
   programmers. Since the 4.50 product's language reference is mostly
   in the online help, you may want a printed reference such as this.
