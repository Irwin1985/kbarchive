-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
- Microsoft Windows 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 to Windows for
Workgroups or Windows version 3.11, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

  Windows 3.x could not be located on your computer. This version of Windows
  for Workgroups requires that Windows 3.x already be installed. You must
  either install Windows 3.x onto your computer, or purchase the complete
  version of Windows for Workgroups.

-or-

  Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 could not be found on your system.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if:

- You do not have the appropriate version of Windows 3.0 or 3.1 installed on
  the computer for Windows or Windows for Workgroups to install properly.

  -or-

- You are using an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of Windows 3.1
  that was preinstalled and has the WIN.COM file renamed. For example, this
  problem occurs on some Toshiba laptops (because WIN.COM is renamed as
  WIN_.COM). This problem also occurs on some Acer Power 500 computers (because
  WIN.COM is renamed as WINDOWS.COM).

  -or-


- The [boot.description] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the line:

        SETUPSTATE=1

  -or-

- The SHELL= entry in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file refers to
  WINSETUP.EXE.


WORKAROUND
==========

1. Install the appropriate version of Windows on your computer.

2. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the SYSTEM.INI file and delete
  the "SETUPSTATE=" line from the [boot.description] section of the file (if it
  is present).

3. Change the "SHELL=" line in the [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file from

  shell=winsetup.exe

  to:

  shell=progman.exe

4. Save and then close the file.

5. Install the upgrade or add-on again.

If you have an OEM version of Windows, you may need to use the following steps:

1. Rename WIN_.COM or WINDOWS.COM (in the Windows directory) to WIN.COM.

2. Run Setup.

3. Rename WIN.COM back to WIN_.COM or WINDOWS.COM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 and the add-on for Microsoft
Windows version 3.1 require that the appropriate version of Windows 3.0 or 3.1
be installed on the computer for Windows for Workgroups to install properly. The
upgrade and add-on Setup programs allow the Windows for Workgroups files to be
placed in the existing Windows directory or in a new directory.

The upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 users installs a full version of
Windows for Workgroups on computers running Windows 3.0. The add-on for
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 installs a full version of Windows for Workgroups
on computers running Windows 3.1.
