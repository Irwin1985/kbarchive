SUMMARY
=======

The downloadable Ga0650.exe file contains Dvorak keyboard layouts that make the
most frequently typed characters on a keyboard more accessible to people who
have difficulty using the standard "QWERTY" layout.

There are three Dvorak layouts: one for two-handed users, one for people who type
only with their left hand, and one for people who type only with their right
hand. The left- or right-hand keyboard layouts can also be used by people who
type with a wand.

NOTE: The single-handed layouts are designed for computers that use Intel
x86-based processors, and are not compatible with MIPS or other non-Intel- based
computers running Windows NT.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Microsoft distributes Dvorak keyboard layouts that make the most frequently typed
characters on a keyboard more accessible to people who have difficulty using the
standard "QWERTY" layout. There are three Dvorak layouts: one for two-handed
users, one for people who type only with their left hand, and one for people who
type only with their right hand. The left- or right-hand keyboard layouts can
also be used by people who type with a wand.

The enclosed disk includes files that provide new keyboard layouts for Microsoft
MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, or 6.22, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or
3.11, Windows NT 3.1, 3.5, or 3.51, and Microsoft Windows 95.

This application note explains how to install these layouts and restore your
original layout. It also provides illustrations of the layouts.

WHAT IS A KEYBOARD LAYOUT?
--------------------------

A keyboard layout is a map or a definition of how keys are laid out on your
keyboard. The keyboard layout you use is determined by software in your
computer. The letters on your keys indicate the standard layout for your
keyboard. There are many different keyboard layouts in use throughout the world.
The one you ordinarily use depends on the country you are in or the language you
use.

Dvorak Keyboard Layouts
-----------------------

Dvorak keyboard layouts are based on designs created by Dr. August Dvorak, a
professor at the University of Washington during the 1930s and 1940s. Dr. Dvorak
studied the way people type standard English, and determined the most common
letter combinations. He then designed new keyboard layouts to speed up typing
and reduce fatigue. These layouts, now called Dvorak or simplified keyboard
layouts, were initially developed for two-handed typists. Following World War
II, Dvorak layouts were developed for typists who use the right or left hand
alone.

INSTALLING A DVORAK KEYBOARD LAYOUT FOR MS-DOS
----------------------------------------------

This Application Note provides the Dvorak.sys file. This file supports the Dvorak
keyboard layouts for two-handed and single-handed typists who use MS-DOS 5.0,
6.0, 6.2, 6.21, or 6.22.

To Install a United States (U.S.) Dvorak Keyboard Layout for MS-DOS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk in the
  appropriate floppy disk drive.

  If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service, skip to step
  2. This procedure assumes that you have already downloaded and extracted the
  compressed file.

2. Copy the Dvorak.sys file from the GA0650 disk or from the folder containing
  the file you downloaded from an online service to your MS-DOS directory by
  typing the following command at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing
  ENTER:

  "copy &lt;drive&gt;:\dvorak.sys &lt;destination&gt;" (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the GA0650 disk or the
  folder containing the file you downloaded from an online service and
  &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your MS-DOS files
  reside. For example, if you inserted the GA0650 disk in drive A and your
  MS-DOS directory is called DOS and is on drive C, type the following line at
  the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

  "copy a:\dvorak.sys c:\dos\dvorak.sys" (without the quotation marks)

3. To begin using one of the new keyboard layouts, type the appropriate command
  (as shown in the table below) at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

      Keyboard Layout     Command
      ----------------------------------------------
      Two-handed          keyb dv,,c:\dos\dvorak.sys
      Right-handed        keyb rh,,c:\dos\dvorak.sys
      Left-handed         keyb lh,,c:\dos\dvorak.sys

To load one of these keyboard layouts automatically when your computer starts,
include the appropriate KEYB command in your Autoexec.bat file. The KEYB command
should be placed after a PATH command that includes your MS-DOS directory. If
your Autoexec.bat file includes the WIN or DOSSHELL command, make sure the KEYB
command comes before the WIN or DOSSHELL command.

Once you have loaded one of the Dvorak layouts, you can easily switch between the
Dvorak layout and the U.S. standard layout. To switch back to the U.S. standard
layout, press CTRL+ALT+F1. To switch to the Dvorak layout, press CTRL+ALT+F2.

To Disable the United States (U.S.) Dvorak Keyboard Layout for MS-DOS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To disable the United States (U.S.) Dvorak keyboard layout for MS-DOS, open the
Autoexec.bat file (with a text editor such as MS-DOS Editor), delete the line
with the KEYB command, save the file, and restart your computer.

INSTALLING A DVORAK KEYBOARD LAYOUT FOR WINDOWS 3.1 OR WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Application Note provides the Kbdusr.dll and Kbdusl.dll files. These files
support the Dvorak keyboard layouts for Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
3.1 or 3.11 users who type with the right hand or left hand alone. Windows
already includes the U.S. Dvorak keyboard layout for users who type with two
hands.

NOTE: If you use MS-DOS-based programs with Windows, you must install the Dvorak
layouts for MS-DOS in order to get Dvorak support for those programs. For
instructions, see the previous section, "Installing a Dvorak Keyboard Layout for
MS-DOS."

To Install the U.S. Dvorak Keyboard Layout for Two-Handed Typists
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the International icon. The International
  dialog box appears.

3. In the Keyboard Layout box, click US-Dvorak.

4. Click OK.

To disable the two-handed Dvorak layout and restore your original layout, follow
the steps in the preceding procedure. In step 3, choose your original layout.

To Install a U.S. Dvorak Keyboard Layout for Single-Handed Typists
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk in the
  appropriate floppy disk drive.

  If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service, skip to step
  2. This procedure assumes that you have already downloaded and extracted the
  compressed file.

2. If you want to use the right-handed Dvorak layout, copy the Kbdusr.dll file
  to the Windows\System folder on your hard disk. If you want to use the
  left-handed Dvorak layout, copy the Kbdusl.dll file to the Windows\System
  folder on your hard disk. You can do this by typing the following command at
  the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER:

  "copy &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;progname&gt; &lt;destination&gt;" (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the GA0650 disk or the
  folder containing the file you downloaded from an online service,
  &lt;progname&gt; is Kbdusr.dll for the right-handed layout or Kbdusl.dll for
  the left-handed layout, and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and folder for
  the Windows\System folder.

  For example, if you inserted the GA0650 disk in drive A and your Windows
  folder is called Windows and is on drive C, type one of the following
  commands at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  "copy a:\kbdusr.dll c:\windows\system\kbdusr.dll" (without the quotation
  marks)

  -or-

  "copy a:\kbdusl.dll c:\windows\system\kdbusl.dll" (without the quotation
  marks)

  If you are using a shared copy of Windows that is installed on a network
  server, copy the file to your private Windows folder.

3. Use a text editor, such as Notepad, to open the System.ini file in the
  Windows folder.

4. Find the section that begins with the following line:

  [keyboard]

5. Within the [keyboard] section, find the following line:

  keyboard.dll=

6. Depending on which keyboard layout you want to use, type KBDUSL.DLL or
  KBDUSR.DLL after the equal sign (=). When you are finished, the line should
  look like one of the following lines:

  keyboard.dll=kbdusl.dll

  -or-

  keyboard.dll=kbdusr.dll

7. Save the System.ini file.

8. Quit and then restart Windows.

To Disable the Single-Handed Layout and Restore Your Original Windows Keyboard Layout

4. Click OK.

INSTALLING A DVORAK KEYBOARD LAYOUT FOR WINDOWS NT 3.1, 3.5, OR 3.51
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To Install a U.S. Dvorak Keyboard Layout for Two-Handed Typists
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Run Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the International icon. The International
  dialog box appears.

3. In the Keyboard Layout box, click US-Dvorak.

4. Click OK.

To disable the two-handed Dvorak layout and restore your original layout, follow
the steps in the preceding procedure. In step 3, choose your original layout.

To Install a U.S. Dvorak Keyboard Layout for Single-Handed Typists
------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The Dvorak single-handed keyboard layouts support only Intel(R) processors.
They do not support RISC processors at this time.

1. If there is an Oemlay0.inf file in the Windows NT\System32 folder, rename it
  with a unique file name. For example, rename it Oemlay1.inf (if there is not
  already an Oemlay1.inf file in the System32 folder) with the following
  command:

  "ren c:\winnt\system32\oemlay0.inf c:\winnt\system32\oemlay1.inf" (without the
  quotation marks)

  NOTE: When you rename an Oemlayn.inf file, choose the next unused number to
  ensure Windows NT reads all the Oemlayn.inf files correctly (where n is a
  number). For example, if you have three Oemlay.inf files (Oemlay0.inf,
  Oemlay1.inf, and Oemlay2.inf), rename Oemlay0.inf to Oemlay3.inf.

2. If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk in the
  appropriate floppy disk drive.

  If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service, skip to step
  3. This procedure assumes that you have already downloaded and extracted the
  compressed file.

3. Copy the Oemlay0.inf file from the GA0650 disk or the folder containing the
  file you downloaded from an online service to the Windows NT\System32 folder
  on the hard disk. You can do this by typing the following command at the
  MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER:

  "copy &lt;drive&gt;:\oemlay0.inf &lt;destination&gt;" (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the GA0650 disk or the
  folder containing the file you downloaded from an online service and
  &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and folder for the Windows NT\System32
  folder.

  For example, if the GA0650 disk is in drive A and your Windows NT folder is
  called WINNT and is on drive C, type the following command at the MS-DOS
  command prompt and press ENTER:

4. Run Control Panel.

5. In Control Panel, double-click the International icon. The International
  dialog box appears.

6. In the Keyboard Layout box, click US Left Single-Handed Layout or US Right
  Single-Handed Layout.

7. Click OK. Windows NT prompts you to type the path to the Kbdrh.dll or
  Kbdlh.dll file.

8. Type the path to the floppy disk drive that contains the GA0650 disk or to
  the folder containing the file you downloaded from an online service. For
  example, if you put the disk in drive A, you would type the following:

  "a:" (without the quotation marks)

9. Click Continue.

To Switch Between a Dvorak Layout and Another Layout
----------------------------------------------------

You may need to switch back and forth between the Dvorak layout and another
layout. An easy way to do this is to set up the Dvorak layout as another
language, and then switch back and forth between languages. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. Make sure the Dvorak layout you want to use is already installed and
  operational on your computer. Refer to the previous sections if you need
  instructions for installing the Dvorak layout.

2. Follow the instructions in the "To disable the Dvorak layout and restore your
  original Windows 95 keyboard layout" section above to restore your original
  layout.

3. In Control Panel, double-click the Keyboard icon. Or, in Control Panel,
  select the Keyboard icon with the ARROW keys and then press ENTER.

4. Click the Language tab. Or, select the Language tab by pressing CTRL+TAB.

5. Click Add, or press ALT+D.

6. In the Language box, click a language other than the language you are
  currently using, and then click OK. Or, use the ARROW keys to select a
  language other than the language you are currently using, and then press
  ENTER.

  NOTE: It does not matter which language you choose, because the Dvorak layout
  will be applied to the language instead of the normal keyboard layout for
  that language. It is helpful to choose a language that has a different
  two-letter code to indicate which language is in use. We recommend choosing
  Danish because it uses "Da" as its two-letter code, which might be helpful in
  distinguishing it as the Dvorak layout.

7. Click the language to which you want to add the Dvorak layout, and then click
  Properties. Or, use the ARROW keys to select the language to which you want
  to add the Dvorak layout, press TAB until Properties is selected, and then
  press ENTER.

  NOTE: Make sure to apply the Dvorak layout to the new language, and not to the
  "English (United States)" language.

8. In the Keyboard Layout box, click United States-Dvorak for two- handed
  typists, United States-LH Dvorak for left-handed typists, or United States-RH
  Dvorak for right-handed typists, and then click OK. Or, use the ARROW keys to
  select United States-Dvorak for two-handed typists, United States-LH Dvorak
  for left-handed typists, or United States-RH for right-handed typists, and
  then press ENTER.

9. In the Switch Languages box, click the option you want to use to switch
  languages. Or, press TAB until the selection enters the Switch Languages box,
  and then use the ARROW keys to select the option you want.

10. If you want a constant language indicator on the screen, click the Enable
  Indicator On Taskbar check box to select it. Or, press TAB until Enable
  Indicator On Taskbar is selected, and then press SPACE BAR to place a check
  mark in the check box.

11. Click OK. Or, press TAB until OK is selected, and then press ENTER.

  NOTE: If you enabled the Enable Indicator On Taskbar option, you can click
  the two-letter language code on the taskbar and then click the language you
  want to use. You can also use the right mouse button to click the two-letter
  code and then click What's This for help or Properties to open Keyboard
  properties.
