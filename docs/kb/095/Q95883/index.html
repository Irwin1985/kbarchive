SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the naming conventions for network interface cards (NICs)
manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). These conventions are used
to identify various information about the network cards, including the class,
architecture, and connections of the card.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DEC NICs are stamped with a product number on the bracket. (For example, the DEC
Etherworks Turbo/TP has the product number DE201.) This number is visible from
the back of the computer. The meaning of the different name and number mappings
are as follows:

  DE10x - Etherworks LC
  DE20x - Etherworks Turbo
  DE21x - Etherworks MC

NOTE: "DE" indicates a DEC Etherworks card.

The number in the first position (1, 2, or 4) indicates the class of the network
card. The classes are as follows:

  1 - Standard
  2 - Turbo
  4 - EISA

The number in the middle position (0, 1, or 2) indicates the bus architecture as
follows:

  0 - ISA
  1 - Microchannel
  2 - EISA

The number in the last position ("x") indicates the type of connectors on the
card and the card name as follows:

  0 - AUI and BNC
  1 - AUI and TP
  2 - BNC and TP

Originally, DEC manufactured a card with the name "DEPCA." This card was an 8-bit
net/mouse full-length card. It had a connector for the mouse and a BNC connector
only for the network connection on the card.

Since this card was produced, all network cards subsequently produced by DEC have
been supersets of this original DEPCA card. These cards all use the same NDIS
driver (DEPCA.DOS) and therefore have been erroneously called "DEPCA" cards. All
DEC cards excluding the original DEPCA card has been given a product name and a
product number as described above.
