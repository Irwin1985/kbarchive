MORE INFORMATION
================

BUG #: lm2_1:0198
-----------------

CSD #: CSD00.003

Bug Description: Macfile/macprint servers sometimes drop out of zones and can't
get back in unless the server is rebooted.

Fix Description: The logic was modified to be more persistent on rejoining
zones.

Component affected: ATALK2.OS2

BUG #: lm2_1:0415, lm2_1:0767, lm2_1:1175 and lm2_1:1636
--------------------------------------------------------

CSD #: CSD00.004

Bug Description: Servers experience various memory allocation problems (ATK0501
and AFP0294), including running out of selectors.

Components affected: AFP.EXE, ATALK1.OS2, and ATALK2.OS2

BUG #: lm2_1:0672
-----------------

CSD #: CSD00.006

Bug Description: From lmsfm client, you get an access denied error when
attempting to copy a file from a RO volume to a write-permit volume, even though
you can read the file correctly.

Fix Description: The permissions checking on the appropriate "containers" was
fixed when doing this kind of operation.

Component affected: AFP.EXE

BUG #: lm2_1:0695
-----------------

CSD #: CSD00.010

Bug Description: Spooled print jobs get deleted from queue or stuck in queue if
printer is unplugged from network or powered down.

Fix Description: The architecture of the despooler thread was reworked, with
improved error handling and recovery.

Component affected: MACDS.EXE

BUG #: lm2_1:0733
-----------------

CSD #: CSD00.005

Bug Description: The burned-in network address is ALWAYS used, ignoring any
overriding address if specified.

Fix Description: The "effective" address is now used, not the permanent address.

Component affected: ATALK1.OS2 AND ATALK2.OS2

BUG #: lm2_1:0822
-----------------

CSD #: N/A

Bug Description: The Mac setup requires at least one card be bound to appletalk
prior to exiting. This causes reconfiguration problems down the road because the
user never really has an opportunity to unbind.

Fix Description: Mac setup no longer requires the network card to be bound to
Appletalk when exiting, but simply produces a warning message to the user.

Component affected: Mac SETUP.EXE and SETUP.MSG

BUG #: lm2_1:0997
-----------------

CSD #:CSD00.007

Bug Description: Incorrect ACLs get attached to a file that has been moved by an
afp client.

Component affected: AFP.EXE

BUG #: lm2_1:1601 and lm2_1:2691
--------------------------------

CSD #: CSD00.012

Bug Description: Spooler files are not getting deleted after printing.

Fix Description: The file handle processing was improved by forcing null file
handles closed (if necessary) when jobs are removed.

Component affected: MACDS.EXE

BUG #: lm2_1:2141
-----------------

CSD #: CSD00.008

Bug Description: Source routing frames are rejected, preventing any appletalk
client from connecting to a server that is using ReceiveChain() in its NDIS TR
driver.

Component affected: ATALK2.OS2

BUG #: lm2_1:2189
-----------------

CSD #: N/A

Bug Description: Incorrect error codes are returned for two OpenFile cases.

Fix Description: The error codes were corrected to return -54 and -45 instead of
-5000 as appropriate.

Component affected: AFP.EXE

BUG #: lm2_1:2254 and lm2_1:2259
--------------------------------

CSD #: N/A

Bug Description: If a file that has a reserved word (nul, LPT1, LPT2, con, etc)
as it's name gets created in a directory on the server that is also a Mac
volume, all the files in that volume become invisible to the Macintosh after
approximately 20 seconds. The Mac can copy files into the volume but they will
eventually disappear. If you attempt to copy a file of the same name as one
already on the volume, an error is returned stating that the file already
exists.

Fix Description: Files with reserved word names are now filtered out.

Component affected: AFP.EXE

BUG #: lm2_1:2563
-----------------

CSD #: N/A

Bug Description: Mac print jobs are submitted with a blank "Notify field" in
prjinfo, causing popup to appear at local server, although it's a remote job.
This results in very undesirable situations, particularly for headless or
physically secure servers.

Component affected: MACPS.EXE
