The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article includes information on several applications that require the
SETVER.EXE program in order to run successfully under MS-DOS 5.0. This article
contains the following sections:

- What Is SETVER.EXE?

- Applications That Require SETVER.EXE

- How to Use SETVER.EXE

What Is SETVER.EXE?
-------------------

When you start an application, often the first thing it does during its
initialization phase is check the version number of MS-DOS. This is done to
ensure that the program is compatible with the current version of the operating
system. Since MS-DOS 5.0 is compatible with earlier versions of MS-DOS, most
programs should run well, regardless of what version they expect.

SETVER.EXE was designed to enable version-checking applications to run
successfully under MS-DOS 5.0. SETVER.EXE does only one thing; it reports the
necessary version number so that any application can start and be used
normally.

In most situations, running a program that was designed for an earlier version of
MS-DOS is safe. However, in some cases, a program that makes certain assumptions
based on the MS-DOS version number may make mistakes. Data loss and file
corruption can occur. This is why a warning message is displayed whenever you
add a program to the SETVER.EXE version table. If you are working with important
or valuable data, you may want to contact your application vendor before using
SETVER.EXE.

Applications That Require SETVER.EXE
------------------------------------


The following applications require versions of MS-DOS earlier than 5.0. Their
filenames and required versions (to be added to the SETVER.EXE version table)
are listed in their titles, followed by any other applicable information:

ACCESS.EXE 4.0
--------------

ACCESS.EXE, the EasyNetwork redirector, appears to run successfully until a
remote user attempts to access a network drive. The remote user may be able to
log on to the drive, but any further use of it results in a network crash. This
applies to the following versions of EasyNetwork:

  Standard configuration, version 1.92 or earlier
  ArcNet configuration, version 1.96 or earlier
  EtherNet configuration, version 1.96 or earlier

FOCUS.EXE 4.01
--------------

Information Builders Incorporated FOCUS.EXE may display the following error
message if it is not added to the SETVER.EXE version table:

  Too many open files. DOS has no more handles.

GEOS.EXE 4.0
------------

(America Online)

Lotus 1-2-3 3.30
----------------

(applies to version 2.01 of Lotus 1-2-3)

MSCDEX.EXE 4.01
---------------

MSCDEX.EXE version 2.2 requires the use of SETVER.EXE. MSCDEX.EXE should already
be in your SETVER.EXE table, unless you have IBM PC-DOS 5.0. If you have
Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0, make sure you are loading SETVER.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS
file. If you have IBM PC-DOS, make sure SETVER.EXE is in the CONFIG.SYS file and
add MSCDEX.EXE to the SETVER.EXE version table.

PCBFAST.EXE 4.01
----------------

(applies to version 1.25 of Intelligent Devices Corporation [IDC] PowerCache)

PLAYER.EXE 4.0
--------------

(Chinon CD-ROM Music Player)

PRODIGY.EXE 4.01
----------------

(Prodigy Services)

TURBO.EXE 3.30
--------------

NEC has confirmed that TURBO.EXE, included with NEC-DOS version 3.3, can be used
with MS-DOS 5.0. The TURBO command is used to toggle between clock speeds on NEC
PowerMate 286 and NEC PowerMate 286 Plus machines.

Note: MS-DOS 5.0 Setup copies TURBO.EXE to the OLD_DOS.1 subdirectory. TURBO.EXE
should be copied to the upgraded MS-DOS subdirectory to avoid the possibility of
its deletion if the OLD_DOS.1 subdirectory is removed.

10NET.EXE 4.0
-------------

(DCA 10Net Network)

10NET16.EXE 4.01
----------------

If 10NET16.EXE (for DCA 10Net networks) detects an unexpected MS-DOS version, the
following error message may be displayed:

  SERVER NOT FOUND

How to Use SETVER.EXE
---------------------

SETVER.EXE allows you to change the version of MS-DOS reported to an application
by adding the application name and the desired version of MS-DOS to the
SETVER.EXE table.

To modify the version table, do the following:

1. At any MS-DOS prompt, type the following:

  " setver &lt;program name&gt; &lt;version&gt; " (without the quotation marks)

  For example: If you want MS-DOS to report version 4.01 to EXAMPLE.EXE, type
  the following:

  " setver example.exe 4.01 " (without the quotation marks)

2. Verify that the command was added to the version table by typing "setver"
  (without the quotation marks).

3. Reboot (press CTRL+ALT+DEL) so that the change to the version table takes
  effect.

NOTE: Before you can use the SETVER command, the SETVER.EXE version table must be
loaded by a DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS file. By default, MS- DOS 5.0
Setup modifies your CONFIG.SYS file to ensure that the version table is loaded
into memory each time you start your computer. If you have problems following
the previous steps, check that SETVER.EXE is being loaded in your CONFIG.SYS
file.
