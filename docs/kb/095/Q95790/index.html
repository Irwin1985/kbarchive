-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Windows for Workgroups Mail is unable to find the MASTER.GLB file in the GLB
subdirectory of the Workgroup Mail postoffice directory structure, you will
receive the following error message:

  Mail could not connect to your mail server

CAUSE
=====

Mail is unable to find MASTER.GLB under any one of the following conditions:

- The Workgroup postoffice computer is unavailable.

- The postoffice directory is not shared.

- You are using the wrong workgroup postoffice name.

- The workgroup postoffice name is invalid.

- The ServerPath= line in your MSMAIL.INI file is incorrect.

- NetWare connectivity is installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information describes these conditions in detail.

Workgroup Postoffice Computer Unavailable
-----------------------------------------

To use the Windows for Workgroups mail system, one workgroup computer must be set
up as the postoffice. This computer handles user accounts and mail messages for
the workgroup. To provide these services, the postoffice computer must contain
the workgroup postoffice directory structure and it must be running in 386
enhanced mode (it must also be turned on).

NOTE: There can be only one postoffice per workgroup.

The Postoffice Directory Is Not Shared
--------------------------------------

If the postoffice computer is not sharing the postoffice directory structure, no
one will be able to access the postoffice. Workgroup users will be able to work
off line, but they will not be able to receive or send messages.

Use File Manager to make sure the postoffice directory structure is being shared
on the postoffice computer.

Using Wrong Workgroup Postoffice Name
-------------------------------------

By default, the workgroup postoffice is named WGPO. However, in your workgroup,
the name may be different. Make sure the name you are using for the postoffice
is correct. (It should be the same as the share name on the workgroup postoffice
computer.)

Workgroup Postoffice Name is Invalid
------------------------------------

By default, the workgroup postoffice is named WGPO. You can use another name
provided that it doesn't exceed 8 characters and doesn't contain any spaces. For
example, changing the share name from "WGPO" (without the quotation marks) to
"Post Ofc" (without the quotation marks) would cause unsuccessful connections.
Make sure that the name each user is trying to connect to matches the name that
was used as the share name on the postoffice computer.

To correct this error, change the share name of the postoffice directory to a
valid name with eight or fewer characters. To do this:

1. Open File Manager on the postoffice machine.

2. Select the postoffice directory.

3. From the Disk menu, choose Share As.

4. From the Share Directory menu, change the Share Name entry to a name with
  eight or fewer characters. (Spaces count as characters.)

ServerPath= Line in MSMAIL.INI Is Incorrect
-------------------------------------------

When you log on to the workgroup mail system, Workgroup Mail checks the
ServerPath= line in your local MSMAIL.INI file to locate the post office
computer and directory structure.

If you are using universal naming convention (UNC) style paths to refer to the
postoffice computer, make sure the computer name and share name are correct. If
you are not sure of the names, you can use File Manager to connect to the
postoffice computer and verify the computer and share names.

If you are using a redirected drive letter (M for example) for your postoffice,
make sure you have a network connection in File Manager that agrees with the
ServerPath= statement.

NetWare Connectivity Is Installed
---------------------------------

When you load the real mode redirector, the NetWare portion of the protocol stack
intercepts Interrupt 21h calls before any other protocol (such as Microsoft
NetBEUI). When you start Mail, Interrupt 21h is used to find the postoffice
computer. This results in a problem if your post office is referred to by a UNC
style path. NetWare does not understand UNC and does not forward the UNC
information to NetBEUI. Therefore, if NetWare connectivity is installed, Mail
displays the error message if you start the real mode redirector before you
start Windows. To avoid this problem, do one of the following:

- Switch to a redirected drive letter style path.

  -or-

- Do not load the real mode redirector before you start Windows.

To switch to a redirected drive letter style path:

1. Add the following to the PROTOCOL.INI file.

  a. Increase the value for SESSIONS= to 20.

  b. Increase the value for NCBS= to 40.

2. In the MSMAIL.INI file, set the SERVERPATH= setting to the valid server drive
  (for example, SERVERPATH=M:).

3. Quit Windows and redirect the drive letter (M in this example) to the
  appropriate server and share name (\\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;).
