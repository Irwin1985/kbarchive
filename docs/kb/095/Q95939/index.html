- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the steps for installing Microsoft Mail version 3.0 for
PC Networks.

INSTALL MICROSOFT MAIL
----------------------

1. Install all needed software on the server.

2. Set up Novell groups, access rights, and drive mappings.

3. Use the Mail Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) to set the default options and
  create user mailboxes.

4. Set up individual workstations.

INSTALL ALL NEEDED SOFTWARE ON THE SERVER
-----------------------------------------

1. Log on to Novell as a Supervisor--not as a supervisor equivalent. Logging on
  as a Supervisor causes all files in the Mail system to be stamped with
  Supervisor ownership. This can reduce the future risk ownerless files might
  pose to smooth operation of the mail system.

  Decide what network (organization) and postoffice names you will use and
  decide where you want to install the executable files (the MAILEXE
  subdirectory) and the Mail database (the MAILDATA subdirectory). Make a note
  of these; you will use this information while installing each set of disks.

2. Run the INSTALL.EXE program from the Server Version - Disk 1 disk. Follow the
  instructions, inserting disks as prompted, until the Mail server is
  installed. For example:

  Enter network type (M)Microsoft or (N)Novell &gt; N
  Enter postoffice name &gt; SEATTLE1
  Enter network name &gt; XYZCORP
  Enter location for the Microsoft Mail executable files
  &gt; f:\apps\mail\exe
  Enter location for the Microsoft Mail data files
  &gt; f:\apps\mail\data

  NOTE: You should always install the MS-DOS workstation even if all your users
  will be running different workstation software. The MS-DOS client
  installation copies files needed by other Microsoft Mail components. It may
  also be helpful when you need to troubleshoot the Mail system.

3. Run the INSTALL.EXE program from the MS-DOS-based Workstation Version - Disk
  1 disk. Follow the instructions, inserting disks as prompted, until the
  MS-DOS workstation client is installed. Give the same directories for the
  executable files and the database as you used in the Server disk installation
  in step 2 above. Continuing with the above example:

  Enter drive, path to the Microsoft Mail executable files
  &gt; f:\apps\mail\exe
  Enter drive, path to the Microsoft Mail database
  &gt; f:\apps\mail\data

  NOTE: At the "Directory is not empty, continue (Y/N)?:" prompt, press Y to
  continue.

4. If you will be using the Windows or OS/2 Presentation Manager workstation
  client, run the INSTALL.EXE program from the Windows-based and OS/2
  Presentation Manager-Based Workstation Version - Disk 1 disk. Follow the
  instructions, inserting disks as prompted, until the installation program
  reports that it has finished. Continuing with the above example:

  Type the name of your organization.
  &gt; The XYZ Corporation
  Type the drive and path to the Microsoft Mail executable files.
  &gt; f:\apps\mail\exe

5. If you will be accessing the Mail database on the Novell server from
  connected Apple Macintoshes, you do not need to take any additional steps at
  this time.

SET UP NOVELL GROUPS, ACCESS RIGHTS, AND DRIVE MAPPINGS
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Create and add users to a Novell PC Mail group with the following trustee
  rights (or give these rights to the group Everyone)

  [ RWCEM ] ..\MAILDATA directory **
  [ R F ] ..\MAILEXE directory

  where:

  R Read (open and read files)
  W Write (open and write to the file)
  C Create (create a directory)
  E Erase (delete a directory or file)
  M Modify (change the attributes or rename a directory or file)
  F File Scan (see the filename when viewing the directory)

  ** Macintosh and OS/2 clients need File Scan (F) rights to the entire database
  (..\MAILDATA).

  Special cases:

   - You need [ RWCEMF ] rights to the MAILDATA\FOLDERS directories if you want
     to be able to change folder sort orders from within any Microsoft Mail
     MS-DOS client or a Microsoft Mail 2.1 Windows client.

   - You need [ RWCEMF ] rights to the MAILDATA\KEY directory if any Microsoft
     Mail 2.1 Windows clients will be accessing the Mail database.

2. Add mapping statements to the system login script similar to the following,
  but adjusted for your own configuration:

        IF MEMBER OF "pcmail" THEN
           MAP M: = Server_Name/SYS:APPS/MAILDATA
           MAP INS S1: = Server_Name/SYS:APPS/MAILEXE
        END

3. Unless otherwise specified, all Mail executable programs for MS-DOS assume
  that the current directory of drive M is the root of the database
  (..\MAILDATA). If the database resides on another drive, add a -Dx switch to
  the command line (where x is the alternate drive letter).

  For example, use the following command if the current directory of drive R is
  the root of the database:

  admin -dr

  CRITICAL NOTE: The CURRENT directory of the drive letter used must be the ROOT
  of the database (..\MAILDATA).

  For example, in the list below, if the directory on the left is the current
  directory when you run a Mail program, the Mail program gives you the error
  message shown on the right:

     Current Directory         Error Message
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

     M:\APPS\MAIL              Could not find mail system database
     M:\APPS\MAIL\EXE          Could not find mail system database
     M:\APPS\MAIL\DATA\LOG     Could not find mail system database

     M:\APPS\MAIL\DATA         (Correct directory--no error message)

  You can verify that the root of the postoffice database is the current
  directory of the drive by changing to that drive and running the MS-DOS DIR
  command. If the Mail database is there, you will see directories named ATT,
  GLB, MBG, and so forth.

  Following are examples of the commands used to map to the root of the
  postoffice database for Novell networks:

  map m:=&lt;Server_Name&gt;/sys:apps\mail\data
  map root r:=&lt;Server_Name&gt;/vol1:maildata

  The Windows workstation software also assumes the database is in the current
  directory of drive M unless told otherwise. It does not require that the
  directory be the current directory, but it does require that you specify the
  full path to the postoffice database. In Microsoft Mail 3.0, this is done in
  the MSMAIL.INI file. You can find the MSMAIL.INI file in your Microsoft
  Windows directory.

  To specify the path to the postoffice database for Mail 3.0's Windows
  workstation software, include a "ServerPath=" line in the [Microsoft Mail]
  section of MSMAIL.INI. For example:

     ----- MSMAIL.INI -----
        [Microsoft Mail]
        ServerPath=F:\apps\mail\data

  NOTE: The system administrator can simplify Windows workstation installations
  by using drive M as everyone's database mapping or by editing the MSMAIL.INI
  file located in the MAILEXE directory on the server to include a standard
  "ServerPath=" line.

4. If necessary, you can get by without using any new mappings by hard coding
  the path to the executable files by using a command at a command-line prompt
  or in a batch file. This eliminates the need for a MAP INSert search path.
  Two examples:

     C:\&gt;  F:\apps\mailexe\ADMIN
     F:\APPS\MAILDATA\&gt;  ..\mailexe\MAIL

  From the MAILDATA directory, load the MS-DOS-based MAIL.EXE or ADMIN.EXE
  program using the -D switch. This switch eliminates the need for a specific
  drive mapping to the root of the database (..\MAILDATA). Two examples are:

     F:\APPS\MAILDATA\&gt;  ..\mailexe\ADMIN -Df
     R:\GRPAPPS\MAIL\DATA\&gt;  \grpapps\mail\exe\MAIL -Dr

  Windows users run their executable files from the local hard disk drive so
  they do not need the MAP INSert search path. The "ServerPath=" line replaces
  most additional mappings needed to the Mail database.

SET MAIL'S DEFAULT OPTIONS AND CREATE USER MAILBOXES
----------------------------------------------------

1. Load the Mail Administrator program for the first time by typing the
  following at an MS-DOS prompt:

  admin admin -ppassword

  NOTE: The above command assumes you are using drive M and have a search path
  to the Mail executable files.

  If you have customized your setup, enter something similar to the following,
  from the root of the database (adjusted for your own drive and path
  settings):

     F:\APPS\MAIL\DATA\&gt; ..\exe\ADMIN admin -Ppassword -Df

2. Once the Mail Administrator program has loaded, select Local-Admin, Options.
  Look at each of the different options carefully to decide what settings you
  want as the default for newly created users. For more details, select a menu
  option and press the Help (F1) key.

3. After you set your default options, select Local-Admin, Create to add users
  to the mail system. When you have finished adding some users, exit the
  Administrator program and set up a few workstations. Add the rest of your
  users once you are sure everything is set up the way you want it.

SET UP INDIVIDUAL WORKSTATIONS
------------------------------

MS-DOS Client
-------------

You do not need to take any additional steps to run the MS-DOS workstation, as
long as the workstation has the appropriate rights to the executable files and
database and can find them both through some form of mapping. You may, however,
want to create a batch file or place the appropriate lines into a menu system.
The following are some examples of how to load the MS-DOS client:

  MAIL
  MAIL mailbox
  MAIL mailbox -Ppassword -Df

  F:\APPS\MAILDATA\&gt;   \apps\mailexe\MAIL george -Df

  ----- MSMAIL.BAT -----
     @Echo Off
  CD R:\apps\mail\DATA
  R:\apps\mail\EXE\MAIL %Mailbox% -Dr

NOTE: For the above batch file to work, your mailbox names and Novell login names
must match and a routine similar to the following must be in your system login
script. You must also have set sufficient MS-DOS environment space to store the
variable:

     IF MEMBER OF "pcmail" THEN
        DOS SET Mailbox="%LOGIN_NAME"
     END

Windows Client
--------------

In the "Install All Needed Software on the Server" section above, you installed
the Windows client software to the server. Now you need to run the SETUP.EXE
program from each Windows workstation. Mail's SETUP.EXE file will be in the Mail
executable directory (..\MAILEXE). Running the SETUP.EXE program will copy
selected files to the local workstation. It will also make the necessary changes
to your Windows configuration.

NOTE: Make sure the user has logged back in since you gave him or her rights to
the mail system.

To run the SETUP.EXE program, double-click it from File Manager or choose the
File Run command.

When you load the Windows client on a workstation for the first time, a
Login=&lt;Mailbox&gt; line is added to the local MSMAIL.INI file. The Mailbox
value will be the one used to bring up Mail on the workstation for the first
time. For system administrators, this means the administrator should log into
Mail the first time as the local user, and not as an administrator. Otherwise,
the system administrator must edit the MSMAIL.INI file.

If the root of the Mail database is not the current directory on drive M, you may
need to add or modify the "ServerPath=" line in the [Microsoft Mail] group of
the local MSMAIL.INI file.

OS/2 Client
-----------

Except where noted below, the OS/2 client installation is the same as it is for
the Windows client installation described above.

NOTE: OS/2 clients require [ RWCEMF ] rights to the MAILDATA directory.

If you are installing Mail on OS/2 version 1.2 or 1.3, run the PMSETUP.EXE
program from the Novell server instead of the SETUP.EXE program. Verify that
MSMAIL.INI and WIN.INI are in the local OS2\DLL directory.

If you are installing Mail on OS/2 version 2.0, run the SETUP.EXE program from
the Novell server by choosing the Program Manager File Run command. Verify that
MSMAIL.INI and WIN.INI are located on the local workstation in the
OS2\MDOS\WINOS2 directory.

Macintosh Client
----------------

The following installation process assumes that you are able to mount your PC
postoffice drive from the Macintosh on which you will be installing the client
software.

NOTE: Macintosh clients require [ RWCEMF ] rights to the MAILDATA directory.

Insert the Apple Macintosh Workstation Version for PC Networks disk and copy the
Microsoft Mail Notifier file to your active system Control Panel folder. Copy
the Microsoft Mail file to any location on the hard drive or desktop. These are
all the necessary files for the Macintosh Mail client.

Mount the volume containing your PC postoffice and choose the Reshare The Drive
At Startup Time and Save My Name And Password options for that volume.
Double-click the Microsoft Mail icon to launch the Mail program. You will be
presented with the following dialog box:

  The Preference file could not be found. Where is your postoffice located?

Choose the Find PO option and select the mounted volume containing your Mail
database. Type your mailbox name and password to start Mail. Your network/mail
preferences file is successfully created.

Quit from the Mail program and restart your Macintosh. This initiates the notify
portion of the Macintosh Mail client, which notifies you of new mail. The
Macintosh Mail client is now installed.
