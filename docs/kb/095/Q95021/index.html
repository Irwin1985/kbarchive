1. Background and History
-------------------------

A number of years ago, there was an agreement between Microsoft and Sybase
whereby Microsoft provided SQL Server for Microsoft operating systems, and
Sybase provided versions of SQL Server for all other platforms. The technology
that was used, by both Microsoft and Sybase, to communicate with SQL Server was
the Tabular Data Stream (TDS). Both companies developed client-side software
that could be used to read the TDS, providing data exchange between Microsoft
versions of SQL Server and those versions of SQL Server developed by Sybase.

The initial product provided by Microsoft targeted the OS/2 and Windows operating
systems. This early TDS decoding technology was called DB-Library. DB-Library
was implemented as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), which could interface between
an application, an appropriate network library interface, and eventually over
the network to SQL Server. Applications were initially written using the C
language.

With the growth of Microsoft Basic and its evolution into Microsoft Visual Basic
(VB), support was provided by the Vbsql.vbx, a DLL that was specific to Visual
Basic. DB-Library was limited to use with Microsoft's SQL Server, and so could
not be used as a standard methodology to work with other data stores.

The limitations of DB-Library eventually lead to the development of the Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) Application Programming Interface (API). ODBC was
developed as an interface to SQL-based data stores. Within the last several
years, a new API has evolved, based on the Component Object Model (COM), that
has the ability to work with any data source that can provide information in a
tabular format. This API is the Object Linking and Embedding Database (OLE DB)
API.

Each of the three APIs that were developed to support Microsoft SQL Server is
based on a version of the TDS specification, which was developed to allow a
client to exchange information with either the Microsoft or Sybase SQL Server.

At one time, both companies shared the same TDS specification. Recently however,
Microsoft SQL Server and the Sybase products have diverged, and as a result,
each company has updated or adapted new versions of the TDS to meet the needs of
their current products. As a result, Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase Data Server
products do not share a common TDS specification to transfer data between the
servers.

2. Tabular Data Stream Details
------------------------------

Applications that use version 4.21a, 6.0, or 6.5 of the Microsoft SQL Server
client software use version 4.2 of the SQL Server TDS protocol to communicate
with SQL Server. Applications that use Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 versions of the
client software use TDS version 7.0.

For additional information regarding Microsoft versions of the TDS specification,
refer to the SQL Server Books Online. Other Microsoft resources such as the
Microsoft Knowledge Base and Microsoft Developer Support Network provide more
current information. These resources are available at the following Web
addresses:

  http://support.microsoft.com (http://support.microsoft.com)

  http://msdn.microsoft.com (http://msdn.microsoft.com)

Sybase products currently run under the TDS 5.0 specification. For additional
information regarding the Sybase TDS specification, see the following Web site:

  http://www.sybase.com/downloads/ (http://www.sybase.com/downloads/)

3. Microsoft Client Access to Sybase SQL Server: DB-Library, ODBC, and OLE DB
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft does not currently provide an ODBC Driver or OLE DB Provider for any
Sybase product. Microsoft has established a working relationship with Merant,
which provides both ODBC and OLE DB software components for Sybase Data Servers.
The Web address for this third-party provider of ODBC and OLE DB components is
as follows:

  http://www.merant.com/datadirect/products/
  (http://www.merant.com/datadirect/products/)

Merant provides an ODBC Product matrix at the following Web address:

  http://www.merant.com/products/datadirect/odbc/Connect/techdocs/matrix.asp
  (http://www.merant.com/products/datadirect/odbc/Connect/techdocs/matrix.asp)

Merant provides a similar type of product matrix for ADO/OLE DB at the following
address:

  http://www.merant.com/products/datadirect/oledb/Connect/techdocs/matrix.asp
  (http://www.merant.com/products/datadirect/oledb/Connect/techdocs/matrix.asp)

It is possible that some Microsoft client components may be able to interact with
Sybase Data Servers that conform to the TDS 4.2 specification. It is important
to remember, however, that with the exception of the information provided in the
subsequent paragraphs, Microsoft has not provided supported client access
technology for Sybase Data Servers.

With older versions of the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver, it was possible to
connect to older versions of Sybase SQL Servers. The following paragraphs
describe how to set up an ODBC data source for these old drivers to connect to
older Sybase SQL Servers. If clients are already connecting to the Sybase server
from Windows DB-Library applications, no extra components are required.

Starting with version 2.00.1912 of the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC Driver (which
shipped with SQL Server version 4.21a), Microsoft SQL Server drivers are no
longer certified for use against any Sybase SQL Servers. Driver versions
1.02.3231 or earlier were certified to run against older versions of Sybase SQL
Servers, but none of the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC drivers was certified to run
against System/10 or later Sybase servers. Because all of the Microsoft driver
versions that were certified for use against Sybase are now obsolete, it is
recommended that sites wanting to connect ODBC applications to Sybase servers
contact Sybase or third-party ODBC driver vendors for drivers certified for use
against Sybase.

The key to Microsoft and Sybase SQL Server connectivity is a module called the
Network Library (Net-Library). This module consists of two interfaces: one
interface with the network, and another with the application. The network
interface is customized to support a particular network, but the application
interface remains the same. Because ODBC, DB-Library, APT-SQL, APT-Library, and
so on communicate with the Net-Library, they can be written in a
network-independent fashion. In particular, the ODBC SQL Server driver can be
used to connect to either Microsoft or Sybase SQL Servers (on Unix and VMS),
regardless of the network you are using, as long as there is a Net-Library for
that network.

To connect to a Sybase SQL Server from an ODBC application, perform the following
steps:

1. For the remainder of this article, it is assumed that you are connecting to
  an SQL Server called "Mysqlsvr". This server should be set up as an ODBC Data
  Source by using the ODBC Administrator utility.

2. In the ODBC Administrator, from the list of installed drivers, click SQL
  Server, and then click Add New Name.

3. In the ODBC SQL Server Setup dialog box, type a data source name (DSN) and
  then click Add. Note that a single server can function as multiple ODBC Data
  Sources, because each database in the server can be a data source. Thus, the
  data source name does not necessarily have to be the same as the server name.

4. In the resulting dialog box, the Network Address field has a default entry of
  the form:

  

  \\DATA-SOURCE-NAME\PIPE\SQL\QUERY

  This is actually a named pipe name. Because a Sybase SQL Server on Unix uses
  sockets rather than named pipes, you must change this name so that it
  contains the IP address and the port identification number. This is a string
  of the form "ip_address,port". For example:

  "11.1.14.40,3180" (without the quotation marks)

  For a Sybase SQL Server on VAX, this entry should contain a string of the form
  "node address,process_id" where "node address" is the DECNet node address of
  the server, and "process_id" is the process identification number to use for
  the connection. An example entry is "1.997,141". The "Network Library" field
  has a default entry of dbnmp3. This is the Net-Library if you are using named
  pipes. This field should contain the name of the Net-Library that you will
  need to use, which is dependent on what network you are using. For example,
  if you are using FTP PCTCP, the Net-Library name is wdbftptc. Note that if
  you are already connecting to a Sybase SQL Server from an existing Windows
  db-lib application, you will have the correct Net-Libraries. Click OK to
  return to the initial screen. The addition of the data source is now
  complete.

5. The next step is to have the Sybase Database Administrator run the
  Instcat.sql script file. This file contains SQL statements that create
  certain stored procedures needed to process ODBC calls. Without these
  procedures, Microsoft Access will not be able to attach to a SQL Server
  table, and Visual Basic 2.0 will not be able to function correctly. To run
  this script file, you must use ISQL. At a Unix command line, or at a DOS
  prompt, type the following:

  "isql -S&lt;servername&gt; -Usa -P&lt;sa-password&gt;
  -i&lt;path&gt;\instcat.sql" (without the quotation marks)

  If you are running Sybase SQL Server 4.2, use the Instcat.sql file that is
  included with the application.

6. Finally, note that if the above procedure is followed correctly, the
  following changes appear in the Odbc.ini and Win.ini files. The [Data
  Sources] section of the Odbc.ini file has an entry of the form:

  

  data-source-name=SQL Server

  where "data-source-name" is the name of the data source that you added. There
  is a new section called "[data-source-name]" that contains the location of
  the SQL Server driver and a description of the data source. The [SQLSERVER}
  section of the Win.ini file contains an entry of the form:

  

  data-source-name=&lt;net-library-name&gt;,&lt;network address&gt;

4. Microsoft Client Access to Microsoft SQL Server: DB-Library, ODBC, and OLE DB
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary source for Microsoft client access components for Microsoft SQL
Server is currently provided by means of the Microsoft Data Access Components
(MDAC). MDAC is an installation package that is available from various Microsoft
products, and as a download from the Web. It is important to note that MDAC
products only support Microsoft operating systems. For the latest information
about MDAC, see the following Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data/ (http://www.microsoft.com/data/)

5. Third-Party ODBC Client Support for Non-Windows Platforms That Need to Connect to Microsoft SQL Server and/or Sybase Server Products
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft does not provide ODBC Drivers or other data access methods for
non-Microsoft operating system platforms. Microsoft has established a working
relationship with Merant, who does provide these software components. For more
information about these products, refer to Merant's Web site at the following
address:

  http://www.merant.com/datadirect/products/
  (http://www.merant.com/datadirect/products/)

  http://www.merant.com/products/datadirect/oledb/Connect/overview.asp
  (http://www.merant.com/products/datadirect/oledb/Connect/overview.asp)

6. Third-Party ODBC Client Support for Sybase Data Servers, MTS, and DTC
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merant provides Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) support with their DataDirect
product for ODBC. They are actively working with Microsoft to include Data
Transaction Coordinator (DTC) support for Sybase Data Server products. Browse
the Merant Web site for more information about their products that support MTS,
and for a current status of DTC for Sybase. Merant also makes an Integrator
product that provides the capability of joining data from various data sources:
from ODBC data sources, from ADO data sources, or from both sources. There are
two versions of the Integrator product: one that communicates with ODBC
applications, and one that communicates with ADO/OLE DB applications.
