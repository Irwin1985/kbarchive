SUMMARY
=======

GlobalDosAlloc() is used by Windows-based applications and dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs) to allocate memory blocks that are guaranteed to exist in the
first megabyte (MB) of linear address space. GlobalDosFree() is used to free
memory blocks allocated by GlobalDosAlloc(). Memory blocks allocated by
GlobalDosAlloc() are fixed in standard mode and page locked in 386 enhanced
mode.

Neither of these functions is prototyped in the Microsoft Windows version 3.0
Software Development Kit's WINDOWS.H; however, both are correctly prototyped in
the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 SDK's WINDOWS.H. Furthermore, both functions
are prototyped incorrectly in the Windows 3.0 SDK "Reference, Volume 1" and in
the Windows 3.1 SDK "Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions." The correct
prototypes are:

  DWORD FAR PASCAL GlobalDosAlloc(DWORD cbAlloc);
  UINT FAR PASCAL GlobalDosFree (UINT uSelector);  // in Windows 3.1
  WORD FAR PASCAL GlobalDosFree (WORD wSelector);  // in Windows 3.0

The return value of GlobalDosAlloc(), if successful, contains a selector in the
low-order word and a paragraph-aligned segment value in the high-order word. If
GlobalDosAlloc() fails, it returns zero. If GlobalDosFree() succeeds, it returns
zero. If it fails, GlobalDosFree() returns the value of the selector passed to
it.

Memory below 1 MB is scarce and should not be allocated by applications or DLLs
unless absolutely necessary. For further information about how memory below 1 MB
is used, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  GlobalDosAlloc() or memory


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code sample demonstrates how to use GlobalDosAlloc() and
GlobalDosFree():

     DWORD dwMyLowMemory;
     UINT  uMySegment;
     UINT  uMySelector;
     LPSTR lpProtModePtr;
     DWORD lpRealModePtr;
      .
      .
      .

     if ((dwMyLowMemory = GlobalDosAlloc(512)) == 0)
        return FALSE;    // Error: unable to allocate memory

     // GlobalDosAlloc() allocates global memory that can be accessed by
     // real-mode applications. The memory is guaranteed to exist in the
     // first megabyte of linear address space.
     // 
     // GlobalDosAlloc() returns a DWORD in which the high-order word is a
     // paragraph segment and the low-order word is a selector.

     uMySegment  = HIWORD(dwMyLowMemory);
     uMySelector = LOWORD(dwMyLowMemory);

     lpProtModePtr = (LPSTR)MAKELONG(0, uMySelector);
                                                 // protected mode pointer

     lpRealModePtr = (DWORD)MAKELONG(0, uMySegment);
                                                 // real mode pointer
      .
      .
      .

     if ((uMySelector = GlobalDosFree(uMySelector)) != NULL)
        return FALSE;    // Error: unable to free memory

This example works correctly in all Windows modes. The selector value returned by
GlobalDosAlloc() does not need to be locked via a call to GlobalLock() because
it is already locked. Because the value of uMySegment is a paragraph-aligned
segment value, the starting offset of the memory object will be zero. In Windows
3.0 real mode, GlobalDosAlloc() returns segment values in both words.

GlobalDosAlloc() allocates memory below 1 MB in linear address space. In standard
mode, this memory is in the first megabyte of physical memory because linear
addresses are the same as physical addresses. In 386 enhanced mode, however,
linear addresses are not the same as physical addresses. Memory allocated via
GlobalDosAlloc() is not guaranteed to reside in the first megabyte of physical
memory nor to be physically contiguous. Furthermore, because the physical
address of a memory block allocated via GlobalDosAlloc() is not known in 386
enhanced mode, it is not suitable for DMA transfers or memory-mapped hardware.


In 386 enhanced mode Windows, GlobalDosAlloc() allocates memory blocks in the
Windows virtual machine only. Terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs) and
MS-DOS device drivers that were started before Windows are global to all virtual
machines and thus can use these memory blocks. However, TSRs and MS-DOS-based
applications that are started in Windows MS-DOS boxes run in their own virtual
machines and so cannot see the memory allocated by GlobalDosAlloc(). Because
memory allocated by GlobalDosAlloc() is not global to all virtual machines, it
cannot be used to communicate asynchronously (based on hardware interrupts, for
example) with TSRs. For examples of Windows-based applications that communicate
with TSRs, study the GDOSMEM and TDOSMEM sample applications included in the
Windows 3.1 SDK, or query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  GDOSMEM or TDOSMEM

If GlobalDosAlloc() is called from within a DLL, the allocated memory block is
owned by the application instance that called the DLL, not the DLL. However, it
is sometimes necessary for a DLL to own a block of memory that MS-DOS can
access. (For example, a DLL may need its own buffer to communicate with a TSR.)

Because GlobalDosAlloc() doesn't take a parameter to specify the attributes of
the memory block to be allocated as GlobalAlloc does, how can the memory be
assigned to a DLL? The DLL can allocate the memory on behalf of the calling
application instance and then call GlobalReAlloc() to change the ownership of
the memory block to itself. The following code sample demonstrates this
technique:

    // Called from within a DLL

     HGLOBAL hMyLowMem;
     DWORD   dwMyLowMemory;
     UINT    uSelector;
     LPSTR   lpszProtModePtr;
      .
      .
      .
     if ((dwMyLowMemory = GlobalDosAlloc (512)) == 0)
        return (FALSE);      // Error: unable to allocate memory

     uSelector = LOWORD(dwMyLowMemory);
     lpszProtModePtr = (LPSTR)MAKELONG(0, uSelector);

     hMyLowMem = LOWORD(GlobalHandle (uSelector));

     hMyLowMem = GlobalReAlloc (hMyLowMem, 0, GMEM_MODIFY |
                                              GMEM_DDESHARE);
      .
      .
      .

After the call to GlobalReAlloc(), the memory block will belong to the DLL and
can be accessed by lpszProtModePtr. To free the memory block, just call
GlobalDosFree(); there is no need to change the ownership of the block back to
its original owner.

GlobalDosAlloc() and GlobalDosFree() are not the same as the DPMI DOS Memory
Management Services (functions 100h to 102h). Windows applications and DLLs
should not use these DPMI functions because GlobalDosAlloc() and GlobalDosFree()
perform the same functions.


Important note: Applications and DLLs should not use GlobalDosAlloc() unless
absolutely necessary because the free memory pool below 1 MB from which it
allocates is a scarce system resource.

GlobalDosAlloc() and GlobalDosFree() are documented on pages 4-236 and 4- 237 of
the Microsoft Windows SDK 3.0 "Reference, Volume 1" and on pages 501 and 502 of
the Microsoft Windows SDK 3.1 "Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions."
