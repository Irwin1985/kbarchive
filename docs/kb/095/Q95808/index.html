Product(s): Microsoft Disk Operating System

Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): msdos
Last Modified: 21-NOV-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======


This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

You can successfully install the Microsoft MS-DOS versions 6.0 and later Upgrade
over Digital Research(R) DOS (DR DOS) version 5.0 or 6.0; however, before you
upgrade your current installation of DR DOS or Novell DR-DOS, you should disable
the following:

- DR DOS security features

- DR DOS DELWATCH utility

- DR DOS GOTO and ? commands

- DR DOS CHAIN command

NOTE: If you use the SuperStor(R) (STOR) data-compression program provided with
DR DOS, you should also read the section in this article titled "Your Computer
Uses DR DOS Disk Compression."

DISABLING SECURITY FEATURES
---------------------------

If you have any security features, including password protection, disable them.
When you run the Setup program for the MS-DOS 6.0 or later Upgrade, your system,
system files, DR DOS directory, and files in your DR DOS directory cannot be
password protected. The MS-DOS Upgrade Setup program cannot create an Uninstall
disk if your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file is password protected.

Disabling Password Protection
-----------------------------

To disable password protection for a specific file, type the following at the
command prompt:

  " password &lt;filename&gt; /n " (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;filename&gt; is the file you want to remove the password from. When you
are prompted for the password, type it and then press the ENTER key.

To disable password protection for a specific directory, type the following at
the command prompt

  " password &lt;dirname&gt; /n " (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;dirname&gt; is the directory you want to remove the password from. When
you are prompted for the password, type it and then press the ENTER key.

To disable password protection for the entire system, type the following at the
command prompt:

  " password /ng " (without the quotation marks)

When you are prompted for the password, type it and then press the ENTER key.

  WARNING: The MS-DOS 6.0 and later Upgrade Setup program cannot create an
  Uninstall disk if your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file is password protected.
  If any of your DR-DOS system files or your DR-DOS directory are password
  protected, use the DR-DOS password command to disable the password protection
  before you install MS-DOS 6.0 or later.

Disabling Master Key Password Protection
----------------------------------------

If you installed the Master Key password security option with DR DOS, you must
run DR DOS Setup again to disable it. For more information on this feature, see
your DR DOS documentation.

DISABLING THE DELWATCH DELETE-PROTECTION UTILITY
------------------------------------------------

If you have the DELWATCH delete-protection utility installed on your computer,
you must disable it and purge your deleted files before you install MS-DOS 6.0
and later. To disable the DELWATCH utility:

1. Use an ASCII text editor to open your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

2. Remove the command that loads DELWATCH, save the file, and then quit the text
  editor.

3. Remove any disks in your floppy disk drives, and then restart your computer
  by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

4. Run the DELPURGE utility to purge your hard disk of pending delete files.

DISABLING THE GOTO AND ? COMMANDS
---------------------------------

If your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file uses any conditional DR DOS commands
(such as ? or GOTO), remove those commands and adjust the order of the remaining
commands accordingly. For more information on the DR DOS GOTO and ? commands,
see your DR DOS documentation.

DISABLING THE CHAIN COMMAND
---------------------------

If your CONFIG.SYS file contains the DR DOS CHAIN command, remove it and adjust
the other CONFIG.SYS commands accordingly. For more information on this command,
see your DR DOS documentation.

YOUR COMPUTER USES DR DOS DISK COMPRESSION
------------------------------------------

Drive C is Not Compressed
-------------------------

If your computer uses disk compression but drive C is not compressed, run Setup
as described in the "Getting Started" chapter of the "User's Guide" for version
6.0 and later. When Setup displays the message "Your CONFIG.SYS file contains
commands that are not valid MS-DOS commands," select the Modify Original Files
option.

Drive C is Compressed
---------------------

If your computer uses disk compression, and drive C is compressed, do the
following:

1. Determine which drive is your original uncompressed drive. For more
  information, see your DR DOS documentation.

2. Make backup copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on your
  compressed drive and the DCONFIG.SYS file on your uncompressed drive.

3. Combine the two configuration files. For example, if drive D is your
  uncompressed drive, type the following at the command prompt:

  " copy d:\dconfig.sys + c:\config.sys d:\config.sys " (without the quotation
  marks)

4. Copy the combined CONFIG.SYS file to drive C. For example, if drive D is your
  uncompressed drive, type the following at the command prompt:

  " copy d:\config.sys c:\config.sys " (without the quotation marks)

5. Copy your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to your uncompressed drive. For example, if drive
  D is your uncompressed drive, type the following at the command prompt:

  " copy c:\autoexec.bat d:\autoexec.bat " (without the quotation marks)

6. Run Setup.

7. When Setup displays the message "Your CONFIG.SYS file contains commands that
  are not valid MS-DOS commands," select the Modify Original Files option.

  When Setup displays the message "Because you are currently using the DR DOS
  operating system," choose Continue.

8. After Setup is complete, MS-DOS displays an "Unrecognized command" message on
  your screen for each command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files that
  is not a valid MS-DOS command. Remove these commands from your CONFIG.SYS and
  AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

9. Add the following command to the beginning of your CONFIG.SYS file, and then
  restart your computer:

  " device=c:\dos\himem.sys " (without the quotation marks)

Setup Displays the Message "Your Computer Uses a Disk-Compression

Program and Does Not Have Enough Free Disk Space to Set Up MS-DOS
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If Setup displays the message "Your computer uses a disk-compression program and
does not have enough free disk space to set up MS-DOS," you must convert your DR
DOS 6 SuperStor compressed drive to an MS-DOS 6.0 or later DoubleSpace drive
using the procedure below. This is necessary because the DR DOS 6 SuperStor
program does not provide the functionality for increasing the size of your
uncompressed host drive.

1. Using the DR DOS BACKUP command, back up your program and data files. For
  more information on using the BACKUP command, refer to your DR DOS
  documentation.

2. Insert the MS-DOS 6.0 or later Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B and use the SETUP
  command with the /F switch. For example, if you inserted Setup Disk 1 in
  drive A, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
  ENTER:

  " a:setup /f " (without the quotation marks)

  IMPORTANT: After you type the above command and Setup prompts you to insert a
  disk to create the startup floppy disk, you must create that disk in drive A.
  Also, be sure that you choose to install on drive A.

3. Make sure that the startup disk you created in step 2 is in drive A, and then
  restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

4. Use the MS-DOS FORMAT command to reformat all your drives. When you format
  drive C, be sure to use the /S parameter to make the disk bootable. To do
  this, type the following command at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press
  ENTER:

  " format c: /s " (without the quotation marks)

5. Use the MS-DOS 6.0 or later RESTORE command, which is located on the startup
  disk you created in step 2, to restore your program and data files. For
  example, to restore your files from drive A to drive C, type the following
  command at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

  " restore a: c:\*.* /s " (without the quotation marks)

  IMPORTANT: Do not restart your computer before proceeding to step 6.

  NOTE: If some of your files cannot be restored to your hard disk because you
  don't have enough disk space, you need to install the MS-DOS 6 or later
  Upgrade, run DoubleSpace to compress your hard disk, and then restore your
  files. After you finish restoring your files, continue with step 6.

6. To remove your DR DOS files, install the MS-DOS 6 or 6.2 Upgrade again. To do
  this, insert the MS-DOS 6 or laster Setup Disk 1 in drive A, type "SETUP"
  (without the quotation marks), and follow the instructions on your screen.
