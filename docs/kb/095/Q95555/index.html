SUMMARY
=======

This article contains an overview of how expanded memory that conforms to the
Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) and extended memory that conforms to the
Extended Memory Specification (XMS) is created and managed in MS- DOS versions
5.0 and later by the device drivers HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE. How MS-DOS is
loaded into the high memory area (HMA) and manages upper memory blocks (UMBs)
are also discussed.

NOTE: Before reading this article, you may want to review the sections about
memory management, HIMEM.SYS, and EMM386.EXE in your printed MS-DOS
documentation. If you are using MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, or 6.22, refer to the
online help. For example, type "help emm386.exe" (without the quotation marks)
at the MS-DOS command prompt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Old Extended-Memory Allocation Methods: Interrupt 15h &amp; VDisk Headers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past, there were two ways for programs to allocate extended memory:
top-down (using Interrupt 15) and bottom-up (using VDisk headers).

Interrupt 15h is a ROM BIOS service that includes several extensions to the
original PC ROM BIOS, including the means to find out how much RAM (conventional
plus extended) is on the system. A program uses this service to find out how
much extended memory there is, then "hooks" Interrupt 15h and reports to any
other programs that there is &lt;n&gt;K less memory available, effectively
slicing &lt;n&gt;K of extended memory off the top. By doing this, the program
has allocated its own extended memory from the top of the memory pool.

Bottom-up memory allocation works by checking for a header at the start of
extended memory stating that &lt;n&gt;K of RAM is in use. If a header is there,
the program checks &lt;n&gt;K further for another header. If no header exists,
the program puts in its own header. These headers are called VDisk headers
because the original IBM DOS RAM drive utility (VDISK.SYS) uses this method.

A drawback to these methods is that after memory has been allocated to a program,
deallocating it is usually not possible. The XMS was designed to make allocating
and deallocating extended memory easier for all involved.

HIMEM.SYS Creates XMS Memory
----------------------------

HIMEM.SYS implements all of the XMS except the optional UMB portion. HIMEM.SYS
versions earlier than 3.0 are XMS 2.0 compliant and recognize up to 16 MB of
RAM; versions 3.0 and later (first included with Windows 3.10 and MS-DOS 6.0)
are XMS 3.0 compliant and recognize up to 4 GB.

On loading, HIMEM.SYS determines the amount of extended memory available. Unless
it was loaded with the /INT15= option, HIMEM.SYS sets out to allocate all
available extended memory for use as XMS memory (note the actual allocation of
all the available extended memory does not occur until a program makes an XMS
function call). HIMEM.SYS reserves the HMA with a VDisk header and hooks
Interrupt 15h. Programs that want to use extended memory (other than the HMA)
without using XMS can do so until a program actually requests XMS.

After a program actually asks for XMS memory, HIMEM.SYS uses its Interrupt 15h
hook to notify programs that only the amount of extended memory specified by
/INT15=xxxx, minus the HMA (64K), is available for use. Memory available through
/INT15=xxxx is physically located above the HMA; XMS- managed RAM is physically
located above any /INT15=xxxx RAM.

A20 and the HMA
---------------

The HMA is defined as FFFF:0010-FFFF:FFFF on 80286 and higher systems that have
physical addressable RAM at these addresses. This area can be addressed in real
mode (8086 emulation) on 80286 and higher systems if the 21st address line (A20)
is enabled, which produces 64K-16 bytes of additional usable RAM. On an 8086 or
an 80x86 with the A20 line disabled, FFFF:0010 "wraps around" and is the same as
0000:0000.

Turning this line on and off is accomplished using the keyboard port and is
hardware dependent. HIMEM.SYS includes a number of "A20 handlers" for different
machines. The XMS allocates and deallocates the HMA as one block, that is, only
one program can use it at a time. MS-DOS 5.0 and later can run in the HMA if
DOS=HIGH is in the CONFIG.SYS file.

DOS=HIGH Asks MS-DOS to Run in the HMA
--------------------------------------

If DOS=LOW or no DOS= command is in the CONFIG.SYS file, MS-DOS and its data are
initialized and loaded into their final place in low memory before the DEVICE=
and DEVICEHIGH= commands are processed.

If the DOS=HIGH command is in the CONFIG.SYS file, MS-DOS data (which must remain
low for compatibility) is loaded into its final place in conventional memory.
After each device driver is initialized, a check is made to determine if an XMS
driver has been installed. If so, and if the HMA is available, MS-DOS is moved
into the HMA. If not, MS-DOS keeps checking after each DEVICE[HIGH]= command,
and then begins processing the INSTALL= commands.

If a DOS=HIGH command exists but MS-DOS hasn't loaded high (if no XMS driver was
loaded or the HMA wasn't available), MS-DOS reports "HMA not available/loading
DOS low" and loads itself into conventional memory above all the installable
device drivers and/or terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs loaded with
INSTALL=.

The transient portion of COMMAND.COM remains in conventional memory whether
MS-DOS is loaded high or low. Most of the COMMAND.COM resident portion, any
software code pages, and the disk buffers (usually) also load high if DOS=HIGH
is in the CONFIG.SYS file.

EMM386.EXE [RAM | NOEMS] Uses XMS to Create EMS and/or UMBs
-----------------------------------------------------------

EMM386.EXE is a device driver for 80386 and higher systems with XMS memory.
EMM386.EXE uses XMS memory to create and manage EMS memory and/or XMS upper
memory blocks (UMBs). EMS is available to programs through the EMS 4.0
interface; UMBs are available through the XMS interface. When providing UMBs,
EMM386.EXE answers only requests to allocate or deallocate UMBs; all other XMS
memory is managed by HIMEM.SYS.

On loading, EMM386.EXE shows a report of its activity. Among other things, this
report includes:

- Whether EMS memory is being provided, and, if so:

   - Amount of EMS available

   - Address of EMS page frame segment

- If UMBs are being provided, the following is also shown:

   - Amount of UMBs available through the XMS

   - Largest UMB available through the XMS

   - Address of upper memory starting segment

This report is also available at the MS-DOS command prompt by running
EMM386.EXE.

NOTE: EMM386.EXE versions 4.45 and later do not display this information at
startup UNLESS the /VERBOSE switch is used.

DOS=UMB Asks MS-DOS to Manage UMBs
----------------------------------

The DOS=UMB command asks MS-DOS to allocate any UMBs available through the XMS to
itself. MS-DOS then makes UMBs available through its own memory- management
services in Interrupt 21h, including:

  Function        Description                     Version
  -------------------------------------------------------
  48h             Allocate memory                 2.0
  49h             Free allocated memory           2.0
  4Ah             Set memory block size           2.0
  5800h           Get allocation strategy         2.0
  5801h           Set allocation strategy         2.0
  5802h           Get upper-memory link status    5.0
  5803h           Set upper-memory link status    5.0

If DOS=UMB is in the CONFIG.SYS file, EMM386.EXE reports that 0 (zero) UMBs are
available from the MS-DOS command prompt, and any program that attempts to use
UMBs through the XMS services is unable to find them.

Users can determine whether MS-DOS has any UMBs available by using the MEM /C
command. Programs can use Interrupt 21h, Function 5803h to determine if UMBs
exist.

DEVICEHIGH=[&lt;drive&gt;:][\&lt;path&gt;\]&lt;filename&gt;
-----------------------------------------

The DEVICEHIGH= command asks that the device driver file be loaded into an MS-DOS
UMB if there is one available that is big enough. If there isn't, the driver is
loaded into conventional memory and executed; no error is displayed by MS-DOS.

LH (LOADHIGH)
-------------

The LH (or LOADHIGH) command tells MS-DOS to load the program file into an MS-DOS
UMB if there is one available that is big enough. If there is not, the program
is loaded into conventional memory and executed; no error is displayed by
MS-DOS.

DEVICEHIGH AND LOADHIGH WITH /L: AND /S
---------------------------------------

If you are using MS-DOS version 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, or 6.22, you can use the /L and
/S switches to control the memory regions into which a device driver or program
is loaded.

  DEVICEHIGH [[/L:region1[,minsize1][;region2[,minssize2] [/S]]=

The /L: switch specifies the memory region(s) a program can be loaded into. If
the /L: switch is not specified, MS-DOS loads the program into the largest free
UMB and all other UMB regions are available to the program. Use the MEM /F
command to view the available memory regions. (Region 0 is conventional
memory.)

The /S switch shrinks the UMB to the minimum size (minsize) while the program is
loading. This switch can only be used in conjunction with the /L: switch and
affects only UMBs for which a minimum size was specified.

The following is an example:

 LOADHIGH /L:1,12194;2,34213 /S C:\PROGDIR\PROGRAM.EXE

This command loads PROGRAM.EXE and restricts it to load into memory regions 1 and
2. The program has access to only 12,194 bytes in region 1 and only 34,213 bytes
in region 2.

NOTE: Rather than attempting to manually configure the memory regions programs
load into, MS-DOS 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, and 6.22 users are encouraged to run the
MemMaker memory optimization program. To run MemMaker, type "memmaker" (without
the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

MEM Reports on Memory MS-DOS Is Managing
----------------------------------------

If MS-DOS is managing UMBs (DOS=UMB), MEM /C or MEM /D includes the UMA in its
report. Any areas not being managed by MS-DOS are labeled "SYSTEM" in this
report. For UMB information, type "mem /c | more" (without the quotation marks)
at the MS-DOS command prompt. (Note that if you are using MS-DOS 6.0 or later,
you can type "mem /c /p" (without the quotation marks) to view the memory report
one screen at a time.)

If MS-DOS is not managing the UMBs, MEM does not report on the UMA. Other UMB
managers typically have some means to determine what is loading high. Check the
documentation for your UMB manager for details.

MEM also includes information about extended memory (determined using the
Interrupt 15/VDisk header interface), the XMS (reported through the XMS 2.0 or
3.0 interface), and the EMS (reported through the EMS 3.2 or 4.0 interface) for
your convenience.

How MS-DOS Uses Extended or Expanded Memory
-------------------------------------------

As a whole, MS-DOS does not use extended or expanded memory for general usage or
for loading applications.

However, some MS-DOS utilities and drivers use extended or expanded memory for
data areas. In addition, MS-DOS versions 5.0 and later load most of the MS-DOS
kernel, command interpreter, code pages (if used), and disk buffers into the
HMA, which is the first 64K of extended memory.

The table below outlines which MS-DOS utilities use extended memory without an
extended memory driver, extended memory through an XMS driver, or expanded
memory through a Lotus-Intel-Microsoft (LIM) EMS driver.

These utilities load into conventional memory but use nonconventional memory for
data areas. Because different versions of many utilities that ship with MS-DOS
also ship with Microsoft Windows, the Windows versions are included in this
table. Microsoft recommends that you do not mix versions of these drivers that
are included with different products.

EMM386.EXE(3) All      No     No         Yes(4)    Provider

  (1) Uses extended memory to provide XMS memory
  (2) Uses extended memory to provide EMS memory
  (3) Uses XMS memory to emulate EMS memory
  (4) MS-DOS 5.0 and later EMM386.EXE can also be configured to
      provide UMBs according to the XMS. This causes EMM386.EXE
      to be a provider of the UMB portion of the XMS.

In MS-DOS versions 4.x, you can place the disk buffers in expanded memory by
using the /X switch; however, this is not recommended because of problems that
may arise. SMARTDRV can provide much of the same performance enhancements and is
preferable to using BUFFERS /X. For more information about BUFFERS /X, query in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the following words:

  buffers and ems and /x

Loading the disk buffers in EMS memory is not supported in MS-DOS versions 5.0
and later. These versions support loading the MS-DOS kernel and, if there is
room, the disk buffers into the HMA. MS-DOS accesses the HMA through the XMS
protocol.
