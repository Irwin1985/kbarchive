-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a grid control loses focus, the focus rectangle surrounding the active cell
incorrectly remains on the cell.

This behavior differs from that of the grid control that shipped with the
Professional Toolkit for Visual Basic version 1.0. The active cell, with the
focus rectangle, can be differentiated from other cells in the grid by its wider
border when GridLines is set to True or by the fact that it is the only cell
with a border when GridLines is set to False.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, change the active cell to one in a fixed row or
column so that no cell has a focus rectangle. Selected cells are unaffected by
changing the active cell. For example, add the following code to the LostFocus
event of a grid control named grid1:

     Sub Grid1_LostFocus ()
        Grid1.Row = 0
        Grid1.Col = 0
     End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in both the Standard and
Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic version 2.0 for Windows. This
problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run Visual Basic, or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N) if
  Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the GRID.VBX
  custom control file. The grid tool appears in the Toolbox. In Visual Basic
  version 3.0, GRID.VBX is automatically installed.

3. Add a grid control (Grid1) to Form1 with the following properties:

  Rows: 5
  Cols: 5

4. Add a text box (Text1) to Form1.

5. From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S) to run the program. Grid1 gets
  the focus on startup and the focus rectangle is around R1C1.

6. Tab to the text box. Focus changes from Grid1 to Text1. Even though focus
  changed to Text1, the focus rectangle on R1C1 on the Grid1 incorrectly
  remains.
