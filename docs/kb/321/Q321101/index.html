IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

COMTI TCP/IP security information that is sent in a transaction request message
(TRM) is not in a format that is compatible with the default security exit,
EZACICSE, that is supplied by IBM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

COMTI TCP/IP security information is sent in the following format:

+------------------------------------+
| Byte    | Data                     | 
+------------------------------------+
| 1 - 4   | Transaction Program Name | 
+------------------------------------+
| 5       | '0x6B' (Comma Separator) | 
+------------------------------------+
| 6 - 13  | User ID                  | 
+------------------------------------+
| 14 - 21 | Password                 | 
+------------------------------------+
| 22 - 40 | Program Data             | 
+------------------------------------+

Microsoft has updated COMTI to support the default IBM-supplied security exit,
EZACICSE. After you apply the update and add the specified registry entry, COMTI
TCP/IP security information that is supported by EZACICSE is sent in the
following format:

+------------------------------------+
| Byte    | Data                     | 
+------------------------------------+
| 1 - 4   | Transaction Program Name | 
+------------------------------------+
| 5       | '0x6B' (Comma Separator) | 
+------------------------------------+
| 6       | '0x01'                   | 
+------------------------------------+
| 7 - 14  | Password                 | 
+------------------------------------+
| 15 - 22 | User ID                  | 
+------------------------------------+
| 23 - 40 | Program Data             | 
+------------------------------------+

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This update requires that you add a registry key so that COMTI can send the
TCP/IP security information using the IBM format for EZACICSE. To add the
registry key, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Locate and then click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cedar\Defaults

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: UseIBMTCPSecurityExit
  Data type: REG_SZ
  Value data: TRUE

NOTE: The actual data value is not checked, but you must enter a data value.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

A supported feature that modifies the product's default behavior is now available
from Microsoft, but it is only intended to modify the behavior that is described
in this article. Apply it only to systems that specifically need it. This
feature may receive additional testing. Therefore, if your system is not
severely affected by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that
contains this feature.

To obtain this feature immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
