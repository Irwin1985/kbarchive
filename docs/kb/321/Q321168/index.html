SYMPTOMS

or user group-based collections may run again when a user logs on.

For additional information, click the article numbers below to view the articles

  Times

  Q316021 SMS: Smsapm32 Does Not Remove Software or Generate Status Messages

completed job files on the client. If an assigned advertisement for a user or
user group has already been installed, it may run again if the user remains
logged out for more than 23 hours.

testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft

additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

  Q323206 SMS: List of Bugs Fixed in the Systems Management Server 2.0 SP4 HRP

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix in this article also fixes the problem that is described in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q316868 Advertisements Do Not Start When a User Logs On

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Apply this fix on all of the sites in the SMS hierarchy. To install the fix, use
one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on i386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required; you must
  also download them from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
  folder structure intact. The Q321168.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q316021.exe file and follow the instructions in the wizard. The
  Systems Management Server services are stopped and restarted as part of the
  installation process.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. Copy the update program file (Q321168.exe) and platform folders to a new
  folder. The folder structure must be arranged so that the program file is
  located one folder "above" the platform folders.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services in Control
  Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. Replace the Clicore.exe file in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version in the
  hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

4. Replace the Compver.ini in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder with the
  Compverbase.ini file in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder. Change the file
  name to Compver.ini.

5. Replace the Ccmcore.exe file in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version in the
  hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

6. Replace the Apasetup.exe file in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\smsapm32\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version in
  the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

7. Replace the Compver.ini file in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\smsapm32 folder
  with the Compversmsapm32.ini file in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.
  Change the file name to Compver.ini.

8. Replace the Swdist32.exe file in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version in
  the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

9. Replace the Compver.ini file in the SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist folder
  with the Compverswdist.ini file in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; Folder. Change
  the file name to Compver.ini.

  the version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

11. Replace the cqmgr32.dll file the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

12. Replace the Ccim32.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

13. Replace the Clisvcl.exe file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

  the version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

15. Replace the Ndsclin.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

16. Replace the Odpsys32.exe file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with
  the version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.
