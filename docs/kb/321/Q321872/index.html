The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are using a linked table in Microsoft Access with the Host Integration
Server (HIS) 2000 ODBC Driver for DB2. You connect through TCP/IP to an IBM
mainframe OS390 system, and you receive the following error message if there are
more than 10 records stored in the table:

  SQL Error -514 has occurred. Please consult the documentation for your
  specific DB2 version for a description of the associated Native Error and SQL
  State.

This problem occurs only when you connect to DB2 on a mainframe host system. The
problem does not occur when you connect to DB2 on an AS/400 system.

CAUSE
=====

Because of the way that Access interacts with linked tables, if there are more
than 10 records stored in a table, the ODBC Driver for DB2 may send a
Distributed Data Management (DDM) Close Query (clsqry) command to the host
system in certain situations. When clsqry is sent to DB2 on a mainframe, the
current SQL statement is always unprepared. When Access tries to fetch the next
bulk of stored records from the linked DB2 database, the ODBC Driver for DB2
will issue a DDM Query Answer Set Data (qrydta) command. This command fails
because it does not have a PREPARE statement in front of it.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix must have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date         Time    Version     Size       File name
  --------------------------------------------------------
  25-Apr-2002  15:37   5.0.0.836   258.320    mseidrda.dll
  25-Apr-2002  15:37   5.0.0.836   876.816    mseidb2d.dll
  25-Apr-2002  15:37   5.0.0.836    78.096    mseidb2c.dll
  

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.
