The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Dungeon Siege, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you play Dungeon Siege, you may receive an error message similar to the
following:

  Fatal Error has occurred and the application must be shut down.

  Decoding error - compressed data is corrupt or unreadable.

  -or-

  Unable to open file '&lt;file&gt;'
  Check your nodes_misc.gas file for a typo. Cannot continue, the program will
  now exit.

  -or-

  Decoding error! Compressed data is either corrupt or unreadable, possibly due
  to hardware failure. Try replacing or repairing the resource file
  (reinstall?) to fix this problem.

You may also experience the following behavior(s):

- During installation a resource file (*.dsres) does not copy.

- The game or computer stops responding (hangs).

- There is no sound during game play.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if one or more of the following are true:

- Dungeon Siege resource files that are currently being stored in memory are
  becoming corrupted due to incorrect settings on the computer hardware.

- Dungeon Siege interacts extensively with almost every system in the PC and as
  a result, is very sensitive to the hardware configuration.

- There is a corrupted resource file (.dsres).

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify Files
------------

Verify that the resource files is corrupted by running a cyclical redundancy
check (CRC) on the files. To do this, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

1. Right-click the desktop, point to New, and then click Shortcut.

2. Click Browse, click DungeonSiege.exe, and then click Open. By default, the
  path is "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Dungeon Siege\DungeonSiege.exe".

3. In the "Command line" box, to the right of the quotation marks ("), type a
  space, and then type " verifydata=true" (without the quotation marks).

4. Click Next, and then click Finish.

5. Double-click the new shortcut.

  The CRC takes several minutes to complete.

If any of the files do not pass the CRC test, the files are corrupted. To remove
and reinstall the game, use one of the following methods:

Method 1:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Dungeon Siege, and then click Add/Remove.

4. Click Uninstall, and then click OK.

  NOTE: Do not click to select the "Remove saved games" check box.

5. After the removal is complete, verify the integrity of your hard disk to look
  for lost clusters and errors. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Double-click My Computer on the desktop, and then click the hard disk
     where you will install Dungeon Siege.

  b. On the File menu, click Properties.

  c. On the Tools tab, click Check Now under Error-checking.

  d. Under "Check disk options", click to select the "Scan for and attempt
     recovery of bad sectors" check box.

  e. Click Start.

6. Reinstall Dungeon Siege.
