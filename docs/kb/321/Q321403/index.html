-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server receives a BIND that contains various routing vectors and
security subfields, you may receive an Access Violation. Whether this behavior
occurs depends on the length of the BIND request.

CAUSE
=====

When SNA Server prepares the BIND response and tries to add the enciphered data
to the BIND, the buffer is overwritten, which causes an Access Violation.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date         Time    Version     Size      File name
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  16-Apr-2002  08:59  4.0.0.606    468,864   Snaservr.exe
  16-Apr-2002  08:59  4.0.0.606    935,344   Trcservr.exe

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.

STATUS
======

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1,
4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, and 4.0 SP4.

Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been observed when SNA Server receives and parses a long BIND
that comes from the IBM Enterprise Extender and includes High Performance
Routing (HPR) data and Security vectors.

When you apply Dr. Watson as the default debugger, a Dr. Watson log is created
that includes the following or similar content:

Application exception occurred:
