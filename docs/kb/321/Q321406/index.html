  Acceleration Level to Basic acceleration.

  If this does not resolve this issue, proceed to Method 2.

  Method 2: Ensure that Your Sound Card Supports EAX:

  support the EAX audio option.

  If your sound card does support the EAX audio option, proceed to Method 3.

  3. In the Sound playback pane, in the Default device drop down menu, click the

  card driver.
