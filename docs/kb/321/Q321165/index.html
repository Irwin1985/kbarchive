-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view any kind of permissions by using the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program that is installed on a server or workstation that is
running either Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP, you may receive
the following error message:

  The trust relationship between the primary domain and the trusted domain
  failed. Microsoft Windows NT ID: 0xc00206fc

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if certain accounts in the Access Control Lists (ACLs) have
been deleted or if the display names of the accounts do not resolve from their
security IDs (SIDs). The accounts may not resolve if you remove the primary
domain controller (PDC) server from a domain after you add the accounts to the
permissions on a resource. In the situation that causes the error message that
is described in the "Symptoms" section of this article, the domain that is the
home to the accounts is unreachable; the domain cannot contact the domain
controller to resolve the SID.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, you must use a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based server
that has the Administrator program installed to view permissions:

1. Log on to the Windows NT 4.0-based server, and then connect to a server that
  is running Windows 2000.

2. Use the Administrator program to check all levels of permissions, including
  Organization, Site, Configuration, and other levels.

3. Remove all unresolved accounts (SIDs).

After you remove the unresolved accounts, the error message typically no longer
occurs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue can occur if you are using a configuration that includes two domains,
a Windows 2000-based domain and a Windows NT 4.0 domain, which also include two
different Exchange Server 5.5 sites. In this configuration, the Exchange Server
5.5 service account is located in the Windows NT 4.0-based domain. The error
message only appears when you try to view permissions by using the Administrator
program that is installed on a computer that is running Windows 2000.

You may also want to verify the domain trusts in both directions. You can use the
Nltest tool, the net use command, or the Active Directory Sites and Services
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to verify the domain trusts.
