  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the error messages that you may receive when you try to
install Dungeon Siege. It describes how to troubleshoot the issue and how to
resolve the issue if it can be resolved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you try to install Dungeon Siege, you may receive an error message similar
to one or more of the following:

  Dungeon Siege Setup encountered an error while reading the file &lt;file
  name&gt;. Make sure that the disc is properly inserted in the CD-ROM drive,
  and then click Retry.

  -or-

  Dungeon Siege Setup encountered a disk error while writing to the file
  &lt;file name&gt;. Make sure your hard disk is not full, and that the file is
  not in use.

  -or-

  Dungeon Siege Setup cannot continue because your hard disk is full or
  write-protected. Close any applications, delete unnecessary files from this
  drive, and then try again.

To troubleshoot and resolve this issue, use one or more of the following
methods.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Method 1: Install Dungeon Siege from a Different CD-ROM Drive or DVD Drive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try to install Dungeon Siege from another CD-ROM drive or DVD drive on the same
computer or a different computer. If the installation is successful in this
test, the problem may be that the original CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is not
properly reading the disc. To resolve this issue, contact your computer
manufacturer or your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive manufacturer.

Method 2: Run Scandisk and Defrag
---------------------------------

1. Restart your computer by using a Windows Startup disk.

2. At the command prompt, type "scandisk /surface" (without the quotation
  marks), and then press ENTER.

  The process starts automatically.

3. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click Disk Defragmenter.

4. Click the drive that you want to defragment, and then click Defragment.

  The process begins automatically.

Method 3: Rebuild the Virtual Memory File
-----------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System, click the Performance tab, and then click Virtual
  Memory.

3. Click "Let me specify my own virtual memory settings", and then specify the
  virtual memory file location and size.

4. Click OK, and then click OK.

Method 4: Clear the Temporary Files
-----------------------------------

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Locate the following folder, and then open it:

  C:\Windows\Temp

3. On the Edit menu, click Select All, and then press DELETE.

4. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.

5. Close Windows Explorer.

Method 5: Run XCopy to Check the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM Drive
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

3. Type the following and then press ENTER, where drive is the letter of your
  CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive:

  "xcopy drive :\*.* /s &gt; c:\test1" (without the quotation marks)

  If the XCopy process fails, your disc is damaged and cannot be read.

Method 6: Install Dungeon Siege on a Network Computer
-----------------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

2. On computer B, turn on sharing on the Dungeon Siege folder.

4. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MicrosoftGames\DungeonSeige

6. On the File menu, click Export.

7. In the Export Registry File dialog box, in the "File name" box, type "ds.reg"
  (without the quotation marks).

8. In the "Save in" box, locate the following folder, and then open it:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Dungeon Siege

9. Click Save.

10. Connect the computer that you originally used to install Dungeon Siege,
  "computer A," to computer B by means of your home network.

11. On computer B, copy the Dungeon Siege folder to the following folder on
  computer A:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games

12. On computer A, locate the following file:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Dungeon Siege\DS.reg

13. When you are prompted to confirm the registry setting, click OK.

14. Right-click a blank space on the desktop, point to New, and then click
  Shortcut.

15. Use the Browse button to locate the following file, and then click it:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Dungeon Siege\DungeonSiege.exe

16. Click OK, and then click Next.

17. Click Finish to complete the installation process.
