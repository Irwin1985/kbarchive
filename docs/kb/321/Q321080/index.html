-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, versions 2.0, 2.1 OEM Only, 2.2 OEM Only 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Ntbackup.exe utility from Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP may
not back up data from an SFU NFS mount point. Although the backup appears to
work, the file is empty after you restore it. A netmon trace shows that an NFS
'Read from Directory' is sent to the UNIX host, but not a 'Read from File', and
this is why no data is backed up.

CAUSE
=====

Ntbackup.exe queries the NFS client to see if it supports IOCTLs for querying
for space regions. Although the NFS client claims to support IOCTL for querying
sparse region, it does not.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
