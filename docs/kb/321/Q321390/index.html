SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to locate any ColdFusion (.cfm) files, you are prompted for user
name and password credentials, and you then receive the following error message
in the browser:

  HTTP Error 401
  401.3 Unauthorized: Unauthorized due to ACL on resource

This behavior occurs even when the ColdFusion application is set to allow
Anonymous authentication. Later, when you are prompted for credentials, you may
access the ColdFusion page if you enter the user name and password of the
Administrator account. This indicates that the Anonymous user (which by default
is the IUSR_machinename user) does not have enough permissions to access the
ColdFusion application.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is typically related to Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows
2000 security and permissions at the NTFS level.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using the Anonymous user account (that is, the IUSR_machinename user
account) to access the ColdFusion application to access the .cfm pages, the
IUSR_machinename user must have at least Read and Execute rights for the
following directories, as well as any folders and files that these directories
contain:

NOTE: If you are using Basic authentication or NTLM Challenge/Response instead of
Anonymous authentication, the account that you are using must also have these
permissions.

- \Cfusion\Bin (especially Iscf.dll, which resides in that directory)

- \Winnt\System32

- The Web root directory and any other directories to which the Anonymous user
  needs access

MORE INFORMATION
================

In certain cases, this behavior occurs after you reboot the computer. The reason
may be that the security on the server is adjusted so that only Administrators
have rights to the root of drive C on the server. This also limits the access to
the ColdFusion directory to only Administrators. This lack of rights to the
ColdFusion dynamic link libraries (DLLs) may cause the prompt for credentials
(that is, the user name and password prompt) to appear. Internet Information
Services (IIS) loads this DLL when the server starts and keeps it in memory.
Because the DLL is already in memory, a security check is not performed.
However, when the server is rebooted, the new security becomes effective and the
password prompt may appear.
