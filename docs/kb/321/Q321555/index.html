The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains the three types of data encryption that are included with
SNA Server and Host Integration Server 2000:

- Server-to-server

- Client sponsor connection

- Client-to-server application

MORE INFORMATION
================

About Data Encryption
---------------------

- Data encryption with SNA Server and Host Integration Server is implemented by
  using the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI).

- The supported data encryption levels are 40-bit, 56-bit, and 128-bit.

- The level of encryption that is used is determined by the operating system
  (OS), not by either the SNA or Host Integration Server client or by the SNA
  or Host Integration Server application.

- The level of encryption is determined by the maximum encryption strength that
  is possible over the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). For example, if a client
  supports 40-bit encryption and the server supports 128-bit encryption, the
  negotiated encryption level will be at the 40-bit level.

Any third-party emulator or application that is written to use the SNA Server or
Host Integration Server client application programming interface (API) will
automatically benefit if encryption is enabled.

Server-to-Server Data Encryption
--------------------------------

Encryption of data is possible between two computers that are running SNA Server
or Host Integration Server when you use the Distributed Link Service (DLS). You
can use DLS encryption to provide secure communications across your network, the
Internet, or any other wide area network (WAN).

When you use DLS, consider whether or not trust exists between the two Windows NT
or Windows 2000 domains.

If trust does exist, note that for pass-through authenticaton to work, the branch
(remote) SNA Server/Host Integration Server computer must run under a domain
user account that can be authenticated by the domain where the central (remote)
SNA Server/Host Integration Server computer resides. For example, the branch
server's link service would be SNAREMx, that is,
&lt;\\Central_Server\SnaDlcx&gt;.

If no Trust exists between the domains, the user account and password that the
branch (remote) server is running under (for example, SNAREMx, that is,
&lt;\\Central_Server\SnaDlcx&gt;) must also exist in the central (remote)
accounts domain for authentication to occur.

Also note that you cannot encrypt data by running the SNAREMx service under the
local system account.

Client Sponsor Connection Data Encryption
-----------------------------------------

When an SNA or Host Integration Server client connects to a SNA Server or Host
Integration Server computer over the sponsor connection, various messages are
sent to the client. When you add the SecureSponsor registry parameter on the
server that is running SNA Server or HIS, all sponsor connection data is
encrypted.

Base:

Client-to-Server Application Data Encryption
--------------------------------------------

Client-to-server encryption prevents information from being sent in clear text
between an SNA or Host Integration Server client and an SNA Server or Host
Integration Server computer. You can enable client/server encryption on either a
group or user-by-user basis.

To configure users for client-server encryption, follow these steps:

1. In the SNA Server Manager console tree, double-click Configured Users.

2. Right-click the user or group that you want to configure, and then click
  Properties.

3. On the Properties tab, click to select the Use Client/Server Encryption check
  box, and then click OK.

4. In the Action list, click Save configuration.

5. Restart the computer that is running SNA Server or Host Integration Server
  for the changes to take effect.

NOTE: SSL support is not available for TN3270 and TN5250. Therefore, encryption
is not available when you use either of these TN services with SNA Server or
HIS.
