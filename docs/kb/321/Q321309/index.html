SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch to address two new security vulnerabilities in
Internet Explorer for Macintosh.

The first vulnerability is an unchecked buffer that is associated with the
handling of a particular HTML element. A security vulnerability results because
an attacker can run a buffer-overrun attack that tries to exploit this flaw. A
successful attack would have the result of causing the program to fail, or to
cause code of the attacker's choice to run as if it were run under the user's
permissions.

The second vulnerability is a flaw in how Internet Explorer for Macintosh handles
certain HTML elements that run AppleScripts that are stored on the local
computer. This flaw makes it possible for locally-stored AppleScripts to be
started outside the typical security restrictions. A vulnerability results
because it is possible for a malicious user to exploit this and cause
AppleScripts to run without the user's consent. The AppleScripts would run as if
they had been started by the user, and might take the same actions as any
AppleScript that is legitimately started by the user.

RESOLUTION
==========

Macintosh OS X
--------------

To resolve this problem, use the Software Update feature in Macintosh OS X
version 10.1 to install the Internet Explorer 5.1 Security Update. Additional
information about the Software Update feature is available at the following
Apple Computer Web site:
