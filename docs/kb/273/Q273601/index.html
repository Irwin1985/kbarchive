MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xxii: Incorrect URL
------------------------

On page xxii, the first bullet in the Reference Materials section has an inactive
URL.

Change:
"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/"

To:
"http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/default.asp"


Page xxxi: Incorrect Hardware Requirements Information
------------------------------------------------------

The minimum processor and memory requirements for Windows 2000 Server is a
Pentium 133 MHz processor and 128 MB of memory.

On page xxxi, under Hardware Requirements, change:
"32-bit 166 MHz Pentium processor
64 MB memory for networking with one to five client computers;
128 MB minimum is recommended for most network environments"

To:
"133 MHz or higher Pentium-compatible CPU
128 MB memory minimum"


Page xxxii: Incorrect Information About CD Included With The Book
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On page xxxii, under the Software Requirements section, it states:

"The copy of the Windows 2000 Server 120-Day Evaluation CD-ROM that is included
in the back of this book is required to complete the procedures in this
course."

This is incorrect. The Windows 2000 Server 120-Day Evaluation CD-ROM is not
included with this book.


Page 12: Incorrect Illustration In Figure 1.3
---------------------------------------------

On page 12, in Figure 1.3, the illustration incorrectly shows that the
"Environment subsystems" encompasses "Win32 subsystem", "OS/2 subsystem", and
"Integral subsystem".

There is a curved line drawn between the "Win32 subsystem" oval and the "Integral
subsystem" oval with a label above it that reads "Environmental subsystems".
That curved line should be between the "POSIX subsystem" oval and the "OS/2
subsystem" oval to indicate that POSIX, Win32, and OS/2 are all environmental
subsystems. The label "Integral subsystems", which is under the "POSIX
subsystem" oval, should be placed at the right side of the diagram near the
"Integral subsystem" oval.


Page 16: Incorrect Information About Alpha-Based System Support
---------------------------------------------------------------

On page 16, under the "Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)" section, the last
sentence incorrectly indicates that Alpha-based systems are supported in Windows
2000. However, Alpha-based systems are not supported in Windows 2000 final
release version.

Change:
"This layer allows Windows 2000 to run on both Intel-based and Alpha-based
systems without having to maintain two separate versions of Windows 2000
Executive."

To:
"This layer was originally designed to allow Windows 2000 to run on both
Intel-based and Alpha-based systems without having to maintain two separate
versions of Windows 2000 Executive. However, Alpha-based systems are not
supported in Windows 2000 final release version."


Pages 93 And 95: Incorrect IP Address In Figures 4.3 And 4.4
------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 93 and 95, in Figures 4.3 and 4.4, the IP addresses listed in the Public
Internet portion of the figures are incorrect. 192.168.x.x is a reserved address
range for private networks.

Change the IP address from:

"192.168.x.x"

To:

"192.169.x.x"


Page 102: Incorrect Reference To Windows 2000 Workstation
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 102, in the last paragraph,

Change:
"Windows 2000 workstation"

To:
"Windows 2000 Professional"


Page 106: Incorrect Program For Changing Domain Mode
----------------------------------------------------

On page 106, under "To change the domain mode to native mode", step 1 incorrectly
lists Active Directory Users And Computers as the program for changing the
domain mode.

Change:
"1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
Active Directory Users And Computers."

To:
"1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
Active Directory Domains And Trusts."


Page 119: "Operations Master" Should Be "Standby Operations Master"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 119, under "Relative ID Master Failure"

Change:
"If the relative identifier master will be unavailable for an unacceptable length
of time, you can seize role to the operations master."

To:
"If the relative identifier master will be unavailable for an unacceptable length
of time, you can seize role to the standby operations master."


Page 135: Forward Should Be Reverse
-----------------------------------

On page 135, under "Zone File",

Change:
"For the standard primary forward lookup zone type"

To:
"For the standard primary reverse lookup zone type"


Page 144: IFXR Should Be IXFR
-----------------------------

On page 144, in the third line,

Change:
"IFXR allows..."

To:
"IXFR allows..."


Page 168: Incorrect Screenshot
------------------------------

On page 168, Figure 6.6, change the four options in the figure

From:
"None - Once per Hour - Twice per Hour - Four Times per Hour"

To:
"Replication Not Available - Replication Available"


Page 185: Incorrect Information About Password Length
-----------------------------------------------------

On page 185, in the fourth bulleted item, the password length is incorrect.

Change:
"Passwords can be up to 14 characters; a minimum length of eight characters is
recommended."

To:
"Passwords can be up to 127 characters; a minimum length of eight characters is
recommended."


Page 193: Incorrect Information About Option Overriding In Table 7.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 193, in Table 7.8, the description for "Password Never Expires" is
incorrect.

Change the last sentence from:
"The User Must Change Password At Next Logon option overrides the Password Never
Expires option"

To:
"The Password Never Expires option overrides the User Must Change Password At
Next Logon option"


Page 244: Incorrect Information About Changing Universal Group Scope
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 244, please remove the Note section under "Changing the Group Scope to
Universal":

"Note Windows 2000 does not allow changing the scope of a universal group because
usage and membership rules for other groups are more restrictive."


Page 251: Incorrect Group Scope For Enterprise Admins
-----------------------------------------------------

On page 256, at the top of the page, "Enterprise Admins" is listed under the
column "Predefined Global Group". This is incorrect. "Enterprise Admins" is a
predefined Universal Group.


Pages 251 &amp; 252: Correction To Table 8.7's Heading
--------------------------------------------------

On pages 251 and 252, change:
"Table 8.7 Commonly Used Built-In Domain Local Global Group"

-------------------------------------------------------------

On page 252, in the last sentence of the first paragraph under "Built-In Local
Groups"

To:
"...in the Local Users and Groups snap-in."


Page 252: Incorrect Reference To Windows 2000 Workstation
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 252, in Table 8.8 there are two references to "Windows 2000 Workstation".
They should read "Windows 2000 Professional".


Page 367: Missing Machine Parameter
-----------------------------------

On page 367, in step 1, the "netdom move" syntax sample is missing the "machine"
parameter, which specifies the workstation or member server to be moved.

Change:
Open a command prompt and type " netdom move /D:domain [/OU:ou_path] [/Ud:User
/Pd:{Password|*}] [/Uo:User /Po:{Password|*}][/Reboot:[time_in_seconds]]"
(without the quotation marks)

To:
Open a command prompt and type "netdom move machine /D:domain [/OU:ou_path]
[/Ud:User /Pd:{Password|*}] [/Uo:User
/Po:{Password|*}][/Reboot:[time_in_seconds]]" (without the quotation marks)

The first bullet on page 368 lists the domain switch incorrectly.

Change:
"/domain"

To:
"/D:domain"


Page 382: Inaccurate Information About Domain Restore
-----------------------------------------------------

On page 382, in the last paragraph, change:

"To authoritatively restore Active Directory data, you must run the NTDSUTIL
utility after you have performed a nonauthoritative restore of the System State
data but before restarting the server."

To:

"To authoritatively restore Active Directory data, you must run the NTDSUTIL
utility after you have performed a nonauthoritative restore of the System State
data but before restarting the domain controller in normal mode."


Page 417: Incorrect Information About GPO Processing Priority
-------------------------------------------------------------

On page 417, in the last sentence of the page,

Change:
"Windows 2000 processes GPOs from the top of the list to the bottom of the
list."

To:
"Windows 2000 processes GPOs from the bottom of the list to the top of the
list."


Page 434: Error In Information About Publishing Applications
------------------------------------------------------------

"published" to "assigned" as follows.

Change:

To:
"An application can be assigned to both computers and users."


Pages 470, 471 and 504: Incorrect Statement About Policy Refresh Interval
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 470, 471 and 504, in the last bulleted items,

Change:
"By default, policy propagation occurs every eight hours"

To:
"By default, policy propagation occurs every 90 minutes for Windows 2000-based
computers, every 5 minutes for the domain controller."


Pages 571 and 586: Incorrect Statement About Policy Refresh Interval
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 571 and 586, in the NOTE, third bullet, change:

"By default, policy progagation occurs every eight hours"
