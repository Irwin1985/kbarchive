The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
- Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (all editions)

SUMMARY
=======

This article answers frequently asked questions about the licensing requirements
for Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 for both client and
server computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When is an SMS license required?

SMS can be installed as a primary site or a secondary site. In both cases, a
license for SMS is required. Component servers, such as distribution points,
client access points (CAPs), and software metering servers do not require an SMS
license, but they may require an SMS Client Access License.

When do I need a Systems Management Server Client Access License?

Any computer or device, including servers, that installs any of the client
components (such as hardware inventory, software inventory, software metering,
software distribution, or remote control) requires an SMS Client Access License.
Any client that runs packages that are created with the SMS Installer software
repackaging tool also requires a Client Access License. A Client Access License
is not required for server-to-server communications.

Do I need a Microsoft SQL Server license?

SMS version 2.0 requires at least one license for Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or
later. Larger or decentralized organizations may require more SQL Server
licenses if they have more than one SMS primary site.

Do I need SQL Server Client Access Licenses ?

SQL Server Client Access Licenses are only required if SQL Server is used with
programs other than SMS. If SQL Server is used solely as a database for SMS and
is accessed solely through the interface provided by SMS, no additional SQL
Server Client Access Licenses are required.

Is SQL Server included with SMS?

If you acquire Microsoft BackOffice Server version 4.5, you receive SMS 2.0 and
SQL Server 7.0. You may install both products on the same computer as defined in
the BackOffice End User License Agreement (EULA). If you acquire only SMS, you
do not receive any software or license for SQL Server. In this case, you would
need to obtain a complete version of SQL Server 6.5 or later separately.

REFERENCES
==========

Please see the EULA that is included with SMS for more information about SMS
licensing details.

For additional information about SQL Server licensing details, please refer to
the Server and Client End User License Agreement that is included with SQL
Server and SMS.
