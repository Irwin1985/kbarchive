-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 or Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0
shuts down and restarts for no apparent reason.

CAUSE
=====

IIS 5.0:

This problem can occur because of a known vulnerability. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q300972 Unchecked Buffer in Index Server ISAPI Extension Can Enable Web
  Server Compromise

Alternatively, this problem can occur when .htm documents are mapped to the
Ssinc.dll file and IIS receives a request with the "HEAD" verb to process. This
is not supported on default documents, and therefore, IIS returns a 403 error
message. However, IIS fails when it handles this error condition, which causes
it to shut down and then restart the IIS services.

IIS 4.0:

This problem can occur because of a known vulnerability. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Server Compromise
