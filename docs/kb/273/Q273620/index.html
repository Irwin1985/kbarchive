SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to optimize game performance in Microsoft Flight
Simulator 98 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To optimize performance in Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 2000, find a
balance between the number of sound and display features you enable and the
frame rate you can maintain. The frame rate is the speed at which images or
frames are drawn on the screen, and is often measured in frames per second
(fps). The appearance of realistic motion improves as the frame rate increases.

Performance in Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 2000 depends on both the
features that you select and the configuration of your computer. A set of
features that you select on one computer may not result in the same level of
performance as an identical set of features on a different computer.

A computer that has a fast Pentium processor, sufficient memory, a 3D video
accelerator card, and more recent device drivers can maintain a higher level of
performance than a computer that barely meets the minimum system requirements.

To optimize performance in Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 2000, you
must optimize your hardware configuration, configure Flight Simulator for the
best performance, and then monitor the frame rate when you select your preferred
features and settings.

To do this, use the following methods.

Quit Unnecessary Programs
-------------------------

To increase the amount of available system resources, quit all unnecessary
programs that are running on your computer before you start Flight Simulator 98
or Flight Simulator 2000.

To quit all unnecessary programs, use the appropriate method for your version of
Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

2. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or Systray
  (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End Task.

  If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not responding,
  click End Task again.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on
  your computer.

Microsoft Windows 2000:

1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC.

2. On the Applications tab, click any program, and then click End Task.

  Repeat this step to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your
  computer.

3. Quit Windows Task Manager.

NOTE: Some programs start automatically every time you restart your computer. For
information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
documentation for the program.

Optimize Your Hardware Configuration
------------------------------------

To optimize your hardware configuration:

1. Contact your video hardware manufacturer to inquire about how to obtain and
  install the latest version of the video driver for your video adapter.

2. Contact your audio hardware manufacturer to inquire about how to obtain and
  install the latest version of the sound driver for your sound card.

Set the display color palette to the lowest setting that is supported by the
game:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. In the Colors or Color Palette box, click 256 Colors for Flight Simulator 98
  or High Color (16-bit) for Flight Simulator 2000.

5. Click OK.

6. If you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

Configure the Program for the Best Performance
----------------------------------------------

To configure Flight Simulator 98 or Flight Simulator 2000 for the best
performance:

1. Disable stereo sound and reduce the audio sample rate in the program. To do
  this:

  a. Quit Flight Simulator.

  b. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories,and then click
     Notepad.

  c. On the File menu, click Open.

  d. Type the appropriate line (including the quotation marks) for the version
     of Flight Simulator that you want to optimize, and then click OK

     Flight Simulator 98:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator\Fltsim98.cfg"

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the hard disk on which Flight
     Simulator is installed.

  e. Type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line, and
     then press ENTER again after you type the last line:

  [SOUND]
  Channels=1
  SamplesPerSec=11025

  f. On the File menu, click Save.

  g. On the File menu, click Exit.

     NOTE: To restore stereo sound, type a SEMICOLON (;) at the beginning of the
     Channels=1 line. To restore the default audio sample rate, type a
     SEMICOLON (;) at the beginning of the SamplesPerSec=11025 line.

2. Disable weather options in Flight Simulator 98 or Flight Simulator 2000. To
  do this:
