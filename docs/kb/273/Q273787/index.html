- Microsoft Midtown Madness 2, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Midtown Madness 2, you may receive the following error
message:

  YIKES!
  Midtown Madness 2 was not properly shut down the last time you ran it. This
  may have been caused by several factors, including abruptly turning off your
  computer, or because the game itself stopped responding.

  Try these suggestions to ensure that Midtown Madness 2 runs smoothly:

- Update your sound and 3D video card drivers to the latest ones available from
  the card or chipset manufacturer's web site. Once you've updated your
  drivers, run the Redetect Video utility (located in the folder where you
  installed Midtown Madness 2), and then start Midtown Madness 2.

  This list includes addresses for the most common video card manufacturer's Web
  sites.

  ASUS http://www.asus.com/
  ATI http://www.atitech.com/
  Creative Labs http://www.soundblaster.com/
  Diamond Multimedia (includes S3) http://www.diamondmm.com/
  Guillemot (includes Hercules) http://www.guillemot.com/
  Intense3D http://www.intense3D.com/
  Matrox http://www.matrox.com/
  NEC PowerVR http://www.videologic.com/
  Number Nine http://www.nine.com/
  Nvidia http://www.Nvidia.com/
  Rendition http://www.rendition.com/
  3DFX (includes STB) http://www.3dfx.com/
  3DLabs http://www.3dlabs.com/
  Trident Microsystems http://www.tridentmicro.com/
  VideoLogic http://www.videologic.com/

  If your video card was pre-installed when you purchased your computer, you may
  need to check with the computer manufacturer for new drivers. Below is a list
  of popular computer manufacturer Web sites.

  Acer http://www.acer.com/
  Compaq http://www.compaq.com/
  Dell http://www.dell.com/
  Gateway http://www.gateway.com/
  Hewlett-Packard http://www.hp.com/
  IBM http://www.ibm.com/
  Packard Bell http://www.packardbell.com/
  Sony http://www.sony.com/
  Toshiba http://www.toshiba.com/

- Try running the game in Software Only mode. To do so, start Midtown Madness
  2, and then click the Options button in the upper-right corner of any game
  screen. Click Graphics, and then, in the Renderer list, click Software only
  (no 3D video card). When you're finished, click Done to confirm the change.

- If the game was previously running successfully on your computer before you
  made changes to your audio or video drivers or to your Options settings,
  backing out of those changes may fix the problem. For example, if you
  encountered difficulties with the game after switching to a very high display
  resolution, switching it back to a lower resolution may solve the problem.
  (To change your resolution setting, start Midtown Madness 2, and then click
  the Options button in the upper-right corner of any game screen. Click
  Graphics, and then, in the Resolution list, click the resolution you want.
  When you're finished, click Done to confirm the change.)

- If you continue to have problems starting Midtown Madness 2, run the Midtown
  2 Safe Mode utility (located in the folder where you installed Midtown
  Madness 2). This will allow you to start the game and make necessary changes
  to Options settings.

  For more information on troubleshooting and optimizing the performance of
  Midtown Madness 2, see the following additional resources:

- Readme.rtf (located in the folder where you installed Midtown Madness 2).
  This document includes detailed information on troubleshooting problems you
  may encounter when running the game.

- The Midtown Madness 2 Help file. Click the "?" button in the upper-right
  corner of any game screen), or open the Mm2help.hlp file (located in the
  folder where you installed Midtown Madness 2).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for either of the following reasons:

- You shut down Midtown Madness 2 incorrectly.

- You start Midtown Madness 2 after the game stops responding (hangs).
