-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the initial installation for a client that is a member of a domain name that
is composed of less than four characters is unsuccessful, the resulting retry
may not be processed. Under these conditions, Client Configuration Manager (CCM)
does not append the .ccr file extension to the Client Configuration Request
(CCR) when it is moved to the SMS\Inboxes\Ccrretry.box folder (the file name
remains as &lt;netbiosname&gt;.&lt;domainname&gt;). This problem occurs only
under the following site configurations:

- Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 with Service Pack 2 applied.

- SMS 2.0 with Service Pack 1 (build 1380) and the hotfix described in Q252717
  applied.

- SMS 2.0 (build 1239) and the hotfix described in Q252718 applied.

If the initial client installation attempt is successful, this problem does not
occur. Unless you use the workaround described in this article, unsuccessful
client installations are not retried until a new CCR is generated. A new CCR is
created when a new Discovery Data Record (DDR) for the unsuccessful client
installation is received and processed by Discovery Data Manager. A DDR is
created during the next installation attempt by Smsman, Logon Installation, or
Remote Client Installation.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because CCM checks to see if an extension already exists on
a file before appending .ccr to the file name. The component assumes that a file
name with three characters or less already has a file extension and does not
need .ccr appended to the end of the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use the following steps on the site server:

1. Manually stop the CCM service by using Service Manager under the Tools node
  of the SMS Administrator console.

NOTE: You can also stop the SMS Executive service as an alternative because CCM
is a subthread of the SMS Executive service.

2. Create a batch file to add the .ccr extension to the end of the
  &lt;computername&gt;.&lt;domainname&gt; file.

3. Restart the service that you stopped in step 1 (either the CCM or SMS
  Executive service).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
