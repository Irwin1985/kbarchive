SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to disable public folder conflict message
notification.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When two users have edited and modified the same message in a public folder, the
resulting saved messages are defined as being in conflict. This can happen when
a simultaneous save occurs on the same public folder server, or if the message
is edited on two servers that contain replicas of the folder. In this case, the
conflict occurs when replication between the servers takes place.

When a conflict occurs, the owners of the public folder receive an e-mail message
from the Exchange server notifying them of the conflict. The owners can then
open the conflicting message in the public folder where they can choose to keep
the item or keep all items. Keeping all items results in the generation of two
messages in the public folder.

The method Exchange uses to resolve these conflicts is defined by the folder
property, PR_RESOLVE_METHOD. This property is displayed as an unassigned folder
property under the process identifier, 0x3FE7. There are three possible values
for this property:

  0	RESOLVE_METHOD_DEFAULT
	Default handling of message conflicts
  1	RESOLVE_METHOD_LAST_WRITER_WINS
	Last writer will win the conflict.
  2	RESOLVE_METHOD_NO_CONFLICT_NOTIFICATION
	Same steps as the RESOLVE_METHOD_DEFAULT, except that the
	contacts defined on a folder and the modifiers of a message
	are not notified.

By default, the value is set to 0. If you do not want a notification message to
be sent out during a conflict, then you must change the value to 2.

You can only change this value programmatically. For more information, you can
consult the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN), or you can use a utility such as
Mdbvu32.exe to change individual folder property values.

The MSDN information is available on the Microsoft Web site at
http://www.microsoft.com/msdn; search for PR_RESOLVE_METHOD for more
information.

The utility, Mdbvu32.exe, is included with the Exchange Server CD-ROM under the
Support/Utilities directory. For additional information about how to use
Mdbvu32.exe, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q214816 HOWTO: Use Mdbvu32.exe to Set/Create a Property on a Folder

Using Mdbvu32.exe to Change the Value of PR_RESOLVE_METHOD
----------------------------------------------------------

Note: The MAPI profile used with Mdbvu32.exe must have the necessary rights to
modify public folder attributes. A profile with the service account defined as
the Microsoft Windows NT Associated account is recommended.

1. Open Mdbvu32.exe, and then click OK to log on to the information store.

2. In the MDB menu, click OpenMessageStore.

3. Select Public Folders, and then click Open.

4. In the MDB menu, click Open Root Folder. Click OK until the main window
  appears.

5. Double-click IPM_SUBTREE.

6. Choose the public folder that you wish to not receive notification messages,
  and then double-click this folder.

7. In the Folder Properties window, double-click the property 0x3FE7.

8. In the Current Properties window select 0x3FE7, and then click SetProps.

9. In the Property ID window, type in "3FE7" (without the quotation marks).

10. For PropType, select PT_LONG.

11. Add the value for this property under Prop Data; in this case enter "2"
  (without the quotation marks).

12. Click Add, and then click Call.

13. Click close on the next window, and make sure the value for 0x3FE7 updated
  to reflect the changes you made.

14. Close the window and repeat these steps for other folders.

Important: By modifying the parent folder property value, the value is not
propagated to child folders. Also, when a child folder is created under the
parent folder with a modified value, the child folder does not inherit the
modified value and is created with the default value of 0.
