-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a custom NOIDMIF file to report on a Novell NetWare server, the
attribute data is displayed as "No Data Available" in the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Administrator console.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Maintenance Manager thread of the SMS Executive component is responsible
for the inventory of NetWare file servers. Maintenance Manager creates an IDMIF
file for hardware and software inventory and a separate IDMIF file that contains
any NOIDMIF data from any submitted .nim files.

The IDMIF file that contains .nim file data is submitted to the inventory
processor first, followed shortly by the inventory MIF file. The NOIDMIF (.nim)
file attributes are then displayed as "No Data Available" in the SMS
Administrator console.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date     Time   Version  Size    File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------
  8/11/00  11:32  786      100 KB  Maintain.dll  Intel
  8/11/00  11:37  786      163 KB  Maintain.dll  Alpha

NOTE: This hotfix is available only for SMS 1.2 Service Pack 4 (SP4).

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, follow these steps on the SMS site server:

1. Stop all SMS 1.2 site services on the site server.

2. Replace the Maintain.dll file that is located in the
  SMS\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.Bin folder with the copy that is supplied in
  the hotfix.

3. Restart the SMS site services.

After you apply this hotfix, Maintenance Manager performs a hardware and software
inventory of Novell NetWare servers and appends .nim file data for all .nim
files that are found in the Logon.srv\Isvmif.box folder on the NetWare server to
the inventory MIF file. A single MIF file is produced.

For information about collecting NOIDMIF files, see page 114 in the SMS 1.2
Resource Guide.
