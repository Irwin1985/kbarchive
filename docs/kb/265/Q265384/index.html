The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The host security DLL (Snasii.dll) is initialized when the SNA Server service is
started on computers running both SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 and Host
Integration Server 2000. Snasii.dll tries to locate a Host Account Cache (HAC)
database to use for Single Sign-On (SSO) account lookups. This occurs even if
SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 have not been configured to use the
Host Security Integration feature.

If Host Security Integration is not being used, the Snasii.dll file cannot locate
an HAC database. The failure to locate an HAC database does not cause any
visible symptoms on the computer running SNA Server or Host Integration Server.
The Snasii.dll file does not log any events in the Windows NT or Windows 2000
event logs when it cannot locate an HAC database during its initialization.

If SNA Server and/or network traces are enabled, they capture data that
corresponds to the HAC location process. This unexpected data may cause some
confusion while troubleshooting other issues.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 and
Host Integration Server 2000 does not validate if the Host Security Integration
feature is installed. Therefore, the Snasii.dll file is always initialized by
the SNA Server service when it is started.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 (all
SP), 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, and Host Integration Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following article details the process used by the Snasii.dll file to locate
an HAC database:

  Q248479 Host Account Database Location for Single Sign-On

As this article explains, the Snasii.dll file searches for a Secondary HAC
Database (SDB) on its local system, and then for each of the Backup Domain
Controllers (BDCs) in the domain if the MDB is not available. If the Snasii.dll
file fails to locate an SDB on any of the BDCs in the domain, it stops trying to
locate an HAC database until it receives a Single Sign-On account lookup request
from the SNA Server service. If it receives an SSO account lookup request, it
moves through the process to locate a HAC database, which is described in the
referenced article.

If Host Security Integration is not configured, the Snasii.dll file never
receives an SSO account lookup request, which is why it does not try to locate
an HAC database after is goes through the location process. Therefore, this only
occurs each time the SNA Server service is started.

If SNA Server internal message traces (Nodemsg?.atf) are enabled through the SNA
Server trace program (Snatrace.exe) while the SNA Server service is starting,
the following messages are logged while the Snasii.dll file is trying to locate
an HAC database when there is not one available:

  ____________________________________________________________

  ____________________________________________________________

The first two messages are the error messages returned when Snasii.dll tries to
contact the Master HAC Database (MDB) on the Primary Domain Controller (PDC).
The last two messages are the error messages returned when Snasii.dll tries to
contact a Secondary HAC Database (SDB) on one of the Backup Domain Controllers
(BDCs) in the domain.

The following is an excerpt of a SNA Server internal trace (Nodeint?.atf) that
captures the enumeration of the BDCs in the domain and the connection attempt to
one of the BDCs:

  StopRpcCancelTimer begin
  StopRpcCancelTimer end
  Acquired the modify lock
  RpcClient: disconnect begin
  RpcClient: disconnect end

A network trace captured with Microsoft's Network Monitor (or any other network
trace utility) while the HAC database location is occurring shows RPC data
flowing between the computer running SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000
and the domain controllers.
