IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

SUMMARY
=======

When a Host Integration Server 2000 client is configured to use Active Directory
to locate server resources, and a server is started after the client SnaBase
process, any client application (such as 3270, Logical Unit Application [LUA],
advanced program-to-program communications [APPC], or Common Programming
Interface for Communications [CPIC]) may not be able to get a session through
the newly started server for several minutes.

During this time, an APPC application may receive an [MC_]ALLOCATE failure when
the application attempts to open a session through the newly started server. For
example:

  primary_rc = 0xF004 (AP_COMM_SUBSYSTEM_NOT_LOADED)
  secondary_rc = 0xF0000001

Or, if the newly started server is the only one that supports the remote APPC LU
being requested, the following error message may be returned:

  primary_rc = 0x0001 (AP_PARAMETER_CHECK)
  secondary_rc = 0x0000015B (AP_BAD_PARTNER_LU_ALIAS)

Likewise, a CPIC application will receive this error when it issues an Allocate
(CMALLC) request:

  rc = 20 (CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR)

Even though the server has been started, the Host Integration Server 2000 client
only queries the Active Directory for new server state information after 7
minutes has elapsed. If a client application attempts to open a new session, and
the locally cached server information is more than 7 minutes old, the client
will then retrieve new state information from Active Directory before attempting
to contact the server.

See the "More Information" section of this article for instructions on
configuring a client registry parameter to specify a shorter refresh interval.
However, note that Active Directory has a replication delay between servers
within a site and across sites that is outside the control of Host Integration
Server 2000. For additional information, click the article number below to view

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Host Integration Server 2000 client is configured to use Active Directory
and the client SnaBase process starts, it scans the Active Directory
organizational unit for all running servers and caches the server state
information within an internal "service table" within client memory. When an SNA
application attempts to open a session, the client checks if the service table
information is 7 minutes old. If not, the client attempts to activate a session
through a running server, using the state information within its local service
table. If the service table information is more than 7 minutes old, the client
requeries the Active Directory for the latest server state information before it
attempts to contact a server.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can configure the Host Integration Server 2000 client with a different
refresh interval by setting the ServiceTableRefreshTime registry key as
follows:

If a server installation or an admin client installation is being used (where the
admin client SnaBase is configured to run as a service):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Snabase\Parameters\ServiceTableRefreshTime:
  REG_DWORD: (time in minutes)

If the end-user client or the admin client is being used (where the admin client
SnaBase is not running as a service):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Snabase\Parameters\ServiceTableRefreshTime:
  REG_DWORD: (time in minutes)

If not configured, ServiceTableRefreshTime defaults to 7 minutes. All values
except 0 are accepted.

NOTE: When the server-side SnaBase, MngAgent, and SNA Server services start, and
Active Directory is being used, these services register themselves as "running"
by adding an object within the Active Directory organizational unit. You can see
these objects by using the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC Snap-In.
From the View menu, choose Advanced Features, and examine the following
objects:

[Domain Name]  (for example,subdomain.NTTEST.MICROSOFT.COM)
- [Organizational Unit Name]  (for example, SNAOU)
 - snaResources
   - snaServerServices
     - snaBases
         Name              Type
         SERVER1/SNABASE   msHostIntegrationServerService
         SERVER2/SNABASE   msHostIntegrationServerService

     - snaMngagents
         Name              Type
         SERVER1/MNGAGENT  msHostIntegrationServerService
         SERVER2/MNGAGENT  msHostIntegrationServerService

     - snaNodes
         Name              Type
         SERVER1/SNASERVR  msHostIntegrationServerService
         SERVER2/SNASERVR  msHostIntegrationServerService

 - snaWMIServers
         Name
         SERVER1
         SERVER2
