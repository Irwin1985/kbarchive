-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) clients that are installed by using Microsoft
Windows NT Remote Client Installation, may not report the client version. This
can cause inconsistent or incorrect query results when a search for clients that
have been upgraded with newer service packs is performed.

NOTE: The client version is properly reported for clients that are running logon
scripts.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the Ccmdata.tcf file, located in the
%windir%\MS\SMS\core\data folder, is written without the Client Version entry in
the SMS Client Base Components section. Note that the client version information
is stored in the Ccmdata.tcf file. When the version information is missing from
the Ccmdata.tcf file, the Discovery Data Record (DDR) that is sent by the client
does not contain any client version information in the Smsdisc.ddr file.

Heartbeat discovery does not add or update this field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use Networking Logon Installation to install the
clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Systems
Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
