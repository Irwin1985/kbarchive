  Q303814 HOWTO: Use ADOX with Excel Data from Visual Basic or VBA

MORE INFORMATION
================

INTRODUCTION
------------

The rows and columns of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet closely resemble the rows
and columns of a database table. As long as users keep in mind that Microsoft
Excel is not a relational database management system, and recognize the
limitations that this fact imposes, it often makes sense to take advantage of
Excel and its tools to store and analyze data.

Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects makes it possible to treat an Excel workbook as if
it were a database. This article discusses how to accomplish this in the
following sections:

- Connect to Excel with ADO
- Retrieve and Edit Excel Data with ADO
- Retrieve Data Source Structure (Metadata) from Excel

NOTE: The testing for this article was conducted with Microsoft Data Access
Components (MDAC) 2.5 on Microsoft Windows 2000 with Visual Basic 6.0 Service
Pack 3 and Excel 2000. This article may not acknowledge or discuss differences
in behavior that users may observe with different versions of MDAC, Microsoft
Windows, Visual Basic, or Excel.

Connect to Excel with ADO
-------------------------

ADO can connect to an Excel data file with either one of two OLE DB Providers
included in MDAC:

- Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider

-or-

- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

How to Use the Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider:

The Jet Provider requires only two pieces of information in order to connect to
an Excel data source: the path, including the file name, and the Excel file
version.

Jet Provider Using a Connection String

  Dim cn as ADODB.Connection
  Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
  With cn
  	.Provider = "Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0"
  	.ConnectionString = "Data Source=C:\MyFolder\MyWorkbook.xls;" &amp; _
  "Extended Properties=Excel 8.0;"
  	.Open
  End With

Provider Version: It is necessary to use the Jet 4.0 Provider; the Jet 3.51
Provider does not support the Jet ISAM drivers. If you specify the Jet 3.51
Provider, at run time you receive the following error message:

  Couldn't find installable ISAM.

Excel Version: Specify Excel 5.0 for an Excel 95 workbook (version 7.0 of Excel),
and Excel 8.0 for an Excel 97, Excel 2000, or Excel 2002 (XP) workbook (versions
8.0, 9.0, and 10.0 of Excel).

Jet Provider Using the Data Link Properties Dialog Box

If you use the ADO Data Control or the Data Environment in your application, then
the Data Link Properties dialog box is displayed to gather the necessary
connection settings.

1. On the Provider tab, select the Jet 4.0 Provider; the Jet 3.51 Provider does
  not support the Jet ISAM drivers. If you specify the Jet 3.51 Provider, at
  run time you receive the following error message:

  Couldn't find installable ISAM.

2. On the Connection tab, browse to your workbook file. Ignore the "User ID" and
  "Password" entries, because these do not apply to an Excel connection. (You
  cannot open a password-protected Excel file as a data source. There is more
  information on this topic later in this article.)

3. On the All tab, select Extended Properties in the list, and then click Edit
  Value. Enter Excel 8.0; separating it from any other existing entries with a
  semicolon (;). If you omit this step, you receive an error message when you
  test your connection, because the Jet Provider expects a Microsoft Access
  database unless you specify otherwise.

4. Return to the Connection tab and click Test Connection. Note that a message
  box appears informing you that the process has succeeded.

Other Jet Provider Connection Settings

Column headings: By default, it is assumed that the first row of your Excel data
source contains columns headings that can be used as field names. If this is not
the case, you must turn this setting off, or your first row of data "disappears"
to be used as field names. This is done by adding the optional HDR= setting to
the Extended Properties of the connection string. The default, which does not
need to be specified, is HDR=Yes. If you do not have column headings, you need
to specify HDR=No; the provider names your fields F1, F2, etc. Because the
Extended Properties string now contains multiple values, it must be enclosed in
double quotes itself, plus an additional pair of double quotes to tell Visual
Basic to treat the first set of quotes as literal values, as in the following
example (where extra spaces have been added for visual clarity).

  .ConnectionString = "Data Source=C:\MyFolder\MyWorkbook.xls;" &amp; _
  "Extended Properties=" " Excel 8.0; HDR=No;" " "

Using Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers:

The provider for ODBC drivers (which this article refers to as the "ODBC
Provider" for the sake of brevity) also requires only two (2) pieces of
information in order to connect to an Excel data source: the driver name, and
the workbook path and filename.

IMPORTANT: An ODBC connection to Excel is read-only by default. Your ADO
Recordset LockType property setting does not override this connection-level
setting. You must set ReadOnly to False in your connection string or your DSN
configuration if you want to edit your data. Otherwise, you receive the
following error message:

  Operation must use an updateable query.

ODBC Provider Using a DSN-Less Connection String

  Dim cn as ADODB.Connection
  Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
  With cn
  	.Provider = "MSDASQL"
  	.ConnectionString = "Driver={Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls)};" &amp; _
  "DBQ=C:\MyFolder\MyWorkbook.xls; ReadOnly=False;"
  	.Open
  End With

ODBC Provider Using a Connection String with a DSN

  Dim cn as ADODB.Connection
  Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
  With cn
  	.Provider = "MSDASQL"
  	.ConnectionString = "DSN=MyExcelDSN;"
  	.Open
  End With

ODBC Provider Using the Data Link Properties Dialog Box

If you use the ADO Data Control or the Data Environment in your application, then
the Data Link Properties dialog box is displayed to gather the necessary
connection settings.

1. On the Provider tab, select Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers.

2. On the Connection tab, select the existing DSN that you want to use, or
  choose Use connection string. This brings up the standard DSN configuration
  dialog box to gather the necessary connection settings. Remember to deselect
  the default read-only setting if desired, as mentioned previously.

3. Return to the Connection tab, and click Test Connection. Note that a message
  box appears informing you that the process has succeeded.

Other ODBC Provider Connection Settings

Column headings: By default, it is assumed that the first row of your Excel data
source contains columns headings, which can be used as field names. If this is
not the case, you must turn this setting off, or your first row of data
"disappears" to be used as field names. This is done by adding the optional
FirstRowHasNames= setting to the connection string. The default, which does not
need to be specified, is FirstRowHasNames=1, where 1 = True. If you do not have
column headings, you need to specify FirstRowHasNames=0, where 0 = False; the
driver names your fields F1, F2, and so forth. This option is not available in
the DSN configuration dialog box.

However, due to a bug in the ODBC driver, specifying the FirstRowHasNames setting
currently has no effect. In other words, the Excel ODBC driver (MDAC 2.1 and
later) always treats the first row in the specified data source as field names.
For additional informationon the Column Heading bug, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288343 BUG: Excel ODBC Driver Disregards the FirstRowHasNames or Header
  Setting

Rows to Scan: Excel does not provide ADO with detailed schema information about
the data it contains, as a relational database would. Therefore, the driver must
scan through at least a few rows of the existing data in order to make an
educated guess at the data type of each column. The default for "Rows to Scan"
is eight (8) rows. You can specify an integer value from one (1) to sixteen (16)
rows, or you can specify zero (0) to scan all existing rows. This is done by
adding the optional MaxScanRows= setting to the connection string, or by
changing the Rows to Scan setting in the DSN configuration dialog box.

However, due to a bug in the ODBC driver, specifying the Rows to Scan
(MaxScanRows) setting currently has no effect. In other words, the Excel ODBC
driver (MDAC 2.1 and later) always scans the first 8 rows in the specified data
source in order to determine each column's datatype.

For additional information about the Rows to Scan bug, including a simple
workaround, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q189897 XL97: Data Truncated to 255 Characters with Excel ODBC Driver

Other Settings: If you construct your connection string by using the Data Link
Properties dialog box, you may notice some other Extended Properties settings
added to the connection string that are not absolutely necessary, such as:

  ... DefaultDir=C:\WorkbookPath;DriverId=790;FIL=excel 8.0;MaxBufferSize=2048;PageTimeout=5;

"Collating Sequence" Error Message in the Visual Basic Editor

In the Visual Basic design environment with certain versions of MDAC, you may see
the following error message the first time your program connects to an Excel
data source at design time:

  Selected collating sequence not supported by the operating system.

This message appears only in the IDE and will not appear in the compiled version
of the program. For additional information, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q246167 PRB: Collating Sequence Error Opening ADODB Recordset the First Time
  Against an Excel XLS

Considerations That Apply to Both OLE DB Providers:

A Caution about Mixed Data Types

As stated previously, ADO must guess at the data type for each column in your
Excel worksheet or range. (This is not affected by Excel cell formatting
settings.) A serious problem can arise if you have numeric values mixed with
text values in the same column. Both the Jet and the ODBC Provider return the
data of the majority type, but return NULL (empty) values for the minority data
type. If the two types are equally mixed in the column, the provider chooses
numeric over text.

For example:

- In your eight (8) scanned rows, if the column contains five (5) numeric
  values and three (3) text values, the provider returns five (5) numbers and
  three (3) null values.

- In your eight (8) scanned rows, if the column contains three (3) numeric
  values and five (5) text values, the provider returns three (3) null values
  and five (5) text values.

- In your eight (8) scanned rows, if the column contains four (4) numeric
  values and four (4) text values, the provider returns four (4) numbers and
  four (4) null values.

As a result, if your column contains mixed values, your only recourse is to store
numeric values in that column as text, and to convert them back to numbers when
needed in the client application by using the Visual Basic VAL function or an
equivalent.

To work around this problem for read-only data, enable Import Mode by using the
setting "IMEX=1" in the Extended Properties section of the connection string.
This enforces the ImportMixedTypes=Text registry setting. However, note that
updates may give unexpected results in this mode. For additional information
about this setting, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

You Cannot Open a Password-Protected Workbook

If the Excel workbook is protected by a password, you cannot open it for data
access, even by supplying the correct password with your connection settings,
unless the workbook file is already open in the Microsoft Excel application. If
you try, you receive the following error message:

  Could not decrypt file.

Retrieve and Edit Excel Data with ADO
-------------------------------------

This section discusses two aspects of working with your Excel data:

- How to select data

-and-

- How to change data

How to Select Data:

There are several ways to select data. You can:

- Select Excel data with code.
- Select Excel data with the ADO Data control.
- Select Excel data with Data Environment commands.

Select Excel Data with Code:

Your Excel data may be contained in your workbook in one of the following:

- An entire worksheet.
- A named range of cells on a worksheet.
- An unnamed range of cells on a worksheet.

Specify a Worksheet

To specify a worksheet as your recordsource, use the worksheet name followed by a
dollar sign and surrounded by square brackets. For example:

  	strQuery = "SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$]"

You can also delimit the worksheet name with the slanted single quote character
(`) found on the keyboard under the tilde (~). For example:

  	strQuery = "SELECT * FROM `Sheet1$`"

Microsoft prefers the square brackets, which are the standing convention for
problematic database object names.

If you omit both the dollar sign and the brackets, or just the dollar sign, you
receive the following error message:

  ... the Jet database engine could not find the specified object

If you use the dollar sign but omit the brackets, you will see the following
error message:

  Syntax error in FROM clause.

If you try to use ordinary single quotes, you receive the following error
message:

  Syntax error in query. Incomplete query clause.

Specify a Named Range

To specify a named range of cells as your recordsource, simply use the defined
name. For example:

  	strQuery = "SELECT * FROM MyRange"

Specify an Unnamed Range

To specify an unnamed range of cells as your recordsource, append standard Excel
row/column notation to the end of the sheet name in the square brackets. For
example:

  	strQuery = "SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$A1:B10]"

A caution about specifying worksheets: The provider assumes that your table of
data begins with the upper-most, left-most, non-blank cell on the specified
worksheet. In other words, your table of data can begin in Row 3, Column C
without a problem. However, you cannot, for example, type a worksheeet title
above and to the left of the data in cell A1.

A caution about specifying ranges: When you specify a worksheet as your
recordsource, the provider adds new records below existing records in the
worksheet as space allows. When you specify a range (named or unnamed), Jet also
adds new records below the existing records in the range as space allows.
However, if you requery on the original range, the resulting recordset does not
include the newly added records outside the range.

With MDAC versions prior to 2.5, when you specify a named range, you cannot add
new records beyond the defined limits of the range, or you receive the following
error message:

  Cannot expand named range.

Select Excel Data with the ADO Data Control:

After you specify the connection settings for your Excel data source on the
General tab of the ADODC Properties dialog box, click on the Recordsource tab.
If you choose a CommandType of adCmdText, you can enter a SELECT query in the
Command Text dialog box with the syntax described previously. If you choose a
CommandType of adCmdTable, and you are using the Jet Provider, the drop-down
list displays both the named ranges and worksheet names that are available in
the selected workbook, with named ranges listed first.

This dialog box properly appends the dollar sign to worksheet names, but does not
add the necessary square brackets. As a result, if you simply select a worksheet
name and click OK, you receive the following error message later:

  Syntax error in FROM clause.

You must manually add the square brackets around the worksheet name. (This combo
box does allow editing.) If you are using the ODBC Provider, you see only named
ranges listed in this drop-down list. However, you can manually enter a
worksheet name with the appropriate delimiters.

Select Excel Data with Data Environment Commands:

After setting up the Data Environment Connection for your Excel data source,
create a new Command object. If you choose a Source of Data of SQL Statement,
you can enter a query in the textbox using the syntax described previously. If
you choose a Source of Data of Database Object, select Table in the first
drop-down list, and you are using the Jet Provider, the drop-down list displays
both named ranges and worksheet names available in the selected workbook, with
named ranges listed first. (If you choose a worksheet name in this location, you
do not need to add square brackets around the worksheet name manually as you do
for the ADO Data Control.) If you are using the ODBC Provider, you see only
named ranges listed in this drop-down list. However, you can manually enter a
worksheet name.

How to Change Excel Data: Edit, Add, and Delete:

Edit

You can edit Excel data with the normal ADO methods. Recordset fields which
correspond to cells in the Excel worksheet containing Excel formulas (beginning
with "=") are read-only and cannot be edited. Remember that an ODBC connection
to Excel is read-only by default, unless you specify otherwise in your
connection settings. See earlier under "Using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for
ODBC Drivers."

Add

You can add records to your Excel recordsource as space allows. However, if you
add new records outside the range that you originally specified, these records
are not visible if you requery on the original range specification. See earlier
under "A caution about specifying ranges."

In certain circumstances, when you use the AddNew and Update methods of the ADO
Recordset object to insert new rows of data into an Excel table, ADO may insert
the data values into the wrong columns in Excel. For additional information,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q314763 FIX: ADO Inserts Data into Wrong Columns in Excel

Delete

You are more restricted in deleting Excel data than data from a relational data
source. In a relational database, "row" has no meaning or existence apart from
"record"; in an Excel worksheet, this is not true. You can delete values in
fields (cells). However, you cannot:

1. Delete an entire record at once or you receive the following error message:

  Deleting data in a linked table is not supported by this ISAM.

  You can only delete a record by blanking out the contents of each individual
  field.

2. Delete the value in a cell containing an Excel formula or you receive the
  following error message:

  Operation is not allowed in this context.

3. You cannot delete the empty spreadsheet row(s) in which the deleted data was
  located, and your recordset will continue to display empty records
  corresponding to these empty rows.

A caution about editing Excel data with ADO: When you insert text data into Excel
with ADO, the text value is preceded with a single quote. This may cause
problems later in working with the new data.

Retrieve Data Source Structure (Metadata) from Excel
----------------------------------------------------

You can retrieve data about the structure of your Excel data source (tables and
fields) with ADO. Results differ slightly between the two OLE DB Providers,
although both return at least the same small number of useful fields of
information. This metadata can be retrieved with the OpenSchema method of the
ADO Connection object, which returns an ADO Recordset object. You can also use
the more powerful Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects Extensions for Data Definition
Language and Security (ADOX) library for this purpose. In the case of an Excel
data source however, where a "table" is either a worksheet or a named range, and
a "field" is one of a limited number of generic datatypes, this additional power
is not useful.

Query Table Information:

Of the various objects available in a relational database (tables, views, stored
procedures, and so forth), an Excel data source exposes only table equivalents,
consisting of the worksheets and the named ranges defined in the specified
workbook. Named ranges are treated as "Tables" and worksheets are treated as
"System Tables," and there is not much useful table information you can retrieve
beyond this "table_type" property. You request a list of the available tables in
the workbook with the following code:

  Set rs = cn.OpenSchema(adSchemaTables)

The Jet Provider returns a recordset with nine (9) fields, of which it populates
only four (4):

- table_name
- table_type ("Table" or "System Table")
- date_created
- date_modified

The two date fields for a given table always show the same value, which appears
to be the "date last modified." In other words, "date_created" is not reliable.

The ODBC Provider also returns a recordset with nine (9) fields, of which it
populates only three (3):

- table_catalog, the folder in which the workbook is located.
- table_name.
- table_type, as noted earlier.

According to the ADO documentation, it is possible to retrieve a list of
worksheets only, for example, by specifying the following additional criteria to
the OpenSchema method:

  Set rs = cn.OpenSchema(adSchemaTables, Array(Empty, Empty, Empty, "System Table"))

Unfortunately, this does not work against an Excel data source with MDAC versions
later than 2.0, using either provider.

Query Field Information:

Every field (column) in an Excel data source is one of the following datatypes:

- numeric (ADO datatype 5, adDouble)
- currency (ADO datatype 6, adCurrency)
- logical or boolean (ADO datatype 11, adBoolean)
- date (ADO datatype 7, adDate, using Jet; 135, adDBTimestamp, using ODBC)
- text (an ADO ad...Char type, such as 202, adVarChar, 200, adVarWChar or
  similar)

The numeric_precision for a numeric column is always returned as 15 (which is the
maximum precision in Excel); the character_maximum_length of a text column is
always returned as 255 (which is the maximum display width, but not the maximum
length, of text in an Excel column). There is not much useful field information
that you can obtain beyond the data_type property. You request a list of the
available fields in a table with the following code:

  Set rs = cn.OpenSchema(adSchemaTables, Array(Empty, Empty, "TableName", Empty))

The Jet Provider returns a recordset that contains 28 fields, of which it
populates eight (8) for numeric fields and nine (9) for text fields. The useful
fields are likely to be these:

- table_name
- column_name
- ordinal_position
- data_type

The ODBC Provider returns a recordset containing 29 fields, of which it populates
ten (10) for numeric fields and 11 for text fields. The useful fields are the
same as earlier.

Enumerate Tables and Fields and Their Properties:

Visual Basic code (such as the following sample) can be used to enumerate the
tables and columns in an Excel data source and the available fields of
information about each. This sample outputs its results to a Listbox, List1, on
the same form.

  Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
  Dim rsT As ADODB.Recordset
  Dim intTblCnt As Integer, intTblFlds As Integer
  Dim strTbl As String
  Dim rsC As ADODB.Recordset
  Dim intColCnt As Integer, intColFlds As Integer
  Dim strCol As String
  Dim t As Integer, c As Integer, f As Integer
  Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
  With cn
  	.Provider = "Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0"
  	.ConnectionString = "Data Source=" &amp; App.Path &amp; _
  "\ExcelSrc.xls;Extended Properties=Excel 8.0;"
  	'.Provider = "MSDASQL"
  	'.ConnectionString = "Driver={Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls)};" &amp; _
  "DBQ=" &amp; App.Path &amp; "\ExcelSrc.xls; "
  	.CursorLocation = adUseClient
  	.Open
  End With
  Set rsT = cn.OpenSchema(adSchemaTables)
  intTblCnt = rsT.RecordCount
  intTblFlds = rsT.Fields.Count
  List1.AddItem "Tables:	" &amp; intTblCnt
  List1.AddItem "--------------------"
  For t = 1 To intTblCnt
  	strTbl = rsT.Fields("TABLE_NAME").Value
  	List1.AddItem vbTab &amp; "Table #" &amp; t &amp; ":	" &amp; strTbl
  	List1.AddItem vbTab &amp; "--------------------"
  	For f = 0 To intTblFlds - 1
  		List1.AddItem vbTab &amp; rsT.Fields(f).Name &amp; _
  vbTab &amp; rsT.Fields(f).Value
  	Next
  	List1.AddItem "--------------------"
  	Set rsC = cn.OpenSchema(adSchemaColumns, Array(Empty, Empty, strTbl, Empty))
  	intColCnt = rsC.RecordCount
  	intColFlds = rsC.Fields.Count
  	For c = 1 To intColCnt
  		strCol = rsC.Fields("COLUMN_NAME").Value
  		List1.AddItem vbTab &amp; vbTab &amp; "Column #" &amp; c &amp; ": " &amp; strCol
  		List1.AddItem vbTab &amp; vbTab &amp; "--------------------"
  		For f = 0 To intColFlds - 1
  			List1.AddItem vbTab &amp; vbTab &amp; rsC.Fields(f).Name &amp; _
  vbTab &amp; rsC.Fields(f).Value
  		Next
  		List1.AddItem vbTab &amp; vbTab &amp; "--------------------"
  		rsC.MoveNext
  		Next
  		rsC.Close
  		List1.AddItem "--------------------"
  		rsT.MoveNext
  Next
  rsT.Close
  cn.Close

Use the Data View Window:

If you create a data link to an Excel data source in the Visual Basic Data View
window, the Data View window displays the same information that you can retrieve
programmatically as described earlier. In particular, note that the Jet Provider
lists both worksheets and named ranges under "Tables," where the ODBC Provider
shows only named ranges. If you are using the ODBC Provider and have not defined
