-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook HTML Form Converter 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook 97 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to gain access to a public folder that is
configured as an Outlook contacts folder, you may receive the following error
message:

  This Version of Outlook only supports your primary contact folder.

If you click OK, you are returned you to your primary Contacts folder in your
mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because although you can create Outlook modules as folders
in Exchange Server public folders, those Outlook modules are not visible from
OWA. For additional information, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q186707 XWEB: Cannot Open a Contact or Calendar Public Folder in OWA

This behavior is by design in the current version of OWA.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, allow this capability by using 32-bit Outlook forms
and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) forms. Further variations or customizations
beyond those that are discussed in this article may require the assistance of
Microsoft Developer Support. The following steps assume that Exchange Server and
OWA have been installed and are functioning properly.

Terms
-----

- Outlook modules. Outlook Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, and Journal
  folders.

- 32-bit Outlook client. Any version of Outlook for Microsoft Windows 95,
  Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows NT.

- 32-bit Outlook forms. Custom forms created using the 32-bit Outlook client.

- HTML Forms. Sometimes called Web Forms, these are HTML versions of 32-bit
  Outlook forms.

- HTML Form Converter. A utility that is designed to assist in converting some
  32-bit Outlook forms into HTML Forms.

Using 32-bit Outlook Forms and HTML Forms
-----------------------------------------

1. Install the Existing Items Converter for Outlook.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q241220 OL2000: General Information About the Existing Items Converter

2. Create a new public folder as a standard mail items folder. Click the newly
  created folder from Outlook.

3. Use 32-bit Outlook to open a standard contact form and enter design mode by
  clicking Forms on the Tools menu, and then clicking Design this Form.

4. Edit the form as necessary, click Forms on the Tools menu, and then click
  Publish Form As. Use a unique name (for example, IPM.Contact.Custom) when you
  publish the form. Publish the form to the public folder that you created
  earlier.

5. Create at least one contact in the public folder by using the newly installed
  form.

6. Use the Outlook Existing Items converter to change the message class of the
  items in this folder to match the newly created forms message class (for
  example, IPM.Contact.Custom).

7. Open the properties of the public folder, click the General tab, and then
  click the custom form in the "When posting to this folder, use" box. Click
  OK.

8. Use the HTML Form Converter to convert the new form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you perform this procedure, when users access the public folder from
either a 32-bit Outlook client or by using OWA the users see the correct content
displayed by using the custom form. Furthermore, new items may be created in the
folder by using the custom form from either a Messaging Application Programming
Interface (MAPI) client or OWA.
