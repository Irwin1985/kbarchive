SUMMARY
=======

The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol uses a combination of public-key and
symmetric-key encryption. Symmetric-key encryption is much faster than
public-key encryption; however, public-key encryption provides better
authentication techniques. An SSL session always begins with an exchange of
messages called the SSL handshake. The handshake allows the server to
authenticate itself to the client by using public-key techniques, and then
allows the client and the server to cooperate in the creation of symmetric keys
used for rapid encryption, decryption, and tamper detection during the session
that follows. Optionally, the handshake also allows the client to authenticate
itself to the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The steps involved in the SSL handshake are as follows (note that the following
steps assume the use of the cipher suites listed in Cipher Suites with RSA Key
Exchange: Triple DES, RC4, RC2, DES):

1. The client sends the server the client's SSL version number, cipher settings,
  session-specific data, and other information that the server needs to
  communicate with the client using SSL.

2. The server sends the client the server's SSL version number, cipher settings,
  session-specific data, and other information that the client needs to
  communicate with the server over SSL. The server also sends its own
  certificate, and if the client is requesting a server resource that requires
  client authentication, the server requests the client's certificate.

3. The client uses the information sent by the server to authenticate the server
  (see Server Authentication for details). If the server cannot be
  authenticated, the user is warned of the problem and informed that an
  encrypted and authenticated connection cannot be established. If the server
  can be successfully authenticated, the client proceeds to step 4.

4. Using all data generated in the handshake thus far, the client (with the
  cooperation of the server, depending on the cipher being used) creates the
  pre-master secret for the session, encrypts it with the server's public key
  (obtained from the server's certificate, sent in step 2), and then sends the
  encrypted pre-master secret to the server.

5. If the server has requested client authentication (an optional step in the
  handshake), the client also signs another piece of data that is unique to
  this handshake and known by both the client and server. In this case, the
  client sends both the signed data and the client's own certificate to the
  server along with the encrypted pre-master secret.

6. If the server has requested client authentication, the server attempts to
  authenticate the client (see Client Authentication for details). If the
  client cannot be authenticated, the session ends. If the client can be
  successfully authenticated, the server uses its private key to decrypt the
  pre-master secret, and then performs a series of steps (which the client also
  performs, starting from the same pre-master secret) to generate the master
  secret.

7. Both the client and the server use the master secret to generate the session
  keys, which are symmetric keys used to encrypt and decrypt information
  exchanged during the SSL session and to verify its integrity (that is, to
  detect any changes in the data between the time it was sent and the time it
  is received over the SSL connection).

8. The client sends a message to the server informing it that future messages
  from the client will be encrypted with the session key. It then sends a
  separate (encrypted) message indicating that the client portion of the
  handshake is finished.

9. The server sends a message to the client informing it that future messages
  from the server will be encrypted with the session key. It then sends a
  separate (encrypted) message indicating that the server portion of the
  handshake is finished.

10. The SSL handshake is now complete and the session begins. The client and the
  server use the session keys to encrypt and decrypt the data they send to
  each other and to validate its integrity.

11. This is the normal operation condition of the secure channel. At any time,
  due to internal or external stimulus (either automation or user
  intervention), either side may renegotiate the connection, in which case,
  the process repeats itself.
