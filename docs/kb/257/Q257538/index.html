SUMMARY
=======

In e-mail client software, Internet mail and unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE)
in an Exchange Server recipient's mailbox may be displayed without the
recipient's display name or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address in the
To line. Instead, the To line is either blank, or it contains other recipients'
names or the address of an external distribution list. The From line may also
contain incorrect information, or it may be missing information.

This article explains how to view the Request for Comments (RFC) 821 portion of
the Internet mail message to obtain information that is not displayed in e-mail
client software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each Internet mail message contains two portions: the RFC 821 portion (sometimes
called the P1 header) and the RFC 822 portion (sometimes called the P2 body).
When e-mail client software receives Internet messages, you can only view the
RFC 822 portion in the e-mail client software. Although the RFC 822 portion
contains a To and From field that the client uses, these fields technically do
not need to be correct because they are not used to route SMTP messages.

Therefore, in junk e-mail (or "spam" e-mail), UCE, and outside e-mail that is
made to falsely appear to come from an authorized user (or "spoofed" e-mail),
addresses in the To and From fields are often replaced with incorrect
information or are missing. The data that is used to direct the message to the
recipient is actually contained in the RFC 821 portion of the SMTP message,
which is further explained below.

A common problem can occur if a recipient has multiple SMTP addresses and the
recipient wants to unsubscribe from a junk e-mail mailing list. You may find it
difficult to determine which SMTP address to use to unsubscribe the recipient
from the sender, because the subscribed address is not displayed in the message.
You can only determine the SMTP address if you perform a network trace or enable
SMTP protocol logging to examine the RFC 821 portions of SMTP traffic.

To determine the e-mail address that was used to route a message to a recipient,
or to gather more information about a spoofed message, search the SMTP protocol
logs:

1. Make sure that SMTP protocol logging is enabled. If the message was delivered
  when logging was disabled, you must enable logging and wait until the next
  occurrence of the unwanted message. To enable SMTP protocol logging:

  a. Open the Internet Mail Service properties, and then click the Diagnostics
     Logging tab.

  b. Under Category, click SMTP Protocol Log, and then click Maximum.

  c. Click Apply to apply the changes, and then restart the Internet Mail
     Service.

2. As soon as the message arrives, stop the Internet Mail Service.

3. Move all of the SMTP protocol log files (*.log) from the Exchsrvr\Imcdata\Log
  folder to a new folder of your choice.

4. Restart the Internet Mail Service.

5. Perform text searches on all of the .log files that you moved by matching
  strings from the offending message with text in the files. (You can
  facilitate this by performing an advanced find on the folder to which you
  moved the .log files and using the Containing Text field.)

6. If you used advanced find, at least one log file that contains text from the
  message should be displayed in the output window. Open the log file or files
  and find the message that contains the matched text. From the matched text,
  scroll up until you see the first occurrence of the word "DATA." This point
  marks the end of the RFC 821 portion of the message and the beginning of the
  RFC 822 portion of the message.

The RFC 821 portion of the message contains at least the following fields and
commands:

- MAIL FROM. This field specifies the SMTP address of the originator or SMTP
  forwarding host.

- RCPT TO. This field specifies the SMTP address that was used to deliver the
  message to the recipient.

- DATA. This command indicates the end of the P1 portion of the message.

messages, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q199051 XFOR: Incoming SMTP Messages Missing To, From, and/or Subject

It is safe to delete the log files when you stop the Internet Mail Service. To
prevent disk space from running out, periodically stop the Internet Mail Service
and remove the .log files, or disable SMTP protocol logging altogether.
