-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

You can unpackage prepackaged hotfixes to test, e-mail, or manually install
them. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) Hotfix utility that is used to package
hotfixes contains the following undocumented switches (GUI Hotfix utility
hotfixes are usually packaged as Q&lt;xxxxxx&gt;.exe files, where &lt;xxxxxx&gt;
is the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q number for the corresponding hotfix):

- /x Generates a list of the packaged files. You can select the files that you
  want to extract and the location.

- /s Performs a silent installation. This switch stops services and installs
  the hotfix with no prompts or user interface (UI). You need to allow
  sufficient time for the hotfix to be installed, because this switch returns
  control to the command prompt well before the installation is finished.
  Verify that the hotfix is installed. The GUI Hotfix package
  Q&lt;xxxxxx&gt;.exe should be running in the task manager properties, where
  &lt;xxxxxx&gt; is the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q number and name of
  the hotfix.

- /z The same as the /x switch, but the /z switch automatically restarts the
  computer. Do not use the /z switch unless you want to automatically restart
  the computer.

- /m Prompts you for the folder locations. You can select the folder locations
  of the Windows folder, System folder, System32 folder, Temp folder, Source
  folder (which is usually the Temp folder), System Windows folder, and
  Language folder.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following list contains more information about the GUI Hotfix utility
switches that are listed in the "Summary" section of this article:

- All hotfixes are listed in the following registry key

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\&lt;product&gt;\Q&lt;xxxxxx&gt;

  where &lt;product&gt; is the name of the product that the hotfix is for, and
  &lt;xxxxxx&gt; is the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q number of the
  hotfix.


- For Exchange Server, two log files are generated in the
  Exchsrvr\Q&lt;xxxxxx&gt; folder. The Install.log file indicates if files were
  copied, skipped, and so on. The Q&lt;xxxxxx&gt;.log file contains more
  information, which includes who installed the hotfix, when the hotfix was
  installed, and so on.

- For Exchange Server, you can uninstall some packages. The dialog boxes in the
  installer setup process state whether or not you can uninstall a fix. When
  Exchange Server backup is possible, the files are backed up to the following
  location:

  Exchsrvr\Q&lt;xxxxxx&gt;

- Registry keys that are overwritten are not backed up.

- There is no /? switch or other help documentation included with the fixes.

- Apply hotfixes as a component whole. Microsoft does not recommend the
  installation of individual files from a component build.

- More information about the /x and /z switches: these switches can be useful
  if the files have been deleted or are corrupted on the target computer. If
  you type a folder name after the /x switch, the switch extracts all of the
  files to the selected folder. The /z switch performs the same function that
  the /x switch performs, but the computer quits Microsoft Windows after the
  files are extracted.

- The /s switch runs the installation in silent mode. The background gradient
  is not displayed, and the progress bar is not displayed. Other than a prompt
  to restart the computer, any messages or prompts that the installation uses
  are not displayed.

- Both Alpha and Intel binaries may be displayed in a package if you expand
  them by using the /x switch. This should only be the case for the
  Administrator component, where both Alpha and Intel binaries are included by
  design. I386 and Alpha files go to every Administrator computer regardless of
  the platform because there may be Exchange Server computers running on either
  platform in the site.

- Each component build has a master Microsoft Knowledge Base article that is
  associated with that component build and that lists all of the other
  Microsoft Knowledge Base articles for fixes of that component. This master
  Microsoft Knowledge Base article is updated with each new build of the
  component. The following is a list of the master Microsoft Knowledge Base
