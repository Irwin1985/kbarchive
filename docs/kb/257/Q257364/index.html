-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Remote Control feature is installed
and enabled on a computer, the folder in which the Remote Control agent is
located has its permissions set to Everyone Full Control by default. If a
malicious user were to replace the client code with other code, the code would
run automatically in a System context the next time that user rebooted the
computer and logged on. This vulnerability exists only if the Remote Control
feature is enabled; no other SMS features are affected by it.

CAUSE
=====

The client code for the Remote Control agent runs in the highly privileged
System security context. However, it is installed in a folder that by default
allows any user who can interactively log on to the computer to have complete
access to the folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The French version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date         Time   Version         Size    File name   Platform
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  01/04/2000  03:16a                   67     Compver.ini   
  03/28/2000  04:32p  2.0.1380.1108  1.61 MB  Remctrl.exe   Intel
  03/28/2000  04:44p  2.0.1380.1108  1.23 MB  Remctrl.exe   Alpha

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site server.

2. Copy the Q257364.exe file and platform folders to the new folder. The folder
  structure must be such that the program file is located one folder "above"
  the platform folders.

3. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

4. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  run the program file (Q257364.exe).

5. Finish any necessary installation steps as instructed by the installation
  program.

NOTE: You can run the Q257364.exe file using the /s command-line switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Copy the updated SMS files to a disk or network share that is accessible from
  the SMS site server you want to update.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services by using Control
  Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. Copy the Remctrl.exe file from the appropriate &lt;Platform&gt; subfolder to
  the &lt;Driveletter&gt;:\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl\&lt;Platform&gt;
  folder.

4. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Driveletter&gt;:\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl folder with the
  Compver.ini file from the hotfix bundle source folder.

5. Restart the SMS site services.

The new files are replicated to all logon points and Client Access Points (CAPs).
After all logon points and CAPs are updated, allow an additional 23 hours for
clients to begin their update polling cycle.

After applying the patch, the permissions on the
&lt;SMS_local_dir&gt;\MS\SMS\Clicomp\Remctrl folder should be:

  Administrators: Full Access
  Everyone: Read, Execute
