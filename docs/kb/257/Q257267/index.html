-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE), version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, and you browse ASP or
HTML pages from the console of the Web server or another workstation on the
network, the Web service may return the following error message:

  HTTP 500 - Server Application Error

The Default Web Site may be in a Running state. If you run the netstat -an
command from a command prompt, you may notice that the Web server's IP address
is listening on TCP port 80, which is the default HTTP port.

NOTE: When you are troubleshooting problems using the Advanced Internet Options
in Internet Explorer 5.0, more descriptive error messages are usually returned
by disabling the Show friendly HTTP error messages option. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q218155 Description of Hypertext Transport Protocol Error Messages

The following items may appear in the Event Viewer on the IIS 5.0 computer:

- Application Log: COM+ error with Event ID 4099
- System Log: W3SVC error with Event ID 59
- System Log: W3SVC warning with Event ID 36.

The Iis5.log file (located in the WINNT folder) may contain the following error
message:

  0x8004e00f=COM+ was unable to talk to the Microsoft Distributed Transaction
  Coordinator

When you try to open the Component Services snap-in, which is used for COM+
administration, the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) may stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

Internet Information Services 5.0 relies on COM+, which in turn relies on the
Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) service for functionality. The DTC
version-checking feature, included in versions of SQL Server that were developed
prior to Windows 2000, does not recognize the version properties used by Windows
2000. As a result, the SQL Server DTC Setup utility removes the DTC service
installed by Windows 2000. For additional information, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q249310 BUG: Installing SQL Server on Windows 2000 Uninstalls DTC Service

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Verify that the version number of the Dtcsetup.exe application (located in
  the c:\Winnt\System32 directory by default) is 1999.9.3422.24 or later.

2. Run the Dtcsetup.exe application to install the DTC service.

3. Start the DTC service.

4. In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

5. Select Add/Remove Windows Components, remove Internet Information Services
  (IIS) 5.0, and then reinstall it from the Windows 2000 CD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in SQL Server versions 6.5 and
7.0 and MSDE version 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0 is a fully functional version of SQL Server
7.0, but is limited to five concurrent connections. Because MSDE and SQL Server
7.0 share the same code base, when you install MSDE 1.0 on a computer running
Windows 2000, the DTC service is removed. MSDE is available from the following
locations:

- Downloadable from the Microsoft Visual Studio site.

- Downloadable from the MSDN Universal Subscription site or on the MSDN
  Universal Subscription CD.

- Installed with the Office Server Extensions, included with the Microsoft
  Office 2000 Premium and Developer Editions.
