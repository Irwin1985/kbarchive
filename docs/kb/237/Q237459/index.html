-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
- Microsoft Outlook 97 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Move Server wizard to move a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer from one site to another within the same Exchange Server organization,
the Free/Busy information for mailboxes on the server may be incorrect or
unavailable to other users.

CAUSE
=====

Every mailbox has a MAPI property indicating the Schedule+ Free/Busy Information
site folder to which Free/Busy data should be published. The Move Server wizard
to point to the new site's Schedule+ Free/Busy Information folder is not
updating this property. Therefore, the client incorrectly publishes data to the
original site's Schedule+ Free/Busy Information folder.

Both of the following conditions must also be met for this behavior to exist:

- The user accesses his or her mailbox with Microsoft Outlook 97 or Microsoft
  Outlook 98.

-and-

- The old site's Schedule+ Free/Busy Information folder is replicated to the
  new site, or the new site has been configured to have Public Folder affinity
  to the old site.

RESOLUTION
==========

In some cases, simply logging into an affected mailbox with Outlook 2000 may not
resolve the issue. If that doesn't resolve the issue, you may need to run
Outlook with the /CleanFreeBusy parameter, as follows:

  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Outlook.exe" /cleanfreebusy

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

As an alternative to the hotfix provided above, users can upgrade to Microsoft
Outlook 2000. This version has a corrected algorithm for determining the
appropriate Schedule+ Free/Busy Information site folder to which data should be
published. When a Microsoft Outlook 2000 client accesses an affected mailbox on
the moved server, the Free/Busy folder property is updated on the mailbox.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Every site within an Exchange Server organization has its own Schedule+
Free/Busy Information folder, which is a hidden system folder. When a user
modifies his or her Calendar or schedule data, the resulting Free and Busy times
are published as messages to this folder.

The Entry ID of a user's message in the Free/Busy folder is cached in a MAPI
property in the mailbox root folder and in the Inbox. Because this property is
not being updated during a server move, the client continues to publish data to
the old site's folder.

NOTE: If the client is unable to find a replica of the old site's folder in the
new site or through Public Folder affinity to the old site, then it publishes
the correct Free/Busy data to the new site's Free/Busy folder.
