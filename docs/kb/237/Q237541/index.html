-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Monitor counters may not be available
after the Exchange Server services have moved to the second node of a Windows NT
cluster. The counters may not be available using the Exchange Server virtual
name or the actual computer name when you select the computer in Performance
Monitor.

CAUSE
=====

The behavior occurs when the order of software installed on the Cluster Server
nodes is different. The performance key for each of the Exchange Server services
contains the index in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Perflib\009\Counters
registry key, where the first and last counters for the Exchange Server services
exist. If you install software into a cluster in a different order, the values
for each service are different for each server in the cluster. The registry
replication in a cluster is currently set to replicate all subkeys for the
particular service key, including the performance key. This overwrites the
values of one server with the values of another server in the cluster. Hence,
the values in the Counters key on the second node no longer match the indices in
performance keys of the services.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Setup Program

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Srvrmax.exe | 5.5.1960.10 | 
+---------------------------+



After you obtain the fix, follow these steps to apply it:

1. Create a new folder on your hard disk, and then copy the contents of the
  Server\Setup\I386 folder from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM to this new
  folder.

2. Rename the Setup.exe file in the folder on the hard disk to Setup.old, and
  then rename the Srvrmax.exe file to Setup.exe.

3. Run Setup.exe from the folder on the hard disk.

4. When the installation process is finished, apply the latest service pack for
  Exchange Server 5.5, even if it was already applied previously. For
  additional information about how to obtain the latest service pack for
  Exchange Server 5.5, click the article number below to view the article in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

The available fix only corrects the behavior on new installations of Exchange
Server into a cluster environment. If you have already installed Exchange
Server, perform the following steps to manually correct the behavior:

1. In Microsoft Windows NT Cluster Administrator, right-click the directory
  service.

  NOTE: You must be at the console itself to run the Windows NT Cluster
  Administrator program; you cannot run the program from a remote location.

2. Click the Registry Replication tab, remove all of the existing entries, and
  then click Apply to apply these changes.

  NOTE: It is very important that you remove ALL of the existing entries in the
  the Registry Replication tab before you proceed to the next step.

3. Add the following entries for the directory service:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Diagnostics

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

4. Repeat the above steps to add the specified entries for each of the following
  Exchange Server services:

   - The system attendant:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\Diagnostics

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\Parameters

   - The message transfer agent:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Diagnostics

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

   - The information store:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\Diagnostics

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersNetIF

     NOTE: Make sure that you do NOT replicate the root keys for each service
     (For example, the SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS key).

5. You must now reload the Performance Monitor counters on each node in the
  cluster, after you make the changes to registry replication. You need to
  locate the following .ini files. These files are located in the Exchsrvr\Bin
  directory by default.

  Dsactrs.ini
  Mtaperf.ini
  Mdbperf.ini

  This file is located in the %Winnt%\System32 directory by default:

  Eseperf.ini

  To reload the counters, at a command prompt in the directory that contains the
  .ini files, enter the following commands:

  unlodctr MSExchangeDS
  lodctr dsactrs.ini
  unlodctr MSExchangeMTA
  lodctr mtaperf.ini
  unlodctr MSExchangeIS
  lodctr mdbperf.ini
  unlodctr ESE97
  lodctr eseperf.ini

  The Lodctr.exe and Unlodctr.exe files are included in the %Winnt%\System32
  folder.


6. Restart both nodes of the Exchange Server cluster.
