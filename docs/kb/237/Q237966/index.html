-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to delete and purge without destroy permission, SourceSafe
Explorer will close when you attempt to rename the file. Also, after you attempt
to delete and purge the file, the view file selection in the drop-down menu does
not work.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you attempt to destroy a file that you do not have the correct permissions
to, select another project and then go back to the previous project. This
refreshes the internal structure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to reproduce this issue:
------------------------------

Scenario 1:

1. Assign yourself delete permissions but not destroy permissions.
2. Delete a file and select destroy permanently.
3. When prompted by a dialog box to destroy the file, click Yes. Visual
  SourceSafe (VSS) displays a message saying that you do not have the correct
  permissions.
4. Right-click on the file and select "Rename".

Scenario 2:

1. Assign yourself delete permissions but not destroy permissions.
2. Delete a file.
3. Re-add the file (do not recover previously deleted one).
4. Delete the file. If prompted to delete all specified items, click Yes. (This
  is the second delete on the same file.)
5. When prompted by a dialog box to purge the previous file and delete this one,
  click Yes All. VSS displays a message saying that you do not have the correct
  permissions.
6. Right-click on the file, and select "Rename".

Expected results:

The file gets renamed.

Actual results:

The following dialog box appears:

  The instruction at "0x6001da9a" referenced memory at "0x0000000. The memory
  could not be read. Click OK to terminate the application. Click on CANCEL to
  debug the application."

Selecting OK on the prior dialog box results in the following dialog box:

  "The instruction at "0x5f4012a1" referenced memory at 0x00000004. The memory
  could not be read. Click OK to terminate the application."

If you click OK, the application is closed.

If you click Cancel instead, a debug window opens with the the following error
message:

  "Unhandled exception in SSEXP.EXE (SSAPI.DLL): 0xc0000005: Access Violation."
