The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install multiple TAPI devices on the same computer, such as ISDN PRI
cards, the RAS configuration specified for the port could change. Typically, the
problem occurs when you install two ISDN cards of the same type on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the device list is maintained in descending order in
the registry. When NdisWan.sys initializes, it registers the second adapter
before registering the first adapter with TapiServ. This causes the addresses
and names to get swapped.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some ISDN adapters, such as USR PRI ISDN cards, have multiple channels on the
same card. USR PRI has 23 channels. When the first card is installed, the first
channel of the first adapter is mapped to the RAS port ISDN1, the second to
ISDN2, and so forth. When the second card is installed, the first channel of the
second adapter is mapped to the ISDN24, second to ISDN25 and so on. The ports
can be configured for "Receive calls as a RAS server" or "Dial out as a RAS
client".

However, when you restart the computer, the ports are remapped. The new
configuration maps the first channel on the first adapter to ISDN24, the second
channel becomes ISDN25, and so forth. The first channel on the second adapter
becomes ISDN1, the second becomes ISDN2, and so forth.

This affects the RAS configuration assigned to the particular port/channel. If
all the channels on the first card are originally configured for dial-out only
(client), and all the channels on the second card are configured for receive
only (server), after you restart, they are swapped such that all the channels on
the first card now are configured for receive only, and the second card for
dial-out only.

Before restart:

Port Address 6-23-0 6-22-0 .....6-1-0   4-23-0  4-22-0 ... 4-1-0
Friendlyname ISDN46 ISDN45 .....ISDN24  ISDN23  ISDN22 ... ISDN1
Role         Server Server .....Server  Client  Client ... Client 

After restart:

Port Address 6-23-0 6-22-0.....6-1-0  4-23-00 4-22-0 ... 4-1-0
Friendlyname ISDN23 ISDN22.....ISDN1  ISDN46  ISDN45 ... ISDN24
Role         Server Server.....Server Client  Client ... Client
