SUMMARY
=======

This article describes orphan clients and steps for recovering from this
problem. This article also describes a procedure to plan for account rotation in
domains with secure account policies.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A client is orphaned when it cannot connect back to its client access point
(CAP) server to receive configuration updates or package instruction files.
Microsoft Windows 95/98 clients do not experience this condition because the
client always connects back to the CAP in the current user context. Microsoft
Windows NT client computers use a client connection account to connect to the
CAP. The default account that is created when the site is installed is
SMSClient_xxx (where xxx is the site code). This account has no special rights
apart from Domain User privileges.

Depending on the number of Windows NT clients and your network infrastructure,
the symptoms of the orphan client condition vary. Problems that can occur
include:

- Domain controllers are slow to respond to logon requests.

- Repeated account lockout of the SMSClient_xxx account occurs when Account
  Lockout is enabled for the domain.

- Performance degradation occurs on CAP servers.

- Windows NT clients do not receive optional component configuration changes.

- Windows NT clients do not receive advertised packages.

- Windows NT clients do not report inventory for long periods of time.

The orphan client condition occurs for many different reasons. Examples of when
this behavior can occur include:

- When a site is rebuilt (for example, you install a new site to replace a
  failed site).

- When a site is restored from backup.

- When the SMSClient_xxx account password is changed.

- When the SMSClient_xxx account is deleted.

Best Practice
-------------

To avoid the orphan client condition, always manually create at least one other
client connection account as a fallback account. To create a second client
connection account:

1. In User Manager for Domains, copy the SMSClient_xxx account, and give it a
  strong password (eight or more characters, using a combination of upper/lower
  case letters, numbers, and symbols).

2. In Server Manager, synchronize the domain.

3. In the SMS Administrator console, click Site Hierarchy, click SiteName, click
  SiteSettings, click Connection Accounts, right-click Client, point to New,
  and then click Windows NT.

4. Specify the account name in domain\account format and the password you chose
  in step 1.

Windows NT clients receive the updated account information the next time they
connect to the CAP (on their 23-hour Client Configuration Installation Manager
(CCIM) cycle) or when they run Smsls.bat or Smsman.exe.

NOTE: If your security policies require you to change passwords frequently and
your clients are installed using Windows NT Remote Client Installation method,
always create a new account several days before the password change is made so
the clients get new account information before the old password is changed. For
more information, refer to the procedure outlined at the end of this article.

Steps to Recover
----------------

If you are currently experiencing an orphaned client problem, use the following
steps to recover the clients:

1. In User Manager for Domains, copy the SMSClient_xxx account, and give it a
  strong password (eight or more characters, using a combination of upper/lower
  case letters, numbers, and symbols).

2. In Server Manager, synchronize the domain.

3. In the SMS Administrator console, click Site Hierarchy, click SiteName, click
  SiteSettings, click Connection Accounts, right-click Client, point to New,
  and then click Windows NT.

4. Specify the account name in domain\account format and the password you chose
  in step 1 above.

Windows NT clients receive the updated account information when they run
Smsls.bat or Smsman.exe. If the clients are installed using Windows NT Remote
Client Installation Method, they cannot be recovered automatically. You must
turn on Windows Networking Logon Client Installation Method and either run
Smsls.bat in the logon script or manually run Smsman.exe on each affected
client.

Supplemental Client Connection Account Information
--------------------------------------------------

The following information is included in the Systems Management Server 2.0
documentation.

If Account Lockout is enabled in Windows NT User Manager for Domains, any one
client with an invalid password causes all client connection accounts that the
client is aware of to become locked out, if the password on those accounts have
changed. For example, an SMS client that has been offline for a long period of
time can cause a lockout because all of its client connection accounts passwords
might have expired. When it attempts to return online with an old, invalid
account password, it causes that client connection account to become locked
out.

Because Windows NT account information typically propagates down the domain more
quickly than Systems Management Server account information in a Systems
Management Server site hierarchy, when a client connection account password is
changed in Windows NT, the Systems Management Server client with the old
password does not work.

If the Systems Management Server client software is installed on the client using
Windows NT Remote Client Installation, it is difficult for that client to
recover from the account lockout because the client receives updated account
information from the CAP using the account that did not work. However, if Logon
Discovery is enabled, the client receives the updated account and password
information during the next logon attempt (if logon scripts are used). If logon
points are not created, the only way for such a client to recover from account
lockout is for you to either enable Discovery or Logon Installation (with
scripts enabled), or use Smsman.exe to reinstall. You could also remove and then
reinstall the client using Windows NT Remote Client Installation.

To avoid locking out clients, do not change the password of the client connection
account. Instead, create new client connection accounts with new passwords.
After the new account information is propagated to all domain controllers, CAPs,
and clients, you can change or delete the old accounts.

If your domain uses a Password Restrictions Account Policy, you need to develop a
procedure to avoid orphaning your Windows NT clients. The time between a cycle
of adding and deleting accounts should be one-third of the maximum password age
set in Windows NT.

Procedure to Maintain Two Valid Client Connection Accounts:

You can use the following procedure to ensure that two valid client connection
accounts are maintained at all times. This procedure should be implemented in
every domain that has a client connection account used by clients in the site.

NOTE: In this procedure, the time between cycles of adding and deleting accounts
is two weeks (one-third of the default 42-day maximum password age in Windows NT
User Manager for Domains).

1. In User Manager for Domains, create the following three accounts:

   - SMSClient_00001

   - SMSClient_00002

   - SMSClient_00003

NOTE: When you name your accounts, use the SMSClient_xxxxx format to ensure
sufficient account capacity.

2. In the SMS Administrator console, create the same three client connection
  accounts.

3. Two weeks after you create the first three accounts, create a fourth account
  (SMSClient_00004) in User Manager for Domains and in the SMS Administrator
  console.

4. Delete the oldest account (SMSClient_00001) from User Manager for Domains and
  from the SMS Administrator console.

5. Two weeks after you delete the oldest account, add a new account
  (SMSClient_00005) to User Manager for Domains and the SMS Administrator
  console.

6. Delete the oldest account (SMSClient_00002) from User Manager for Domains and
  from the SMS Administrator console.

7. Continue this cycle every two weeks by adding a new account with an
  incremented number in the account name (SMSClient_xxxxx), and by deleting the
  oldest account in the series. Remember to add and delete the account in both
  User Manager for Domains and the SMS Administrator console.

By creating three new accounts, adding a new account and then deleting an old
account, you ensure that two accounts remain untouched during account
maintenance (the newer account and the older account). The older account helps
ensure that clients who have been offline for a longer period of time and return
online, have a valid account and password.
