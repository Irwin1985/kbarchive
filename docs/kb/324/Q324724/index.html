-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you turn on the Backup Sponsor Server feature for an SNA subdomain, SNA
Server 4.0 clients and Host Integration Server 2000 clients may try to connect
to the configured backup sponsor servers, although there are available sponsor
servers in the client's configured subdomain.

If the SNA client or the Host Integration Server client makes a sponsor
connection to a backup sponsor server, any later host session obtained by the
user will be through an SNA Server server or a Host Integration Server 2000
server that belongs to the SNA subdomain of the backup sponsor server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000 .


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following explains how the problem described in this article can occur. The
example uses Host Integration Server 2000, but it also applies to SNA Server
4.0.

- Host Integration Server 2000 End User Client Configuration:

  By using the Resource Location Wizard, the client is configured to "Locate
  Servers by Server Name". The following sponsor servers are configured for the
  client:

   - SPONSOR1
   - SPONSOR2

  Additionally, the following configuration options are turned on:

   - Update SNA Server computer list dynamically
   - Select an SNA Service computer list in random order

- Host Integration Server 2000 Server Configuration:

  The Backup Sponsor Server option is turned on and BACKUP1 is added as the
  backup sponsor server to be advertised to the Host Integration Server 2000
  clients. BACKUP1 is in a different SNA subdomain than SPONSOR1 and SPONSOR2.

If SPONSOR1 and SPONSOR2 are unavailable, the Host Integration Server 2000 client
correctly fails over to BACKUP1 to get a sponsor connection. The Host
Integration Server 2000 client can then host sessions from Host Integration
Server 2000 servers in the SNA subdomain in which BACKUP1 is located.

When the failover occurs, the Host Integration Server 2000 client's sponsor
server list is updated to include BACKUP1, in addition to SPONSOR1 and SPONSOR2.
The problem occurs when the client randomly tries to connect to BACKUP1 as a
sponsor server each time SnaBase.exe initializes. This is not the correct
behavior; a backup sponsor should be used only when the client's configured
sponsor servers are not available.

If a Host Integration Server 2000 client has the DeleteNonActiveSponsors registry
entry set to "YES" (without the quotation marks), and the configuration settings
described previously, BACKUP1 is added to the client's sponsor server list and
the other sponsor servers (SPONSOR1 and SPONSOR2, in this example) are removed
from the sponsor server list when the client fails over to its backup sponsor
server. The result is that the Host Integration Server 2000 client cannot
reconnect to any Host Integration Server 2000 servers in its configured SNA
subdomain. The Host Integration Server 2000 client must be reconfigured manually
to have the correct sponsor servers added to its sponsor server list.
