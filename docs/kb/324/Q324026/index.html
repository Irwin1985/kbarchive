CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if incorrect values exist for the location of the MTA
database path in the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, edit the registry to refer to the correct location for
the MTA database files. To do so, follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. Locate the following registry entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\MTA
  Database Path

4. Double-click the registry entry that you located in step 3, and then type the
  correct path to the MTA database files in the "Value data" box. For example,
  "&lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\mtadata" (without the quotation marks).

5. Locate the following registry entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\MTA
  Run Directory

6. Double-click the entry that you located in step 5, and then verify that the
  correct location for the MTA Run Directory is displayed in the "Value data"
  box. For example, "&lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\mtadata" (without the quotation
  marks).

7. On the Registry menu, click Exit to quit Registry Editor.

NOTE:You can also use Microsoft Exchange Server Performance Optimizer to move the
MTA database files. To start Performance Optimizer, click Start, point to
Programs, point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click Microsoft Exchange
Optimizer. If you want to run Performance Optimizer in verbose mode, follow the
steps in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
