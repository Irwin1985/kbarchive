-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

COMTI components that use an LU 6.2-type Remote Environment may fail under load
and log events 103, 300, and 301 in the application event log.

Details of Event ID 103

  Event ID: 103
  Event Source: COMTI
  Description:
  (103) An error occurred during object creation and couldn't be reported to the
  client:

  Exception description:
  (1435) The SNA dynamic link libraries WAPPC32.DLL and WINCSV32.DLL were not
  found on the system. You must install Host Integration Server 2000 or its
  client software before you try to use the COM Transaction Integrator LU 6.2
  transport.

Details of Event ID 300

  Event ID: 300
  Event Source: COMTI
  Description:
  (300) COM Transaction Integrator's state machine dispenser was unable to
  create a new state machine object

  Progress Code: 6
  HRESULT: 0x80040111

Details of Event ID 301

  Event ID: 301
  Event Source: COMTI
  Description:
  (301) COM Transaction Integrator's state machine dispenser was unable to
  allocate a state machine object

  Progress Code: 2
  HRESULT: 0x80040111

CAUSE
=====

Under load, multiple COMTI client requests may be received at or near the same
time. If this occurs when COMTI tries to load the APPC transport DLLs
(wappc32.dll and wincsv32.dll), a timing issue may occur, which causes COMTI to
return an exception to the client and to log the events that are listed in the
"Symptoms" section.

RESOLUTION
==========

Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use
the Time Zone tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

  20-Jun-2002  08:36  5.0.0.865          49,424  Turnaround.dll

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

No fix is available at this time.


WORKAROUND
==========

There is no way to work around this problem. However, you can disable idle
timeout on the COM+ application that is hosting the COMTI component to greatly
reduce the chance of experiencing this problem. If you disable idle timeout,
COMTI and the APPC transport DLLs remain loaded in memory and do not have to be
reloaded when new client requests are received.

STATUS
======

Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem affects COMTI components that use LU 6.2-type Remote Environments.
The LU 6.2-type Remote Environments that are available in Host Integration
Server 2000 are as follows:

- CICS LINK using LU6.2

- CICS using LU6.2

- IMS using LU6.2

The COMTI events that are listed in the "Symptoms" section may also be logged for
other reasons. Most frequently, these errors may be logged if COMTI has trouble
loading the APPC transport DLLs because of a path problem. Typical path problems
may include the following:

- The HISROOT\System directory is not contained in the path.

- The HISROOT\System directory is located too far down in the path.

- Third-party DLLs with the same names exist in a directory that is higher in
  the path statement than the HISROOT\System directory.
