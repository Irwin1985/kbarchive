The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, versions SP1, SP2, SP3 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4, 5.5 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you delete an Exchange 2000 mailbox from a mixed Exchange Server 5.5 and
Exchange 2000 environment, the mailbox vanishes from Active Directory and Site
Replication Service (SRS), but you can still see the mailbox when you are
connected to an Exchange Server directory. If you re-create the mailbox, a
duplicate mailbox appears in the Exchange Server directories with "-1" added to
the directory name of the mailbox. Exchange Server users see duplicate entries
in the Global Address List. These users may not be able to send mail to either
entry and may receive a non-delivery report.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because mailbox deletions are set to be written to a .csv file
on the properties of the Active Directory Connector (ADC) recipient Connection
Agreement that is responsible for the Site/Administrative Group that the
mailboxes were deleted from.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, create a new .csv file for each Exchange
Site/Administrative Group that has duplicate mailboxes, and then paste the first
line in the Ex55.csv file into each new .csv file.

In the server where the ADC is installed, there is a file named Ex55.csv that is
created in the Program Files\MSADC\MSADC\&lt;Name of Connection Agreement&gt;
folder. This .csv file contains a list of all of the deleted Exchange 2000
mailboxes that were not replicated to the Exchange Server directories.

The first line of the file named ex55.csv is similar to the following line:

  Obj-Class, Mode, Directory Name, Obj-Container

After you paste each entry from the Ex55.csv file to the appropriate new .csv
file, sort the new .csv file by Exchange Site and then sort by Administrative
Group. Each entry is similar to the following entry:

  mailbox, delete, user, /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients

Next, you must take some additional steps to determine which SRS to import each
.csv file into.

1. Open the ADC console and view the list of Connection Agreements.

2. Check the properties of each Connection Agreement that starts with "Config
  CA."

   - On the From Windows tab, you can see a list of the Administrative Groups
     that Config CA is responsible for.

   - On the Connections tab, the Exchange Server entry specifies the SRS server
     that corresponds with the Config CA and that is responsible for the
     Administrative Groups listed in the From Windows tab.

Follow these steps for each Connection Agreement that starts with Config CA to
determine which SRS databases are responsible for each Administrative Group in
your organization.

Now you are ready to import the .csv files that you created.

1. Start Exchange Server Administrator, and then connect to the Exchange 2000
  server that hosts the SRS database.

2. Click Tools, and then click Directory Import.

3. Select the domain that the SRS server belongs to, and then select the SRS
  server as the MS Exchange Server.

4. Type the name of the .csv file that you created in the Import File box.

5. Click Import, and then wait for Exchange Server directory replication to
  replicate the deletions in the site.

NOTE: You must follow these steps on a regular basis unless you allow mailbox
deletions to replicate to Exchange Server directories on the Deletion tab on the
properties of each recipient Connection Agreement.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
