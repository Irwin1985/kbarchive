- Modify WSDL from HTTP to HTTPS
- Verify That SSL Is Configured Correctly
- Enforce SSL-Only Access


SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to configure a current XML Web service
to use an encrypted channel with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection.

Configure Your Web Server for SSL
---------------------------------

Your XML Web Service will be running on Internet Information Server (IIS) and it
will rely on IIS to provide SSL support. Because of this, you must first install
an SSL server certificate on your server so that you can enable SSL support. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. If you are purchasing a server certificate from a third-party certification
  authority or if you have an enterprise certification authority available to
  you, skip to step 2.

  Otherwise, to install Certificate Services, follow these steps:

  a. Start the Add or Remove Programs tool.

  b. Click Add/Remove Windows Components.

  c. Click to select the Certificate Services check box.

  d. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. To run the Web Server Certificate Wizard, follow these steps:

  a. Start Internet Information Services Manager (IISM).

  b. Right-click the site that you want the certificate for.

  c. Click Properties, click the Directory Security tab, and then click Server
     Certificate.

3. In the Web Server Certificate Wizard, click Next.

4. Click "Create a new certificate", and then click Next.

5. Click "Prepare the request now, but send it later", and then click Next.

6. Type a name for the certificate, select the "Bit length", and then click
  Next.

7. Type your company's organization and organizational unit names, and then
  click Next.

8. Type the "Common name", and then click Next.

  NOTE: Provide the common name for the server that runs your XML Web service.

9. Complete the Geographical Information page, and then click Next.

10. Type a file name for your certificate request, and then click Next.

11. Click Next.

12. Click Finish.

13. When you complete the wizard, a certificate request is saved in a file that
  you specify. By default, this is C:\Certreq.txt.

14. Do one of the following:

   - If you are submitting your certificate to another certification authority,
     submit your application by following the certification authority's
     guidelines. When you receive your certificate file, open it, and then skip
     to step 15.

   - If you are using Windows .NET Server Certificate Services to create your
     certificate, follow these steps:

     a. In Internet Explorer, visit the following Web site:

  http://localhost/certsrv

     b. Click "Request a Certificate".

     c. Click "Advanced certificate request".

     d. Click "Submit a certificate request using a base64 encoded PKCS #10
        file or a renewal request using a base64 encoded PKCS #7 file".

     e. On the Submit a Certificate Request or Renewal Request page, click
        "Browse for a file to insert", specify the file that you created in
        step 13, click Read, and then click Submit.

        NOTE: You may also copy and paste the content of the certificate request
        file into the Saved Request text box.

     f. Click Start, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
        Certification Authority.

     g. Expand your certification authority's name, and then double-click the
        Pending Request folder.

     h. Right-click the certificate request that you just submitted, point to
        All Tasks, and then click Issue.

     i. Quit the Certification Authority Management console.

     j. In Internet Explorer, visit the following Web site:

  http://localhost/certsrv

     k. Click "View the status of a pending certificate request".

     l. Click the request that you just created.

     m. On the Certificate Issued page, select either of the encoding schemes,
        and then click "Download certificate".

     n. Click Save in the security dialog box.

     o. Click Close.

15. In Internet Services Manager, right-click the virtual site that you created
  the certificate for, and then click Properties.

16. Click the Directory Security tab, and then click Server Certificate.

17. Click Next.

18. Click "Process the pending request and install the certificate", and then
  click Next.

19. Click Browse, locate and click your certificate file, and then click Next.

20. Click Next.

  NOTE: If a dialog box appears that warns you that the certificate may have
  come from an untrusted source, click OK.

21. Click Finish.

Install Your Certification Authority's Certificate on the Client
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you used your own certificate services, follow these steps to install your
certification authority's certificate on the client as a trusted root
certification authority:

1. In Internet Explorer, visit the following Web site, where
  &lt;CertificateServer&gt; is the name of the Certificate Services server that
  issued the certificate that is being used on the Web server:

  http://&lt;CertificateServer&gt;/certsrv

2. Click "Download a CA certificate, certificate chain or CRL".

3. Click "Download CA certificate".

4. In the File Download dialog box, click Open.

5. In the Certificate dialog box, click Install Certificate.

6. In the Certificate Import Wizard, click Next.

7. Click "Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of
  certificate", and then click Next.

8. Click Finish.

9. Click OK to acknowledge that the import was successful.

10. Click OK to close the Certificate dialog box.

If you plan to access your XML Web Service from an ASP page, follow these steps
to add the certification authority's certificate to the computer's trusted root
store:

1. In Internet Explorer, visit the following Web site, where
  &lt;CertificateServer&gt; is the name of the Certificate Services server that
  issued the certificate that is being used on the Web server:

  http://&lt;CertificateServer&gt;/certsrv

2. Click "Download a CA certificate, certificate chain or CRL".

3. Click "Download CA certificate".

4. In the File Download dialog box, click Save.

5. Click Close.

6. Click Start, and then click Run.

7. In the Open box, type "mmc" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

8. On the File menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in.

9. Click Add.

10. Click Certificates, and then click Add.

11. Click Computer Account, and then click Next.

12. Click Local Computer, and then click Finish.

13. Click Close, and then click OK.

  The list of certificate categories for the local computer appears in the
  snap-in window.

14. Expand Certificates (Local Computer).

15. Expand "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".

16. Right-click Certificates, point to All Tasks, and then click Import.

17. In the Certificate Import Wizard, click Next.

18. Click Browse, and then locate the certificate that you saved in step 14,n.

19. Click the file, and then click Open.

20. Click Next.

21. Click Next, and then click Finish.

22. Click OK to acknowledge the successful import.

Modify WSDL from HTTP to HTTPS
------------------------------

1. Edit the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) files for your service so
  that the address for your Web service begins with https instead of http. Make
  sure that the copy of the WSDL that your client uses also indicates https.

2. For Microsoft Visual Studio .NET projects, when you add a Web Reference, you
  can specify an https URL as the location of the XML Web service. To do this,
  edit the class that was created by Visual Studio .NET that wraps the Web
  service; modify the line of code that sets the URL. For a C# project, the
  line of code will look similar to the following after you modify it, where
  &lt;mycomputer&gt; refers to the Web server that is hosting Web services that
  are secured by SSL:

  this.Url = "https://mycomputer/MyWS/Service1.asmx";

Your XML Web Service will now be accessed over SSL.

Verify That SSL Is Configured Correctly
---------------------------------------

To determine whether SSL is configured correctly, try using an https URL such as
the following, where &lt;mycomputer&gt; refers to the Web server that is hosting
Web services that are secured by SSL:

  https://&lt;mycomputer&gt;/test/test.asmx

If you can successfully visit the location without Internet Explorer displaying
an error message, your configuration is correct. You are now ready to try to
access your Web service programmatically.

Enforce SSL-Only Access
-----------------------

To make sure that only SSL requests are accepted by your Web service, follow
these steps to configure the virtual directory where your XML Web service
resides to be SSL only in Internet Services Manager:

1. Click Start, point to Administrative Tools, and then click "Internet
  Information Services (IIS)".

2. Expand the computer that hosts your XML Web service Web site.

3. Expand the Web Sites folder.

4. Expand the Web site that hosts your XML Web service.

5. Right-click the virtual directory where your XML Web service resides, and
  then click Properties.

6. Click the Directory Security tab, and then click Edit under the Secure
  Communications section.

7. In the Secure Communications dialog box, click "Require secure channel
  (SSL)", and then click OK two times.
