The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server (SMS) Collection Evaluator component
(SMS_COLLECTION_EVALUATOR) may time out when it tries to refresh a collection
that is based on one or more SMS queries. If you experience this problem, the
following entries or entries that are similar to these entries may appear in the
Colleval.log file:

  **********~Processing file A01001F3.UDC

  (remainder of query removed) 
  CStatusReporter::Report() ERROR: Caller passed NULL for pSM.
  Could not refresh results for collection A01001F3.

CAUSE
=====

The hotfix for the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article changed the
Collection Evaluator timeout from 18 hours to 18 minutes:

  Q317337 SMS: Executive Services that Interact with SQL Appear to Hang

Collections that are based on complex queries or queries that connect to
extremely large tables may take over 18 minutes to finish. When this occurs, the
collection refresh does not work, and you receive the symptoms that are listed
in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this fix for SMS 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) sites
should have the following file attributes or later:

contains the above files may also contain additional files.



After you apply the fix from Q324204, the Collection Evaluator timeout is set to
6 hours. If you have installed any of the following hotfixes and have
collections that take longer than 18 minutes to update, you may want to install
the hotfix that is documented in this article. Besides increasing the timeout,
Q324204 also fixes all the issues that are documented in the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q316258 Problems Connecting to SMS Provider Without Impersonation

  Q317337 SMS: Executive Services that Interact with SQL Appear to Hang

  Q303397 Cannot View Subcollections on Child Sites

  Q320692 SMS: Transaction History Files Increase in Size

  Q245579 SMS: Secondary Site Does Not Decompress Package

  Q319189 SMS: Distribution Manager Continuously Processes .pkg Files

  Q323614 SMS: Increasing Number Of Zero-Byte Files in the Replmgr.box/Incoming
  Folder

NOTE: The individual hotfixes for these Microsoft Knowledge Base articles are no
longer available from Microsoft because they are all superceeded by the hotfix
for Q324204.


The hotfix that is described in this article is included in the Hotfix Rollup
Package (HRP) for customers who have installed SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4).

Note that the timeout problem that is described in Microsoft Knowledge Base
article Q324204 is fixed in the HRP. The fixes for Q316258, Q317337, Q303397,
and Q320692 are also included in the HRP. However, the fixes for Q245579,
Q319189, and Q323614 are not included in the HRP.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not create collections that are based on queries that take more than 18
minutes to finish.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Use the Hotfix Installer
------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based computers.

1. Create a folder to a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the update file (Q324204.exe) and platform folders to the new folder.
  The folder structure must be arranged so that the update file is located one
  folder "above" the platform folders.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console, if it is running.

5. Run Q324204.exe, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

Manual Installation
-------------------

Manually Update the SMS Site Server:

1. Create a folder to a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfixed files to the new folder.

3. From each of your primary SMS site servers in your environment, log on to
  your site server by using an account with administrative privileges.

4. Quit the SMS administrator console.

5. Stop all SMS services.

6. Make a backup copy of the following files:

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Baseutil.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Colleval.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Replmgr.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Smsprov.dll

7. Copy the updated files from the disk or network share to the SMS installation
  folder:

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Cmprov.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Compmgr.exe

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Baseutil.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Colleval.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Replmgr.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Smsprov.dll

NOTE: This hotfix also contains a SQL script to update the SMS database. If the
SMS site server and the SQL server are running on separate computers, you must
run the script on the remote SQL server computer.

8. Load the Update.sql script by using a SQL server query tool, such as Query
  Analyzer or ISQL/W.

9. In the SQL server query tool, click the SMS database, and then run the
  script.

10. Restart the SMS services.

Additional Installation Information
-----------------------------------

To update remote site computers such as SMS administrator consoles, an SMS SQL
monitor, or an SMS provider that is not located on the site server, use the
appropriate method.

Manually Updating a Remote SMS Administrator Console:

  service.

3. Make a backup copy of the SMS SQL monitor files you are about to overwrite:

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Basesvr.dll

   - &lt;SMS_Root&gt;\bin\&lt;processor type&gt;\Baseutil.dll
