SUMMARY
=======

No method exists for logging on to multiple secure Microsoft Windows NT domains
or workgroups while moving from location to location with a portable computer.
When you take a portable computer away from a secure Microsoft Windows NT domain
and reconfigure the computer to log on to a workgroup or secure domain at
another location, it is not possible to return to the original secure domain and
reconfigure the machine account without administrative rights, or a call to your
network administrator. Moving a portable computer from a corporate network to a
home network causes machine account problems in a enterprise network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Only administrators have the necessary rights to add machine accounts to a
domain. Most users will have to ask a domain administrator to return the machine
account to the domain. The current design is that only an administrator can
change the domain to which a Windows 2000-based or Windows NT-based computer
belongs.

If your situation requires users to log on to various domains, you can establish
trust relationships between the various domains. If all the domains are in a
Windows 2000 tree, the trusts are transitive and there is no special
configuration required.

Windows 2000 Active Directory domains allow any authenticated user the right to
create up to ten computer accounts in the domain by default. This is a group
policy setting that is found in the Domain Controllers container in the
following folder:

  Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User
  Rights Assignment

Add Workstations to Domain Policy
---------------------------------

Determines which groups or users can add workstations to a domain. This policy is
valid only on domain controllers. By default, any authenticated user has this
right and can create up to ten computer accounts in the domain.

Adding a computer account to the domain allows the computer to participate in
Active Directory based networking. For example, adding a workstation to a domain
allows that workstation to recognize accounts and groups that exist in Active
Directory.

The default group that has this right on domain controllers is:

- Authenticated Users

NOTE: Users that have the "Create Computer Objects" permission on the Active
Directory Computers container can also create computer accounts in the domain.
The distinction is that users with permissions on the container are not
restricted to the creation of only ten computer accounts. Furthermore, computer
accounts created by means of the Add workstations to domain user right have
Domain Administrators as the owner of the computer account, while computer
accounts created by means of permissions on the computers container have the
creator as the owner of the computer account. If a user has permissions on the
container and also has the add workstation to domain user right, then the
computer is added based on the computer container permissions rather than the
user right.
