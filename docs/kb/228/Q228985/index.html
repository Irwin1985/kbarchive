NOTE: This issue occurs on computers running Windows XP Home and Windows XP
Professional. When the issue occurs on Windows XP Professional, it does not
occur as a result of "fast user switching." but the issue may occur due to one
of the other conditions listed earlier in this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order they are
presented.

Method 1: Verify the Game CD Is Inserted in the CD-ROM Drive
------------------------------------------------------------

Verify that the game disc is inserted in the CD-ROM drive. Insert the original
game disc into your CD-ROM drive, and then restart the program.

- Combat Flight Simulator 2:

  If you are trying to play Combat Flight Simulator 2, then please use CD-ROM
  number 2.

- MechWarrior 4: Inner Sphere 'Mech Pak:

  If you are trying to play MechWarrior 4: Inner Sphere 'Mech Paks, please
  insert MechWarrior Vengeance 4 (disk 1) or Black Knight before starting the
  game.

  For Midtown Madness 1, you can now download the Midtown Madness update to fix
  the issue with "please insert correct CD." To download the update, please
  visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/midtown/downloads.htm

  NOTE: If you are using a copied game, please use the original game CD to
  install or start the game.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 2: Quit Armon32.exe
--------------------------

If it is running, quit Armon32.exe before you start the game. To do so:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

2. In the Close Program dialog box, click Armon32, and then click End Task.

3. If you receive a message that the program is busy or not responding, click
  End Task again.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 3: Clean Boot the Computer
---------------------------------

These articles describe how to disable common startup programs, settings, and
drivers to troubleshoot issues. This procedure is known as "clean booting."
Programs that run in the background in memory are called
terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSR's). For example, these programs may be
virus protection software, utility programs, print manager programs, or screen
savers.

To clean boot your computer, use the appropriate method for your version of
Windows:

  Q192926 How to Perform Clean-Boot Troubleshooting for Windows 98

  Q267288 How to Perform a Clean Boot in Windows Millennium Edition

  Q281770 How to Perform Clean-Boot Troubleshooting for Windows 2000

  Q310353 How to Perform a Clean Boot in Windows XP

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 4: Log On as Administrator (Only for Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows XP)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP, please log off the
computer, and then log on to the computer as a user with Administrator rights.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 5: Obtain the Windows XP Fix
-----------------------------------

If you are using Windows XP, and have fast user switching enabled, you may need
to obtain a patch file. To do so, please visit the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=35831

NOTE: To install this patch, you must log on to Windows using an account with
administration rights. This file is not required for Windows 2000 or earlier.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 6: Obtain Microvision Update
-----------------------------------

This update is designed for Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP. You may
need to be logged on as an administrator to install it.

If you continue to experience problems verifying the CD, a compatibility
enhancement patch is available. To download it, please visit the following
Macrovision Web site:

  http://www.macrovision.com/solutions/software/fix.php3

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 7: Install and Then Start the Game from a Different CD-ROM Drive or DVD-ROM Drive
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this issue continues to occur, your CD-ROM drive may be unable to read the
game CD.

Try to install the game from a different CD-ROM or DVD drive on the same computer
or a different computer. If the installation is successful and you are able to
start the game in this test, the problem may be that the original CD-ROM or
DVD-ROM drive is may be unable to read the game disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because these Microsoft games are copy-protected programs, you must insert the
game CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive to run the program.

This is also true if you copy the contents of the game CD-ROM to a hard disk,
server, or other storage device and then install the game from this storage
device.
