MORE INFORMATION
================

Spine: Text Correction
----------------------

Change:
"MSCE"
To:
"MCSE"


Page 49: Question 70-098.02.02.004 Correction
---------------------------------------------

On Page 49, in question 70-098.02.02.004, the question should be revised so that
the answer for "A" applies.

Change the last sentence in the question from:
"How must Tom's computers be configured to allow Tom access to his work computer
from his home computer?"

To:
"How must Tom's work computer be configured to allow Tom access to it from his
home computer?"

This change should take place on page 49 and 50.


Page 69: Question 70-098.02.03.011 Answer "D" Should Be Incorrect
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On page 69, the answer to Question 70-098.02.03.011 should be "C" and "F".

When Client for Netware Networks is installed, it automatically installs IPX/SPX
so you do not have to install it again seperately. This can be verified by
looking at page 66 in the answer for 70-098.02.03.007, option A.

Change "D" from:
"Correct. Netware networks use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol."

To:
"Incorrect. Netware networks use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, but when you
install Client for NetWare Networks, the IPX/SPX protocol will be installed
automatically."


Page 98: Question 70-098.02.06.002 Answer "D" Is Incorrect
----------------------------------------------------------

On page 98, the correct answers for question 70-098.02.06.002 are A and C.

Change answer D from:
"D. Correct. Windows 98 supports restoring MS-DOS backups."

To:
"D. Incorrect. Windows 98 does not support restoring MS-DOS backups."


Page 104: Using Microsoft Backup, Practice 2 Is Incorrect
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 104, under "Using Microsoft Backup", Practice 2 states the same practice
exercise as Practice 2 in Configuring a local printer.

Under "Using Microsoft Backup" delete: "Practice 2: Share the printer for network
use. Try connecting to this printer and printing a test page."

The following practice exercises should suffice:

- Manually install Microsoft Backup on a Windows 98 computer.

- Create a New backup job using the Backup Wizard.

- Restore the backup job using the Restore Wizard.

- Perform a backup and restore without using the Wizards.


Page 146: Question 70-98.03.05.001 Cluster Size Incorrect
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 146, in question 70-98.03.05.001, the cluster size for FAT 32, in answer
"D" is incorrect.

Change:
"D. Incorrect. FAT32 uses 32-KB clusters, so by upgrading to FAT32 you would be
implementing 32-KB, not 8-KB, clusters."

To:
"D. Incorrect. FAT32 uses 4-KB clusters on a drive smaller than 8 gig, so by
upgrading to FAT32 you would be implementing 4-KB, not 8-KB, clusters."
