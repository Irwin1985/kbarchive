SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect through the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to an IIS
4.0 computer that resides on a different domain, the following error message may
occur:

  Unable to Administer the &lt;Specific IIS Service&gt; Service on &lt;Server
  Name&gt; because the following error occurred.
  Access is Denied.

CAUSE
=====

The user account that you are logged in as on the workstation or server from
which you are running the MMC does not exist on the remote IIS 4.0 computer that
you are trying to connect to. Therefore, you can not be authenticated as an
administrator of the IIS 4.0 resources on the remote computer. If you cannot be
authenticated as an administrator, then the MMC will deny you access to those
resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following resolution needs to be performed on the domain or server where the
remote IIS 4.0 computer is located.

Create a similar account and password on the other domain using User Manager for
Domains. If the server is a standalone server, use User Manager on the server to
create the user account.

Perform these steps on the remote IIS 4.0 computer that you want to administer:

1. If the IIS 4.0 computer is a standalone server, run User Manager. Otherwise
  run User Manager for Domains.

2. Create a user account with the same user name and password as the account
  that you are logged on to on the local workstation or server.

3. To be able to fully administer the remote IIS 4.0 computer, make this new
  account a member of the Local Administrators Group on the remote IIS 4.0
  computer.

You can now run the MMC on your system and access and manage the IIS 4.0
resources of the remote system.
