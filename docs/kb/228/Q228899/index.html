SUMMARY
=======

The Software Metering component of Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 (SMS)
has two different modes of operation, Offline mode and Online mode. Offline mode
is a passive operation that provides a list of applications that have been
executed by participating clients. In Online mode, the Administrator configures
the Software Metering server to restrict clients to specified applications by a
limited user group, machine, or preset number of allowed licenses throughout all
participating clients. For clients to work in Online mode, you need to set up
several specific configurations. Please see the "More Information" section of
this article to review these configurations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For clients to work in Online mode, it is essential to have a functional and
healthy SMS 2.0 site with Software Metering installed. In addition, you should
enable the server side of Software Metering prior to configuring the client
component. For more information on this, refer to Chapter 14, "Metering
Software" in the SMS Administrator's Guide.

NOTE: Before enabling the "Force real-time license verification" option, the
client is in an Online mode. This can cause a much higher use of network
bandwidth, as well as client and server processor use.

To Enable the Software Metering Client Agent and Configure the "Force Real-Time License Verification" Option:

1. In the SMS Administrator Console, navigate to:

  Systems Management Server\Site Database (site code - site name)\Site
  Hierarchy\site code - site name\Site Settings\Client Agents

2. On the General tab, click to select both of the following options:

  "Enable software metering on clients"
  "Force real-time license verification"

3. Open the Software Metering Tool by navigating to:

  Systems Management Server\Site Database (site code - site name)\Site
  Hierarchy\Tools\Software Metering

4. Right-click All Tasks, and then click Start Software Metering.

  This starts the Software Metering configuration tool, which allows you to
  designate the applications on which you would like to actively force
  verification.

5. In the Metered Software window, click the New icon.

6. Use Create New, click the browse button (...) at the end of the Program Name
  line, and then select an application to register.

  This fills in the Product Name, Version, and other relevant fields used to
  compare against the client-executed program in real time.

7. Change the "Number of licenses" to the number you would like to run
  simultaneously, and then click to select the "Enforce the license limits for
  this product" box.

NOTE: Some programs could be renamed from what is stored in the header of their
executable file, so it may be necessary to add aliases for particular registered
applications. You can do this after the application is registered by
double-clicking the application to reopen it in the Licensed software window and
using the Aliases button to add the other possible file names.

For a more effective method of registering applications, use unlicensed
information from the Summary-&gt;Unlicensed Programs window and simply
right-click the executable file. Click Register and follow the steps listed
above for setting and enforcing the number of licenses.

To Set the Polling Interval:

When you first register programs, it takes the amount of time specified in the
polling intervals before the server updates its local cache. When the server
updates its local cache, the license verification will then be enforced on the
client. You can configure the polling intervals by navigating to this location:

  Systems Management Server\Site Database (site code - site name)\Site
  Hierarchy\site code - site name\Site Settings\Component
  Configuration\Software Metering

From there, click the Local tab, and then configure the Site management schedule.
The default is every one hour.
