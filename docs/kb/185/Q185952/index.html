SUMMARY
=======

Traditionally, all user account database changes are made on the primary domain
controller (PDC), and then replicated to each of the backup domain controllers
(BDC). There are a few instances when the flow of information is reversed. A few
domain activities are actually triggered by a BDC that sends the change to the
PDC. After the PDC has the new information, usual Netlogon replication
distributes the change to each of the BDCs at an interval specified by the
Netlogon Pulse parameter. The default is five minutes. Below are some of these
examples.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Account Lockout
---------------

Each BDC maintains a bad logon counter, and, when reached, this information is
sent to the PDC. After replicated to the remaining BDCs, the account is locked
out on the whole domain.

In theory, this may potentially give a user a window of bad logon attempts that
may exceed the account lockout counter. This theoretical limit is ((number of
bad logon attempts) x (number of domain controllers)). In actuality, this is
very unlikely. Domain validation is usually handled by the nearest domain
controller, and it is also this domain controller that would continue to respond
to the bad logon requests. Also, this theoretical window is the amount of time
between normal domain synchronization, which, by default, is five minutes.

Trust Account Password Changes
------------------------------

Every seven days, the PDC of the trusting domain changes the password used for
pass-through authentication with the trusted domain. This password change is
sent to the domain controller in the trusted domain that has a secure channel
established with the PDC in the trusting domain. The trusting PDC sends an
I_NetServerPasswordSet RPC call to the DC of the trusted domain asking it to
change the password. If this DC is not the PDC, the BDC sends the password
change to its PDC. At the next replication interval, all domain controllers in
the trusted domain will have the new password. If there are many BDCs in the
trusted domain, and the PDC of the trusting domain is closer to these than it is
to the PDC in the trusted domain, it is more likely that the secure channel will
be between the PDC in the trusting domain and a BDC in the trusted domain.
