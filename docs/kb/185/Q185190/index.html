-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you run a macro to find or replace a character
formatted with a decorative font such as one formatted with a Wingdings
character, nothing happens.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the macro was created in an earlier version of Word
(Microsoft Word version 6.0 or Microsoft Word 7.0 for Windows 95) and if that
macro uses the Asc function. In Word 97, this function returns the same ANSC
(ANSI) or ACSII character code for all special characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To find and replace Symbol or special characters (characters from fonts not
based on the ANSI or ASCII character set), use the FindSymbol macro, which is
supplied with Word in the Macros8.dot template. Word Setup places this template
in the macros folder of the Office program folder.

To use the FindSymbol macro to find symbol or special characters in the current
document, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Template.

2. Select Macros8.dot, which is located in the &lt;Word&gt;\Macros directory,
  and click OK.

  Where &lt;word&gt; is the directory in which your Word program files are
  located.

3. On the Tools menu, click Macro.

4. Select All Active Templates or Macros8.dot in the Macros Available In list.

5. In the Macro Name box, select FindSymbol, and then click Run.

  a. In the Find And Replace Symbols dialog box, click Find What to select the
     symbol you want to find.

  b. If you want to replace the Find What character with another symbol, select
     the Replace With option and then click Replace With to select the
     replacement symbol.

  -or-

     If you want to replace the Find What character with regular text, select
     the Text option and type the replacement text in the Text box.

following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Asc function is used to return an integer representing the ANSI value of a
Symbol character in a macro. When this function is used in Microsoft Word 97, it
returns the same value (40 or 63 depending on the method you use to insert the
character into your document) for all the decorative font characters.

You can use the following macro to return the ANSI code for a Wingdings
character:

     Sub ShowANSI()
        'Returns a message box with the ANSI value of the selected character.
        MsgBox Str(Asc(Selection.Range))
     End Sub

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q173707 OFF97: How to Run Sample Code from Knowledge Base Articles

ANSI Value of 40
----------------

If you insert a Windgings font from the Symbol dialog box, the ANSI value for
that character is always 40.

To insert the Wingdings font from the Symbol dialog box, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Symbol and then click the Symbol tab.

2. In the Font list, select Wingdings.

3. Click any symbol, click Insert, and then click Close.

If you select the inserted character and run the ShowANSI macro, Word displays a
message box on the screen with the value 40. If you repeat steps 1-3 and insert
a different Winding character, the value will remain 40.

ANSI Value of 63
----------------

The ANSI character for a Wingdings character is always 63 if you insert the
character by doing any of the following:

- Use the Character Map

- Use a keystroke (such as ALT+0245)

- Manually change the character font (using the Font list or dialog box)

To see an example of this, follow these steps:

1. In blank document, click the drop-down arrow in the Font box, and select the
  Wingdings font.

2. Press the "K" key.

  A fancy ampersand is added to your document.

3. Select the character and run the macro.

The ANSI value returned is 63.
