IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Red Button security fix that was posted to Microsoft's FTP
site, Account Operators are no longer able to administer domain accounts. When
you attempt to access User Manager for Domains from any computer other than the
primary domain controller (PDC), you get the following error message:

  Access Denied. Do you want to select another domain to administer?

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix corrected the issue of users without administrative privileges being
able to access the registry.

The hotfix consisted of the executable Secfix_i.exe for Intel-based computers,
and Secfix-a.exe for Alpha computers. The fix is installed by double-clicking
the executable file. The installation created an $NtUninstallSecurityFix$
directory that contained the following files:

  Lsasrv.dll
  Msv1_0.dll
  Netui1.dll
  Netui2.dll
  Srv.sys
  Srvsvc
  Uninst.inf

Although this directory was created, there is no way to uninstall the hotfix.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To restore the Accounts Operator's ability to manage domain accounts from
machines other than the PDC, give Read privileges to the following registry key
on the PDC:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers
\winreg

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

This problem is also corrected by installing Service Pack 3.
