-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a computer running Windows NT Workstation or Server, you
receive an error concerning the loading or use of a profile. These occur for
local, roaming, and mandatory profiles.

In viewing the corresponding Event Viewer Application Log, there are event ID
1000 errors:

  Event ID:   1000
  Source:     Userenv
  Type:       Error
  Category:   None

Description: The description will be one of the following, where %s is the
affected username, and %d is the system error.

- The operating system was unable to load your profile. Please contact your
  Network Administrator. (%d)

- You do not have permission to access your central profile located at %s. The
  operating system is attempting to log you on with your local profile. Please
  contact your Network Administrator.

- The operating system was unable to create a profile directory %s. Another
  file exists with the same name. You will be logged on with a local profile
  only. Please contact your Network Administrator.

- The operating system was unable to create profile directory %s. You will be
  logged on with a local profile only. Please contact your Network
  Administrator. (%d)

- Your roaming profile is not available. You will be logged on with the locally
  stored profile. (%d)

- The operating system was unable to create a temporary profile directory %s.
  Please contact your Network Administrator. (%d)

- The operating system was unable to load the locally stored profile. A new
  local profile will be created. (%d)

- The operating system was unable to set security on your registry. Please
  contact your Network Administrator. (%d)

- The update of your roaming profile failed. Please contact your Network
  Administrator. (%d)

- Your profile was not successfully loaded, but you have been logged on with
  the default system profile. Please correct the problem and log off. (%d)

- Your roaming profile is not available, the operating system is attempting to
  log you on with your local profile. (%d)

- Your roaming mandatory profile is not available, the operating system is
  attempting to log you on with your local profile. (%d)

- The operating system is unable to log you on because your roaming mandatory
  profile is not available. Please contact your Network Administrator. (%d)

- This computer is in manual policy mode, but the policy file can not be found.
  You will be logged on without policy. (%d)

- RegLoadKey failed with error %d for %s

CAUSE
=====

This problem has several common causes. The following are the most relevant
causal scenarios.

- Permissions on the local %system root%\Profiles have been modified. The
  EVERYONE group needs Full Control to load the profile.

- Lack of resources. If the system partition is low on space, or the registry
  size limit has been exceeded, the profile can fail to load.

- The profile is corrupted. Either the local Ntuser.dat (or .man) or the
  roaming copy of Ntuser.dat is corrupted. When this occurs, there is usually
  an event indicating a RegLoadKey failure.

For more information on configuring and manipulating profiles, please consult the
Windows NT 4.0 profiles and policies white paper available from the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/management/deployment/planguide/prof_policies.asp

NOTE: Uusers on NT 4.0 Workstation may experience the following error:

  Your profile was not successfully loaded, but you have been logged on with
  the default system profile. Please correct the problem and log off.

The apparent cause was a missing folder: \Winnt\Profiles\Default User. To fix,
replace entire folder with one from another workstation.
