SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to manually remove a program created by the Windows
CE Toolkit for Visual Basic (VBCE) or eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB) from Windows
CE device. To uninstall a VBCE/eVB program, you must remove the files generated
by the Application Manager, remove any controls registered by the program, and
delete whatever files and folders were added during the installation process,
while avoiding the removal of components or files that are shared by other
applications.

A VBCE/eVB program consists of the following parts:

- The .vb file for the application.

- The VBCE/eVB run-time files:

  
   - pvbform2.dll
   - pvbhost2.dll
   - pvbload.exe
   - vbscript.dll
   - vbsen.dll (for Windows CE 2.11-based platforms only)

- Any .dll, data or other associated files added for the application.

VBCE programs are usually installed and uninstalled by the CE Services
Application Manager. If, for some reason, the Application Manager fails to
completely install or remove the program, you may manually remove it by removing
all of its files and registry settings.

Cleaning Up Application Manager Files
-------------------------------------

The Application Manager does the following when installing a program:

- Copies the CAB file to Windows\AppMgr\Install.

- Decompresses and copies the files.

- Creates folders as needed.

- Puts DAT and DLL files in Windows\AppMgr.

- Puts files in the application folder.

- Puts files in the Windows folder (no other folders usually needed).

- Registers controls.

- Creates an Unload file.

- Writes uninstall registry entries.

- Deletes the CAB file from Windows\AppMgr\Install

Using Pocket Word (PWD), you may look at the .unload or .dat files for clues on
what was added during the install process. In most cases, the Application
Install Wizard instructs the Application Manager to use file names of the form
"CompanyName AppName."

NOTE: The .dat and .unload files are not in Pocket Word or pure text format. Do
not modify the files if they are to be used later.

1. If it exists, delete the CAB file for the application. If the Application
  Manager runs of out room while copying the CAB file, the device may drop the
  connection to the desktop and exhibit other strange behavior because it is
  out of working room. To recover, allocate some application memory for storage
  using the Memory tab under the System icon in the Control Panel (reset the
  device if needed), and delete the CAB file from the \Windows\AppMgr\Install
  folder.

2. If they exist, delete the .dll and .dat file for the application from the
  \Windows\AppMgr folder.

3. Delete the program's .lnk file from the \Windows\Programs folder. This will
  remove the program from the Start menu. On PocketPC devices, the shortcut
  file will be located in the \Windows\Start Menu\Programs folder.

4. Delete the application's program folder. Application files are usually stored
  in a folder called \Program Files\[appname] where [appname] is the name of
  the application (as specified in Step 7 of the Application Install Wizard).

5. Delete the other files (except .dll files) that were installed in the Windows
  folder.

  NOTE: If you are unsure whether another application requires the file, it is
  safer not to delete it.

Cleaning Up Registry Entries
----------------------------

Because many Windows CE devices do not ship with a registry editor, you must use
a third-party program, the Remote Registry Editor shipped with VBCE/eVB, or the
Control Manager to manually change registry settings.

1. Unregister installed .dll files that are not shared by other applications. If
  you are unsure whether a .dll is shared, it is safer to leave it. To
  unregister a control run the following:

  RegSvr.Exe /u \windows\[controlname]

  Where [controlname] is the name of a control such as MSCEFile.dll. You can use
  the Windows CE Control Manager to automatically run RegSvr /u on the device
  in an attempt to remove controls.

2. Due to a bug in RegSvr.exe, controls may not be completely unregistered and
  may still show as installed in the Control Manager.

  WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious
  problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
  cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry
  Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  The registry holds control information in three places: ProgId, CLSID, and
  TypeLib.

  NOTE: Deleting the CLSID information (in HKey_Classes_Root\CLSID\&lt;key&gt;)
  is required to ensure the control is unregistered. Removing the ProgId and
  TypeLib information is not required. Partially uninstalled controls are safe
  to leave on your system, but will not function properly.

  For example, identify the registry entries for the MSCEFile.dll. The File
  control actually has two classes: File and File System. This example focuses
  only on the File class.

  a. ProgIds are listed in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FILECTL.FileSystem
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FILECTL.FileSystem.1
        (In the Clsid subfolder will be the matching Clsid:
           {3F0C2794-5C3A-11D1-A717-00AA0044064C}  )

        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FILECTL.File
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FILECTL.File.1
        (Clsid={25C953B5-5464-11D1-A714-00AA0044064C})

  b. CLSID information is listed in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\&lt;clsid&gt;. Use
     the CLSID found in step A above to locate the matching entry, such as the
     following:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{25C953B5-5464-11D1-A714-00AA0044064C}

     Under this key will be numerous entries that provide additional information
     about the server, such as: Version, TypeLib, InProcServer32, and ProgId
     (useful as a cross reference).

     WARNING: DO NOT delete the parent key HKey_Classes_Root\CLSID!

     Note the TypeLib value from HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\&lt;clsid&gt;\TypeLib.
     For the File class is should be: {25C953A7-5464-11D1-A714-00AA0044064C}.

  c. TypeLib information is listed in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\&lt;clsid&gt;.
     Use the TypeLib value obtained in step B above to locate the matching
     TypeLib key.

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{25C953A7-5464-11D1-A714-00AA0044064C}

  d. Now that you have found the entries for the class, you can delete the
     appropriate CLSID subkey (not the entire KEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID). Deleting
     the matching TypeLib and ProgId entries are optional.

3. You may delete the .dll file that you just unregistered. To re-register a
  control that you accidentally unregister, run the following:

  RegSvr.Exe \windows\[controlname]

  This is not possible if you delete the control.

4. Also in the registry are entries for the Start menu:

  HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Apps\&lt;TOKEN&gt;application name&lt;/TOKEN&gt;

  This key can be deleted if desired.

Deleting the Visual Basic Run Time
----------------------------------

If no other VBCE/eVB programs are installed on the Windows CE device, it might be
possible to remove the following files:

- pvbdecl.dll

- pvbform2.dll

- pvbhost2.dll

- pvbload.exe

- vbscript.dll

- vbsen.dll

On some devices, these files may be in ROM, making it impossible to delete them.

WARNING: These files are required to run Visual Basic programs on Windows CE. If
they are deleted, you cannot run other programs created by the Toolkit until
they are restored. Please use caution when removing them.

Follow the steps in this article to remove a VBCE/eVB program from the Windows CE
device. The steps do not remove the installation program from the desktop.

NOTE: Development machines may still contain other files used by the remote tools
and the debugger.
