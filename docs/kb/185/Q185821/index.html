SUMMARY
=======

When you insert values into a table with an identity column, SQL Server
automatically generates the next identifier based on the last used identity
value. You might want to retrieve this automatically generated identity value
immediately after an insert.

The Ident.exe sample demonstrates how to retrieve the automatic @@IDENTITY value
from an insert into a Microsoft SQL Server database. The sample consists of a
simple MFC AppWizard project based on the CRecordset class. The project was
modified slightly to allow inserts into the table and to retrieve the
automatically generated identity value for the insert. It uses the pubs data
source name (DSN), although any DSN will work, and a table called tblIdentity.

Ident.exe includes an algorithm and sample code that illustrate how to retrieve
the identity value from a SQL Server database. You can use this method for
multiple processes or threads doing simultaneous inserts into the same table.
(Note that threads cannot share connections.)

Project Description
-------------------

A master identity table, called tblIdentity, is created. It consists of the
identity, table name, and server process ID number (SPID). An insert trigger
into tblIdentity is created for each table in the database that satisfies the
following criteria:

- Inserts are performed on the table.

- The table has an identity column with values that are automatically generated
  by SQL Server.

- The automatically generated identity value is needed immediately after the
  insertion.

The following SQL script, located in the Master.sql file, generates the sample
table, insertTbl:

     CREATE TABLE insertTbl (myAuto int IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL ,
                             lname varchar (15) NOT NULL ,
                             fname varchar (15) NOT NULL )

Because names are not unique, the code uses the identity property of SQL Server
to automatically generate a unique key.

The following SQL script, located in the Master.sql file, creates an insert
trigger for insertTbl:

     CREATE TRIGGER trgAudit ON insertTbl FOR INSERT
        AS
        INSERT INTO tblIdentity VALUES (@@IDENTITY, 'insertTbl', @@SPID)

Immediately after an insertion into tblIdentity, the trigger fires and stores:

- the identity SQL Server generated (@@IDENTITY),

- the table name ("insertTbl" in this case), and

- the SPID (the server process ID number of the current process, guaranteed to
  be unique for each connection).

After insertion, the program calls a stored procedure (called sp_getID) to
retrieve the identity value.

The code calls the stored procedure sp_getID (with a negative value for the spid
parameter) in the one time initialization to get the SPID (the server process ID
number of the current process, guaranteed to be unique for each connection).
Applications with multiple threads inserting into the same table must not share
a connection. Each thread must have it's own connection to guarantee a unique
SPID.

NOTE: Applications with multiple threads sharing a connection must use a more
complicated algorithm that includes the thread ID and the SPID to establish a
unique insertion.

After each insertion, the program calls sp_getID and passes the table name where
the insert occurred and the SPID that was retrieved in the initial call to
sp_getID. The stored procedure sp_getID returns the unique identity value that
SQL Server generated on the insert.

Running the Sample
------------------

To use the sample application, run the Master.sql file in the SQL Query Tool from
SQL Enterprise Manager. After running the script, you can verify that the tables
and triggers were created successfully by running the following SQL statement:

     insert into insertTbl (lname,fname) VALUES ('Smith','Joe')
     select * from tblIdentity

The Results tab should look similar to the following:

  iID         strTable        SPID
  ----------- --------------- -----------
  5           insertTbl       11

  (1 row(s) affected)

The iID and SPID values you see will probably not be 5 and 11. The tblIdentity
values verify that the Master.sql script was successful.

NOTE: The sample code uses a sub-optimal method to display the identity value and
is used for illustration purposes only.

The sample uses the SQLExecDirect function to run the stored procedure and
retrieve the identity value.
