REGISTRY ENTRIES NOT INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEM POLICY EDITOR:

The following section describes the locations and values for useful registry
entries that are available in the operating system, but not available in the
System Policy Editor.

Autorun:
Category: Windows NT Shell

connected to the system. When Autorun is enabled, media is started automatically
when it is inserted in the drive. This value is comprised of 32 bits. The lower
26 bits each represent a drive, with the lowest (right- most) bit representing
drive A and the 26th bit from the right representing drive Z. If a bit is set to
0, the autorun feature is enabled on that drive. If a bit is set to 1, the
autorun feature is disabled on that drive.

on drive D. Note that a value of 1 in the bit representing the CD- ROM drive
takes precedence over the value of Autorun.
