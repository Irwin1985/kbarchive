SUMMARY
=======

When using the Internet Mail Service (Internet Mail Connector in version 4.0) as
an SMTP gateway to connect to a VAX mail System, specifically a VAX system using
Innosoft's PMDF as an SMTP gateway, do not specify character set by domain. Use
the default, which is Western European (ISO-8859-1). If the Character Set
translation is set by domain (accessed by the E-mail domain button on the
Internet Mail tab), the inbound mail is processed into the Archive queue by the
Internet Mail Service, because the character set is incorrect.

Using the default Western European (ISO-8859-1) will result in '=20' being
appended to various messages depending on the original format. Specifically
messages including tabs, or replies and forwarded messages sent to the non- MIME
VAX user agent.

The PMDF supports MIME and is ISO 8859-1 compliant. However the VAX user agent
(client) must also support MIME. Because the PMDF supports X.400, setting up
Exchange Server to use an X.400 connector between the VAX mail system is the
preferred method. Older versions of PMDF are not supported by Innosoft
International, Inc., which means that an upgrade to a later version of PMDF is
required before migrating to Microsoft Exchange Server.

Contact Innosoft to verify whether the PMDF and VAX User agent versions used are
still supported. Innosoft also provides a MIME- enabled client with the PMDF,
but some companies do not implement it because of training issues.


The only configuration that is supported by Innosoft, is using its X400 module
with the Exchange Server X.400 Connector. Using the Internet Mail Service as an
SMTP Gateway to the PMDF VAX Gateway is not recommended.

PMDF is manufactured by Innosoft International, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
