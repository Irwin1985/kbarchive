SUMMARY
=======

By setting the SeDebugPrivilege privilege on the running process, you can obtain
the process handle of any running application. When obtaining the handle to a
process, you can then specify the PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS flag, which will allow the
calling of various Win32 APIs upon that process handle, which you normally could
not do. Some of the Win32 APIs that could be successfully called include the
following:

- TerminateProcess

- CreateRemoteThread

This article contains an in-depth example on how you can set the SeDebugPrivilege
upon your application process token, and use that to terminate another
application. This is an advanced topic, and a strong knowledge of process
security is highly recommended.

The discussion of what Process Access, Process Tokens, and Token Privileges are
not covered within the scope of this article. This article assumes that the
reader already understands these advanced topics.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This sample involves creating three separate Visual Basic applications. Each
application will be built one at a time and then used together to demonstrate
the power of the SeDebugPrivilege process privilege.

Application #1 (Term01.exe)
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Change the project name to Term01.

3. Rename Form1 to frmTerm01.

4. Add a Command Button to frmTerm01.

5. Set the caption for Command1 to "Terminate Notepad."

6. Add the following code to frmTerm01:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Command1_Click()

           ' This is a simple application that attempts
           ' to shut down any process that is passed in through
           ' the command line.

           Call TerminateProcess(CLng(Command$), 0)

        End Sub

7. Add a standard Module to the project, and rename it to MdlApi01.

8. Add the following code to MdlApi01:

        Option Explicit

        Declare Function TerminateProcess Lib "kernel32" _
           (ByVal hProcess As Long, _
           ByVal uExitCode As Long) As Long

9. Save the project and make the exe file (Term01.exe).

Application #2 (Term02.exe)
---------------------------

1. Create a new standard EXE in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Change the project name to Term02.

3. Rename Form1 to frmTerm02.

4. Add a Command Button to frmTerm02.

5. Set the caption for Command1 to "Terminate Notepad."

6. Add a list box to frmTerm02.

7. Set the width of ListBox1 to 3735.

8. Add the following code to frmTerm02:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()

           ' The PID of the application you want to kill will be received
           ' through the command line. Convert it to a long so it can be
           ' used with the various API calls.

           SeDebugSample CLng(Command$)

        End Sub

9. Add a standard Module to the project, and rename it to mdlAPI02.

10. Add the following code to the module mdlApi02:

        Option Explicit

        ' Constants used for various API calls. Refer to MSDN for detailed
        ' information about what these constants mean.

           End If

        End Function

11. Save the project to the same directory as the Term01 project, and make the
  .exe file (Term02.exe).

Application #3 (MainTest.exe)
-----------------------------

1. Create a new standard EXE project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. Rename the project to MainTest.

3. Rename Form1 To frmTest.

4. Add three Command Buttons to the form.

5. Set the caption for Command1 to "Start Notepad."

6. Set the caption for Command2 to "Start Term01."

7. Set the caption for Command3 to "Start Term02."

8. Add the following code to frmTest:

        Option Explicit

        ' You want to keep the process ID of the NotePad instance
        ' that you create
        Private iAppPID As Long

        Private Sub Command1_Click()

           ' Create an instance of the NotePad.exe application.
           iAppPID = Shell("Notepad.exe", vbNormalFocus)

        End Sub

        Private Sub Command2_Click()

           ' You will try to terminate the NotePad application by another
           ' application, which is running in its own process space.
           ' This will FAIL.

           Call Shell(App.Path &amp; "\Term01.Exe " &amp; iAppPID, vbNormalFocus)

        End Sub

        Private Sub Command3_Click()

           ' You will try to terminate the NotePad application by another
           ' application, which is running in its own process space.
           ' However, this application is going to use the SeDebugPrivilege,
           ' and will be able to terminate the application without a fuss.

           Call Shell(App.Path &amp; "\Term02.Exe " &amp; iAppPID, vbNormalFocus)

        End Sub

9. Save the project to the same directory as the Term01 project, and make the
  .exe file (MainTest.exe).

Running the Sample
------------------

Once you have built and compiled the three applications, you can see the
demonstration in action. In the second application (Term02.exe), the code
assumes that the Notepad application (Notepad.exe) is located within the path.

1. Run the MainTest.exe program. This will be our "control pad" for the
  demonstration.

2. Click the Start Notepad button. This will launch Notepad.

3. Click the Start Term01 button. This will launch the Term01 application.

4. Click the Terminate Notepad Button on the Term01 application. It is intended
  to shut down Notepad, but does not succeed.

5. Close the Term01 application.

6. Click the Start Term02 button on the MainTest application. This will launch
  the Term02 application.

7. Click the Terminate Notepad button on the Term02 application. This will start
  the SeDebugPrivilege demonstration, which will result in Notepad being
  terminated. The list box provides visual feedback to what is going on in the
  process.
