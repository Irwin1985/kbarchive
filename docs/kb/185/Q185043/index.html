SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to re-home public folders to a particular Exchange
Server computer, using the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator program.

In some situations, public folders may be accidentally re-homed to another site,
and this article should help in recovering from such a situation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 has a number of new features designed to help with
public folder re-homing situations. The Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Administrator
program can re-home individual public folders to any server that contains a
replica of the public folder. All subfolders of the public folder can then be
automatically re-homed as well.

In order to re-home public folders using the Administrator program, you must be
running the Exchange 5.5 Administrator program against an Exchange Server 5.5
computer. Also, this procedure assumes that you want the entire public folder
sub-tree re-homed to the Exchange Server 5.5 computer.

The steps below assume that all the public folders were initially homed in the
site ORIGINAL_SITE and have been accidentally re-homed to the site NEW_SITE. The
name of the Exchange Server 5.5 computer in ORIGINAL_SITE is SRVPF55. All
folders under a folder called "NorthAmerica" need to be re- homed back to
ORIGINAL_SITE, and it's okay to have a replica of these folders on server
SRVPF55.

1. If an Exchange Server 5.5 computer does not exist in site ORIGINAL_SITE, add
  a new 5.5 server to the site, or upgrade an existing Exchange Server 4.0 or
  5.0 computer to version 5.5. Assume this 5.5 server is called SRVPF55.

2. Run the version 5.5 Microsoft Exchange Administrator program against server
  SRVPF55.

3. Get properties of the Public Information Store object. The Public Information
  Store object is found under &lt;Site&gt;\Configurations\Servers\&lt;Server
  Name&gt;

4. Go to the Instances property page of the Public Information Store properties.

5. Search for the NorthAmerica folder in the list labeled Public Folders. You
  may need to select the site NEW_SITE in the Site list. Use the Folder path to
  make sure that you have found the correct public folder.

6. After you have found the NorthAmerica folder, select it and click the Add
  button. This moves the folder to the list labeled "Folders on this
  Information Store".

7. Click OK to close the property sheet.

8. Press the F5 key to refresh the Administrator program.

9. In the Administrator program, under the organization object, click the
  Folders object to expand it. Then click Public Folder. You should see the
  Public Folder hierarchy. Traverse the hierarchy until you reach the
  NorthAmerica folder.

10. Select the NorthAmerica folder. On the File menu, select Properties. This
  brings up the properties of the folder.

11. Go to the Advanced property page of the folder properties.

12. From the "Home server" list, select SRVPF55.

13. Click OK to close the property sheet. This re-homes the NorthAmerica folder
  to the server SRVPF55.

14. Wait for about a minute.

15. Press F5 in the Administrator program to refresh the data displayed.

16. In the public folder hierarchy, select the NorthAmerica folder. On the File
  menu, select Properties to bring up the properties of the folder.

17. Go to the Replicas page of the folder properties.

18. Check the list on the right labeled "Replicate folders to". This list should
  include SRVPF55. Remove from this list any servers that you do not want all
  of the subfolders of the NorthAmerica folder replicated to.

19. After you have verified the replica list, go to the General page of the
  folder properties.

20. Select the setting labeled "Propagate these properties to all subfolders".
  (If this setting is not visible, either you are not using an Exchange 5.5
  Administrator program, or the folder whose properties you have obtained does
  not have any subfolders.)

21. Click OK. This brings up a dialog box titled "Subfolder Properties". Clear
  all options except Replicas.

22. After selecting only the Replicas option, click OK. This starts a process to
  automatically modify the replica list of all subfolders of the NorthAmerica
  folder, with the replica list of the NorthAmerica folder. This results in a
  replica of all subfolders being added to the SRVPF55 server. This process
  may take up to several hours, depending on the number of subfolders. After
  this process is completed, all the data in the public folders whose replicas
  were added will start being replicated to the SRVPF55 server. This is an
  important point if the only other replicas of the public folders are on
  servers across slow links. This process may cause very high network
  utilization on these slow links.

23. After the process has completed, refresh the Administrator program by
  pressing the F5 key.

24. Get permissions of the NorthAmerica folder again.

25. On the General page, select the setting labeled "Propagate these properties
  to all subfolders".

26. Click OK. This brings up the Subfolder Properties dialog box. Clear all
  options except Home Server.

27. Click OK. This starts a process to re-home all the subfolders of the
  NorthAmerica folder to the SRVPF55 server.

After this process has completed, all the subfolders will be re-homed to server
SRVPF55. If the public folder permissions were lost during the accidental
re-homing, this process does not restore the permissions.

NOTE: The contents of all the subfolders will be replicated to the server
SRVPF55. This may affect network utilization.

NOTE: In order for you to perform the above steps, both the Administrator program
and the server against which the Administrator program is running must be
version 5.5.

The server on which the public folders have been accidentally re-homed does NOT
have to be running version 5.5.

Advantages of using an Exchange Server 5.5 computer to re-home folders
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the Exchange 5.5 Administrator program in conjunction with an Exchange
Server 5.5 computer has the following advantages over other methods, such as
using PFADMIN.EXE, to re-home public folders:

- The amount of work needed to re-home entire public folder trees is greatly
  reduced.

- All the work is done on the original site and there is no need to access the
  server on which the folders were accidentally re-homed. This may be useful if
  the server where the folders are re-homed is across a slow WAN link.

- There is no need to add replicas of all folders to the server where the
  folders are re-homed. This eliminates the replication of the contents of all
  the public folders across a possibly slow network link.

Considering these advantages--if an Exchange Server 5.5 computer is not available
in the original site, it may be useful to install one in the site if you need to
re-home public folders.
