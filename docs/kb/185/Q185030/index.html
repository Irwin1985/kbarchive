The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes what DOCS Open(R) from PC DOCS, Inc. is and how Microsoft
Word 97 for Windows integrates with DOCS Open.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DOCS Open is a document management solution that enables you to control,
organize, access, and share information. Word processing documents,
spreadsheets, presentations, forms, images, e-mail messages, or any type of file
you want to save can be managed through DOCS Open.

DOCS Open is an open architecture, working in virtually any computer environment
to manage network-based information across a variety of applications, platforms,
databases and networks. DOCS Open creates a document profile for each document
you create. To retrieve a document, you select a search that locates the
document profiles that you or someone else has created.

How DOCS Open Works
-------------------

A Document Profile is associated with every DOCS Open document that you create.
The Document Profile form is analogous to a library catalog card. It contains
customizable attribute information (author, document title, client number,
project, application type, and so forth) which describes a DOCS Open document.
When you want to retrieve a document, you simply select a search that locates
the Document Profiles that were created by you or other DOCS Open users.

DOCS Open lets you search remote file servers automatically and provides you with
a host of powerful, easy-to-use search features. You can search for any words or
phrases in the text of the document or the Document Profile. Document Profiles
are stored in a DOCS Open Library.

How Word 97 Integrates with DOCS Open
-------------------------------------

As an Open Document Management (ODMA) compliant application, Word 97 searches the
Windows Registry during start-up for either of the following keys to determine
if a document management system (DMS) is installed.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\ODMA

  -or-

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\ODMA32

If DOCS Open is found as installed in this registry key, Word 97 initiates calls
(hooks) into DOCS Open using ODMA integration. As a result of this integration,
several default Word functions are either replaced or supplemented with the DOCS
Open interface. Items that are replaced are supplemented include the following
commands on the File menu:

- Open

- Close

- Save

- Save As

- Save as HTML

- Versions

- Properties

Microsoft Word 97 does not have full ODMA integration for all features. To
compensate for this, DOCS Open installs the Wordin80.dot template, usually
located in the "\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Startup" folder, which
adds four additional menu commands (through the use of macros) to Word 97 as
listed in the following table.

NOTE: The macro name that adds the menu command is listed inside the parentheses
below the menu command. For example, the macro name is shown as
(&lt;macroname&gt;).

  Menu Command Added
  (Macro Name)              Menu     Function of Menu Command
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Save With Options         File     This command provides a dialog box
  (PasswordProtectDocument)          before saving that allows you to
                                     password protect the document and
                                     also allows you to choose the file
                                     format your document should be saved
                                     in.

  DOCS Open Footer          Insert   This command adds a footer to the
  (Footer)                           current document based on the values
                                     stored in a profile.

  DOCS Open Mail Merge      Tools    Microsoft Word 97 does not provide
  (PCDOCSMailMerge)                  ODMA integration for a mail merge.
                                     DOCS Open provides macro integration
                                     for using the mail merge feature in
                                     Word 97.

  About DOCS Open           Help     This command displays which version
  (AboutPCDOCS)                      of DOCS Open you are using.

Additionally, DOCS Open modifies the functionality of three other native Word
menu commands. These Word menu commands are modified by a macro with the same
name as the built-in Word command.

NOTE: If you rename these macros, the DOCS Open menu command functionality will
be disabled and the normal Word menu command functionality will return. The
macro name is listed inside the parentheses below the menu command. For example,
the macro name is shown as (macroname).

  Command Modified
  (Macro Name)          Menu               Function of Menu Command
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  File                  Insert             Brings up the DOCS Open Quick
  (InsertFile)                             Retrieve dialog box.

  From File             Point to           Brings up the DOCS Open Quick
  (InsertPicture)       Picture on the     Retrieve dialog box.
                        Insert menu

  Highlight Changes     Point to Track     This menu command was
  (ToolsRevisions)      Changes on the     mistakenly included in the
                        Tools menu         DOCSOpen Wordin80.dot template.
                                           The modified menu command
                                           displays the old Word 95 for
                                           Windows Revisions dialog box.

Several other macros are included in the DOCS Open Wordin80.dot template. These
macros are either not used or have no effect on Word 97.

  ExitWord
  FileSaveAsPassword
  PCDOCS

During the installation and integration of DOCS Open, one of the following keys
is written into the Windows Registry:

  16-bit version:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\ODMA\PCDOCS

  32-bit version:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\ODMA32\PCDOCS

NOTE: This is the registry key that informs ODMA-compliant applications that DOCS
Open is installed on the computer. If the key is removed from the Windows
Registry, DOCS Open ODMA integration with Word 97 will be disabled.

---------------------

Search and retrieval capabilities as well as version control and security provide
you with access to documents. Additionally, DOCS Open provides system
administration features such as storage management for document archival and
document activity tracking. These features are detailed in the following table.
