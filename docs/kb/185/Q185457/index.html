-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange information store service shuts down. In the Windows NT
application event log, the following event is logged:

  Event ID:1112
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Description:  The database has reached the maximum allowed size.
  Attempting to stop the Microsoft Exchange Information Store.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange information store utilizes the Exchange database engine.
The maximum allowed size of a single database in Exchange versions 4.0 and 5.0
is 16 GB (Priv.edb can be 16 GB and Pub.edb can be 16 GB). After the limit is
reached, the Exchange database engine stops taking transactions and notifies the
information store to shut down.

NOTE: Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Enterprise Edition information store
databases are not limited to 16 GB; they are limited only by available hardware.

WORKAROUND
==========

The database (Priv.edb or Pub.edb) that has hit the 16-GB limit must be
decreased so that the affected process can be started and remain started.

First, the affected database must be defragmented to reclaim any free space. This
can be accomplished by doing the following:

1. Defragment the database. To do so, run the following command:

  "edbutil /d /ispriv" (without the quotation marks)

  -OR-

  "edbutil /d /ispub" (without the quotation marks)

  NOTE: If you are using the 5.5 version of Microsoft Exchange Server, run the
  following command:

  "eseutil /d /ispriv" (without the quotation marks)

  -OR-

  "eseutil /d /ispub" (without the quotation marks)

2. Start the information store service, let it run for a couple of minutes, and
  then stop the service gracefully. (This is done to make sure all uncommitted
  transactions are flushed into the database; see the "More Information"
  section later in this article for details.)

3. After the process is back up and running, perform a FULL online backup.

  -OR-

  After the process is back up and running, stop the information store service
  and perform an offline backup of the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directory.

Defragmenting the database should result in a decrease in size of the database;
however, it is possible that the database will still be very close to the 16-GB
limit. Therefore, steps must be taken to decrease the amount of information in
that database. This can be accomplished by either moving some users from this
server to another server with more free space, or implementing personal
information store (PSTs) for users and having them move mail into PSTs. The
Mailbox Resources tab in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program can assist
the system administrator in finding the largest mailboxes.

It is a good idea to implement storage limits on user mailboxes in the private
information store. Storage limits can be configured through the Exchange
Administrator program and will help prevent from the database reaching the 16-GB
limit.

For more information about use of personal folders and storage limits, see the
online documentation.

NOTE: If users are moved to another server, the information store should be
defragmented again by running "edbutil /d /ispriv" (without the quotation marks)
or "edbutil /d /ispub" (without the quotation marks) so as to reclaim the space
used by the users who were moved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Exchange database is committing a transaction from a log file and that
transaction, if committed, will make the database surpass the 16-GB limit, the
Exchange database engine takes the following steps:

1. The transaction is wholly rolled back, meaning that no part of the
  transaction succeeds, and the checkpoint holds a pointer to this transaction
  in the log file where it was contained.

2. The Exchange database engine alerts the information store that the 16-GB
  limit has been reached.

3. The information store then performs a graceful shutdown of the service.

After the database size has been decreased and the service is restarted, the
transactions that were not committed because the limit was reached will be
committed. To ensure this happens, do this: After the information store is
restarted following the defragmentation, stop the service again. This causes all
the log files to be committed into the database.

If you are using Exchange Server 5.5 Standard Edition and plan to upgrade to
Exchange Server 5.5 Enterprise Edition with unlimited storage, you do not need
to defragment the database. Run Setup.exe from the Exchange Server 5.5
Enterprise CD-ROM or Srvmax.exe from the Select CD-ROM.
