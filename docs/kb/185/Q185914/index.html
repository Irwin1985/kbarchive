-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Inventory Agents, Invdos and Invwin32, do not
record the NetCardID information (Sms.ini, [Local]) in the same format.

Invdos records the media access control address using a set of lowercase letters
and digits whereas Invwin32 reports the media access control address with a set
of uppercase letters and digits.

When a 16-bit client and a 32-bit client are installed on the same computer,
Systems Management Server Database Manager (Dbclean) cannot report it as a
duplicate computer because the NetCardID case is different for each client
(lowercase for 16-bit versus uppercase for 32-bit).

NOTE: For clients with dual-boot systems, you must choose one of the operating
systems on which to run the Systems Management Server client. Systems Management
Server does not support its installation on both operating systems even though
it would allow the user to switch back and forth repeatedly. This is because
Systems Management Server must know which operating system is run by each client
computer, so that the correct jobs can be sent to each client. If Systems
Management Server is installed on a computer with a dual-boot configuration and
you want to change which operating system is supported by Systems Management
Server, run the Upgrade.bat file on the operating system you want to switch to.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
