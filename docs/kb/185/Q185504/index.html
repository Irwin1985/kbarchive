-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

The Dxadata folder cannot be moved to a different location unless you reinstall
Microsoft Exchange Server. If the Dxadata folder and the Bin folder are not
located under the same parent folder, directory synchronization (dirsync) cannot
be performed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recognizes the need for people to move the Dxadata folder to a
different location after installing Exchange Server. We have modified the
directory synchronization components in Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 so
that the Dxadata folder and the Bin folder do not have to be located under the
same parent folder.


This supported feature is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems having a specific need for it. Unless you
are severely impacted by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this feature. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


We have also modified the directory synchronization components in Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5 so that the Dxadata folder and the Bin folder do not
have to be located under the same parent folder.

This feature is included in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 U.S.
Service Pack. For information about obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


To move the Dxadata folder to a different location after you obtain this feature,
use the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Stop the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service. To do so,
  follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  b. Click the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service, click
     Stop, and then click Yes.

  c. Click Close.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Locate the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDX

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

     Value name: DXADataPath
     Value type: REG_SZ
     Value data: &lt;path&gt;


  where &lt;path&gt; is the full path to the dirsync database files that are
  normally located in the Exchsrvr\Dxadata folder. Note that the new folder
  does not need to be named Dxadata.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. Move all the files from the Dxadata folder to the new location, and then
  delete the Dxadata folder.

7. Start the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service. To do so,
  follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  b. Click the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization service, and then
     click Start.

  c. Click Close.
