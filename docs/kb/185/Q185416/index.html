Hotmail Service
---------------

1. Q. Can I use my current Web browser to gain access to my Hotmail account?

  A. You can use any Web browser to gain access to your Hotmail account. For
  best results when you read your messages, we recommend that you use a Web
  browser that supports frames.

2. Q. What are the advantages of using Hotmail?

  A. Hotmail is a free, high-quality e-mail service that lets you gain access to
  your permanent Hotmail e-mail account and up to three other Internet e-mail
  accounts from any computer with an Internet connection. The Hotmail e-mail
  client offers password protection, instant mail delivery, a personal address
  book, a spelling checker, and message filtering. Hotmail also supports file
  attachments and Web content in e-mail messages. A Hotmail address does not
  depend on your Internet service provider (ISP), geographic location, or place
  of employment. You can change your ISP or job, or move to a different
  country, and still access your Hotmail account from any Web-connected device.
  You can access your Hotmail account from a public Internet terminal or Web
  kiosk, so you do not even need to own a computer or ISP account to use
  Hotmail.

  To sign up for a Hotmail account, visit the following Hotmail Web site:

  http://www.hotmail.com

3. Q. How can Hotmail offer free e-mail service?

  A. Hotmail is advertiser-supported.

4. Q. Do many Hotmail members have more than one account?

  A. While it is not difficult to sign up for more than one Hotmail account, it
  is not practical to maintain more than one account for business use and one
  account for personal use. Only a very small fraction of Hotmail members have
  more than one Hotmail account.

5. Q. How does Hotmail protect member privacy?

  A. Both Hotmail and Microsoft have strict guidelines to protect the privacy of
  Hotmail members. Hotmail does not examine messages or screen content in
  member accounts, and it does not provide private member information to third
  parties. Hotmail uses only the demographic information it gathers about
  members to target advertisements.

6. Q. How does Hotmail protect members from abusive e-mail messages or
  unsolicited commercial e-mail messages (spam)?

  A. Hotmail has a staff dedicated to preventing abusive e-mail, chain letters,
  and spam. This staff maintains a list of known sources of abusive e-mail
  messages and spam, and blocks the delivery of all incoming e-mail messages
  from those sources. You can also use your Hotmail account's Block Sender
  feature to maintain a personal list of return addresses that you want to
  block. Hotmail members are encouraged to forward any questionable messages
  they receive to abuse@hotmail.com or support@hotmail.com.

  Hotmail is a leading advocate of anti-spam measures in the e-mail industry,
  and is actively involved in CAUCE, the Coalition Against Unsolicited
  Commercial E-mail.

7. Q. How does Hotmail discourage members from sending spam?

  A. Hotmail has a very strong No Spamming policy. If a member sends an
  excessive amount of unsolicited e-mail messages, chain letters, or abusive
  e-mail messages, Hotmail may immediately terminate their account.

  Currently, less than one half of one percent of spam messages with a Hotmail
  return address are from actual Hotmail accounts. Most spam messages with a
  Hotmail return address are sent by people who enter a false return address in
  the e-mail message. Hotmail is developing software to authenticate Hotmail
  messages and prevent people from forging Hotmail return addresses.

Microsoft's Acquisition of Hotmail
----------------------------------

1. Q. Why did Microsoft purchase Hotmail?

  A. Microsoft is committed to making it easier for people to communicate over
  the Internet from any location in the world.

  Because Hotmail already had the necessary large-scale server and messaging
  technology in place, it made more sense to buy Hotmail than to spend the time
  and resources necessary to develop similar technology.

2. Q. How does Microsoft plan to change Hotmail?

  A. Microsoft's goal is to provide consumers with the best combination of free
  and premium e-mail services by combining the benefits of Hotmail with
  Microsoft messaging technology. Hotmail continues to operate with the same
  name, user interface, Web address, and support options. Hotmail and Microsoft
  plan to work together to expand the Hotmail e-mail service and quickly
  introduce new Hotmail features. Planned new Hotmail features include secure
  password authentication to allow MSN Premier members to use a Hotmail account
  to check their MSN e-mail messages from any Web browser and notification in
  MSN Program Viewer when you receive new Hotmail messages. Other planned
  changes include the integration of Microsoft and Hotmail messaging technology
  and the migration of Hotmail's mail servers to Microsoft Windows NT Server.

3. Q. If I need technical support on a Hotmail issue, do I contact Hotmail or
  Microsoft?

  A. Hotmail continues to provide technical support at the following e-mail
  address:

  support@hotmail.com

Hotmail and Microsoft Messaging
-------------------------------

1. Q. How does the Hotmail e-mail client compare to Microsoft's other messaging
  programs?

  A. Hotmail complements Microsoft's existing family of e-mail and collaboration
  clients. The Hotmail e-mail client is ideal for students and travelers, as
  well as people who do not own a computer.

  Microsoft Outlook Express is the messaging client for home and small business
  users who need both online and offline access to their Internet mail and
  newsgroup messages. Microsoft Outlook 98 is the client of choice for users
  who want to integrate Internet e-mail or other messaging services with the
  personal information management and collaboration capabilities that are
  required by many corporate users. Microsoft Exchange Server is the only
  e-mail and collaboration server to embrace Internet standards and extend rich
  messaging and communication to businesses of all sizes.

2. Q. How is Hotmail different than the Outlook Web Access (OWA) feature in
  Microsoft Exchange Server?

  A. The Hotmail client is a Web-based, Internet e-mail client that you can use
  with any Internet mail service to send and receive e-mail messages. OWA is a
  Web-based messaging and personal information manager (PIM) client that can
  only be used with Microsoft Exchange Server.

Hotmail and MSN, The Microsoft Network
--------------------------------------

1. Q. How is Microsoft integrating Hotmail with MSN?

  A. Hotmail is an important component of The Microsoft Network of online
  communication and information services that Microsoft offers free of charge
  to all Internet users.

  Microsoft plans to add message notification for Hotmail to MSN Program Viewer
  and MSN QuickView, and Hotmail plans to add secure password authentication to
  its Web-based e-mail client so that MSN Premier members can use Hotmail to
  check their MSN e-mail from any Web browser.

2. Q. How is Microsoft integrating Hotmail with other free Microsoft or MSN
  online services?

  A. You can connect to Hotmail from the home page of a free Microsoft Web site
  by placing your pointer over Microsoft Network, and then clicking Hotmail.

  To connect to Hotmail from the home page of a free MSN Web site, click Hotmail
  in the The Microsoft Network box.

  To connect to the home page of a free Microsoft or MSN Web site from Hotmail,
  click the site you want in the The Microsoft Network box on the Hotmail home
  page.

3. Q. Does Microsoft plan to replace the current MSN Premier e-mail service with
  Hotmail?

  A. MSN does not plan to replace MSN Premier e-mail service with Hotmail.
  Microsoft's goal is to provide consumers with the best combination of free
  and premium e-mail services by combining the benefits of Hotmail with
  Microsoft services and technology.

  Hotmail provides a convenient e-mail service for free-tier MSN customers who
  do not have an MSN e-mail account as well as for MSN Premier customers who
  want a second e-mail address.

4. Q. How does Hotmail differ from MSN Premier e-mail?

  A. The following table lists the differences between the Hotmail and MSN
  Premier e-mail services.

        MSN Premier                          Hotmail
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        Uses Outlook Express                 Uses Web-based e-mail client
        Integrated login for all MSN sites   Separate login
        New mail notification                No new mail notification
        Store messages offline               Limited online message store
        Requires MSN Premier membership      Does not require MSN account

5. Q. Can I use Hotmail to gain access to my MSN Premier e-mail account?

  A. At this time, you cannot use Hotmail to gain access to your MSN Premier
  e-mail account. MSN uses secure password authentication to encrypt your POP3
  e-mail password. This currently prevents Hotmail from accessing MSN Premier
  POP accounts. Microsoft and Hotmail plan to add this feature to Hotmail.

6. Q. Are there any compatibility issues between Hotmail features and MSN
  features?

  A. Microsoft and Hotmail are currently working to resolve an issue between the
  Express Notification feature in Hotmail and the Friends Online feature in
  MSN.

7. Q. Now that MSN is offering free e-mail with Hotmail, what are the reasons
  for joining MSN Premier?

  A. In addition to the free services MSN offers to the public, MSN Premier
  members get the benefits of Internet access, exclusive MSN content,
  integrated password authentication, desktop navigation, superior e-mail,
  online community and forums, and Friends Online.
