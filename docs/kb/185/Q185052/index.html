SUMMARY
=======

The SaveAs method of the Document object in Microsoft Visual Basic for
Applications has an optional parameter called FileFormat that you can use to
specify the save format for the document.

This article describes how to use the FileFormat property of the SaveAs method to
specify a converter that is not supported with one of the supplied constants
(values).

FileFormat accepts the following built-in conversion constants:

wdFormatDocument

  Save as a Word document.

wdFormatText

  Text Only: Saves text without its formatting. Converts all section breaks,
  page breaks, and newline characters to paragraph marks. Uses the ANSI
  character set. Select this format only if the destination program cannot read
  any of the other available file formats.

wdFormatDOSText

  MS-DOS Text: Converts files the same way as Text only format (wdFormatText).
  Uses the extended ASCII character set, which is the standard for MS-DOS-based
  programs. Use this format to share documents between Word and
  non-Windows-based programs.

wdFormatTextLineBreaks

  Text only with line breaks: Saves text without formatting. Converts all line
  breaks, section breaks, and page breaks to paragraph marks. Use this format
  when you want to maintain line breaks. For example, when transferring
  documents to an electronic mail system.

wdFormatDOSTextLineBreaks

  MS-DOS text only with line breaks: Saves text without formatting. Converts
  all line breaks, section breaks, and page breaks to paragraph marks. Use this
  format when you want to maintain line breaks, for example, when transferring
  documents to an electronic mail system.

wdFormatRTF

  Rich Text Format (RTF): Saves all formatting. Converts formatting to
  instructions that other programs, including compatible Microsoft programs,
  can read and interpret.

wdFormatTemplate

  Save as a Word template.

wdFormatUnicodeText

  Saves as a Unicode text file. Converts text between common character encoding
  standards, inclucing Unicode 2.0, Mac OS, Windows, EUC and ISO-8859 series.

Other File Types
----------------

If you record a macro that saves a file as a type not supported by one of the
constants described earlier, the FileFormat property will contain a number. The
following sample macro was recorded using HTML as the Save As Type:

     Sub Macro1()
        ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:="myHTMLdoc", FileFormat:=103
     End Sub

Note the number 103 that was recorded for the HTML FileFormat argument. This
number may not be the same on another computer.

To retrieve the correct FileFormat number for a conversion type for any computer,
use the FileConverters collection. The following sample Visual Basic for
Applications macro saves a document in HTML format on any computer:

NOTE: In the following example, replace "HTML" with the class name you want to
Save As. For a list of class names, see the "Obtaining Class Names" section
later in this article.

     Sub SaveAsHTML()
        Dim fcCnv As FileConverter
        Dim strClass As String
        Dim strFileName As String

        ' If there are no documents open to
        ' save, exit this routine.
        If Documents.Count = 0 Then Exit Sub

        ' Set the ClassName to use for saving.
        strClass = "HTML"

        ' Set the FileName to use for saving.
        strFileName = "MyHTMLdoc"

        ' Loop through all installed converters.
        For Each fcCnv In FileConverters
           With fcCnv
              ' Test for conversion ClassName.
              If .ClassName = strClass Then
                 ' Save using the FileConverters.ClassName.
                 ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:=strFileName, _
                    FileFormat:=.SaveFormat
              End If
           End With
        Next fcCnv
     End Sub

For more information about the SaveFormat Property, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "SaveFormat," click Search, and then click to
view "SaveFormat Property."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q176476 Office Assistant Not Answering Visual Basic Questions

Obtaining Class Names
---------------------

The following list contains converters and class names installed by Word that you
can use for saving a document:

  Converter                                  ClassName
  ----------------------------------------------------
  HTML Document                              HTML
  MS-DOS Text with Layout                    MS-DOS Text with Layout
  Text with Layout                           Text with Layout
  Word 2.x for Windows                       MSWordWin2
  Converter: Word 4.0 for Macintosh          MSWordMac4
  Word 5.0 for Macintosh                     MSWordMac5
  Word 5.1 for Macintosh                     MSWordMac51
  WordPerfect 5.0                            WrdPrfctDOS50
  WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS                    WrdPrfctDOS51
  WordPerfect 5.x for Windows                WrdPrfctWin
  WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 Secondary File      WrdPrfctDat
  WordPerfect 5.0 Secondary File             WrdPrfctDat50
  Works 3.0 for Windows                      MSWorksWin3
  Works 4.0 for Windows                      MSWorksWin4
  Word 6.0/95                                MSWord6Exp
  Word 97 &amp; 6.0/95 - RTF                     MSWord6RTFExp

To retrieve other class names for an installed converter to Save As, you can loop
through the FileConverters collection.

The following sample macro loops through all installed converters that you can
use for saving, and then inserts the converter name and associated class name
into a blank document:

        Sub GetConvClassName()
       Dim fcCnv As FileConverter

       ' Create blank document.
       Documents.Add

       ' Loop through all installed converters.
        For Each fcCnv In FileConverters
           With fcCnv
              ' If the converter can be used to save...
              If .CanSave = True Then
                 ' Insert the converter name and class name in the document.
                 Selection.TypeText "Converter: " &amp; .FormatName &amp; vbTab _
                    &amp; "ClassName: " &amp; .ClassName &amp; vbCr
              End If
           End With
        Next fcCnv
     End Sub

For more information about the ClassName property, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "ClassName," click Search, and then click to
view "ClassName Property."
