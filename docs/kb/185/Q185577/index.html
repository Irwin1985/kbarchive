-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Information Store service in Microsoft Exchange Server may not start and the
Server Specific Error 4294966746 occurs. Events 1120 and 5000 are recorded in
the Event Log with MSExchangeIS as the source.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Information Store stops abnormally and the
Eseutil.exe hard repair option (/P) is run against the Priv.edb file to return
it to a state in which it can be started. In addition, the previous transaction
log files were deleted, as recommended in the Eseutil dialog box, but hard
repair was not run against the Pub.edb file.

At this point, the Priv.edb file is returned to a consistent state through the
repair process, but the Pub.edb file is not. A consistent database does not
require the presence of previous transaction log files to start, but an
inconsistent one does.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use either of the following solutions to resolve this behavior.

Remove Pub.edb
--------------

Remove the Pub.edb file. This removes all public folder data on the server.

IMPORTANT: If you choose to remove the Pub.edb file, rather than repair it, do
not remove the Edb.log file that was just created during the previous startup
attempt.

That failure marks the Priv.edb file as inconsistent and Priv.edb requires the
presence of its log file so that it can start successfully.

If the Edb.log file is removed, the only way to return the Priv.edb file to a
consistent state is to run the "eseutil /p" command again.

Run Eseutil /p
--------------

Run the "eseutil /p" command (without the quotation marks) against the Pub.edb
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The symptoms described in this article also occur if Pub.edb is repaired, but
Priv.edb is not.

IMPORTANT: Note that using the Eseutil's hard repair functionality is a last
resort option. Using that option may result in data loss if there is no current
backup or if circular logging is enabled, thus preventing restoration of
Exchange data to the time of failure. First try a soft recovery by using the
eseutil /r command. If this does not work, try the eseutil /p command for a hard
repair; this may be the best current alternative.

In the application event log, a series of events similar to the following
accompany this behavior:

  Event ID: 100
  Source: ESE97
  Type: Information
  Category: General
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((&lt;Process ID&gt;) ) The database engine
  &lt;version&gt; started.

  Event ID: 108
  Source: ESE97
  Type: Information
  Category: Logging/Recovery
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((&lt;Process ID&gt;) ) The database engine is
  initiating recovery steps.

  Event ID: 109
  Source: ESE97
  Type: Information
  Category: Logging/Recovery
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((&lt;Process ID&gt;) ) The database engine is
  replaying log file &lt;exchsrvr&gt;\MDBDATA\edb.log.

  Event ID: 110
  Source: ESE97
  Type: Information
  Cateogory: Logging/Recovery
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((&lt;Process ID&gt;) ) The database engine has
  successfully completed recovery steps.

  Event ID: 1120
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: General
  Description: Error Database is in inconsistent state initializing the
  Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store database.

  Event ID: 5000
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: General
  Description: Unable to initialize the Microsoft Exchange Information
  Store service. Error Database is in inconsistent state.

A Microsoft Exchange Server database is considered consistent only after it has
been shut down normally. At all other times, including during normal operation,
there is a flag in the database marking it as inconsistent. Thus if the database
service is terminated abnormally, Exchange Server knows on the next startup that
something went wrong in the previous session. Exchange then initiates "soft
recovery" steps to back out or commit necessary transactions to the database and
restore its integrity.

You can check a database for consistency with the following command:

  eseutil /mh &lt;database path and name&gt; | more

The State line in the screen output from this command may contain Consistent or
Inconsistent.

NOTE: Exchange 2000 Service Pack 2 and later, do not report the database state as
"Consistent" or "Inconsistent" but as "Clean Shutdown" or "Dirty Shutdown." The
meaning of "Clean Shutdown" is the same as "Consistent", and the meaning of
"Dirty Shutdown" is the same as "Inconsistent".
