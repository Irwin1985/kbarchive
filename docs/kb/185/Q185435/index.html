SUMMARY
=======

How to Establish AFTP Connectivity to an AS/400 or Mainframe
------------------------------------------------------------

An AFTP (APPC File Transfer Protocol) connection can be established using
Microsoft SNA Server versions 3.0 and above to an AS/400 or Mainframe running
IBM's AFTP protocol found in the APPC Applications Suite. (AFTP is a necessary
component on the Mainframe or AS/400, or there is no possibility of the
Microsoft SNA AFTP Service communicating with the AS/400 through AFTP.) The AFTP
Service allows users to use standard FTP clients or to use the AFTP client
software (included as part of the Microsoft SNA client) to transfer files back
and forth to an AS/400 or Mainframe. AFTP access to an AS/400 or Mainframe can
be established by implementation of the steps below.

Configuring the SNA AFTP Service on the SNA Server
--------------------------------------------------

1. Configure a good connection to the Mainframe or AS/400.

  NOTE: To configure a good connection to an AS/400, please refer to the
  following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for Token Ring or Ethernet
  access:

  Q112158 Configuring SNA Server to Talk to AS/400 Over 802.2

  Or if the connection is through SDLC, please see the following Microsoft
  Knowledge Base article:

  Q112159 Configuring SNA Server to Talk to AS/400 Over SDLC

  If you are connecting to a Mainframe through a 3174 gateway through 802.2,
  please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q107567 Configuring SNA Server through a 3174 Gateway via 802.2

2. At this point, the SNA Server should have a good Link Service, Connection,
  Local APPC LU, and Remote APPC LU.

3. Install the AFTP Service if it has not previously been installed. (This can
  be verified by using the Control Panel Services tool and checking to see if
  AFTP Server is in the list of services; or by typing "net start" at an MS-DOS
  command prompt, which will display all services running on the local
  computer.) If the AFTP Service has been installed, skip steps 4 and 5.

4. If the AFTP Service is not installed, click the Start button, point to
  Programs, point to SNA Server, and click Setup.

5. Click Add/Remove. Select the "SNA Server Components and Services" line, and
  click Change Option. Select the "AFTP Service" check box, and the click OK.
  Click Continue and SNA Server will install the AFTP Service and prompt you to
  restart your computer.

Configuring FTP-AFTP Access
---------------------------

If the SNA AFTP Server is going to be used as an FTP-AFTP Gateway and allowing
standard FTP clients to communicate to the Mainframe or AS/400, then perform the
following steps on the SNA AFTP Server:

1. Stop the FTP publishing service. With Windows NT Server 4.0, the service can
  be stopped from the Internet Service Manager. In previous versions of Windows
  NT Server, use the Control Panel Services tool.

2. Back up the Ftpsvc2.dll file. The native Windows NT Server FTP service will
  be replaced by an FTP service that is supplied with SNA Server. The original
  file is generally in the &lt;NTroot&gt;\System32\Inetserv directory. If you
  have customized your Windows NT Server and Microsoft Internet Information
  Server (IIS) configuration, use the Find File tool to locate the original FTP
  service.

3. Copy the Ftpsvc2.dll file supplied with SNA Server from the
  &lt;snaroot&gt;\System directory to the &lt;NTRoot&gt;\System32\Inetserv
  directory.

4. Restart the computer.

When the system is restarted, the new Ftpsvc2.dll will be used and it has the
ability to direct incoming FTP requests to the appropriate service, FTP or AFTP,
depending upon the user logon. The new ftpsvc2.dll retains all the original FTP
functionality of the previous file as well as adding in the AFTP proxy
capability.

NOTE: If you are using IIS 4.0 and encounter error 0127 when trying to start the
FTP Publishing Service, it will be necessary to obtain hotfix 10250.

Using the FTP-AFTP Proxy Gateway Service
----------------------------------------

1. Go to an MS-DOS command prompt and type the following command:

  "FTP &lt;SNA ServerName&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

2. To start an FTP-AFTP session on a host, type:

  "User: &lt;Username&gt;@&lt;SNADestination&gt;
  Password: &lt;Password&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  The username and password are your host user name and its associated password.

The SNADestination is a valid AFTP address for an SNA host system. This can be a
CPI-C symbolic destination name defined by the system administrator in SNA
Server Manager, or can be the name of an APPC Remote LU Alias, or the fully
qualified APPC Remote LU Name in the form NetName.LUName.

For example:

  User: yourname@appn.as400

This is an example of using the Fully Qualified Remote LU Name.

  -or-

  User: yourname@aftpd

This is an example of using a CPIC Symbolic Destination Name.

NOTE: A number of commands in the AFTP client are not supported by an FTP client,
for example recfm for controlling the host record format for uploaded files.
These commands can be implemented in FTP through the use of the quote facility
or the Site command, depending on your client. Choose the method supported by
your FTP client.

NOTE: If you use a login account from a trusted domain, you must disable
anonymous logins on the FTP server. For more information, please see the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q123417 Err Msg: 530 User &lt;User Name&gt; Cannot Log In


Configuring an AFTP Client to AFTP Server Connection
----------------------------------------------------

When you use Microsoft SNA Server for AFTP access, the SNA AFTP Server must be
configured with either a CPIC Symbolic Destination Name or have the Local and
Remote LU partnered when using the AFTP client. The AFTP client is a CPI-C
application and cannot specify a Local LU alias. Security and permissions for
the AFTP server must also be configured. When the user issues the open command,
he or she can open to the remote LU (either its alias or the fully qualified
remote LU name). By default, the AFTP client uses the mode #BATCH and the
invokable TP name AFTPD. These defaults can be changed by using the modename and
tpname commands.

Configuring a CPIC Symbolic Destination Name for AFTP
-----------------------------------------------------

1. In the SNA Manager, click the Insert menu, point to APPC, and then click
  "CPIC Symbolic Name." The Properties dialog box is displayed.

2. Click the General tab, in the Name box, type AFTPD, in the Mode Name box type
  "#BATCH", and under Conversation Security, click None.

3. Click the Partner Information tab.

4. Under Application TP, type AFTPD.

5. Under Partner LU Name, click Alias and type the Remote LU Alias of the
  AS/400.

6. Leave all other settings at the default value, and then click OK.

7. Save the configuration.

Configuring AFTP Client-AFTP Server Access Security
---------------------------------------------------

Before attempting to make the connection, the AFTP client will prompt you for a
user ID and password. This user ID is used by the AFTP server for file
permissions (different users have different permissions), as well as for APPC
conversation security. A user who types the user ID Anonymous is not prompted
for a password. No APPC conversation security is specified on the ALLOCATE
flowing from the AFTP client, and the AFTP server treats this as "no user ID."

NOTE: For more information on security and AFTP, refer to the online help
documentation or part 5 of the SNA Administration Guide.

The Aftpserv.ini file is used to set user permissions in order to provide users
access to specific directories.

Configuring the Aftpserv.ini File
---------------------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then
  click Notepad.

2. Open Snaroot\System\Aftpserv.ini.

3. To control access, you may specify users, directories, and permissions for
  AFTP clients. The Aftpserv.ini file is loaded on startup of the AFTP server
  and any additions to the permissions will take effect at that time. Be sure
  to type the semicolon (;) following the last line.

  "provide_access
  users(userx userx)
  directory(directory name)
  permissions(such as, read write);" (without the quotation marks)

4. Save the file and exit Notepad.

5. At the AFTP server, start the AFTP Service; either in the Control Panel
  Services tool, or at an MS-DOS command prompt, type the following command:

  "net start aftpd" (without the quotation marks)

Installing and Using the AFTP Client Software
---------------------------------------------

1. When you install the SNA Client software, select the AFTP Client check box in
  the Options List.

2. Type aftp from an MS-DOS command prompt. This will initialize the Microsoft
  AFTP client.

3. From the AFTP prompt, type the following:

  "open aftpd" (without the quotation marks)

4. There will be a prompt for a user ID and password. These should match what is
  used in the Aftpserv.ini file or whatever security context is set on the
  Mainframe or AS/400 for access.

5. The connection should now be established and AFTP commands can be carried
  out. For a list of valid AFTP commands, consult the SNA online documentation.

Obtaining and Configuring AFTP on the AS/400
--------------------------------------------

NOTE: The following information can be found on the online documentation for
AFTP, obtained from IBM. Microsoft makes no claims for the accuracy of this
documentation and cannot guarantee or imply reliability, serviceability,
performance, or functionality of the AFTP program running on the AS/400 or
Mainframe systems.

Obtaining AFTP
--------------

AFTP was made available for OS/400 V3R1 on June 13, 1995. Because it uses system
APIs new to V3R1, it is not supported on prior releases of OS/400.

AFTP is available for free two ways:

1. From the AS/400 FORUM, available via PerformanceEdge. PerformanceEdge is
  available to all customers who are under warranty, or who have a maintenance
  agreement with IBM. Other customers may purchase PerformanceEdge.

2. AFTP is available internally to all IBMers via the AS4TOOLS disk. The
  customer can ask his/her IBM CE or SE to get a copy from AS4TOOLS. The SE/CE
  may distribute the copy freely to customers.

AS/400 AFTP Online Documentation

AS/400 Server Setup

After restoring the AFTP library on the AS/400 server system, the following must
be done. The AFTP library must be placed in the User Library List. Update the
QUSRLIBL system value. The subsystem which will handle the AFTPD invocations
must be restarted to pick up the new library list entry. If your subsystem, APPC
controller and APPC device configurations are not already defined, these may
need to be configured. See the OS/400 Communications Configuration Reference for
configuration information.

AS/400 Client Setup

After restoring the AFTP library on the AS/400 Client system, the following
should be done. CPI-C side information should be defined. Use the CRTCSI command
to do this for each destination server. Set TPNAME on this command to "AFTPD".
If your subsystem, APPC controller and APPC device configurations are not
already defined, these may need to be configured. See the OS/400 Communications
Configuration Reference for configuration information. You also may want to
place the AFTP library in the User Library List.

AS/400 AFTP Invocation

There are 3 possible ways to invoke AFTP for the AS/400. The first is to call
AFTP using just system destination name.

CALL AFTP system_destination

This will use the CPI-C side information system destination providing it is
configured and found. If not the system_destination will be used as a remote LU
name.

The second is to call AFTP using -f option.

CALL AFTP PARM(system_destination '-f' 'file_name')

This will use a file of AFTP commands which will be input to the AFTP
application. The file_name must be specified using the following format:

  'file(member)' if the member name is different that the file name,

  or

  'file' if the member name is the same as the file name.

NOTE: The user ID and Password must be specified in the file either after the
open command if system destination was not specified on the AFTP call, or as the
first 2 entries in the file if the system destination was specified on the AFTP
call.

The third is to call AFTP using no options.

CALL AFTP

This will put you in the AFTP environment. You can then specify your mode name
and use the OPEN command to start a conversation to a server system.

AS/400 AFTP naming convention.

The AS/400 uses a library structure, so the naming convention that AFTP uses is
library/file.member. Save files do not have member names associated with the
file.

When listing libraries on the AS/400, the output list will include all the files
and members that are part of the library. The DIR command will include the files
and members.

To list a library that is not the current directory, a slash must be provided
after the library specification. For example, to list the XXXX library you must
specify "ls XXXX/". If the "/" is not specified AFTP will try to list the XXXX
file in the current directory. This rule applies for multiple PUTS, GETS and
DELETES also.

 For the PUT, GET, DELETE, and RENAME commands you must specify the
 complete qualified name.
    get filename.mbrname          or
    get library/filename.mbrname

 For multiple GETS, PUTS, and DELETES you can use;
    get filename.*                or
    get filename.xxx*

Please note AS/400 AFTP will not recognize any file having a "." as part of its
name. AS/400 AFTP assumes anything after the "." is part of the member name.

Please note AS/400 AFTP will not recognize any file having a "." as part of its
name. AS/400 AFTP assumes anything after the "." is part of the member name.

AS/400 AFTP Notes and Limitations

-- Server user ID and password must be capitalized.
-- The LSD command will only work for the QSYS library. To see all
libraries on the server AS/400, use the LSD command on the QSYS
library.
-- AS/400 files will always be overwritten.
-- To display a file from a remote system specify "-" as the local
system name on the get command( get file.mbr - ).
-- If a file does not exist on the AS/400 previous to transfer, a
physical file(*DATA) will be created with record length of 512
for binary transfers, and 80 for ebcdic and ascii transfers.
-- If you would like a physical file to be created with
a different record length, use the lrecl command.
-- The ALLOC command can be used to specify the maximum # of records
in a physical file.
-- During the RENAME of a member, the filename (file.mbr) must be
the same name in the source and target.

-- Retrieve previous command (PF9) does not work for AFTP client.
-- Server will not delete a DB file with existing members.
-- Server will not remove directory (library) with existing files.
-- Server may not support anonymous userid.
-- A file with greater than 78 record length will not completely
display when using the "get file -" command invocation.
-- Save files must be transferred using the binary data type.
-- Logical files may not be transferred using the binary data type.
-- Empty DDM file members will not be transferred.
-- Date function will not be use when adding members to the AS/400.
The NEW date will always be used.
-- EBCDIC should only be used between AS/400 systems.
-- AS/400 does not support BELL, RECFM, and BLOCK commands.
-- AS/400 has no ANAME support.
