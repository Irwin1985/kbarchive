The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Due to the change in structure of the database from SourceSafe 3.x to Visual
SourceSafe 4.0, there are several steps that would be beneficial to take when
upgrading.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Purge\Destroy all unneeded files and projects from the 3.1 database. First,
  understand the difference between a deleted and a destroyed file/project: A
  deleted file/project is recoverable, destroyed files are not. If a deleted
  file existed in an earlier version of a project, it will reappear when a Get
  is done on that earlier version of the project. If the file is destroyed, it
  will not reappear.

  To destroy a file or project that is active, highlight the file, hit the
  delete key, make sure the "Destroy permanently" checkbox is checked, and
  click the OK button.

  To destroy a file or project that has been deleted, highlight the parent
  project, access the Info menu, chose the Removed... option. You will be
  presented with a list of files and projects that used to exist in the parent
  project but have been deleted. This is a multiselect listbox. Select the
  files/projects you want to destroy, and click the Purge button.

  If you have a deleted file or project with the same name as an active file and
  want to keep both versions, it is recommended that you temporarily rename the
  active file/project. To rename a file, highlight the file, access the File
  menu, and choose the Rename... option.

2. Tell all users to exit any SourceSafe executables. Users can have files
  checked out, but they cannot be running any of the executables.

3. Check to make sure there is no detectable corruption in the 3.1 database.
  This can be done by running the 3.x version of Analyze.exe on the 3.1 data.
  Analyze.exe can be found in the ADMIN and the WINNT subdirectories of the
  SourceSafe 3.x installation. This process can take anywhere from 5 seconds to
  7 hours depending on the complexity of the database and the size of the
  SS\DATA subdirectory. Given operating system permissions and correct login
  information, Analyze.exe can be run in an overnight process.

  To run Analyze.exe, type the following in a Command box:

  analyze -I- &lt;path to data directory&gt; &gt;analyze.log

  This command runs the Analyze executable on your data without prompting you
  for input, and then outputs the results to the Analyze.log file.

  Look at the Analyze.log file. If it says: "Analysis Complete No Errors Found"
  move on to the next step. If it says anything else, correct those error
  messages before trying the upgrade.

  For more information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q133054 HOWTO: Detecting and Fixing Database Corruption Errors in SourceSafe

  Q131447 HOWTO: Use PHYSICAL Command to Find SourceSafe Database File

4. Make a full backup of your 3.1 SS\DATA subdirectory and all its
  subdirectories.

5. Create an empty subdirectory on a 32-bit operating system (Windows 95 or
  Windows NT). Download Analyze6.exe from one of the Microsoft download sites
  into this subdirectory. Run the file to extract its contents. For more
  details on how to obtain this self-extracting executable, please refer to the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190881 SAMPLE: Analyze6.exe Utility for Visual SourceSafe

6. Install Visual SourceSafe version 4.x or greater into a new directory.

7. At that 32-bit operating system, unload anything that might be in memory,
  especially virus protection programs. Then open a Command prompt, change to
  the newly created subdirectory, and run the following:

  ddconv &lt;path to data directory&gt;

8. When the process completes, open the Ddcerr.log file that was created in the
  SS\DATA subdirectory. If the process doesn't complete, contact Visual
  SourceSafe product support. In the United States and Canada, the phone number
  is 425-635-7014.

9. If any messages except the following appear, there was corruption in the 3.1
  database that caused a problem in the conversion:

  DDCONV initializing
  Creating subfolders
  Moving files
  Creating rights DB
  Building project list
  Creating names DB
  Converting log files
  &lt;Logfile&gt; Parent count in old DB #, correcting to actual count #.
  &lt;Logfile&gt; parent project &lt;Project path&gt; not found, skipping parent
  record.
  &lt;Logfile&gt; Project entry count in old DB #, correcting to actual count
  #.
  &lt;Logfile&gt; Format record, invalid, correcting.
  Adding project rights
  Converting users
  DDCONV finished

  If a problem occurs, refer to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q153872 DDConv Messages of Visual SourceSafe 4.0

10. Insert the Visual SourceSafe CD-ROM, and run Setup.exe. Choose the server
  install, and point to the 3.1 installation. If SourceSafe is on a Novell
  Netware server, install won't work from a Windows 95 computer. See the
  following KB article:

  Q153873 How to Install When Setup Fails on Novell

  As a workaround, you can run the install from a Windows 3.1, Windows for
  Workgroups 3.11, or Windows NT 3.51 workstation. If you only have Windows 95
  workstations, install the server copy locally, drag and drop it to the
  Novell Netware server, and then copy the following from the SourceSafe 3.1
  installation to the 4.0 installation:

  SS\USERS and all subdirectories
  SS\DATA and all subdirectories
  SS\srcsafe.ini
  SS\users.txt

11. Test the installation. While connected to the server copy of Visual
  SourceSafe, go to the appropriate subdirectory for the platform of your
  local operating system and run SSEXP. If it comes up, your installation and
  conversion was successful. If it doesn't come up or looks wrong, call
  Microsoft Visual SourceSafe technical support.

12. Rename any active files or projects that you renamed before the conversion
  (see Step 1) back to their original names.

13. After the server copy is installed, you will want to have users connect to
  the server copy of Visual SourceSafe and run Netsetup.exe to install the
  client copy of Visual SourceSafe. Your users can now use Visual SourceSafe.

14. Although not required, it is recommended that you run the analyze that was
  downloaded in step 5 on the 4.0 database. See the readme.txt file that came
  from the analyze4.exe self-extracting executable. See the following
  Microsoft Knowledge Base article for information about analyze messages:

  Q152807 Error Messages from the Analyze Tool of Visual SourceSafe
