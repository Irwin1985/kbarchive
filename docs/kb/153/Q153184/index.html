SYMPTOMS
========

If you have previously installed one of the Kids programs listed at the top of
this article on a 16-bit operating system (for example, Microsoft Windows 3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups 3.11), and then you install the same program under a
32-bit operating system (for example, Windows 95 or Windows NT) on the same
computer, the previous 16-bit version of the program is not removed.

For example, if you were running the Kids program under Windows 3.1 and then
upgraded to Windows 95 and installed the 32-bit version of the Kids program, the
32-bit AND the 16-bit versions of the Kids program are installed on your hard
drive.

If you have both the 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the programs installed on your
computer, you will have a set of the following folders on your hard drive, where
C: is the drive on which you installed the program(s):

   Paul Bunyan:
        C:\Mskids\Bunyan (16 bit)
           - and -
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Kids\Bunyan (32 bit)

   Koi and the Kola Nuts:
        C:\Mskids\Koi (16 bit)
           - and -
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Kids\Koi (32 bit)

RESOLUTION
==========

If you only want to use the program under the 32-bit operating system, manually
remove the files installed by the 16-bit version. The location of these files is
listed below, where C: is the drive on which you installed the program(s):

            Paul Bunyan:   C:\Mskids\Bunyan

  Koi and the Kola Nuts:   C:\Mskids\Koi

How to Remove the Files
-----------------------

To remove the files, delete the program folder shown above.

NOTE: The converse is true if you first installed the 32-bit version of the
program and then installed the program under a 16-bit operating system. Please
see the More Information section of this article for the list of files installed
by the 32-bit version of the program.

Windows 95:


To remove the 16-bit version of the program, follow the instructions outlined
below.

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

2. Open your hard drive folder by double-clicking its folder icon.

3. Open the Mskids folder by double-clicking its folder icon.

4. Single-click the program folder to select it (for example, Bunyan or Koi).

5. On the File menu, click Delete.

6. Confirm deletion of the following files in the appropriate folder, where C:
  is the drive on which you installed the program(s):

     C:\Mskids\Bunyan          C:\Mskids\Koi
       Bunyan.exe                Koi.exe
       Bunyan.mdf                Koi.mdf
       Bunyan.tdf                Koi.tdf
       Bunyan.ini                Koi.ini
       Bun_w31.hlp               Koi_w31.hlp

After you complete the steps listed above, the 16-bit version of the
corresponding program should be removed from your hard drive.

Windows NT 3.51:

To remove the 16-bit version of the program, follow the instructions outlined
below:

1. Run File Manager.

2. Open your hard drive folder by double-clicking its folder icon.

3. Open the Mskids folder by double-clicking its folder icon.

4. Single-click the program folder (for example, Bunyan or Koi) to select it.

5. On the File menu, click Delete.

6. Confirm deletion of the following files in the appropriate folder, where C:
  is the drive on which you installed the program(s):

     Bunyan (C:\Mskids\Bunyan)          Koi (C:\Mskids\Koi)
     -------------------------          -------------------

     Bunyan.exe                         Koi.exe
     Bunyan.mdf                         Koi.mdf
     Bunyan.tdf                         Koi.tdf
     Bunyan.ini                         Koi.ini
     Bun_w31.hlp                        Koi_w31.hlp

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup program for the 32-bit version of the program listed above does not
check to see whether the 16-bit version of the program is installed. Because
some computers may run both 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems, both versions
of the program may be necessary.

The 32-bit version of the program installs the following files onto your hard
drive. To remove the 32-bit version of the program, run Add/Remove Programs from
Control Panel. This should remove all files associated with the 32-bit program.

If, for some reason, the Setup program fails to remove the program files, delete
the program files manually.

The program folders of the 32-bit version of the program are located in the
following directory, where C: is the drive on which you installed the
program(s):

  Paul Bunyan
  ---------------------------------------
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Kids\Bunyan
       Bun_w95.cnt
       Bun_w95.fts
       Bun_w95.gid
       Bun_w95.hlp
       Bunyan.exe
       \System &lt;directory&gt;
           Bunyan.ini
           Bunyan.mdf
           Bunyan.tdf
           Mscreate.dir &lt;hidden&gt;

  Koi and the Kola Nuts
  ------------------------------------
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Kids\Koi
       Koi.exe
       Koi_w95.cnt
       Koi_w95.fts
       Koi_w95.gid
       Koi_w95.hlp
       Mscreate.dir &lt;hidden&gt;
       \System &lt;directory&gt;
          Koi.ini
          Koi.mdf
          Koi.tdf
          Mscreate.dir &lt;hidden&gt;

Different versions of the program are necessary because each version (16 and 32
bit) makes calls to different Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) when performing
various operations. These DLLs, which are stored commands, are also either 16 or
32 bit.
