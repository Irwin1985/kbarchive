-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Files created from Visual FoxPro's Support Libraries will have a creator of
FOXX, rather than the library's signature FOXL or FOXS. This problem will occur
with every file created from the library and with commands such as PACK that
create and rename temporary files. This problem will also affect how documents
are associated with their creator's icon and launching behavior via the
document.

CAUSE
=====

This is a limitation of Visual FoxPro and the Visual FoxPro support libraries.
Although the libraries will operate with a custom creator, icons, and signature,
they do not stamp the files created with the creator. The creator "FOXX" will be
stamped on all created files, regardless of the library's creator or signature.

WORKAROUND
==========

- Use the FoxTools function, fxSetType(), or a third-party utility, such as
  ResEdit or File Buddy, to restore the desired creator;

-or-

- Create an ALSM or CFM library to create files with the correct creator, or
  alter the creator of created files; -or-

- For use on partitions that do not have any version of FoxPro installed,
  change the library's creator and signature to FOXX.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual FoxPro libraries have different signatures to facilitate their
coexistence on the same volume as the development environment and to handle
executables properly. Below is a table of applications and their corresponding
signatures.

  Application                   Signature
  --------------------------    ---------
  Microsoft Visual FoxPro       FOXX
  VFP Support Library PPC       FOXL
  VFP Support Library 68K       FOXS

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Take the following PRG and build it to a PowerMac and 68K Executable. Copy the
Executable and the appropriate library to a new folder.

Macintosh alerts will display the creator and type of a DBF after creation,
custom stamping, and a subsequent PACK. The following example should illustrate
the problem and give some code examples to implement a workaround in code:

     CREA TABLE Fruit ( cID C(2), cKind C(10) ) &amp;&amp; Create a new table
     cID = "AP"
     cKind = "Apple"
     INSERT INTO Fruit FROM MEMVAR

     cID = "OR"
     cKind = "Orange"
     INSERT INTO Fruit FROM MEMVAR

     cID = "CH"
     cKind = "Cherry"
     INSERT INTO Fruit FROM MEMVAR

     cTable = SYS( 2027, DBF() ) &amp;&amp; Mac Path version of the table path
     USE

     SET LIBRARY TO HOME() + "FOXTOOLS.CFM"

     * ShowInfo is a simple function below to display the current
     *    creator and type.
     cFileType=SHOWINFO('Original', cTable)

     * Set the Creator
     cFileType = cFileType &amp;&amp; Same as before
     cFileCreator = 'ZZZZ' &amp;&amp; Custom creator or FOXL/FOXS for PPC/68K
     =FxSetType( cTable, cFileType, cFileCreator)

     cFileType=SHOWINFO('Stamped', cTable)

     USE (cTable)
     GO TOP
     DELETE
     PACK
     USE

     cFileType=SHOWINFO('PACKed', cTable)

     * Unload the library
     SET LIBRARY TO

     PROCEDURE showInfo
       LPARAMETER cMessage, cTable

       * What creator does the file have
       STORE "" to cFileType, cFileCreator
       =FxFileType( cTable, @cFileType, @cFileCreator )

       nIconNumber = 2       &amp;&amp; Note icon
       nResourceNumber = 257 &amp;&amp; Continue button
       nHorizontal = -1      &amp;&amp; Default position
       nVertical = -1      &amp;&amp; Default position
       cText1 = cMessage + " " + cTable  + CHR(13)
       cText2 = "Creator = '" + cFileType + "'  Type = '"  + ;
            cFileCreator + "'"
       =FxAlert( nIconNumber, nResourceNumber, nHorizontal, nVertical, ;
            cText1,  cText2 )

       RETURN cFileType
