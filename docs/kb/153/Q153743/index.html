SUMMARY
=======

Joining a domain during an automated Windows NT Setup may fail in some
instances.

CAUSE
=====

There are various causes for failures. The most common ones are listed below:

1. Problems communicating with a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) during Windows
  NT Setup.

2. Not creating a new computer account for the system attempting to join the
  domain.

3. Specifying a Workgroup name as well as a domain name in the answer file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You must be able to contact a PDC during Setup if you want to join a domain. If
the PDC is across a router, you will need to use a routable protocol such as
TCP/IP. This may also involve configuring a DHCP Server to supply a valid WINS
Server address or using an LMHOSTS file with #PRE #DOM statements to assist in
resolving Netbios names. For more information on TCP/IP name resolution, refer
to the "Name Resolution for Windows Networking" section in the TCP/IP manual
included with Windows NT Server.

From Cps.hlp included in the Windows NT Resource Kit:

  If you specify a domain to join, there must be a computer account on the
  server for the domain, and the account must never have been joined to.

Another common problem involves the Ntlanman.inf file that is used in setting up
the network, including joining a domain. The issue is that Ntlanman.inf first
attempts to set the Workgroup name by comparing STF_AUTOWORKGROUP to "" (the
empty string). If this is successful the domain information is ignored. To avoid
this issue, modify the [DefaultValues] section of your answer file (that is,
Unattend.txt, Profile.ini, Defaults.inf) as follows:

  DefaultWorkgroup = ""

Do not attempt to comment the line by placing a semicolon in front of
DefaultWorkgroup.

For more information on automating Windows NT Setup, refer to Volume 1, Chapter 3
of the Windows NT Resource Kit 3.51.
