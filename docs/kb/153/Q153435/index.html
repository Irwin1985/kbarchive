-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Rainforest for Windows, version 1.0 
- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores Inside the Earth for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run Setup for Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth or
Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs, the mouse moves to a corner of the screen and
freezes, while the program continues to run.

Another symptom is that the mouse pointer may persistently move to the upper left
corner of the screen (however, you may be allowed to click on objects to
activate them).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when Smartmove is enabled for the Logitech Mouse.

  -or-

This problem also occurs if you are using a mouse with the "Snap To" option
enabled for your mouse software.

NOTE: The problem may also be resolved by disabling animated cursors, or by
having the program ask you if you would like to change resolution if you are
running at a resolution higher than 640x480 and then responding with "No". (See
the "III. ASK BEFORE RESOLUTION SWITCHING" section below for more information on
how to do this task.)

RESOLUTION
==========

I. DISABLE THE "INTELLIGENT MOUSE MOVEMENT"
-------------------------------------------

Use one of the following solutions to disable automatic mouse movement, depending
on your mouse.

Microsoft Natural Keyboard
--------------------------

If you are using a Microsoft Natural Keyboard with the "SnapTo" option enabled,
clear the SnapTo setting on the Pointer Activity tab in the Keyboard Control
Panel:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Keyboard.

3. Click the Mouse Activity tab.

4. Clear the SnapTo checkbox.

5. Click the OK button to close the Keyboard control panel.

Logitech Mouse
--------------

If you are using the Logitech Mouse, disable Smartmove in the Mouse Properties
dialog box, as follows:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Mouse.

3. Choose the Settings tab in the Mouse Properties dialog box, and click the
  Advanced button.

4. Clear the Smartmove check box.

5. Close the Mouse Control Panel and restart Windows.

PS/1 Mouse
----------

If you are using a PS/1 mouse with the Snap To option enabled, clear the Snap To
setting on the Activities tab in the Mouse section of Control Panel:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Mouse.

3. Click the Activity tab.

4. Clear the Snap To check box.

II. DISABLE ANIMATED CURSORS
----------------------------

To work around the problem described above, choose a pointer scheme that does not
include animated cursors. To change the pointer scheme used by Windows 95,
follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Mouse.

3. Click the Pointers tab.

4. In the Scheme box, select a pointer scheme that does not include animated
  cursors (such as Windows Standard).

III. ASK BEFORE RESOLUTION SWITCHING
------------------------------------

If you are running at a resolution higher than 640x480, you may set the program
parameters to ask you if you would like to switch the resolution to 640x480
while running the program.

1. To start the Bus Stop Utility, click Start, point to Programs, point to
  Microsoft Kids, then follow the instructions appropriate for the program you
  want to run:

   - MSB Dinosaurs:

      - Click Bus Stop Utility-Dinosaurs. (Continue on to Step 2).

   - MSB Earth:

     a. Click Bus Help - Earth.

     b. Double-click Troubleshooting.

     c. Double-click Bus Stop Utility.

     d. Click the arrow in the phrase, "Click here &lt;arrow&gt; to start the
        Bus Stop Utility." (Continue on to Step 2.)

2. Click the "Ask whether to change to 640x480" option.

3. Click Exit.

4. Restart the program.

You may have difficulty with the mouse freezing when trying to get into the Bus
Stop Utility. If you are still having difficulty with your mouse in MSB
Dinosaurs or MSB Earth, contact Microsoft Technical Support with the number
listed in your documentation.
