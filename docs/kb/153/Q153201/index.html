- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to install a Visual FoxPro executable from a CD-ROM setup disk
created with the Setup Wizard, the following error may appear:

  Insert CD-ROM Disk Labeled:
  'Disk1'
  Into Drive X:

"Drive X:" is the drive designation of the CD-ROM drive. However, the CD-ROM
drive contains the CD-ROM disk, causing the setup program to stop.

CAUSE
=====

The Netsetup directory that holds the compressed files exists under another
subdirectory on the hard drive. When the Setup program attempts to decompress
the files from the CD-ROM, it cannot locate the original directory structure
that existed when the Netsetup directory was created on the hard drive.

WORKAROUND
==========

While the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard was not created with the intention of
making CD-ROM distribution disks, this error message can usually be corrected.

Here are two workarounds:

- Implement the solution described in the article referenced in the REFERENCES
  section and change a line of code in the Setup.inf file located in the
  destination folder created with the Setup wizard.

  Open the Setup.inf file using any text editor and place a period between the
  last set of quotes in the following line of code:

        "1","Disk 1","ACMSET16.EX_","."

  -or-

- Create the Netsetup directory making sure it is located off the root
  directory of the hard drive. In the third screen of the Setup Wizard, Step
  Three-Disk Images, select the root directory of the hard drive in the Disk
  Images Directory text box.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project file containing a program file with a WAIT WINDOW command.

2. Build an executable from this project.

3. Start the Setup Wizard, build a network distributable, and save it in a
  directory under the Visual FoxPro directory.

4. Create a CD-ROM setup disk from the contents of the Netsetup directory.

5. Attempt to install the application from the CD-ROM and note that the error
  results.
