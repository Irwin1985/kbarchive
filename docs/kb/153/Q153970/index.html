MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, each entry in this document
might also include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note
that the "Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not
necessarily address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments"
section contains specific information for working around the problem.

CD-ROM: Demo 6 issues and corrections
-------------------------------------

Below are two comments from an astute reader regarding Networking Essentials Demo
6:

The demo on the CD says that, to install a new network card, you must first
remove the power from the machine because you might get zapped, and then goes on
to show someone putting in a network card.

I have two issues with this demo:

In the first case the card is fitted without any obvious indication, nor even a
mention, of Static Precautions. I've been known to have been a little tiresome
on this point around this place but I suspect that is only because static damage
is such a difficult thing to prove, and if you view similar instruction videos
from hardware vendors you will find that they are all careful to highlight and
observe static precautions. (I have heard that in some companies, failure to
observe static precautions is an automatic dismissal offense i.e. Medical
Companies.)

In the second case (and I could be debated on this), I believe that the
recommendation to remove the power from the PC is actually counter- productive
to properly grounding the computer during servicing.

Almost all computer boards run on +5V DC with the occasional use of -5V &amp;
+,-12V DC. The main power is converted to these voltages by a SMPC (Switched
Mode Power Supply) which is in a case of its own (the little metal box in this
particular demo). Usually the power supply is fitted into the PC so that the
main power lead plugs directly into the box, and in some cases the power switch
is connected via a flying lead which is fairly well insulated if it is to meet
design standards. Should any voltage leakage from the SMPS occur due to a fault
condition, the whole PC case would go live as well and you would tend to notice
that... I can assure you!

I doubt too that you could find many PCs using either a Linear Power Supply or
any other sort of Power Supply without some form of shielding of its own. Also,
it would only be in extremely rare circumstances that you would find any other
form of high voltage equipment inside the case of a PC, and there would probably
be a regulatory requirement to add some sort of label to indicate that situation
on the outside of the PC case itself.

For my own purposes (and this is what I recommend), I have found it best to leave
the power lead connected to the PC, and if you want be really safe to switch the
power off at the wall outlet. This means that the PC is still properly grounded
via the main lead and that I can connect a static lead from the PC to myself to
be held at the same grounded voltage potential.

Hope this is of some help.


Correction:

1. Change steps and wording to keep power supply connected (but turned off)
  during servicing, unless the power supply or power switch is potentially
  erratic or defective.

2. Add information regarding static grounding before servicing internal
  components that might be sensitive to static electricity (especially memory,
  CPU, and other microchip components.

Comments:

Please note that not unplugging the computer case can be dangerous in certain
situations. One particular instance is if the power supply or power switch is
suspected to be erratic or defective in any way. In these cases, it is highly
recommended that you remove the power cord from the computer before you open the
case.

CD-ROM: No sound in demos
-------------------------

All of the demos provide excellent text content and motion videos. However, there
is no sound to accompany the demonstration presentations.

The omission of sound was by design to ensure that all content was accessible,
regardless of whether the computer was configured to provide audio. No sound is
necessary to fully understand the concepts being demonstrated.

Microsoft is investigating the possibility of enhancing the demonstrations to
include sound in future editions of this product.

Correction:

Add the information in the description above to the README.TXT and README.WRI
files on the CD-ROM.

SPLINE:  "Self-Placed Training" misspelled Paced
------------------------------------------------

The Networking Essentials book spine reads "Self-Placed Training" instead of
"Self-Paced Training."

Page XXXV: Certification Roadmap not on CD-ROM
----------------------------------------------

The section titled "Microsoft Education and Certification Roadmap" refers to
installing the Roadmap and the assessment exams from the \Roadmap\Disk1 and
\Assmt folders (respectively). However, these directories do not exist on the
Networking Essentials CD-ROM.

Correction:

Page XXXV: Remove the one paragraph section titled "Microsoft Education and
Certification Roadmap."

Comments:

Page XXXVIII states clearly how to obtain the Roadmap and other Certified
Professional resources and information.

You can also find out more about the Roadmap and assessment exams by connecting
to the World Wide Web address http://www.microsoft.com/ and searching for
Roadmap.

Page 75: "Insulation (PVC, Teflon)" is not correct term
-------------------------------------------------------

Page 75: Diagram pointer for inner insulator labeled "PVC or TEFLON." This
terminology actually applies to the outer jacket. The part being pointed to is
either soft foam, hard nylon, or a spiral type insulator.

Correction:

Replace "PVC or TEFLON" with "soft foam, hard nylon, or spiral type."

Page 80: Connectors used with Thicknet cables
---------------------------------------------

Page 80 indicates the following: "Both thinnet and thicknet use connection
components, known as BNC..." Actually, thinnet cables use BNC connectors and
thicknet cables use N connectors.

Correction:

Reword page 80 so that it properly indicates that thinnet cables use BNC
connectors, and thicknet cables use N connectors.

Page 96-103: Summary contradictions
-----------------------------------

Page 96 states, "Because broadband transmission signal flow is unidirectional,
there must be two paths for data to flow..." Page 103 contradicts this by
stating, "Broadband uses analog signaling to transmit multiple simultaneous
transmissions on the same cable."

This is not a contradiction because broadband transmission contains many
different channels, each capable of independent unidirectional transmission.
Page 96 states that all channels can be devoted to unidirectional transmission
or a mid-split broadband configuration can be used to reserve a portion of the
broadband channels for receiving signals.

Page 99 chart indicates IBM type 3 cable is "Voice grade cable." Page 103
contradicts this by stating "IBM Type 3 cabling, for example, is a voice and
data, shielded twisted-pair cable otherwise known as STP."

Page 103 should state [ASCII 147]IBM Type 1 cabling...[ASCII 148].

Page 102: Optical cable incorrectly described
---------------------------------------------

On page 102, Chart states optical cable is "not flexible at all." Most fiber
optic cable is considerably more flexible than any of the copper cables,
including UTP.

Correction:

Chart should state that optical cable does have some flexibility.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
