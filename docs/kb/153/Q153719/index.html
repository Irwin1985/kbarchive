SYMPTOMS
========

After a Windows NT backup domain controller (BDC) has been offline for some
time, it may fall out of synchronization with the primary domain controller
(PDC). When you attempt to bring the BDC back online, you may get the following
errors in the BDC's Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 3210
  Source: Netlogon
  Type: Error
  Description: Failed to authenticate with &lt;computer name&gt;, a Windows NT
  domain controller for domain &lt;domain name&gt;.
  Data word: c0000022

  Event ID: 7023
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: Netlogon service terminated with the following error
  message: Access Denied.

This is very likely to occur if a BDC is restored from a backup that is more than
a few days old or if the BDC is offline for more than a few days.

CAUSE
=====

Domain controllers maintain a password-protected channel between each other.
When a BDC is brought into a domain, the PDC gives the BDC the current password
to use when connecting to the PDC for authentication, account database
replication, and other system activities. This password changes automatically on
a regular basis. If the BDC is offline when the password changes, or if a BDC is
restored from a backup that has an old password, the BDC will not be able to
authenticate with the PDC, and Netlogon will fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the simplest case, all that has happened is that the domain password has
changed. To resolve the behavior, do the following:

1. Start the BDC, and open Server Manager

2. Select the BDC's name, and select Synchronize with Primary Domain Controller.

If this procedure is successful, you will get a message that the LSA Database has
been updated and Netlogon will start automatically. No other action is
necessary.

However, if synchronizing with the PDC does not work on the first attempt, try
carrying out the same command again. Often, a second attempt will succeed.
However, if the BDC will not synchronize and Netlogon fails to start after three
attempts, you should create a new machine account for the BDC. These
instructions are taken from a related article, Q137987:

1. Using Server Manager, create a new computer name.

2. Synchronize entire domain (check another BDC's event viewer to see if it
  synchronized).

3. At the problem BDC, use the Network tool in Control Panel to change the name
  to the new name created in Step 1.

4. Shut down the BDC, restart, and log on to Windows NT. Note any error
  messages. You must logon to the domain the BDC belongs to, not a trusted
  domain.

5. Using Server Manager, synchronize the entire domain.

6. From the PDC, delete the old computer name(use Server Manager).

7. Synchronize the entire domain, using Server Manager.

8. Make sure the old BDC name has been deleted in Server Manager before
  proceeding.

9. After the old BDC name is gone from Server Manager, re-create it.

10. Synchronize the entire domain, using Server Manager.

11. At the problem BDC, change computer name to the old name created in step 9,
  using the Network tool in Control Panel.

12. Shut down the BDC, restart, and log on to the domain. Note any error
  messages.

13. Synchronize entire domain.

At this point the BDC should be synchronized with the PDC, netlogon should be
running, and the accounts database should be up to date.
