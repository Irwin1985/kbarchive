- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the procedures for building a CFM library for use with
Visual FoxPro for Macintosh using the CodeWarrior 8 C compiler. It will assume
that the C code and LCK functions have been implemented properly in the source
code file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CodeWarrior is manufactured by MetroWerks Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.

The folder paths to the Visual FoxPro API sample files are as follow:

  Microsoft Visual FoxPro:API:Sample Code
  Microsoft Visual FoxPro:API:CodeWarrior
  Microsoft Visual FoxPro:API:CodeWarrior:CW CFM Sample

In the steps that follow, this article will only refer to the current folder name
and not provide the full path.

Visual FoxPro for Macintosh comes with a sample CodeWarrior project called
Hello.pi (note that the actual file extension is the symbol for the Greek letter
pi but that character cannot be reproduced in this text). The easiest procedure
for building a CFM from a new C file is to copy this project and make some
modifications for the new file.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Make sure that Metrowerks CodeWarrior 8 is installed on the Macintosh. By
  default is should install in a folder named CW8 Gold. The compiler to use is
  found in the Metrowerks CodeWarrior folder in the CW8 Gold folder. Use the
  CodeWarrior IDE 1.4 program.

2. To build the sample CodeWarrior Hello.pi project into a CFM, open the
  Hello.pi project. It is located in the CW CFM Sample folder. Choose the Make
  command from the Project menu, press CMD+M or click the Make button on the
  CodeWarrior toolbar. This library can then be loaded in Visual FoxPro with
  the SET LIBRARY TO command. More information on calling the library functions
  will follow.

3. To build a different C file into a library, follow these steps.

  a. Go to Finder and open up the CW CFM Sample folder.

  b. Copy the Reverse.c file from the Sample Code folder to the CW CFM Sample
     folder.

  c. Duplicate the Hello.pi.exp file in the CW CFM Sample folder. Rename it to
     Reverse.pi.exp. This file should only contain the text "DispatchAPI"
     without the quotes. If CodeWarrior is allowed to create this file when
     Making the CFM, the build will fail.

  d. Duplicate the Hello.pi project file. Rename it to Reverse.pi.

  e. Double-click Reverse.pi to launch CodeWarrior. If you get the message that
     the project was created by an older version of CodeWarrior, go ahead and
     update it.

  f. With the Reverse.pi project window active, choose the Add Files... command
     from the Project menu. Add the Reverse.c file to the project. You will
     probably have to navigate to the CW CFM Sample folder to find it. It
     should show up under the Sources portion of the project. If not, drag it
     there.

  g. Remove the Hello.c file from the project. Select Hello.c and choose the
     Remove Files command from the Project menu.

  h. To have the correct name and icon for the new CFM file you are about to
     build, a couple of preferences need to be set. From the Edit menu, choose
     the Preferences... command. Choose the PPC Project icon from the list of
     icons on the left side of the Preferences dialog. Scroll down to find it.
     The Project Type should be Shared Library. The File Name can be any legal
     name. Use Reverse.cfm for this example. The Creator can be changed to
     "cfmg" ,without quotes, to provide the CFM with the library bookshelf
     icon. Leave the Type as "shlb."

  i. While still in the Edit...Preferences dialog, choose the Access Paths icon
     on the left side. Under the Additional Access Paths section, check the
     Treat #include &lt;..&gt; as #include "..." checkbox. Alternately, you can
     modify the Reverse.c file and change the #include &lt;pro_ext.h&gt; line
     to #include "pro_ext.h." Checking the checkbox is preferable however.

  j. Make the project. Choose the Make command from the Project menu, press
     CMD+M, or click on the Make button on the toolbar. Reverse.cfm should show
     up in the CW CFM Sample folder with a bookshelf icon.

4. To load the Hello or Reverse.cfm libraries in Visual FoxPro, use one of the
  following commands from the Visual FoxPro Command window or within a
  program:

        SET LIBRARY TO GETFILE() ADDITIVE

  Click the All Files checkbox, and navigate to the folder with the library.

  If the full path to the library is known, type that in the command:

       SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"API:CodeWarrior:CW CFM Sample:Reverse.cfm"
       SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+"API:CodeWarrior:CW CFM Sample:Hello" ADDITIVE

  Note that the complete library file name must be specified, including any file
  name extension(.CFM). This was not the case in FoxPro 2.6 for Macintosh.
