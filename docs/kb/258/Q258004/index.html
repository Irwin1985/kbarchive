SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information about how to configure the NetView Alerter
(NVAlert) initialization file (Nvalert.ini) for use with the NVAlert service
that is provided by Microsoft SNA Server. This information includes syntax
description, examples, and references to online and printed materials. This is a
basic guide to develop NVAlert messages for your specific environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft SNA Server installation includes an example of an Nvalert.ini
file. This example file is used as a reference throughout this article. You must
have a working 3270 connection to the mainframe computer. The following are
basic setup procedures to be performed on the SNA Server computer in order for
the NVAlert service to perform properly.

Configuring the NVAlert Service:

1. In the SNA Manager, select the subdomain, and then click Properties. Click
  the NV Alert tab. Select a previously configured connection that the NVAlerts
  messages will be sent to. The NetView management messages can fail under the
  following settings on the SNA Server computer:

   - If you configure the data encryption for the group Everyone.

   - If the corresponding link service is not configured to run under a user
     account. To add the user account information, click Control Panel, and
     then click Services to correct this issue. Select the appropriate link
     service, for example SNADLC1.

NOTE: Verify the link service name of the connection you are using for NVAlert
messages. Select Startup, and then type the proper SNA System account username
and password.

2. Start the NVAlert service. (You can reconfigure this service to start
  automatically.)

Understanding the Structure and Syntax of the Nvalert.ini File:

The following example is a Nvalert.ini file, which is a flat file that the
NVAlert service uses to generate the alert:

  

  [Srv.3.2016]
  ;;wannabe AlertType=02
  AlertType=03
  AlertDescription=5008
  ProbableCauses=1057
  ;5008 N OUT OF MEMORY; ; 1057 N RESOURCE LIMIT REACHED;
  FailureCauses=1100,F8c0
  FailureDetData=00,5A,%C;00,13,%M %I EVENT_SRV_NO_VIRTUAL_MEMORY

- The brackets ([]) represent the Microsoft Windows NT Event Log header message
  that is monitored by the NVAlert service. This is the Windows NT Event Log
  header and you must format it this way.

- "Srv" represents the service short name that logs this message. In this
  example, it is the Windows NT Server Service. The short name is under the
  source heading in a Windows NT Event Log message or as the key value listed
  in the registry of this particular service.

- The number "3" represents the level of the error log. In this example, it is
  an error log message. Please see the various levels of numeric representation
  for event log messages later in this section.

- The number "2016" represents the message ID number logged in the Event Viewer
  log for a particular Windows NT event.

- Following the Windows NT event header message is the NetView command
  structure that posts the NetView alert. Please see the "References" section
  of this article for an online guide to all the command options for this
  section.

The following commands are required for every NetView alert:

  AlertType=
  AlertDescription=
  ProbableCauses=

These commands provide the type of message that is posted. For specifics on the
various codes that are acceptable, please see the "Reference" section in this
article to access an online guide for the possible IBM System Network
Architecture/Management System (SNA/MS) formats.

NOTE: NetView Alert (on the mainframe computer) can be set to filter on certain
events. In most cases, alert types "01" and "03" are not filtered. Please
contact your mainframe NetView Administrator for specific alert types that are
filtered.

The commands following the previous settings are user defined. The user-defined
codes are as follows:

- The "FailureCauses=" codes are specific to SNA formats.

- The "FailureDetData=" codes are defined as follows:

- 00 - Means that the NetView code point data is in hexadecimal form.

- 5A - SNA formats the code.

- %C - A wildcard character for the computer name.

- %I - The Event ID.

- %M - The Module name.

- ; - Used for comments.

NOTE: Do not use carriage returns in the NVAlert message. This causes an unwanted
or undeliverable message.

The Event Log numeric message values are as follows:

+--------------------------------------------+
| Type of Message | Numeric Value Equivalent | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Success         | 0                        | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Information     | 1                        | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Warning         | 2                        | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Error           | 3                        | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Success Audit   | 4                        | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| Failure Audit   | 5                        | 
+--------------------------------------------+
