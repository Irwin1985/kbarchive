The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Exchange Server user may receive a non-delivery report (NDR) after the
Exchange Server user sends e-mail to other Exchange Server users who have been
recently migrated from Lotus Notes. For example, if the Lotus Notes server is
connected to Exchange Server site A and the Exchange Server computer that
contains the new mailboxes for the migrated users is located in Exchange Server
site B, the following NDR is generated:

  Your message did not reach all or some of the intended recipients. The
  following recipient(s) could not be reached: c=US;a= ;p=Organization;o=Site
  A;dda:MSEXCHANGE=/o=PRI/ou=CALIFORNIA/cn=Recipients/cn=b4501a7a-4060570b-8525644b-78c319;
  on 12/7/99 3:06 PM

  The recipient name is not recognized.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the unrecognized Common Name attribute
(cn=b4501a7a-4060570b-8525644b-78c319;) is assigned to the Lotus Notes custom
recipient before migration to create a unique name for the Lotus Notes custom
recipient. This attribute is located in the properties for this custom
recipient. Because the Lotus Notes mailbox is not migrated to the site where the
custom recipient existed (in the example in the "Symptoms" section of this
article, site A), but instead is migrated to a different site (site B), there
are two addresses in the directory for this recipient for a brief time (the
custom recipient in site A and the new Exchange Server mailbox in site B).

If the originator selects the name from the global address list, the name may
resolve to the custom recipient address and then generate an NDR because the
Lotus Notes mailbox no longer exists after migration. After directory
replication has finished throughout the organization, the custom recipient
address is removed from the global address list, which leaves only the Exchange
Server mailbox address.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, either wait for a directory replication cycle to finish
or force a directory replication cycle.
