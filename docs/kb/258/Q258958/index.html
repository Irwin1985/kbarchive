SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the Move Server Wizard, mailbox folder permissions and delegate
access may no longer function properly.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Move Server Wizard does not attempt to update
folder access or delegate access, other than to make sure that the mailbox owner
can gain access to his or her mailbox after the move.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, re-establish any delegate access or permissions that
were lost when you ran the Move Server Wizard by re-applying the settings from
the client.

If you use the Mailbox Information Program (MBInfo) version 2.01 or later, you
can create a comma-separated values (CSV) file that contains folder permissions
for most of the folders in the information store. (For information about exactly
which folder permissions are exported to the file, see the documentation for
MBInfo.)

When delegate access is granted, some folder permissions are usually granted as
well, so the folder permission information from MBInfo should include any
mailboxes that have granted delegate access to others. The output does not
explicitly show the access as delegate access; the output only shows the folder
permissions that are granted in conjunction with the delegate access.

The information that you extract with MBInfo provides a list of mailboxes. You
can determine if permission and delegate settings are correct for these
mailboxes, and if they are not, you can either re-apply the appropriate settings
or notify users that they may need to re-apply these settings themselves.

You can obtain MBInfo from Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS). Microsoft
PSS will use commercially reasonable efforts in addressing all support problems
with MBInfo.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Folder permissions are stored as properties of a folder and are granted to a
mailbox (not a Windows NT account). When you grant another mailbox permission
for a folder, the Distinguished Name (DN) of the mailbox that you are granting
permissions to is stored on the folder to which that mailbox will have access.

A mailbox DN is similar to the following:

  /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=MailboxDirectoryName

After you run the Move Server Wizard and change the organization or site name,
mailboxes on the server that you moved have a different DN than they had before
the move. This means that the mailbox DN does not match the DN that is stored on
the folder, so access to the folder no longer works properly. When you remove
and re-apply the permissions, you use the new mailbox DN and permissions are
re-established.

The Move Server Wizard does not check all of the folders to make sure the
permissions are updated. You can grant any mailbox in the organization
permission for your folders. If the Move Server Wizard maintained all of the
folder permissions, the Move Server Wizard would need to check the information
stores of all of the servers in the organization to see if the mailboxes on the
server that the Move Server Wizard was moving had permissions for any mailbox
folders, and then update those permissions accordingly (which is nearly
impossible to do).

In some situations, folder permissions between two mailboxes that both reside on
the server that you are moving may be maintained, but this does not always
happen and is not something that you should rely on.
