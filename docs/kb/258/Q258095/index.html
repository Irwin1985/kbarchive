  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set up the Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector
Service on a Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computer to use the router for the
Microsoft Exchange Novell GroupWise Connector that resides on a Microsoft
Exchange 2000 server.

The GroupWise Connector, which is included with Exchange 2000, supports meeting
requests. This means that GroupWise, and Exchange 2000 users can send meeting
requests to each other over the GroupWise Connector. However, Exchange 2000 does
not include, or support the Calendar Connector. The Calendar Connector is an
additional component that works in tandem with the GroupWise Connector to add
support for free-and-busy lookups between GroupWise, and Exchange users. This
means that although Exchange 2000 supports meeting requests, it does not support
free-and-busy lookups.

To work around the lack of Exchange 2000 support for the Calendar Connector, keep
an Exchange Server 5.5 computer in your organization that has Calendar Connector
installed. Calendar Connector depends on the GroupWise Connector router service
to route free-and-busy messages between Exchange, and GroupWise. Usually, an
Exchange Server 5.5 computer with the Calendar Connector configured must also
have the GroupWise Connector configured. It is now possible to use the GroupWise
Connector of an Exchange 2000 server to route free-and-busy messages for a
Calendar Connector that is installed on an Exchange Server 5.5 computer, thereby
eliminating the need to install the GroupWise Connector on the Exchange Server
5.5 computer. The only GroupWise Connector component that you must install on
the Exchange Server 5.5 computer is the Novell GroupWise E-Mail Address
Generator. You can install this component by using the GroupWise Connector Setup
program, without having to fully install the GroupWise Connector.

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This following instructions are based on the assumption that:

- The Calendar Connector, and the GroupWise Connector are currently installed,
  and working on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer.

- You are using these instructions to disable the GroupWise Connector on the
  Exchange Server 5.5 computer.

- You continue to use the Calendar Connector on the Exchange Server 5.5
  computer, which now uses a GroupWise Connector that is properly configured on
  an Exchange 2000 server.

To use the Calendar Connector Service that is installed on Exchange Server 5.5
with the GroupWise Connector that is installed on Exchange 2000, you must edit
the registry on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCalCon\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then type "GWISECAL.0001.API_IN
  Directory" (without the quotation marks) in the Value Name field. Set the
  Data Type field to REG_SZ, and then click OK. In the String field, type:

  \\&lt;Exchange2000ServerName&gt;\gwrouter\togwise

4. Again, in Regedt32.exe, in the same key, on the Edit menu, point to Add
  Value, and then type "GWISECAL.0001.API_OUT Directory" (without the quotation
  marks) in the Value Name field. Set the Data Type field to REG_SZ, and then
  click OK. In the String field, type:

  \\&lt;Exchange2000ServerName&gt;\gwrouter\freebusy

  NOTE: In steps 3 and 4, be sure to replace &lt;Exchange2000ServerName&gt; with
  the actual name of the Exchange 2000 server that is running the GroupWise
  Connector.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. On the Exchange 2000 server that is running the GroupWise Connector, create a
  network share, type "Gwrouter" (without the quotation marks) for the name,
  and have it point to the Exchsrvr\Conndata\Gwrouter folder of the Exchange
  2000 server. Give the Calendar Connector Service account on the Exchange
  Server 5.5 computer full control of this share.

7. Start the connector services on both servers. Ensure that:

   - The Connector for Novell GroupWise on the Exchange 2000 server is started.

   - The GroupWise Connector on the Exchange Server 5.5 computer is disabled.

   - The Calendar Connector Service on the Exchange Server 5.5 connector is
     started.

After you add the two registry keys, the Calendar Connector routes, and receives
free-and-busy requests by means of the Exchange 2000 Gwrouter share, rather than
by means of its own local Gwrouter queues.
