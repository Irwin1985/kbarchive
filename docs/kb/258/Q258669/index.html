-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The redirection operators (&lt; and &gt;) may not work if a command is run by a
file-type association.

For example, assume that you have an .xxx file associated with Program.exe.
Running the "test.xxx" command has the same effect as running "program.exe
test.xxx". If you redirect the output of Program.exe to a file by using the
"program.exe test.xxx &gt; output.txt" command, the output is redirected to the
Output.txt file. However, if you try to redirect the output of Program.exe to a
file by using the "test.xxx &gt; output.txt" command, the output is not
redirected to the file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem in the Kernel32.dll dynamic-link library
(DLL).
