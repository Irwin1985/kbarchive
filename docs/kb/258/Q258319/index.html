The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a uuencoded e-mail message that has attachment files with certain
conditions, a temporary file may grow until it consumes all of the disk space or
the information store service is shut down. This issue may also occur when you
download such an e-mail message from the server by using a Post Office Protocol
version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev1 (IMAP4)
client.

An attachment file with the following conditions can cause this issue:

- The file includes double-byte character set (DBCS) characters in the file
  name.

- The length of the file name exceeds 246 bytes after the file name is
  converted from the SJIS character set to the JIS character set.

- The file is encoded by using uuencode.

- The codepage of the message is the JIS character set.

The temporary file is created in one of the following folders (when Exchange
Server is installed in drive C by default):

- If you send the attachment file, the temporary file is created in the
  C:\Exchsrvr\Imcdata\Out folder.

- If you download the attachment file, the temporary file (the *.stf file) is
  created in the C:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can be caused by the information store service, if a file name that
includes DBCS characters exceeds 246 bytes after the file name is converted from
SJIS to JIS. If this file was attached to an e-mail message, the length of file
name exceeds the size of destination buffer and causes an error. The conversion
is retried, which results in an endless loop that emits the same file name over
and over while the temporary file grows in size.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
