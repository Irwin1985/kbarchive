The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Baseball 2001, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot problems with game controllers in
Microsoft Baseball 2001.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Game Is Designed for Controllers with Six or More Buttons
---------------------------------------------------------

Baseball 2001 is designed to be played with game controllers that are equipped
with six or more buttons. The program does not function properly with two-button
game controllers. With some game controllers, you may be unable to use the
intentional walk command, or the check first base or check third base commands.

NOTE: If you are unable to use the intentional walk command, throw four outside
pitches instead.

If your game controller is equipped with fewer than four buttons, Microsoft
recommends that you use the keyboard as your game controller.

Do Not Change Game Controllers While a Game Is in Progress
----------------------------------------------------------

If you want to change your game controller, do so while Baseball 2001 is NOT
running. If you change your game controller while the program is running, the
program may not recognize all of the game controller commands correctly.

Microsoft Freestyle Pro Users Should Turn Off the Sensor
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are using the Freestyle Pro game controller, turn off the sensor to ensure
that directional input is handled through the d-pad. Using the d-pad while the
sensor is turned on may cause problems.

Recommendations For Microsoft Game Pad Pro Users
------------------------------------------------

If you are using the Game Pad Pro game controller, make sure that you install the
Microsoft SideWinder 4.0 software, which is included with the game controller.
The drivers for the SideWinder version 3.02 or earlier software cause Baseball
2001 to recognize the game controller buttons incorrectly.

The directional pad responds better if you select the Standard setting in the
game controller Properties settings. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Under Game Controllers, click Microsoft Game Pad Pro, and then click
  Properties.

4. Click the "Standard (not Proportional) directional pad" option.

5. Click Apply, click OK, and then click OK again.

6. Close Control Panel.

Game Pad Device May Be Listed as a Joystick in the Game
-------------------------------------------------------

Some game controllers may be listed as a joystick on the Controls screen, even if
they look like a game pad. If you experience this behavior, you should be able
to select the game controller, and it should behave as expected in the game.

Second Game Controller Functions Only When the First Controller Is Being Used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the second game controller is connected to the computer via the first game
controller (in a daisy chain), the second game controller may not function
unless the first game controller is being used.

To use the second game controller in a single-player game, connect the second
game controller directly to the computer.
