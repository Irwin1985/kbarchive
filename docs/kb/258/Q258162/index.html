-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attach a large number of Systems Management Server 1.2 child sites to a
Systems Management Server 2.0 parent site, you do not see inventory information
from those child sites reported in the parent site. When you check the parent
site, you may find a large number of files in the following directory tree:

  Sms\Inboxes\Dataldr.box

In particular, you may notice a large number of files in the Orphans
subdirectory.

CAUSE
=====

The Dataloader and Software Inventory Processor may not be able to process
inventory files fast enough. In addition, the Dataloader creates Data Discovery
Records (DDRs) for each Management Information Format (MIF) file that is
processed when the computer cannot be located in the database. Systems
Management Server 1.2 clients never create DDRs, so the Discovery Data Manager
(DDM) creates a DDR for each 1.2 MIFs found. In a high-volume situation, the DDM
is unable to process those DDRs fast enough. The Dataloader tries to process an
MIF, but is unable to find the computer in the database, so it creates a DDR for
that client and places the MIF in the Orphans folder. Every 10 minutes,
Dataloader tries to reprocess the MIF, but it is still unable to find the
computer in the database, and therefore it creates another DDR for it and moves
the MIF back to Orphans.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server 2.0 clients generate their own DDRs, unlike Systems
Management Server 1.2 clients. Data Loader and Software Inventory Processor were
changed in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1 so that they only
generate a new DDR for a orphan client once every 24 hours, unless the MIF
originates from a 1.2 client.
