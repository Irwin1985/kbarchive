IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user tries to connect a Windows NT 4.0 client computer to a server that
is more than two levels higher in the domain name tree structure, the user may
find it necessary to type the full domain name to connect. This is caused by the
client computer domain name resolver component (DNR) only "devolving" two domain
suffixes.

For instance, if you have a client named

  mycomputer.subdomain3.subdomain2.subdomain1.example.microsoft.com

the domain suffix is

  subdomain3.subdomain2.subdomain1.example.microsoft.com

If you want to ftp to a server named "myserver.example.microsoft.com," it is
necessary to type the full name "myserver.example.microsoft.com." to connect.

If you type only "myserver", the client queries the DNS for the following:

  myserver.subdomain3.subdomain2.subdomain1.example.microsoft.com
  myserver.subdomain2.subdomain1.example.microsoft.com (one level of
  devolution)
  myserver.subdomain1.example.microsoft.com (two levels of devolution)

CAUSE
=====

The DNR component was designed to only devolve two levels up the domain suffix.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  
  +---------------------------------------------------+
  | Date     | Time   | Size   | File Name | Platform | 
  +---------------------------------------------------+
  | 01/07/99 | 05:01p | 42,768 | rnr20.dll | (x86)    |

  | 01/07/99 | 05:11p | 43,792 | rnr20.dll | (Alpha)  |

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

With the default settings, it continues to devolve only two levels. However, this
hotfix supports the new MaxDomainsSearchListSize registry value to make the
devolution behavior configurable:

  Registry value:
  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\MaxDomainsSearchListSize

  Value Type: REG_DWORD
  Default: 3 (including the first query with no devolution)
  Range:1-12 (decimal)

CAUTION: Setting this value higher than necessary can cause delays in name
resolution, as more attempts to locate the name are made.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.
