The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to format a floppy disk using an LS-120 floppy disk drive drive
with a third-party ATAPI/IDE miniport driver, you may receive the following
error message on a blue screen:

  An exception 0E has occurred at 0028:C0021E77 in VxD IOS(01) + 00001197. This
  was called from 0028:C00219AF in VxD IOS(01) + 00000CCF.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the data is being moved in words (16-bit segments)
instead of bytes (8-bit segments).

RESOLUTION
==========

correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
