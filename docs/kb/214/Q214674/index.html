The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to write to the file number of a file that was opened in an
ActiveX DLL or vice versa, the following run-time error is generated:

  Error '52' Bad File name or number

CAUSE
=====

The file number created when a file is opened cannot be shared between separate
projects or executable modules.

RESOLUTION
==========

If a file must be accessed by both an EXE and an associated DLL, wrap all of the
file access activities in a class module in the ActiveX DLL.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is added by default.

2. From the Project menu, click Project Properties. Change the Project Name to
  DllFileNumber and click OK.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Class1:

  Option Explicit

  Private m_Fn As Integer

  Public Sub WriteFile(Fn As Variant)
     Write #Fn, "This is a text from the DLL."
  End Sub

  Public Sub OpenFile()
     m_Fn = FreeFile
     Open "C:\DllTEST.txt" For Append As #m_Fn
  End Sub

  Private Sub Class_Initialize()
     m_Fn = 0
  End Sub

  Public Property Get DLLFileNum() As Variant
     DLLFileNum = m_Fn
  End Property

  Public Sub CloseFile()
     If m_Fn &lt;&gt; 0 Then
        Close #m_Fn
        m_Fn = 0
     End If
  End Sub

4. Save the ActiveX Dll project.

5. From the File menu, click Add Project and add a Standard EXE project. Form1
  is added by default.

6. In the project window, set the Standard EXE project as the Start Up project
  by right-clicking on the project name and clicking "Set as Start Up" in the
  pop-up menu.

7. From the Project menu, click References and check the DllFileNumber entry.

8. Add two CommandButtons to Form1: Command1 and Command2 will be added by
  default. If a size larger than the default is used, the captions will be more
  readable.

9. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     Dim objvar As New DllFileNumber.Class1
     Dim sVar As String

     sVar = "This is text from the main program."
     objvar.OpenFile
     objvar.WriteFile objvar.DLLFileNum
     Write #objvar.DLLFileNum, sVar 'Error 52 occurs here.
     objvar.CloseFile
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()

     Dim FileNumber As Variant
     Dim objvar As New DllFileNumber.Class1

     FileNumber = FreeFile

     Open "C:\TEST.txt" For Append As #FileNumber
     Write #FileNumber, "This is text from the main program."

     objvar.WriteFile FileNumber  'Error 52 occurs here.

     Close #FileNumber
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
     Command1.Caption = "Write to a file opened in the DLL"
     Command2.Caption = "Write to a file opened in the main program"
  End Sub

10. Run the program and click on the button labeled "Write to a file opened in
  the DLL." A Run-Time error 52 will occur on the line of Write statement. End
  the program.

11. Run the program again and click on the button labeled "Write to a file
  opened in the main program." A Run-Time error 52 will occur on the line
  containing the WriteFile method.

Resolution
----------

1. Comment out the code lines containing the following comment:

  ' Error 52 occurs here.

2. Run the program again and click each CommandButton. No error will occur.
