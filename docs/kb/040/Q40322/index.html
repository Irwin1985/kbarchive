The following article contains one possible setup configuration for
installing QuickC Version 2.00 on a two-floppy machine (360K). This is
not the only setup configuration. Although the combination listed
below will minimize disk swapping, it is not as practical for large
programs as other configurations that require an additional disk(s)
for your libraries.

The following are the four steps to this setup:

1. Below is a description of the distribution of QuickC Version 2.00
   files over five 360K floppies. After each disk number is a list
   of files that you need to copy to that disk. The following is the
   description:

      disk 1:   qc.exe

      disk 2:   qcc.ovl
                c1.err
                cl.err
                link.exe
                ilink.exe
                ilinkstb.ovl

      disk 3:   qc.hlp

      disk 4:   qcenv.hlp
                errors.hlp
                graphics.hlp
                notes.hlp
                (There is plenty of room left on this disk for
                addition help files.)

      disk 5:   \include\*.h    (It is best to copy just the header
                                 files that you require.)
                \include\sys\stat.h
                \include\sys\timeb.h
                \include\sys\types.h
                \include\sys\utime.h
                \include\sys\locking.h
                \lib\xlibce.lib (without graphics.lib or pgchart.lib)
                source files

      The following are notes on disk 5:

      The notation "\include\*.h" means that you must create a
      directory named "include" on disk five, and copy the necessary
      header files (files with the .h extension) to this directory.
      "\include\sys\.." means that you must create a subdirectory
      "sys" inside the "include" directory and copy the files listed
      into it.

      If you copy all of the header files, there is room for a
      combined library without any graphics, and about 45K remains for
      your source file. Due to this behavior, it's better to only copy
      needed header files. If you want to use graphics or pgchart, in
      all practicality, you should put your library or libraries onto
      another disk, and swap when the linker asks for it.

      The notation "\lib\xlibce.lib" means you must create a "lib"
      directory and copy a combined library to this directory.
      xLIBCE.LIB is your combined library where "x" is S, M, C, or L
      (small, medium, compact, or large).

      To build the combined libraries, you can invoke the SETUP.EXE
      program to specifically build them for you. Type "setup /L" (use
      /L, not /l).

2. Set your environment variables as follows:

      PATH=a:\;b:\
      set INCLUDE=b:\include
      set LIB=b:\lib

   You can set these variables at the DOS command prompt
   ("set path=a:\;b:\") or you can place these settings within
   a batch file. When typing these variables, it is vital that
   you do not add extraneous characters (such as spaces) to them
   because they will mislead DOS. The following lists two common
   errors when setting environment variables:

      set path = a:\;b:\ &lt;enter&gt;    &lt;--spaces invalidate this setting.
      set path=a:\;b:\ &lt;space(s)&gt;&lt;enter&gt;  &lt;--spaces at the end also
                                             invalidate the setting.

3. Add the following two lines to your CONFIG.SYS file:

      files=20
      buffers=15

   (You must reboot after this modification for the changes to take
   effect.)

4. Make Drive B: your default drive by typing "B:".
