This article provides a list of possible software and hardware
conflicts that may cause a program to hang (in the QB.EXE editor or in
an executable .EXE program). To determine why a program might hang,
the possibilities below should be checked.

If the steps below are followed and the program still hangs, the
problem may be related to a coding error or a problem associated with
QuickBASIC itself.

The information in this article applies to the following products:

1. Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 1.00, 1.02, 2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00,
   4.00b, and 4.50 for IBM PC and compatibles

2. Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and
   MS OS/2

3. The QBX.EXE environment of Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for
   MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

The following are potential software conflicts:

1. Terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs. QuickBASIC is not
   designed for use with most TSRs and does not support them.
   Remove these programs and reboot the computer without loading
   the TSRs.

2. Networks. Unsupported networks fall into the same category as TSRs,
   and they should be removed. (However, there should be no problem
   with the IBM PC Network or MS Network, both of which are
   supported.)

3. Operating systems. Always use the standard operating system
   provided by the manufacturer of the computer. QuickBASIC is not
   supported under multiuser or multitasking operating systems.
   Try using the standard PC-DOS or MS-DOS with the computer.

4. Extended/expanded memory. QuickBASIC does not use either
   extended or expanded memory, and the drivers that provide this
   support should also be removed from the system.

Note: To ensure that there are no programs loaded in memory in all the
cases above, use the original DOS disk provided for the computer by
the manufacturer. There should be no special DEVICE=xxx.SYS statements
in your CONFIG.SYS file and no special programs installed by your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The following are potential hardware conflicts:

1. Incorrect math-coprocessor settings. If the math-coprocessor switch
   settings are incorrect, QuickBASIC may hang. By using the command
   "SET NO87=xxxx" at the DOS prompt, you inform QuickBASIC not to use
   or check for the math coprocessor. If QuickBASIC then works
   correctly, the switch settings may be incorrectly set. For more
   information on the correct switch settings, query on "NO87" in this
   Knowledge Base.

   Also, the speed of the coprocessor must be equal to or less than
   the speed of the computer's CPU (central processing unit);
   otherwise, a numeric exception error can hang the machine.

2. Video systems. The computer's video system should be a standard
   video system (CGA, EGA, VGA, or MONO-TEXT). There are several
   options available for checking the video system. Proper
   configuration of the video hardware can be performed by issuing
   three MS-DOS MODE commands, as follows:

      MODE MONO -- MONOCHROME SYSTEM
      MODE BW80 -- MONOCHROME MONITOR with COLOR GRAPHICS ADAPTER
      MODE CO80 -- COLOR SYSTEM, both ADAPTER and MONITOR

   If QB.EXE Version 4.50 does not operate with your video system, try
   invoking QuickBASIC with each of the video-specific options, such
   as the /b (black and white) option, the /nohi (no high-intensity)
   option, the /g (update screen as fast as possible) option, and the
   /h (high-resolution) option. For more information, query on the
   words "compatibilities and QuickBASIC" in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base.
