<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q42600
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 5.00 5.10
Operating System(s): MS-DOS

The formula given on Page 362 of the "Microsoft C for the MS-DOS
Operating System: Run-Time Library Reference" for Optimizing C Version
5.x and QuickC Version 1.x, and on Page 133 of the "Microsoft QuickC
2.00 Graphics Library Reference" is incorrect for most color EGA and
VGA video modes. The formula given is as follows:

   xwid = abs(x1-x2)+1;
   ywid = abs(y1-y2)+1;
   size = 4+((long) ((xwid*bits_per_pixel+7)/8)*(long)ywid);

This formula is accurate only for the following modes:

   _MRES4COLOR
   _MRESNOCOLOR
   _HRESBW
   _VRES2COLOR
   _MRES256COLOR
   _HERCMONO
   _ORESCOLOR

However, for most EGA and VGA color graphics modes, the correct
formula is as follows:

   xwid = abs(x1-x2)+1;
   ywid = abs(y1-y2)+1;
   size = 4 + ((bits_per_pixel * (long) ((xwid+7)/8)) * ywid);

This formula should be used exclusively for modes that utilize bit
planes. These modes are as follows:

   _MRES16COLOR
   _HRES16COLOR
   _ERESCOLOR
   _VRES16COLOR

Either formula is accurate for the following modes:

   _HRESBW
   _VRES2COLOR
   _HERCMONO
   _ORESCOLOR

A call to _getvideoconfig will determine the current video mode. This
call is also necessary to determine the bits_per_pixel value.

The following is an example of values that will yield an incorrect
result in _VRES16COLOR mode:

   x1 = 0;  y1 = 0;
   x2 = 4;  y2 = 5;

Note that for all cases, _imagesize does return the correct value.
Only the formula given in the reference manuals is incorrect.

The formula used internally by the _imagesize function is as follows:

   xwid = abs(x1-x2)+1;
   ywid = abs(y1-y2)+1;
   size = 4+(bits_per_plane*(long) ((xwid*linear_bits_per_pixel+7)/8)*ywid);

This formula is useful only for lending understanding of how the two
prior formulas are derived. It cannot be used in a C program for the
following reasons:

1. In this formula, linear_bits_per_pixel is the actual number of
   linear bits required to store a pixel. In the color EGA and VGA
   modes listed, this is not equivalent to the bitsperpixel field of
   the videoconfig structure. There is no way to determine this value
   within C.

2. There is no way to determine the bits_per_plane value within C.

The formula given on Page 392 of the run-time library reference is
correct for CGA, single-color, and _MRES256COLOR modes because bit
planes are not utilized in storing graphic images. That is,
bits_per_plane is equal to 1. Therefore, this factor may be simplified
out of the equation.

The formula given on Page 392 of the run-time library reference fails
on the listed EGA and VGA modes because bit planes are implemented in
storing graphics images under those modes. That is, bits_per_plane is
greater than 1. Also, linear_bits_per_pixel is not equivalent to the
bitsperpixel field of the videoconfig structure.

In elaborating on the bitsperpixel field of the videoconfig structure,
this value is as follows:

   vc.bitsperpixel = linear_bits_per_pixel * bits_per_plane;

For more information on bit planes and pixel maps, refer to the
"Programmer's Guide to PC &amp; PS/2 Video Systems" by Richard Wilton,
Pages 87-91.
