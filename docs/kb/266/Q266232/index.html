The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On some Microsoft Windows 9x-based clients, when you install the Remote Control
agent, the computer may stop responding (hang) while displaying low-resource
error messages. While the computer hangs, a background process named Winoldap
runs. When this issue occurs, the Remctrl.log file contains the following text:

  Performing a INSTALL type installation
  Starting install.log
  Successfully notified SMS that installation has not completed.
  Remote Control Installation starting.
  Looking for conflicting products on a Windows 9X system
  Installing SMS Remote Control on Windows 95.
  Installing Windows 95 Remote Control Files.
  Checking the client machine type.

NOTE: This error message is an example from a computer running Windows 95. Error
messages may differ between operating systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem for English-based clients, obtain the latest service
pack for Systems Management Server version 2.0. For additional information,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q236325 SMS: How to Obtain and Install Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack 2

To resolve this problem for International clients, obtain the Systems Management
Server version 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) Hotfix Rollup package (HRP). For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q323206 SMS: List of Bugs Fixed in the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use any of the following methods:

- Quit the Winoldap process:

  1. On the client, press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.

  2. Click Winoldap, and then click End Task.

  3. Reboot the client computer. The Remote Control agent should be installed
     properly after the client restarts.

- You can work around this problem by disabling the Remote Tools Client agent
  on the entire site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

When the client hangs, Remctrl.exe is attempting to determine the computer type.
This detection is necessary so that Remctrl.exe can determine if the Nec-PC98
components need to be installed. The Pcdetect code first attempts to read a
SetupMachineType registry value (from
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ENUM\ROOT\*PNP0C01\0000) to determine the computer type. If
this process does not succeed, Remctrl.exe loads a real-mode program
(Pcddos.exe) to perform the computer-type detection.

To force LSM to perform a polling cycle when the LSM thread or Systems Management
Server Executive service is stopped and restarted, set the following registry
value to 0 (zero):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER\Last
  Update Cycle
