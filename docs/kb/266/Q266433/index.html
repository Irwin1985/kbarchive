SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch that addresses a range of vulnerabilities in
local procedure call (LPC) functionality and LPC ports. These vulnerabilities
include:

- Invalid LPC request - This vulnerability affects only Windows NT 4.0-based
  computers. By levying an invalid LPC request, the affected computer may not
  work.

- LPC memory exhaustion - This vulnerability affects both Windows NT 4.0-based
  computers and Windows 2000-based computers. When malicious LPC requests are
  sent, the number of queued LPC messages may increase and kernel memory may be
  depleted.

- Predictable LPC message identifier - This vulnerability affects both Windows
  NT 4.0-based computers and Windows 2000-based computers. Any process that is
  aware of the identifier of an LPC message can access it, however, the
  identifiers can be predicted. In the simplest case, a malicious user can
  access other processed LPC ports and send them random data as a denial of
  service attack. In the worst case, the malicious user may be able to send
  spurious requests to a privileged process to receive additional local
  privileges.

- Spoofed LPC port request - This is a new variant of the previously reported
  "spoofed LPC port request" vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both
  Windows NT 4.0-based computers and Windows 2000-based computers, and can,
  under very restricted conditions, allow a malicious user to create a process
  that runs under the security context of an already-running process, which may
  include system processes.

NOTE: Because you can use LPC only on the local computer, none of these
vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. Instead, a malicious user can exploit
these vulnerabilities only on a computer that the malicious user can log on to
interactively. Typically, workstations and terminal server computers are at risk
because, if normal security practices are followed, users are not allowed to log
on to critical servers interactively. This also means that, even in the worst
case, the malicious user can get only additional local privileges and not domain
privileges.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
