-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After granting Windows 2000 global groups permission within the Systems
Management Server Administrator console, users of these groups may not inherit
class or instance rights that are defined for the group. Users will be able to
connect, and see the various nodes (such as collections), but will not be able
to view any objects (such as All Systems).

At the same time, users who are explicitly defined within Systems Management
Server security, who do not rely on groups for access, inherit permissions as
expected.

NOTE: This may occur in either Windows 2000 Mixed, or Native Mode domains.

NOTE: No errors are being generated, not even in the SMSProv log.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when the SMS Provider uses an anonymous connection to
retrieve the logged user's group membership from the PDC emulator.

There are currently three known scenarios in which this problem occurs:

- The Everyone group is not a member of the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access
  group. This could be caused if the "Permissions compatible with only Windows
  2000 Servers" is selected during the Dcpromo process described in the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q257988 Description of Dcpromo Permissions Choices

- The Default Domain Policy under Computer Configuration|Windows Settings|Local
  Policies|Security Options|Additional restrictions for anonymous connections
  is configured to "No access without explicit anonymous permissions".

- The Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group does not have the requisite
  directory access permissions.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Systems Management Server Provider makes an anonymous connection to a domain
controller in the domain to determine a users group membership. By default,
Windows 2000 permits all authenticated users and members of the Pre-Windows 2000
Compatible Access group to view group membership. Because the Everyone group is
a member of the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group by default, anonymous
access can be used to retrieve group membership.
