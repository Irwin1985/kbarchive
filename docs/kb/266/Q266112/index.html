Page 493, Missing Answers To Questions On Page 92
-------------------------------------------------

On page 493, there are no answers provided for the exercise questions found on
page 92. Here are the missing answers:

1. What would be the appropriate grain for this data mart? Why?

Because the Northwind database is not very large, select the lowest grain your
system supports. This way, you can better support unexpected queries and your
schema will be more adaptable.

2. Which tables would be appropriate dimension tables? Why?

Product, to analyze product sales trends.
Customer, to analyze what the customers typically buy and what the regional
trends are.
Employee, to find out which employees are most productive.
In addition, you might want to include the Time dimension, to analyze how trends
change over time.

3. Which tables in the Northwind database would best represent the fact table?

Orders, because it contains transaction facts.
Order Details, because it contains line-item facts.

4. Which measures would you include in the fact table?

You need quantity, discount, line item total, and line item freight.

Question 5 is not applicable here and should be removed.
