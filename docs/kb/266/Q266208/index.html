service that depends on remote procedure call (RPC) service may not start and
you may receive the following event log notices:

  Event ID: 7022
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: The remote procedure call (RPC) service hung on startup.

  Event ID: 7001
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: HTTP server service depends on the MUP service which failed to
  start because of the following error: An instance of the service is already
  running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, remove the IntranetWare client and then restart the
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior may also occur on some Compaq computers. Apply the latest Compaq NT
Support Software Disk (NT SSD) from the Compaq Smartstart CD-ROM. Then manually
stop all the services and re-add them one at a time to identify which device is
causing the behavior.
