The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server

SYMPTOMS
========

The procedures for copying and moving files are the same for Microsoft Windows
2000 Server and Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional as they are for Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 and earlier versions. The main difference is the automatic
inheritance of permissions in Microsoft Windows 2000.

When a file is copied from one location to another location, whether on the same
or different volume, a new file is created in the destination location. The file
inherits the permissions, the Access Control List (ACL), from its parent
folder.

When a file is moved from one location to another on the same volume, the file
retains its security descriptor. Only the pointer to the resource is modified.

When a file is moved from one location to another on a different volume, it acts
similar to the copy, except the file is deleted from the source location. The
moved file inherits the permission from the parent folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To move a file within the same volume and have it inherit from the parent
folder, follow these steps:

1. Prior to moving the file, clear the "Allow inheritable permissions from the
  parent to propagate to this object" check box.

2. Click Copy to copy the current permissions to the object.

3. Move the file or folder to a different location on the same volume.

4. Click "Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagate to this
  object".

5. Click Apply.

  The permissions from the parent folder are added to the security descriptor of
  this object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Files and folders are security objects. Every security object has a security
descriptor attached to it. The Master File Table (MFT) record that defines the
contents of the file or folder has a pointer to a $Security_Descriptor
attribute.

A security descriptor contains a Discretionary Access Control List (DACL),
consisting of a list of access control entries (ACE). Each ACE consists of a
Security Identification Number (SID), together with a list of accesses that the
security principal, referred to by the SID, has to the resource.
