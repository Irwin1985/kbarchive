  Microsoft Technical Support

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Internet Information Server Version 4.0 
--------------------------------------------------

- Windows NT 4.0 and Service Pack 3: The Windows NT(r) Server service must be
  installed and running.

- When installing IIS 4.0 on a computer running Windows NT Server, the NetLogon
  and Computer Browser services must be running. If these services are not
  running, you will receive a dialog that says "Cannot detect OS type" and
  Setup will fail.

- Removal of Alpha, Beta 1, or Beta 2 software: If you have IIS version 4.0
  Alpha or IIS version 4.0 (Beta 1 or Beta 2), be sure to uninstall that
  release (before installing the current release). To do this, first start the
  Setup program from the compact disc containing the earlier release or, in
  Windows NT, click "Start", point to "Programs", point to "Microsoft Internet
  Information Server (Common)", and then click "Internet Information Server
  Setup". Click "Next", then click "Remove All".

  ODBC installation errors will occur during setup if there are any other
  applications or system services running that use the existing ODBC on the
  system. If any ODBC errors occur, please stop all desktop and system service
  applications, and run Setup again.

  NOTES

  The Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack only can be installed on Windows NT Server 4.0
  and Windows NT Workstation 4.0.

  The Personal Web Server for Windows 95 contained in the Windows NT 4.0 Option
  Pack installs on both Windows 95 and Beta 3 of Windows 98.

  The Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack cannot be installed on any version of Windows
  NT 5.0.

Other Installation Considerations:

  Reinstalling Windows NT Service Pack 3:
  If you reinstall Windows NT Service Pack 3 for any reason after IIS 4.0 is
  installed, do not overwrite the newer files that were installed by IIS 4.0.

  Uninstalling the Product:
  To uninstall the product, rerun the Setup program for this release. There are
  several ways to access the Setup program. You can use the compact disc, or
  click "Start", point to "Programs", point to "Windows NT Option Pack 4.0",
  and then click "Windows NT Option Pack 4.0 Setup". Follow the instructions in
  the dialog boxes and, when prompted, click the "Add/Remove" button to
  uninstall the software.

  Installation Errors and Problems:

- Errors that occur during unattended setup will be written to the Windows NT
  registry. Navigate to the following registry path for error information:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ 
Software
 \Microsoft
  \Windows
   \Setup
    \OCmanager
     \Errors

- When installing IIS 4.0 on a Windows NT Server Backup Domain Controller
  (BDC), in Setup you should select the Custom installation option and disable
  Index Server and the Web Wide Web Sample Site. If you want to install Index
  server or Web Wide Web Sample Site on a BDC, use Add/Remove feature in
  Control Panel to install these components after the IIS installation has
  completed.

Upgrading Considerations:

- IIS version 4.0 is not compatible with Microsoft Proxy Server 1.0. In order
  to use Proxy server with IIS, please upgrade Proxy Server from version 1.0 to
  version 2.0. Proxy Server version 2.0 should be installed or reinstalled
  after IIS is upgraded to version 4.0. Additionally, present installations of
  Proxy Server 2.0 will not function properly after IIS 4.0 has been installed.
  You should rerun Proxy Server 2.0 Setup after installing IIS 4.0.

- If you are upgrading from a previous version of IIS and you have trouble
  viewing Default.asp, then you probably have an older version of this file. In
  order to install the newer IIS 4.0 version of this file, you must manually
  remove the older version of Default.asp. The default location is
  C:\InetPub\Wwwroot.

- You cannot use Internet Service Manager for Internet Information Server 3.0
  to configure administrative properties for Internet Information Server 4.0.

  Certificate Server Issues:
  If you have Certificate Server installed, you must stop this service before
  installing IIS. If you do not, you will not have properly installed the
  updated ODBC drivers. In general, it is a good idea to shut down all
  background applications before running Setup to avoid issues.

  To stop the Certificate Server service on Windows NT, click "Start", point to
  "Settings", click "Control Panel", and run the Services application. Select
  "Certificate Authority", then click the "Stop" button. To restart the service
  after the IIS installation has successfully completed, open "Control Panel",
  start the "Services" application, select "Certificate Authority", and click
  the "Start" button.

  If you receive an error during setup that Msdasql.dll or Odbc*.dll failed to
  be loaded, you will need to cancel setup, stop the services, and restart.

  Setup.exe is not code signed:
  When running Setup from the IIS CD from the setup Web page, Internet Explorer
  will display an error message indicating that Setup.exe has not been code
  signed. Setup.exe is a 16-bit file and 16-bit file formats cannot be code
  signed.

Product Documentation
---------------------

All documentation for the product is available online. You can access the Help
topics by clicking "Start" and pointing to the program group where the product
is installed, or by using the "Help" menu of the administration tool.
Context-sensitive help is also available by clicking the "Help" button on a
property sheet or dialog box.

Using the Documentation:

Please observe the following guidelines when using the online documentation:

- The WWW service must be installed and the server must be running in order to
  view the documentation (with the exception of release notes and
  troubleshooting files). If the Web site is stopped, when you click "Product
  Documentation" you will get a message that "A connection with the server
  could not be established." If you get this error, start Internet Service
  Manager and check the status of the Web site; if the site is stopped, then
  start the service.

- In Internet Explorer 4.01 users must enable the "Bypass proxy server for
  local (Intranet) addresses" option on the "Connection" property sheet in
  order to view local files, such as the product documentation

- If you click the print icon in the Option Pack product documentation
  "Contents" frame and select the option "Print everything contained in the
  current heading", you may experience a temporary performance degradation on
  the server if the selected section contains a large number of topics. Pages
  printed by using the Contents print icon will not include graphics or linked
  documents. Also, the Contents print icon does not work in conjunction with
  the sample scripts and programs found in the Developer Samples section of the
  IIS documentation. If you select a topic in the Developer Samples section and
  click the Contents print icon, you will receive an error message indicating
  that the file cannot be found.

- In order to view the IIS documentation remotely, please use the following
  URL: http://&lt;servername&gt;/iisHelp/ where &lt;servername&gt; is the
  nameof the server running IIS.

Other Known Problems and Limitations
------------------------------------

The following list contains known problems and limitations in this release:

  Administration
  Remote Administration with Internet Service Manager (HTML)
  Internet Server Application Program Interface (ISAPI)
  Active Server Pages
  Server Security
  Exploration Air Sample Site Issues
  General

Administration:

- In previous versions of IIS, you could stop the entire Web service by typing
  at the command line "net stop w3svc". This would terminate all of the Web
  services on the computer, and shut down the Inetinfo.exe process. As a result
  of the new multiple Web site architecture, there is another service,
  Iisadmin, that keeps running, even when W3SVC is shut down. The same is true
  for starting and stopping services from Control Panel. If you truly want to
  unload the Inetinfo.exe process, and make sure that all of the extensions are
  unloaded properly, you should now type "net stop iisadmin", rather than "net
  stop w3svc". Typing "net start w3svc" or "net start msftpsvc" automatically
  starts Iisadmin.

- When you start the Web server it migrates all new virtual roots in the
  registry to the metabase ("new" meaning, not already in the metabase). The
  server then deletes all registry virtual roots and mirrors the virtual roots
  from the metabase to those of the registry. Any change to metabase virtual
  roots re-mirrors the virtual roots to the registry, deleting any registry
  entries changed or added since the original installation.

- The PStore service must be running in order to run IIS.

- If you have a .dll file with special dependencies that require these files to
  be loaded before other Web server processes, you can create a
  registry-defined list of those .dll files that are to be preloaded into
  Inetinfo.exe program before any other Web server services start up.

  To preload .dll files, create a new registry key called PreloadDlls at the
  following registry path:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ 
SYSTEM
 \CurrentControlSet
  \Services
   \Inetinfo
    \Parameters

  Set this entry as type multi-sz, with data consisting of the names of the .dll
  files that you want to preload (separated by carriage returns). If the files
  reside in the same path, you can type just the name of the .dll file. If the
  .dll file resides in another directory, type file name and its full path.

- When you attempt to backup Web site configuration information you will be
  prompted to type in a comment phrase before saving the configuration
  information. However, you cannot save this information if your comment
  includes non-alphanumeric characters, including nonprintable characters, or
  any of the following characters:
  / \ \ * . ? \ "&amp; ! @ # $ % ^ ( ) = + | ` ~

- You cannot use Internet Service Manager to remotely administer a computer
  running IIS 4.0 Beta 3.0 from a computer running the final release of IIS
  4.0. Likewise, you cannot administer a computer running IIS 4.0 final release
  from one running IIS 4.0 Beta 3.0. This applies to all other applications
  using the AdminBase interface. The workaround is to put the released version
  of the file Admwprox.dll on all machines and then reboot.

Remote Administration with Internet Service Manager (HTML):

- To administer a remote computer running IIS 4.0 using Internet Server Manager
  (HTML) to you must log on with a valid administrator (or operator) account
  for that remote computer. With previous releases you could create a session
  to \\ServerName\IPC$ using a different user account to get access, this will
  not work for IIS 4.0. If you want to access Internet Service Manager (HTML)
  on a remote computer with a different account (that is, an account other than
  the account you use to log on the local computer), you must enable Basic
  Authentication and disable Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication on
  the Directory Security property sheet, so that you will be prompted for
  proper user account credentials.

- In order for Internet Service Manager (HTML) to function properly, you must
  set your browser's cache to refresh with every visit to an HTML page. In IE
  4.01 you can set this by following these steps:

  1. Select the "View" menu item.

  2. Select "Internet Options".

  3. On the "General" tab, click the "Settings" button.

  4. Under "Check for newer versions of stored pages", select the "Every visit
     to the page" option.

- Some Internet Information Server virtual directories are configured in such a
  way that they appear as non-virtual directories to the IIS Administration
  Objects. This configuration prevents the Administration Objects objects from
  being administered by means of Internet Service Manager (HTML). The following
  are the affected virtual directories:

  Iishelp/Ado
  Iishelp/Adc
  Iishelp/Msadc
  Iishelp/Ics
  Msadc
  Iishelp/Sse/Sa
  Iishelp/Sse/Uaexpress
  Iishelp/Ics/I_cmak
  Iishelp/Ics/I_cps
  Iishelp/Ics/I_ias
  CertSrv
  CertQue
  CertAdm
  CertControl

  A script called Fixcfg.vbs (located in Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples, by
  default) will correct this problem.

- When administering your Web server with Internet Service Manager (HTML)
  through a proxy connection, you cannot use Windows NT Challenge/Response
  authentication. Proxy servers will only allow your Web server to use Basic
  authentication.

- If you create a new Web site in Microsoft Management Console, Web site
  Operators cannot remotely connect to that site with Internet Service Manager
  (HTML) until you create a virtual directory called IISADMIN. (Note that users
  designated as Administrators are able to remotely administer the site through
  the Administrative Web Site without this virtual directory). If you create
  the Web site by using Internet Service Manager (HTML), then your Web server
  will automatically create the IISADMIN site because the server assumes that
  you will want to remotely administer that site.

  To create the IISADMIN virtual directory:
  1. In Internet Service Manager, select the Web site you want your Operators
     to remotely administer.

  2. Right-click, select "New", then click "Virtual Directory".

  3. In the "Alias" box, type in "IISADMIN", then click "Next".

  4. Type "&lt;DriveLetter&gt;:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmin" where you
     replace DriveLetter with the letter of your local drive. (This physical
     path is the same as the path for the Default Web Site's Iisadmin
     directory.) Click "Next".

  5. Select "Allow Read Access" and "Allow Script Access." Click "Next".

  6. Click "Finish".

  7. Select the new IISADMIN virtual directory for the Web site, and open its
     property sheets.

  8. Select "Directory Security" property sheet, and under "Anonymous Access"
     and "Authentication Control", click "Edit".

  9. Clear the "Allow Anonymous Access" check box.

  10. Select either "Basic Authentication" or "Windows NT Challenge/Response
     Authentication" and click "OK".

Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI):

- The configuration metabase property InProcessIsapiApps
  (MD_IN_PROCESS_ISAPI_APPS) now permits entries of .dll names without
  qualifying paths. An entry without a qualifying path will match any ISAPI
  request that contains the .dll name regardless of the physical path specified
  in the request. For example, the following would be a valid list for the
  property: "D:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Ssinc.dll"
  "D:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Httpodbc.dll" "Author.dll" "Shtml.dll"
  "Admin.dll".

- When debugging ISAPI applications, ISAPI filters, server components, or other
  code you are writing to run on top of IIS, it may be useful to run IIS as a
  process. Information about configuring IIS 4.0 to run as a process is
  outlined in the product documentation. Additional instructions and two .reg
  files that automate the process of switching IIS to run as a service or a
  process have been added to the IIS 4.0 SDK.

  To install the SDK

  1. In IIS Setup dialog box, select Internet Information Server then click
     "Show Subcomponents".

  2. Select Documentation, click "Show Subcomponents", then click "SDK".

  3. Click OK.

  You can find the instructions in
  Inetpub\Iissamples\Sdk\Components\IIS_as_process.txt. For more information,
  the topic "Establishing a Debugging Environment" in the Advanced Web
  Application Development section of the Internet Information Server
  documentation describes how to set up an environment for debugging ISAPI
  extensions.

- The metabase identifier MD_ALLOW_PATH_INFO_FOR_SCRIPT_MAPPINGS is not
  documented in the Metabase Identifier Reference in the Programmer's
  Reference. The documentation for the corresponding automation metabase
  property, AllowPathInfoForScriptMappings, in the Administration Property
  Reference also applies to MD_ALLOW_PATH_INFO_FOR_SCRIPT_MAPPINGS. The user
  type is IIS_MD_UT_SERVER.

- In the Metabase Identifier Reference, which is part of Programmer's Reference
  documentation for the metabase identifier MD_SCRIPT_MAPS, the constant
  MD_SCRIPTMAPFLAG_SCRIPT is incorrectly identified as
  MD_SCRIPTMAPFLAG_SCRIPT_ENGINE.

- The two configuration metabase properties, AppAllowDebugging and
  AppAllowClientDebug, can be set at the IIsWebDirectory key in addition to the
  other keys specified in the documentation.

Active Server Pages:

- Properties set for the ASP Request, Response, and Server objects are valid
  only during the processing of a request. For example, if you set a property
  in the Global.asa, such as Response.Buffer = True, the property will apply
  only to a single request and not to all requests.

- If you stop the WWW service from Internet Service Manager while debugging a
  script, then Internet Service Manager will not function until you resume
  execution of the script you are debugging. Normally, if you stop the Web
  service using Control Panel or the "net stop" command, scripts being debugged
  with Microsoft Script Debugger are terminated. However, if you stop a Web
  site from Internet Service Manager, then the site will stop operation if you
  are currently debugging scripts that are running on the server you are
  stopping. If you go to the Microsoft Script Debugger and select "Stop
  Debugging" for scripts that you are debugging, then Internet Service Manager
  will resume operation.

- There are currently known problems with using PerlScript with ASP. If you are
  running PerlScript from ActiveWare, contact ActiveWare for a new PerlScript
  engine.

- There is a mistake in the ASP documentation which states that the MapPath
  method does not support relative path syntax, such as ./path or ../path. The
  MapPath method will support relative path syntax only if the
  EnableParentPaths metabase property is enabled. When the EnableParentPaths
  property is not enabled, using the MapPath method with a relative path
  results in an error.

- When setting Windows NT permissions for a directory for which you intend to
  use use anonymous or Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication, you must
  assign the anonymous user account (IUSR_computername) or the application
  owner account (IWAM_computername) Read permissions if the directory contains
  an out-of-process application and a Global.asa. Failure to set the Read
  permission may result in ASP ignoring the Global.asa file.

  Similarly, for in-process applications contained in directories stored on a
  network drive, you must make sure that the anonymous user account has Windows
  NT Read permissions.

- In Microsoft(R) Visual Basic or VBScript, if you call GetObject() to
  instantiate an IIS Admin Object, and GetObject fails, the returned error code
  is changed in ole32 from MkParseDisplayName() to a MK_E_SYNTAX error.

- If you create or use components developed in Microsoft(R) Visual Basic(R) 5.0
  (Enterprise or Professional Editions) for use with ASP, it is strongly
  recommended that you upgrade to Visual Studio(TM) 97 Service Pack 2, both for
  your development and server computers. You can download the Visual Studio 97
  Service Pack 2 at http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/.

- The Scripting.Dictionary object is erroneously marked as Both-threaded. It
  should be marked as Apartment-threaded. To change this, use the Registry
  Editor to open the following registry key:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ 
 CLSID
  \{EE09B103-97E0-11CF-978F-00A02463E06F}
   \InprocServer32

  Change the named value for ThreadingModel to Apartment. If you use the
  Dictionary object at Application scope without making this change, corruption
  of data may occur.

Server Security:

- Although Internet Service Manager will allow you to enable password
  synchronization for a non-local anonymous user account, this is not a
  supported configuration, and may cause all access to your Web or FTP server
  to be denied. Password synchronization should only be used with anonymous
  user accounts defined on the local computer. If your Web site relies on the
  anonymous user being able to access network resources, you cannot use the
  anonymous authentication password synchronization feature and you must
  specify a valid password for the anonymous user.

Exploration Air Sample Site Issues:

- If you have not installed the Remote Data Service included with Microsoft
  Data Access Components 1.5, then you will need to edit the Prefs.txt file
  (located in Inetpub\IISSamples\ExAir\Benefits\Prefs.txt, by default) to
  disable the Remote Data Service feature, which is used in the Benefits
  application of the Exploration Air. Specifically, set the RDSAvailable change
  from True to False.

- When using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) feature for file uploading, the
  Posting Acceptor component will correctly upload a file onto your Web server;
  however, the redirect to Verify.asp will fail. This will have no functional
  effect on the Posting Acceptor Component.

- The Exploration Air sample site's Microsoft SQL Server database is configured
  to use the default user ID (UID) and password (that is, UID=sa and no
  password.) Other SQL configurations will not work.

- The file upload component found in the Business Partners Only link will not
  work if the directory for the file upload is not properly configured.
  Following is a procedure you can use to to configure your system for file
  upload:

  1. In the IISSamples\ExAir\BusinessPartners directory, create a subdirectory
     called Upload.

  2. Click "Start", point to "Programs", point to "Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack",
     point to "Internet Information Server", and then click "Internet Service
     Manager".

  3. In the left pane of "Internet Service Manager", click Internet Information
     Server folder, then double-click your icon named as your server.

  4. Double-click "Default Web Site", then navigate to the
     "IISSamples/ExAir/Business Partners/Upload" virtual directory.

  5. Right-click "Upload", and select "Properties". In the "Directory" property
     sheet, under "Access Permissions", select "Write".

  6. Under Permissions in "Application Settings", select "None". These settings
     will allow the "Posting Acceptor" component to work properly.

  7. Close the Internet Service Manager and retry file uploading.

General:

- In addition to versioning your Web server configuration, the backup and
  restore feature can be used to restore a previous IIS configuration when a
  problem occurs that can be fixed by uninstalling and then re-installing IIS.
  However, this process will not work when a complete re-installation of the
  operating system is required. If your computer encounters a problem that
  requires you to reinstall the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, use the following
  procedure to restore a previous configuration:

  1. In left pane of "Internet Service Manager", click the Internet Information
     Server folder, then select then icon with the name of your computer.

  2. From the Internet Service Manager tool bar, click "Action", then select
     "Backup/Restore Configuration".

  3. In the "Configuration Backup/Restore" dialog box, click "Create Backup".

  4. In the "Configuration Backup Name" dialog box, type a name for the backup
     file. By default, the backup file will be stored in the
     C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Metaback directory. Alternatively, the backup
     file may be stored in the directory specified in the following registry
     entry (that is, if you have created this entry):

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ 
SOFTWARE
 \Microsoft
  \InetStp
   \MetaBackup

     Select the value BackupPath, which contains the name of the backup file you
     created with Internet Service Manager.

  5. Copy the file to a location outside of the Inetsrv subdirectory. Backup
     files in the Metaback subdirectory are deleted during the uninstall.

  6. Uninstall and then re-install the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.

  7. Copy the backup file to the Metaback subdirectory
     (C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Metaback\ , by default.)

  8. In the "Configuration Backup Name" dialog box, select the backup file you
     created, and then click "Restore". Although the restoration may fail, a
     portion of your backed up configuration will be restored.

  9. At a command-prompt type, "cscript.exe
     C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples\Adsutil.vbs enum w3svc". This
     command will list several IIS Web service settings. From the settings
     listed find the WamUserName and WAMUserPass evalues. These values
     represent the the user ID and password that the Windows Application
     Manager (WAM) uses to start out-of-process applications. During
     re-installation, the password is reset in the User Manager.

     NOTE: To use the Adsutil.vbs utility you must have installed the Windows
     Script Host as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack installation.

  10. Click "Start", point to "Administrative Tools" and click "User Manager
     for Domains". Double-click the IWAM_&lt;computername&gt; user account.
     Type the password retrieved from the previous step.

  11. Click OK.

  12. In the "Configuration Backup Name" dialog box, select the backup file you
     created, and then click "Restore". Your configuration should now be fully
     restored.

  NOTE: If you change the identity of your out-of-process applications, then
  those applications will revert back to the previous IWAM user name.

- Uninstalling Microsoft SNA Server 3.08 removes the Microsoft ODBC
  Administrator file (Odbcad32.exe). However, you can manually access the
  functionality achieved by this doing the following:

  1. From the "Start" menu, point to "Settings", then click "Control Panel".

  2. Double-click the "ODBC" icon. With the "ODBC Data Source Administrator"
     dialog box, you can create, edit, and view ODBC data sources, and carry
     out other ODBC administrative tasks.

- In the IIS documentation, the Monitoring Counters for Web Sites topic refers
  to the Trace Requests/sec counter. This counter is not available, although
  the Total Trace Requests counter is available.

- You cannot execute the ADSI Configuration Restore function from within a Web
  Server application (like Active Server Pages or CGI applications). Executing
  Configuration Restore from a Web Server application will cause the server to
  stop responding.

- Microsoft Index Server Issues:
  When you create a new Web site, the site is not indexed by default. You must
  select the "Index this directory option" on the "Home Directory" property
  sheet.

- Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition:
  Important: The clustering features described in the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack
  documentation are available only with the Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition
  and are not part of this Option Pack. When installing IIS over the clustering
  features of the Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition, the IIS setup Wizard will
  exit if the cluster is not installed and shared correctly. To ensure the best
  IIS and cluster setup use the following steps:

  1. Install the clustering features of the Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition
     on both nodes of the cluster, start the cluster service, and verify
     operation.

     NOTE: In order to install Internet Information Server on Windows NT
     Enterprise Edition, the path to the Windows directory must be the same on
     the two nodes of the cluster.

  2. Use the Cluster Administrator to move the cluster disk resource into the
     same group as the cluster Name resource.

  3. Install IIS on one node and do not reboot. Stop at the dialog box saying
     that IIS should be installed on the other node before proceeding.

  4. Install IIS on the second node and proceed with restarting both nodes.

     NOTE: During installation of the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack on the first
     node of an Enterprise cluster, a warning message indicating an error in
     the IIS Server Instance resource type may appear on the second node.
     Disregard this message. The installation will proceed normally after
     completion of the second node installation.

- Prior to running the iissync command-line utility to replicate the metabase
  from your server to a target computer on a cluster, you must set the
  replication share on the source computer in Transaction Server Explorer. Use
  the following procedure:

  1. In the left pane of Internet Service Manager, double-click the "Console
     Root" folder, then double-click the "Microsoft Transaction Server", then
     double-click the "Computers" folder.

  2. Click the "My Computer" icon, open the "My Computer" property sheets, and
     then select the "Options" property sheet.

  3. Under "Replication", in the "Replication Share" box type the name of a
     Windows NT shared directory accessible by the target computer.

  4. Click OK.

- Internet Information Server 3.0 supported a cluster resource type called IIS
  Virtual Root. This resource type is no longer supported and has been replaced
  in IIS 4.0 by the IIS Server Instance resource type. If instances of the
  obsolete resource type are present following installation of IIS 4.0, use the
  Cluster Administrator to delete the instances.

- When installing IIS 4.0 on Windows NT Enterprise Edition with Microsoft
  Message Queue Server already installed, in certain cases Setup will fail and
  display the following error message:

  MS Data Access components 1.5

  Unable to register the following file: C:\Program Files\Common
  Files\System\Ole db\Msdasql.dll

  If this message appears, click OK and allow Setup to complete. When the "Setup
  of World Wide Web Server" failed error message appears, click OK. Run IIS
  Setup again and choose "Remove All", then reinstall IIS. The MS Data Access
  components will install without setup failing.
