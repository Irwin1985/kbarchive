-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, the
installation may fail, and the following error message may be displayed:

  Could not open file E:\Program
  Files\Exchange\Connect\Exchconn\Setup\LMEISTAT.TXT to check return code of
  LME utility. Setup cannot continue.

The actual path may vary.

CAUSE
=====

Exchange Server is installed to a path with a space character in it. By default,
Exchange Server is installed to the Exchsrvr folder located on a certain drive.
You can configure the Setup program to install Exchange Server to a different
path. However, if the path name includes a space character (" "), for example,
C:\Exchange Server, the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes cannot be installed
properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem you need to edit the registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Stop all Exchange Server services.

2. Create a new folder to install the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes, for
  example, E:\Exchsrvr.

3. Go to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

  If a sub tree Exchconn exists, delete it.

4. Go to the following registry key:

  \HKEY_LOCALMACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup\Services

  This key points to your existing Exchange Server path. Write down the current
  value. Change this value to the folder that you created in step 2.

5. Run the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes again.

6. Revert the registry key in step 4 to the original value.

7. Restart all of the Exchange Server services.
