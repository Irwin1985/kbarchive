The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.03, 8.04 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has confirmed that the dates of the following holidays in Microsoft
Outlook 97 and Microsoft Outlook 98 are incorrect:

- United States: Memorial Day is incorrectly listed as one week prior to the
  actual date of Memorial Day.

- United States: Thanksgiving Day is incorrectly listed as one week or one day
  prior to the actual date of Thanksgiving Day.

- United States: Columbus Day is incorrectly listed as October 12 every year,
  as opposed to the actual date of Columbus Day which is the second Monday in
  October.

- United Kingdom: Spring Bank Holiday, 1999, is incorrectly listed as May 24,
  1999, instead of May 31, 1999.

- United Kingdom: Late Summer Holiday, 1999, is incorrectly listed as August
  23, 1999, instead of August 30, 1999.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the incorrect dates for these holidays are included
in the Outlook.txt file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the appropriate method.

How to Correct the Dates Before You Add Holidays to Your Calendar
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already added the holidays to the Outlook Calendar, use a text
editor such as Notepad to correct the dates in the Outlook.txt file, and then
import the holidays for your country/region. To do this, use the following
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files and Folders".

2. In the Named box, type "Outlook.txt" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the "Look in" box, click the hard disk on which Outlook is installed, and
  then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, double-click the Outlook.txt file.

  If you receive a message that states that the file is too large for Notepad,
  click Yes to open the file in WordPad.

5. Scroll down to the appropriate section for your country/region, and then
  change the incorrect holiday dates to the correct dates.

  For example:

  [United Kingdom]

  Change: "Spring Bank Holiday, 1999/05/24"

  to: "Spring Bank Holiday, 1999/05/31" (without the quotation marks).

6. On the File menu, click Save.

7. On the File menu, click Exit.

How to Import the Corrected Holiday List:

1. Start Outlook.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. On the Preferences tab, click Calendar Options.

4. Under Calendar Options, click Add Holidays, and then click to select the
  check box for your country/region.

5. Click OK on each of the three dialog boxes to close them.

How to Correct the Dates After You Add Holidays to Your Calendar
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you already added the holidays to the Outlook Calendar, follow these steps to
adjust the incorrect dates:

1. Open the Outlook Calendar that contains the incorrect holiday dates.

2. Navigate to a holiday with an incorrect date.

3. Double-click the all-day appointment for the holiday to open it.

4. Change the date to the correct date in the "Start time" box and in the "End
  time" box.

5. On the toolbar, click the "Save and Close" button.

6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 to change any other incorrect dates in your Outlook
  Calendar.
