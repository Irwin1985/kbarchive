Welcome to Microsoft SMTP Service
---------------------------------

Before installing this product, review this entire document.

Microsoft SMTP Service is a commercial-grade implementation of SMTP that is
designed to meet the high-traffic loads required by mission-critical
applications. Key benefits of Microsoft SMTP Service include:

- A robust, scalable, well-integrated SMTP server.

- Internet Service Manager and Microsoft Management Console (MMC) support for
  administration.

- Default restrictions to prevent Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail (UCE) from
  being relayed through the server.

- Domain routing for fine-tuning SMTP delivery options.

- Secure mail transmission using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

- Transaction logs for offline processing to collect usage statistics, track
  messages and transactions, and examine usage patterns.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardware and Software Requirements
----------------------------------

This version of Microsoft SMTP Service has the same minimum hardware requirements
as Windows NT Server (IIS) version 4.0 and Microsoft Internet Information Server
version 4.0. It is important to plan thoroughly before you build your mail
service.

To install Microsoft SMTP Service, you must have the following software
installed:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0

- A partition large enough to hold the SMTP queue

- Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 (or later), which is available from the
  \Support\Qfe directory on the installation compact disc or from
  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/support/default.asp

- Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing Microsoft SMTP Service
---------------------------------

IMPORTANT: You cannot use Microsoft SMTP Service as an upgrade from previous
versions of Microsoft Commercial Internet System (MCIS) Mail Server. If you are
upgrading to Microsoft SMTP Service, use the following procedure to remove
previous versions of Microsoft MCIS Mail Server before running Setup.

To remove MCIS Mail Server:

1. Pause Microsoft SMTP Service so that queued messages can be delivered.

2. Monitor the Mailroot\Queue directory to determine when the Queue directory is
  empty. When it is empty, stop Microsoft SMTP Service.

3. In Control Panel, double-click the "Add/Remove Programs" application.

4. In the "Install/Uninstall" property sheet, select "MCIS Mail Server" in the
  list box.

5. Click "Add/Remove".

6. Restart the computer.

To install Microsoft SMTP Service:

1. Install Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3.

2. Install Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 and the Microsoft
  SMTP Service component using one of the options in the following table.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| IIS 4.0 Setup Option | Description                                                                                                                             | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Typical              | Microsoft SMTP Service and all related documentation is installed.                                                                      | 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Custom               | You can select Microsoft SMTP Service and related documentation options as a subcomponent of the Internet Information Server component. |

Restrictions on Relaying Mail Through Microsoft SMTP Service
------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the growing problem on the Internet concerning Unsolicited Commercial
E-Mail (UCE), Microsoft SMTP Service, by default, does not allow mail to be
relayed through it to an external e-mail address. Mail addressed to any domain
not configured for the SMTP site is rejected with the error "550 Unable to relay
for &lt;mail address&gt;." To allow mail to be relayed from specific IP
addresses, change the settings in the "Relay Restrictions" section of the
"Directory Security" property sheet.

NOTE: Changing the settings to allow unrestricted relay through your SMTP server
on the Internet makes your site a prime target for UCE. UCE can consist of
special offers, commentaries, or any message a sender wants to convey to as many
recipients as possible across the Internet. Often, senders relay UCE through
well-known, trusted servers on the Internet to make messages appear as though
they originated from a trusted host, or to make it difficult to determine the
origin of the messages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Client Software
---------------

Microsoft SMTP Service included in the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack is designed to
be used as an outbound mailer for mail-enabled applications. It does not provide
the POP3 or IMAP4 protocol support necessary for use by e-mail client software.
Mailboxes are not available in Microsoft SMTP Service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secure Mail Transmission
------------------------

To protect communications, you can configure Microsoft SMTP Service to encrypt
SMTP transmissions using Transport Layer Security (TLS). This protection is
provided through the STARTTLS SMTP protocol command. The command is described in
the Internet draft titled "SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS," and
located at ftp://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-smtp-ssl-03.txt.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installing the Collaboration Data Objects 
for Windows NT Server Header File
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developers using the Collaboration Data Objects for Windows NT Server library,
Cdonts.dll, may also need the header file. This header file is useful for C++
developers and contains class and dual interface definitions, class IDs,
constants, and error codes. The Cdonts.h header file is available from the
following location on the installation compact disc:

\ntoptpak\en\&lt;x86 | alpha&gt;\winnt.srv

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuring Authentication for All Browsers
-------------------------------------------

If the browser you are using does not support Windows NT Challenge/Response for
authentication, you can change the default Web site setting to transmit account
and password information in clear text. To change the authentication setting,
complete the following steps:

1. Start Internet Service Manager and expand the directory hierarchy for the
  default web site.

2. Select the "Mail" folder.

3. Select "Properties" from the "Action" menu and then select the "Directory
  Security" property sheet.

4. Under "Anonymous Access and Authentication Control", choose "Edit".

5. Select "Basic Authentication".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Internet Service Manager (HTML)
-------------------------------------

With Internet Service Manager (HTML), you can operate Microsoft SMTP Service
remotely using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). To use this tool, you must
use Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 or later, or another Web browser.
The configuration options are the same in Internet Service Manager (HTML) as in
Internet Service Manager, with the following exceptions:

- Configuring relay restrictions for managing UCE

- Enabling transaction logging

- Granting or denying access for specific computers

- Using Key Manager to install certificates

- Granting operator permissions to individual Windows NT Server accounts

Starting Internet Service Manager (HTML):

- From the Start menu, choose Programs, select "Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack",
  select "Microsoft Internet Information Server", select "Microsoft SMTP
  Service", and then select "SMTP Service Manager (HTML)".

NOTE: If you change the default document settings in the Documents property sheet
for the default Web site in Internet Service Manager, you must also change them
in the Mail node. For example, if you disable the default document or rename
Default.htm, you cannot start Internet Service Manager (HTML) by choosing "SMTP
Service Manager (HTML") from the Start menu. To prevent this from occurring,
configure the Mail node as follows:

1. In Internet Service Manager, expand the directory hierarchy for the default
  Web site.

2. Select the Mail node.

3. From the Action menu, choose Properties.

4. In the Documents property sheet, select "Enable Default Document" and make
  sure that Default.htm is included in the list box.

If you change the document settings again later for the default Web site, choose
not to override the Mail settings in the "Inheritance Overrides" dialog box.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Issues
------------

The following list contains known issues for Microsoft SMTP Service.

Using WINS or a HOSTS file for Intranet service:

Although DNS is required to deploy Microsoft SMTP Service on the Internet, WINS
or a HOSTS file can be substituted for DNS when using Microsoft SMTP Service on
an intranet.

Messages can be corrupted under low disk conditions:

Messages can be corrupted when available disk space is low or exhausted on the
Mailroot directory. Place the Mailroot directory on drives that have adequate
disk space

Cannot selectively bind multiple IP addresses to a single SMTP site:

Does not support selective binding of multiple IP addresses to a single SMTP
site. The choices are either a single IP address or all unassigned IP
addresses.

Missing event logs when Microsoft SMTP Service is running:

Some configuration changes are not logged to the event log when the service is
running (for example, default domain changes, smart host changes, and site
starting and stopping). No configuration changes are logged to the event log
when the service is not running.

Changing Microsoft SMTP Service Badmail directory:

The administration interface does not validate that the Badmail directory is on a
local drive. You must always specify a local drive for the Badmail directory.

Master properties are not supported for Microsoft SMTP Service:

In the "Internet Information Server" property sheet for the computer in Internet
Service Manager, Microsoft SMTP Service is not listed under "Master Properties".
Microsoft SMTP Service does not support setting master properties. Multiple SMTP
sites cannot be created.

Imprecise NDR on some looping cases:

In cases when the SMTP server tries to connect to itself, the non-delivery report
(NDR) displays the message "Connection to host &lt;hostname&gt; failed." The
correct message is "Cannot connect to self."

Microsoft SMTP Service adds extra blank lines to messages placed in the Drop directory:

Microsoft SMTP Service adds an extra blank line to the end of messages placed in
the Drop directory.
