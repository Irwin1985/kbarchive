Product(s): Microsoft SNA Server
Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.0SP1,3.0SP2,3.0SP3,4.0,4.0SP1,4.0SP2
Operating System(s):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) may fail unexpectedly or may stop
accepting new client connections when the access violation in
SNADMOD!RpcRoutProc occurs. This results in one or both of the following:

- Previously-connected users lose their host (mainframe or AS/400) sessions.
- New users are unable to obtain a new host session.

If the Windows NT Server where SNA Server is running is configured with
Drwtsn32.exe as the default debugger, a Drwtsn32.log entry may be generated when
this failure occurs, indicating a FAULT in the top-level routine along with the
following stack-back trace (which may vary):

      snadmod!RpcRouteProc+0x400
      snadmod!sepdq2_int+0x122
      ntdll!RtlLeaveCriticalSection+0x1d
      snadmod!sbpdin_int+0x23d
      snadmod!sbpdin+0x25
      snaservr!sbpcdin+0x50
      snaservr!sbpsched+0x2ac
      snaservr!sbpgmain+0x25
      snasvc!ServiceMainFunction+0x140
      advapi32!ScSvcctrlThreadA+0xe
      kernel32!BaseThreadStart+0x51

In the reported instances of this problem, the SNA Server systems had to be
rebooted to recover.

CAUSE
=====

The access violation occurs when an SNA Server RPC Response message is
inadvertently routed to the SNA Server service. The SNA Server service is unable
to interpret this message, which causes the access violation to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
