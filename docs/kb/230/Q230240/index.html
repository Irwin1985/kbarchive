MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 15: Text Correction
------------------------

Page 15, second to last paragraph:

Change:
"For those mathematically inclined, you will quickly realize that 256 is the
largest number that can be represented by a byte."

To:
"For those mathematically inclined, you will quickly realize that 255 is the
largest number that can be represented by a byte."


Page 17: Error In ASCII Character Set Table
-------------------------------------------

The table on page 17 lists the incorrect ASCII code for the letter D.

Change:

   D 01000010 68

To:

   D 01000100 68


Page 46: Typo In Figure 4.11
----------------------------

Change:
"1386SX"

To:
"80386SX"


Page 52: Delete Last Paragraph
------------------------------

Delete the information in the last paragraph on page 52, above the bulleted
items, regarding the 50 MHz 486DX processor and DX2 processors running
internally and externally at 50MHz. This information can not be verified or
supported.

Also delete references to 486DX processors at 50MHz in the table on page 51.


Page 55: Missing Word
---------------------

Page 55, subheading Intel's Competitors, last sentence:

Change:
"Just like the Intel processors, these processors are all backward."

To:
"Just like the Intel processors, these processors are all backward-compatible."


Page 56: Typographical Error
----------------------------

Page 56, second paragraph, first sentence:

Change:
"On method that the Pentium Pro used to increase efficiency..."

To:
"One method that the Pentium Pro used to increase efficiency..."


Page 107: Errors In Note
------------------------

Page 107, note:

Change:
"Eight 64 KB x 1 RAM chips make 64 KB bytes of memory. Or eight 256 KB x 1 RAM
chips make 256 KM bytes of memory."

To:
"Eight 64 KB x 1 RAM chips make 64 KB of memory. Or eight 256 KB x 1 RAM chips
make 256 KB of memory."


Page 114: Typographical Error
-----------------------------

Page 114, under the Troubleshooting RAM subheading, first sentence:

Change:
"The MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) rate for DRAM in a computer built after
1992 computer is something like 30 to 35 years!"

To:
"The MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) rate for DRAM in a computer built after
1992 is something like 30 to 35 years!"


Page 140: Last Paragraph Should Refer To Platter Rather Than Head
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Change:
"Data is stored in circular paths on the surface of each head. Each path is
called a track. There are hundreds of tracks on the surface of each head. A set
of tracks (all of the same diameter) through head head is called a cylinder."

To:
"Data is stored in circular paths on the surface of each platter. Each path is
called a track. There are hundreds of tracks on the surface of each platter. A
set of tracks (all of the same diameter) through each platter is called a
cylinder."


Page 180: Typo In Second Bullet
-------------------------------

Page 180, second bullet, first sentence:

Change:
"Master driverequires that the driver is loaded before anything else..."

To:
"Master drive requires that the driver is loaded before anything else..."


Page 188: Change Ultra (32-bit) SCSI SI-2 to UltraSCSI
------------------------------------------------------

On page 188, in the first section SCSI-2, the third bulleted item, Ultra (32-bit)
SCSI SI-2 should be changed to UltraSCSI.

UltraSCSI does not increase the datapath to 32 bit. UltraSCSI deals with the
transfer rate. It doubles the FAST SCSI transfer rate. UltraSCSI runs at 20
MegaTransfers/sec. Thus, Ultra narrow SCSI (8-bit) = 20MB/sec and Ultra Wide
(16-bit) SCSI = 40 MB/sec.


Page 223: Graphic Doesn't Match Preceding Text
----------------------------------------------

The Pixel area in the graphic should show dots of all one color. As it is, it
shows R, G, and B dots.


Page 358: Delete Last Sentence In First Paragraph

On page 358, the last sentence in the first paragraph can be disputed.

When loading an application from the "run=" statement in the Win.ini file,
Windows uses the function SW_SHOWNORMAL. This function leaves the application
maximized in a full-screen window.


Page 253: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Change the definition for the term TCP/IP from:
"Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol..."

To:
"Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol..."


Page 358: Delete Last Sentence In First Paragraph

Page 358, first paragraph, last sentence:

Delete:
"When loading an application from the "run=" statement in the WIN.INI file,

maximized (that is, in a full-screen window)."


Page 458: Typographical Error
-----------------------------

Page 458, under the Types Of Networks subheading, second paragraph, first
sentence:

Change:
"In a peer-to-peer network, each computer acts as a either server..."

To:

Page 465: UTP Cannot Support Distances Greater Than 100 Meters
--------------------------------------------------------------

Page 465, last paragraph before the Coaxial Cable subheading, second sentence:

Change:

Page 465: The Twisted Pair Cable Described Is Unshielded
--------------------------------------------------------

Page 465, last paragraph before Coaxial Cable subheading, first sentence:

Change:
"Twisted-pair cable has several advantages over other types of cable..."

To:
"Unshielded twisted-pair cable has several advantages over other types of
cable..."


Page 480: Lesson Summary Corrections
------------------------------------

Page 480, fifth bullet:
