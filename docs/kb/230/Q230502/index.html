SUMMARY
=======

The PrintForm method prints only the portion of the form that is displayed. This
article demonstrates how to print a form that is either larger than the screen
or is only partially displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you need to print a form that is larger than the screen, or is only partially
displayed, then the controls on the form must be placed in a PictureBox. This
prints the bitmap that is contained in the PictureBox, instead of a screen
capture of the form itself (which is what PrintForm does). Because the
PictureBox's bitmap is stored in a device context in memory, you have access to
the entire bitmap regardless of what is displayed.

NOTE: For the purposes of this article, the height of the form is set to 11
inches. If another paper size is desired, such as 8.5- X 14- inches, set the
sTall variable to an appropriate value, for example, 14. Also note that these
assignments are made in twips because this is the default scalemode for forms.
If you change the scalemode, you need to change these values to match as well.

Print a Form That Is Larger Than the Screen
-------------------------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add two PictureBoxes to Form1.

  Avoid drawing the second PictureBox inside the first, because doing so makes
  the second PictureBox a member of the first. Instead, place the origin point
  of the second PictureBox to the left of the origin point of the first
  PictureBox.

3. Right-click Picture2 and choose Send to Back.

4. Add two labels to Picture1, leaving Picture2 empty.

5. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Private Const twipFactor = 1440
  Private Const WM_PAINT = &amp;HF
  Private Const WM_PRINT = &amp;H317
  Private Const PRF_CLIENT = &amp;H4&amp;    ' Draw the window's client area.
  Private Const PRF_CHILDREN = &amp;H10&amp; ' Draw all visible child windows.
  Private Const PRF_OWNED = &amp;H20&amp;    ' Draw all owned windows.

  Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias _
     "SendMessageA" (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, _
     ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
     
  Private Sub Form_Load()
     Dim sWide As Single, sTall As Single
     Dim rv As Long

     Me.ScaleMode = vbTwips   ' default
     sWide = 8.5
     stall = 11   ' or 14, etc.
     Me.Width = twipFactor * sWide
     Me.Height = twipFactor * stall
     With Picture1
        .Top = 0
        .Left = 0
        .Width = twipFactor * sWide
        .Height = twipFactor * stall
     End With
     With Picture2
        .Top = 0
        .Left = 0
        .Width = twipFactor * sWide
        .Height = twipFactor * stall
     End With
     With Label1
        .Caption = "Top"
        .Left = Me.Width / 2
        .Top = 0
     End With
     With Label2
        .Caption = "Bottom"
        .Top = (twipFactor * stall) - .Height * 2
        .Left = Me.Width / 2
     End With
     Me.Visible = True
     DoEvents

     Picture1.SetFocus
     Picture2.AutoRedraw = True
     rv = SendMessage(Picture1.hwnd, WM_PAINT, Picture2.hDC, 0)
     rv = SendMessage(Picture1.hwnd, WM_PRINT, Picture2.hDC, _
     PRF_CHILDREN + PRF_CLIENT + PRF_OWNED)
     Picture2.Picture = Picture2.Image
     Picture2.AutoRedraw = False

     Printer.Print ""
     Printer.PaintPicture Picture2.Picture, 0, 0
     Printer.EndDoc
  End Sub

6. Run the project.

7. The Top and Bottom labels should appear in their respective positions
  regardless of whether the form is completely displayed.

Print a Form on More Than One Page
----------------------------------

If the form you are printing is too large to fit on a page, you can use the same
approach as in the preceding example with a minor addition. The PaintPicture
method has a number of optional parameters. The clipping region parameters can
be used to grab a portion of the bitmap image and print it.

To accomplish this, locate the following code in the previous example:

  Printer.Print ""
  Printer.PaintPicture Picture2.Picture, 0, 0
  Printer.EndDoc

Replace those three lines of code with the following:

  Printer.Print ""
  Printer.PaintPicture Picture2.Picture, 0, 0, , , _
     0, 0, , Picture2.Height / 2
  Printer.NewPage
  Printer.PaintPicture Picture2.Picture, 0, 0, , , _
     0, Picture2.Height / 2, , Picture2.Height / 2
  Printer.EndDoc

For ease of illustration, this example merely divides the form in half. You can
adjust the clipping region appropriately for your needs.

NOTE: Visual Basic 6.0 Online Help states that PrintForm prints the entire form,
whether the entire form is visible or not. This information is incorrect.
