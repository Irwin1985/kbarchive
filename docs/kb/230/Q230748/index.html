The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

In complex Exchange Server organizations, it is possible that site directories
may not stay fully replicated with the most current directory information. The
directory changes are caused by adding or deleting recipients, any objects in
the directory, servers, and even Exchange Server sites themselves. Changing
configurations on the server itself and any directory object also changes
directory information. If directories in any Exchange Server organization are
not up-to-date, it may cause unnecessary non-delivery reports (NDRs) to be
generated and logged in the application log.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The application event log may show a lot of Event IDs 290 with the similar
description:

  Event ID: 290
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Warning
  Category: X400 service

  A non-delivery report (reason code unable-to-transfer and diagnostic code
  unrecognized-OR-name) is being generated for message C=US;A=
  ;P=ORG;L=MessageOriginatingServer. It was originally destined for
  DN:/o=ORG/ou=SITE/ cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=Recepient (recipient number 1), and was
  to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 21 136] (12)

To get rid of these unnecessary NDRs, run a complete directory replication cycle
across all sites within the Exchange Server organization. To force replication
with other sites:

1. In the Configuration container, click Directory Replication. Go into the
  properties of the Directory Replication Connector.

2. Click the Sites tab.

3. Select each of the other sites and click Request Now after each.

To force replication from within the site:

1. Go to the Site level, then select a server within the site.

2. Open the properties of the Directory Service, and click Update Now.

  NOTE: You may need to click "Refresh all items in the directory" when doing a
  Request Now depending on how much the directories actually are out of sync.

  CAUTION: Make sure NOT to run the directory update cycles in the middle of
  your regular business hours as doing so can generate a lot of network traffic
  depending on the size of the directories and the organization itself, and may
  consume the available network bandwidth.
