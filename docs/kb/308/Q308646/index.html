-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the Systems Management Server (SMS) client software, you
may experience one or more display-related symptoms. For example, the screen may
appear to be jittery, drop-down list boxes may not appear, you may see
screen-redraw issues, and so on. If you configure Windows Task Manager to
display the "GDI objects" column, you may see an increasing number of GDI
objects that are allocated for the Smsmon32.exe process.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if an SMS package that contains a program that is set to
use a custom icon is advertised. This condition can cause Smsmon32.exe to
allocate GDI objects that are never freed, and this can cause various
screen-redraw issues to occur. The number of allocated GDI objects increases
each time the SMS client looks for new advertisements from its Client Access
Point (CAP).

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English post-SP3 version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, configure all programs to use the default icon as

create a program. The GDI resources can be freed if you reboot the client, or
end the Smsmon32.exe process.

STATUS
