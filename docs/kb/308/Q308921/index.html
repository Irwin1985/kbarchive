The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 in a Distributed Link
Service (DLS) environment, network outage notifications (Event 23) may not be
logged in the Application event log on the branch server.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server Service does not reset a certain internal field, so that events
are not logged if a dropped connection restarts and is subsequently dropped
again.

RESOLUTION
==========

--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
