-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A grid's Deleted event does not fire when a record is programmatically deleted.
However, the event does fire if you interactively delete a record in a grid.

RESOLUTION
==========

Call the grid's Deleted event explicitly using code. For the sample code in the
MORE INFORMATION section, see step 3 for further instructions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program (.prg) file that contains the following code and run the
  program:

        CREATE TABLE Ztest (A c(1), B c(1))
        INSERT INTO Ztest (A,B) VALUES ('A', 'B')

        USE 'Ztest'

        F1 = CREATE('oForm')
        F1.SHOW
        * F1.gridcontrol.Deleted  &amp;&amp; Remove comment to see grid's Deleted
                                  &amp;&amp; event fire.
        READ EVENTS

        DEFINE CLASS oForm AS FORM
           ADD OBJECT GRIDcontrol AS myGRID
           PROC INIT
              DELETE
           PROC DESTROY
              CLEAR EVENTS
        ENDDEFINE

        DEFINE CLASS myGRID AS GRID
           RECORDSOURCE='Ztest'
           RECORDSOURCETYPE=1
           PROC DELETED
              LPARAMETERS nRecNo
              WAIT WIND "Deleted Event Fired"
        ENDDEFINE

2. Notice that the record is marked as deleted in the grid, but the grid's
  Deleted event never fired. Now, double-click the deletion marker in the grid
  (the black rectangle to left of the first field in the grid) and note that
  the grid's deleted event fires as expected.

3. Remove the asterisk from the commented line of code in the example so that is
  reads as follows:

        F1.gridcontrol.Deleted

  Run the example again. Note that the grid's Deleted event fires when
  explicitly called with code.
