The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested by
Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been taken from
unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS
ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without

When using the Jaws for Windows software to read the Visual FoxPro menus, the
software is not able to read some of the menus. For example, here is a listing
for some of the menus that cannot be read:

- File / New

- View / Toolbars

- Tools / Options

Any of the menus that are called through the Windows API, such as, File - Open,
File - Print, or Format - Font, can be read properly by the Jaws software.

JAWS for Windows is manufactured by Henter-Joyce, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.

CAUSE
=====

The Visual FoxPro menus have not been designed to expose their objects.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Jaws for Windows is a software product that runs in the background, allowing
blind users to use other software while Jaws talks to them and "speaks" what
object is on the screen they are accessing with the mouse or keyboard. Visual
FoxPro's menus are written in such a way that the objects are not exposed at
run-time. Some of the menus that can be read by Jaws are menus that are called
through the Windows API. These menus have been designed to expose their objects,
therefore, Jaws can read the objects and can "speak" those objects to the user.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start the Jaws for windows software, start Visual FoxPro for Windows, and
  from the File menu, choose New. As you tab through the menu, Jaws is not able
  to read the objects. However, accessing the File - Open menu allows Jaws to
  read the objects.

2. If Jaws for Windows is not available, start Visual FoxPro, and from the File
  menu, choose Open.

3. Open Microsoft Spy++ that comes with Microsoft C++ and select the Spy [ASCII
  150] Windows menu. Scroll down the list and find the "Open" #32770 (Dialog)
  entry. Note that there are items listed under this entry that describe the
  objects in the Open dialog box.

4. Now, go back to Visual FoxPro and select from the File menu, choose New.
  Switch back to Spy++ and press the F5 key to refresh the window. Scroll down
  the list and find the "New" Fox_4000002 entry or "New" VFP664000002 if using
  Visual FoxPro 6.0. Note that there are no objects listed under this entry.
