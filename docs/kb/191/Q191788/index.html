SYMPTOMS
========

When using the OpenConnection method of a rdoEnvironment object to establish a
connection to a local database, the Connect event of the rdoConnection object
will not fire.

The Connect event will fire, however, when using the EstablishConnection method
of the rdoConnection object.

CAUSE
=====

This is primarily caused by the speed of the connection. When accessing a
database server that resides locally, the connection is made and the Connect
event is fired before the object can be returned to your program. Because the
object has not yet been returned, custom event handlers are not called.

Basically, when using the rdoEnvironment.OpenConnection on a synchronous call, a
connection is established first and then the object is returned, whereas using
rdoConnection.EstablishConnection, an object has already been created before the
connection is established.

Specifying rdAsyncEnable (an asynchronous connection) in the OpenConnection
method will not solve the problem on machines where the database server is
local. Because the database server is local, the connection is created before
RDO has an object to return to the calling program. When the database is remote,
RDO has enough time to return the rdoConnection object to the calling program
before the connection is established. When the connection is finally
established, the Connect event will fire normally.

NOTE: You must specify rdAsyncEnable to make OpenConnection fire the Connect
event or the Connect event will never fire under any circumstances. If
rdAsyncEnable is not specified, the connection is always made to the database
before the object is returned.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, try using the EstablishConnection method of a valid
connection object. Because the object has already been created and your program
has the event handler established before the connect call has been made, the
Connect event will always fire correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are running SQL Server or other similar database system locally, you can
reproduce this behavior by following the steps below.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.
  Add a reference to the RDO Object Library.

2. Add the following controls with the following properties to Form1:

   Control         Property         Value
   -------         --------         -----

   Label           Name             lblDSN
                   Caption          DSN
   TextBox         Name             txtDSN
   CommandButton   Name             cmdUseEstablishConnection
                   Caption          Use EstablishConnection
   CommandButton   Name             cmdUseOpenConnection
                   Caption          Use OpenConnection

3. Paste the following code into the Code Window of Form1:

       Option Explicit
       Dim WithEvents ConnectionObj As RDO.rdoConnection
       Dim Env As RDO.rdoEnvironment

       Private Sub cmdUseEstablishConnection_Click()

           'Here, we are creating the Object First
           Set ConnectionObj = New RDO.rdoConnection

           ConnectionObj.Connect = txtDSN

           'and then establishing the connection
           ConnectionObj.EstablishConnection

       End Sub

       Private Sub cmdUseOpenConnection_Click()

           'Here, we are establishing the connection first
           'and then creating the object
           Set ConnectionObj = Env.OpenConnection(dsname:="", _
           prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, Connect:=txtDSN.Text, _
           Options:=rdAsyncEnable)

       End Sub

       Private Sub ConnectionObj_Connect(ByVal ErrorOccurred As Boolean)
           MsgBox "We are connected!", vbInformation
       End Sub

       Private Sub Form_Load()

           Set Env = rdoEngine.rdoEnvironments(0)

           'This sample is designed to work with the pubs database
           'on a local SQL Server.  You may change your connect string
           'here.
           txtDSN = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=(local);" &amp; _
                    "Database=Pubs;UID=sa;PWD=;"

       End Sub

4. Run the form. Click on each of the command buttons and note that the Use
  EstablishConnection will always display a Message Box whereas OpenConnection
  will not.
