-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Visual Basic Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to create a
distribution set for your application, you may need to modify the .cab file
created by the wizard.

This article describes how to modify the .cab files that the Package and
Deployment Wizard creates, how to extract the files from a .cab file, and how to
rebuild the .cab file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a distribution package with the Package and Deployment Wizard,
it creates the .cab file(s) that are used to install your application.

The Contents of a .cab File
---------------------------

A .cab file contains compressed files that are necessary for installing your
application. The Package and Deployment Wizard places an decompressed copy of
each of these files in a folder named "Support," which can be found in the same
location as the .cab file.

In all cases, the Package and Deployment Wizard places at least two files in the
Support folder: a .ddf file and a component file (.exe, .dll, or .ocx file). If
you are creating an Internet download package, the Package and Deployment Wizard
also includes an .inf file.

- .ddf: The ddf file is known as a Diamond Directive File, a text file that you
  can open in NotePad or any text editor. The .ddf file contains specific
  information required to compress your files into a cabinet file; the .ddf
  file itself is not placed in the .cab file.

  NOTE: You should not modify this file unless absolutely necessary.

- Component File (.exe, .dll, or .ocx): The type of component you create
  determines the file extension of the file included here. This is the main
  file you are attempting to install.

- .inf: This is the Information file that contains information about what other
  files your ActiveX component depends on (dependency files), where to get
  copies of those files, and how to install those files.

Extracting the Contents of a .cab File
--------------------------------------

To extract the contents of a cabinet file, you must use the Extract utility.
Extract.exe can be found in your Windows folder or on your Windows 95, Windows
98, Windows Me, or Windows NT installation disc.

Extract.exe is a command-line utility; therefore, it is used from an MS-DOS
command prompt. To extract the files within a cabinet file, be sure the
Extract.exe utility is in the MS-DOS path, or copy the Extract utility to the
same folder as the cabinet file.

From the MS-DOS command prompt, you can run the following command to extract all
of the files in a .cab file into the current directory:

  Extract Project1.cab *.*

where "Project1.cab" is the name of your cabinet file.

For more information on using the Extract.exe utility, you can type the following
command at an MS-DOS command prompt:

  Extract /?

For even more information on Extract.exe, please see the ActiveX SDK
documentation as referred to in the REFERENCES section of this article.

Rebuilding a .cab File
----------------------

Once you've extracted the files within a .cab file, you can make modifications to
those files and then proceed to rebuild the .cab file manually.

To rebuild a .cab file, the Package and Deployment Wizard provides a batch (.bat)
file. The batch file will have the same name as your .cab file, but with a .bat
extension. The wizard places this file into the Support folder for your package.
Double-click the .bat file in Windows Explorer or run the .bat file from the
MS-DOS prompt to rebuild the .cab file.

The .bat file runs the MakeCab.exe utility that ships with Visual Basic. The
MakeCab utility is installed by default in the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Wizards\PDWizard\

You can also find the MakeCab utility on your Visual Basic installation disc.

To rebuild the cabinet file without the .bat file, place any modified files and
the original .ddf file into a single folder. Also, make sure the MakeCab.exe
utility is in the MS-DOS path or copy it to the same folder as the .ddf file.

At a command prompt, type the following command where "Project1.ddf" is the name
of your .ddf file:

  MakeCab /F Project1.ddf

For more information about the MakeCab utility, you can use the "/?" switch, or
see the ActiveX SDK documentation as referred to in the REFERENCES section of
this article.

Notes on Rebuilding Cabinet Files
---------------------------------

Normally, you do not need to modify the files within a cabinet file. However, if
you do need to modify cabinet files, please use the following guidelines to
avoid problems:

- Never add or remove files from a .cab file. The only files that should be in
  a .cab file are those added by the Package and Deployment Wizard. If you need
  to add or remove files from the cabinet file, re-run the wizard. Otherwise,
  you need to modify the .ddf file, which this article does not discuss.

- If you modify the .inf file, be sure that your changes are syntactically
  correct and do not contain errors. For more information about modifying .inf
  files, see the ActiveX SDK as referred to in the REFERENCES section of this
  article. Problems with the .inf file can result in undesired behavior when
  the component attempts to download.

- You should not modify an ActiveX component (.ocx, .exe, or .dll) in any way.
  If you need to modify an ActiveX component, rebuild the cabinet file using
  the Package and Deployment Wizard.

- If you rebuild the .cab files after updating any of the included files to a
  newer version, you also need to update the version number and date/time stamp
  in the Setup.lst file.

- If you end up with a different number of .cab files after running the .bat
  file, you need to update the number of .cab files listed in the Setup.lst
  file. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q190077 : HOWTO: Set Number of .CAB's in Setup.lst After Repackaging
