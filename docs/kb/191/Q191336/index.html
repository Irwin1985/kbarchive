The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article is intended to help set up a group that will be
primarily responsible for performing the Remote Control functions of a
production help desk. This article will cover how to set up the IDs in SQL
Server and Systems Management Server as well as how to update the clients in the
site so that the newly created group can take remote control of the computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first task in this process is the creation of the ID in the SQL Enterprise
Manager. With SQL Server in Standard security, the steps in creating this ID
are:

1. Open the SQL Enterprise Manager.

2. Open the Databases folder and expand the SMS database so that the folders
  Groups/Users and Objects appear.

3. Under the SMS database, right-click the Groups/Users folder and then click
  New Group on the shortcut menu to create a new group for the users that will
  have the Remote Control responsibilities.

4. Type the name of the group, click Add to create it, and then click Close.

5. Right-click the Logins folder at the bottom of the SQL Server tree and then
  click New Login on the shortcut menu.

6. Add the name of the login and give it a password. Give this new user the
  Permit right to the SMS database. Click the Group field for the SMS database
  to reveal the Group drop-down menu. Specify the group that you created in
  steps 4 and 5 and then click Add. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each user you want
  to create.

7. Open and log in to the SMS Security Manager. This may take a few minutes.

8. In the ID drop down box in the upper left, you should see "dbo" by default.
  Change this to the new login ID that you just created in the SQL Enterprise
  Manager. All of the Objects listed should show "NO ACCESS" in both Proposed
  and Current Rights.

9. Give the following objects these rights:

     Alerts                No Access
     Architectures         View
     Diagnostics           Full
     Events                No Access
     Helpdesk              Full
     Jobs                  No Access
     Machine Groups        No Access
     Network Monitor       No Access
     Packages              No Access
     Program Groups        No Access
     Queries               No Access
     Site Groups           View
     Sites                 View
     SNMP Traps            No Access

  NOTE: View permissions is the minimum for the Architectures object because
  this is required to be able to see the Sites window.

10. Click Security at the top menu and then click Save User. Repeat steps 8-10
  for each user that you had created in SQL Enterprise Manager. Close SMS
  Security Manager when you are finished.

To notify the clients of this new group, you must perform the steps below. these
steps involve making a change to the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. On the servers that you DO NOT want the help desk group to have access to, go
  to HKLM\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\SMS\CLIENT SERVICE\REMOTE CONTROL and change the
  Override Site Permitted Viewer List option to 1.

2. In the Systems Management Server Administrator program, open the Site
  Properties by selecting the site in the Sites window, clicking File menu, and
  then clicking Properties.

3. Click Clients and select the Proposed Properties radio button, followed by
  the now-enabled Options button.

4. In the Allow Access For These Users box, add the new Remote Control group to
  the list.

5. Click OK until you have closed out of the Site Properties. Then click Yes to
  update the site.

6. Using a text editor such as Notepad, open and save the System.map file
  WITHOUT making any changes. Doing this causes all clients to begin the
  Upgrade process upon the next client logon. For more information, see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates

This procedure allows a system administrator to off-load the remote control
responsibilities to the help desk or other group if the SQL Server is using
Standard security.
