SYMPTOMS
========

  Plus! 98. The Shockwave Flash object in the Garfield theme conflicts with the
  3D hardware detection process in one of the games listed at the beginning of
  this article.

- You are running Microsoft NetMeeting on your computer. NetMeeting prevents
  DirectX from dynamically changing your screen resolution when you start the
  game.

  run Train Simulator, which requires at least 4 megabytes (MB) of video
  memory.
- DirectDraw Acceleration may be disabled.
