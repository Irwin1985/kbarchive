-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a Dynamic RAS call to another Exchange Server site, you may receive the
following message:

  The local Exchange Server is unavailable on the local network.

Furthermore, you will not be able to ping or connect to the other site in anyway.

CAUSE
=====

During a DRAS connection, the property to "Use default gateway on remote
network" has been set. As a result, when Exchange Server needs to communicate to
any computer across a gateway (router), it will assume that the gateway over the
dial-up network (DUN) connection is the correct one. Local network computers are
actually able to send packets over the local router to the Exchange Server
computer, but the Exchange Server computer is replying to the wrong router (over
the DUN connection), and thus to the wrong network. Communication is never
established between the Exchange Server computer and local computers physically
located across the router.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check the Dial-Up Entry by performing the following steps:

1. From the Start menu, select Programs, Accessories, and click Dial-Up
  Networking. Select the Phone Book Entry that the Dynamic RAS Connector is
  using, and click More for a list of options.

2. Select the Edit Entry and Modem Properties option.

3. Select the Server tab.

  a. Under Network Protocols, click TCP/IP Settings and click the Settings
     button.

  b. Clear the Use Default Gateway on Remote Network check box.

NOTE: This workaround may cause other problems, depending on how the TCP/IP
network is configured for DUN networking. See the More Information section for
more details.

MORE INFORMATION
================

While a dial-up connection is on line, the local dial-up server will no longer
be able to communicate with any resources that are across the default gateway on
the remote network. This is due to the fact that all the packets will be
directed to the default local router and not the remote gateway (router). This
may cause another problem with DUN. See the "Dynamic RAS Connector White Paper"
for more details.
