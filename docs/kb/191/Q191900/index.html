- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a self-extracting archive for use with the
Microsoft Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK).


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the ODK to create a build of Outlook 98, if you choose the option
to install your ODK build in silent mode, you can only add one custom package.
By using the IExpress program that comes with the ODK, you can bundle multiple
files together into one self-extracting executable that you can run at the end
of the Setup program. This is necessary if you want to deploy multiple patches
or generate profiles after Outlook 98 is installed.

To generate the package:

1. Create an .inf file that lists the files to copy and commands to execute.

2. Bundle the files into a single executable, using the IExpress Wizard.

Creating the .inf File for Use with the IExpress Wizard
-------------------------------------------------------

The .inf file contains the list of files to be copied to the users' hard disk
drives and programs to be executed.

A sample .inf file is presented below that runs three programs. The Program1.exe,
Program2.exe, and Program3.exe files ware copied to the hard disk drive and
executed at the end of the Setup program. Substitute your program names for
Program1, Program2, and Program3.

The [install.files] section is a list of files to copy to the users' computers.
The [RunPostSetupCommandsSection] section lists the names of the programs to
execute and the start order. You also need to include any command-line arguments
in this section.

NOTE: The .inf file is named Odk.inf and must be listed in the [install.files]
section.

  ; This is a sample INF file to use with the IExpress Wizard.
  ; Copy this file and save it with the name Odk.inf.

  [Version]
  Signature="$Chicago$"
  AdvancedINF=2.0

  [DefaultInstall]
  CopyFiles=install.files
  RunPostSetupCommands=RunPostSetupCommandsSection

  [DestinationDirs]
  install.files=30,IDKTemp

  [install.files]
  ; List the files that need to be copied to the local hard disk drive.
  ; This should be the same list of files that are added in the
  ; "Packaged Files" section of the IExpress Wizard, described in
  ; Step 4 below.

  Program1.Exe   ; example program #1
  Program2.Exe   ; example program #2
  Program3.Exe   ; example program #3
  Odk.inf

  [RunPostSetupCommandsSection]
  ; List the programs you want to run and the order in which
  ; you want them to be executed.
  ; Include any command-line switches or parameters that are necessary.

  Program1.Exe
  Program2.Exe
  Program3.Exe /argument1 /argument2

  [SourceDisksNames]
  1="default",,1

Combining Multiple Files Using the IExpress Wizard
--------------------------------------------------

To bundle several programs using the IExpress utility:

1. Start the IExpress Wizard version 2.0. The default location and file name
  are:

  C:\Program Files\ODK\Tools\Iexpress.exe

  In the Welcome to IExpress 2.0 dialog box, click "Create new self extraction
  directive file", and then click Next.

2. In the Package Purpose dialog box, click "Extract files and run an
  installation command" option, and then click Next. In the Package Title box,
  type a name, such as "Example Installation" (without the quotation marks),
  and then click Next.

3. On the Confirmation Prompt dialog box, click "No prompt", and then click
  Next. On the License Agreement dialog box, click "Do not display a license",
  and then click Next. These options, although not necessary, may be used.

4. On the Packaged Files dialog box, click Add to choose the components that you
  want to be bundled into the self-extracting executable. For this example,
  locate the following files:

   - Program1.Exe

   - Program2.Exe

   - Program3.Exe

   - Odk.inf

  Click Open, and then click Next.

5. On the Installation Program to Launch dialog box, type the name of your .inf
  file. In this example, the file is Odk.inf.

  Under Post Install Command, click None, and then click Next.

6. On the Show Window dialog box, click Default, and click Next. On the Finish
  Message dialog box, click No Message, and then click Next.

7. On the Package Name and Options dialog box, type the name of your package,
  specify the directory location, and then click Next. On the Configure Reboot
  dialog box, click No Reboot, and then click Next.

  NOTE: If you deploy your package by using the ODK, you must click No Reboot.

8. In the Save Self Extraction Directive dialog box, type the location that you
  want to save the SED file to, and then click Next. This file allows you to
  change your IExpress configuration and the files that you have selected.

9. When the Create Package Confirmation dialog box is displayed, click Next, and
  then the package is built. The package is the self-extracting executable with
  the name you specified. The package can be included in the Outlook Deployment
  Kit as your single custom package.

10. The final dialog box confirms the creation of your package. It displays
  information, such as how much compression the files received, how many bytes
  the package contains, and the amount of time that it took to create the
  package. Click Finish to exit the wizard.

  The bundled self-extracting executable is now ready to be included in the
  ODK.
