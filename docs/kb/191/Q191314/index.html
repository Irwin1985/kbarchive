-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Outlook client is not installed by default on a BackOffice Small Business Server
(SBS). The following article describes the proper way to install Outlook on the
SBS server. There are different considerations for Outlook 97 and Outlook 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing Outlook 97
---------------------

Outlook 97 can be installed on both SBS 4.0 and 4.0a (SP1). For best results the
following steps should be used:

1. On the SBS computer, click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control
  Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

3. Select Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.

4. Click Stop (this stops Exchange Server). Do the same for Microsoft Fax

  Internet Mail Service (if this was previously running)
  Microsoft Fax Server

  Outlook will acquire any previous Exchange profiles.

Installing Outlook 98
---------------------

Outlook 98 can only be installed on SBS 4.0a (SP1). This is because Outlook 98
requires Internet Explorer 4.01 or later and SBS 4.0 is only compatible with
Internet Explorer 3.02. To verify the SBS version, select Start and then click
Manage Server. Select "About Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server." Under
Product ID, the version installed is listed.

For best results, the following steps should be used for Small Business Server
4.0a:

1. On the SBS computer, click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control
  Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

3. Select Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.

4. Click Stop (this stops Exchange Server). Do the same for Microsoft Fax
  Server.

5. Select your installation source for Outlook 98 (compact disc, Internet,
  other).

6. Run Setup.

7. Specify Outlook (not Outlook Express), Exchange, or "none of the above" as
  previous email client.

8. On the Installation Options page, select the level to install.

9. On the E-mail Service Options page, select Corporate or Workgroup. Do NOT
  select Internet Mail or None.

10. Complete the installation.

11. If the system needs to be restarted, restart it and skip to step 14

12. After setup completes, double-click Services in Control Panel.

13. Start the following Microsoft Exchange Services:

  System Attendant
  Directory
  Store
  Message Transfer Agent
  Internet Mail Service (if this was previously running)
  Microsoft Fax Server

14. Outlook will acquire any previous Exchange profiles.

If your Small Business Server is 4.0 you must update it to SP1. For additional
information on updating your SBS 4.0 computer, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q179729
  TITLE : Upgrading BackOffice Small Business Server from 4.0 to 4.0a

If Outlook 98 Was Installed on an SBS 4.0 server:

If you have already installed Outlook 98 on a SBS 4.0 system, everything on the
server should work except the Manage Server console. To bring the console back,
two options are available:

Option 1 (Recommended):

Apply Small Business Server Service Pack 1 upgrade. This is available through
Microsoft on compact disc for the cost of shipping, or on TechNet, but it is not
downloadable.

Use the steps in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base to upgrade
to SP1.

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q179729
  TITLE : Upgrading BackOffice Small Business Server from 4.0 to 4.0a

After the server has been upgraded to 4.0a, follow the steps in the "Installing
Outlook 98" section to install Outlook 98 on the server.

Option 2:

Remove Outlook 98 and Internet Explorer 4.0.

To remove Outlook 98 (use same steps to remove Outlook 97):

1. On the SBS computer, click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control
  Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

3. Select Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.

4. Click Stop (this stops Exchange Server). Set all Exchange services to Manual
  start.

5. On the SBS computer, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
  Add/Remove Programs.

6. Select Microsoft Outlook 98, and then click Add/Remove.

7. When Setup runs, select Remove All.

8. If prompted, select remove all shared components especially Internet Explorer
  and all its components.

9. Complete Setup.

10. In Add/Remove Programs in Control Panels, verify that Internet Explorer 4.0
  and any of its components are not there. If present, select Add/Remove and
  remove it and all shared components.

11. Install Internet Explorer 3.02 from &lt;CD-ROM drive&gt;:\MS\IE\I386, and
  run MSIE30

12. Select Start and then click Manage Server. If the console comes up, continue
  with steps. If the console errors when started, follow the following
  Microsoft Knowledge Base article to fix the problem:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q186388
  TITLE : SBS: Restoring Console After Removing and Reinstalling IIS/ASP

13. Install Exchange or Outlook 97 from the compact disc. For additional
  information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  then start each Exchange service.
