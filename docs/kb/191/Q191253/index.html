SUMMARY
=======

Because the Microsoft Jet database engine has a read-cache and lazy writes, you
can get duplicate values in your custom counter field if two applications add
records in less time than it takes the cache to refresh and the lazy-write
mechanism to flush to disk. This article presents a method that takes these
factors into account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Jet database engine provides a Counter (AutoIncrement) field.
However, it starts at 1 and increments by 1. In order to do something different,
such as increment by 10, you have to implement your own counter mechanism. In
order to do so, you need to be aware of how some Microsoft Jet performance
optimizations affects your implementation.

Microsoft Jet has a read-cache that is updated every PageTimeout milli- seconds
(default is 5000ms = 5 seconds). It also has a lazy-write mechanism that
operates on a separate thread to main processing and thus writes changes to disk
asynchronously. These two mechanisms help boost performance, but in certain
situations that require high concurrency, they can create problems.

Earlier versions of Microsoft Jet did not expose full programmatic control over
concurrency. To refresh the cache, you had to close and re-open the database.
Microsoft Jet 2.x and earlier did not have a lazy-write mechanism.

The Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine provides two methods to ensure that your
application has current data:

- DBEngine.Idle dbRefreshCache

- CommitTrans dbForceOSFlush

DBEngine.Idle dbRefreshCache
----------------------------

There is a separate read-cache for each Workspace object. This method immediately
refreshes the read-cache for all Workspace objects in the DBEngine.Workspaces
collection. The read-cache for Workspace objects not appended to this collection
are unaffected.

CommitTrans dbForceOSFlush
--------------------------

In Microsoft Jet 2.x and prior, all writes were immediately committed. With Win32
and multi-threading, Microsoft Jet introduced a lazy-write mechanism. This
method flushes all writes for objects created off the same Workspace the
BeginTrans/CommitTrans is invoked from.

These methods are preferable to modifying registry values to get the same effect,
because you can precisely control where you need this value. Global registry
programs will adversely affect engine performance in other areas and in other
applications.

EXAMPLE

The following example provides a function for generating custom counter numbers
and handling the concurrency and locking issues that result from the process. It
involves the use of a second table to store the next available key value. This
is used for performance reasons and also to avoid adversely affecting users who
would just need to read data.

The main function is NextKeyValue. It accepts four arguments: database object,
table name, workspace object, and increment value. The last two are optional and
default to DBEngine(0) and 1 respectively. It opens the table exclusively and
reads the value from the first field of the first record. This is the key value
returned. It then increments the value for the next user and releases the
table.

When you set the initial value in the table, this is the first value returned by
the function.

The error handling is designed to handle locking problems opening the table. If
the locks time-out, the function returns -1 as the next key value. If any other
error occurs, the function raises a run-time error that the main application
will need to trap.

Because most people leave their registry settings untouched, Microsoft Jet will
usually have a 100ms delay between lock-retries. If all instances of Jet have
the same delay, this could result in a race situation and cause your application
to time-out more than is necessary. The NextKeyValue function sets the lock
retry to a random interval between 60 and 120 milli- seconds to reduce the
chance of a race condition occurring. The test application is responsible for
using the RANDOM statement to seed the random number generator.

The test application adds 100 records to the table. It does not implement any
error handling.

Database Setup
--------------

1. In Microsoft Access, open the NWind.MDB file, and create the following
  tables:

  Table: KeyStore
     Field Name: NextValue
     Type:       Number, Long Integer

  Table: KeyTest
     Field Name: ID
     Type:       Number, Long Integer

     Field Name: Description
     Type:       Text, 50

2. Open the KeyStore table and add a record. Set NextValue to the amount that
  you want your counter to start from. Example: 3.

3. Save the record and closeMicrosoft Access.

Test Program
------------

1. Open a new Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications project with a Form
  (Form1) and a Module (Module1).

2. Add a reference (Project | References or Tools | References) for Microsoft
  DAO 3.5 Object Library.

3. Add the following code to the Module:

     Option Explicit
     Private Const MAX_RETRIES = 10

     Function NextKeyValue(db As Database, _
                           ByVal TableName As String, _
                           Optional ws As Workspace = Nothing, _
                           Optional Increment As Long = 1) As Long
     Dim rs As Recordset, ErrorCount As Long, TempKeyValue As Long
       NextKeyValue = -1   ' Returns this if the routine times out
       On Error GoTo NKV_Err
       ' Random delay between 90ms and 150ms prevents race condition
       DBEngine.SetOption dbLockDelay, 90 + Rnd * 60
       ' use default workspace if not supplied
       If ws Is Nothing Then Set ws = DBEngine(0)
       ' Error should occur on the next line if table is in use
       ' Open it exclusively
       Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(TableName, dbOpenTable, _
                                 dbDenyRead Or dbDenyWrite)
       DBEngine.Idle dbRefreshCache         ' refresh read cache
       TempKeyValue = rs(0)                 ' get value to use
       ws.BeginTrans
         rs.Edit
         rs(0) = TempKeyValue + Increment   ' value for next call
         rs.Update
       ws.CommitTrans dbForceOSFlush        ' flush the lazy-write cache
       rs.Close

       NextKeyValue = TempKeyValue
       Exit Function

     NKV_Abort:               ' clean up the mess
       On Error Resume Next
       ws.Rollback
       rs.Close
       Exit Function

     NKV_Err:
       Select Case Err.Number
         Case 3008, 3009, 3189, 3211, 3260, 3261, 3262
           ' various locking errors (above)
           ErrorCount = ErrorCount + 1
           If ErrorCount &gt; MAX_RETRIES Then
             Resume NKV_Abort
           Else
              Resume
           End If
         Case Else  ' unhandled errors
           Err.Raise Err.Number, Err.Source, Err.Description
       End Select

     End Function

4. Add a CommandButton (Command1) and a Text Box (Text1) to the form.

5. Add the following code to the form:

        Option Explicit
        Dim ws As Workspace, db As Database

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Dim SQL As String, I As Long
          For I = 1 To 100
            SQL = "INSERT INTO KeyTest VALUES (" &amp; _
                  NextKeyValue(db, "KeyStore", ws, 10) &amp; _
                  ",'Test Record " &amp; Time &amp; "')"
            db.Execute SQL
            Text1 = CStr(I)
            Me.Refresh
          Next I
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()
          Randomize
          Set ws = DBEngine(0)
          Set db = ws.OpenDatabase("NWIND.MDB")
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
          db.Close
          ws.Close
        End Sub

6. In Visual Basic, compile the application to an EXE. Run the application from
  multiple computers and click Command1 at the same time. It will run to
  completion (barring any unhandled errors) and add records without duplicate
  ID numbers.

NOTES:

1. The KeyStore table does not require an index. You will get better performance
  and have fewer problems if you do not add (or allow Access to add) and index
  or Primary Key to the table.

2. The fewer indexes on the KeyText table, the better. Indices have a negative
  effect on the ability to lock and update data quickly. If you have problems
  in your application, try reducing the number of indices.
