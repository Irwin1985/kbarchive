-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have controls bound to a query built by the DataEnvironment and then call
the underlying recordset's Requery method, your bound controls will still
display data from the recordset prior to having called the Requery method. In
short, you will still see your old data.

You may also see an error message stating:

  "Error while trying to set current row."

RESOLUTION
==========

- After you have re-queried the recordset, you must re-bind it.

  -or-

- Bind your controls to the recordset object rather than to the
  DataEnvironment. If you then call the Requery method on the recordset object,
  you see the up-to-date data in your bound controls.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a DataEnvironment to your project.

3. Rename the connection "cnNWind" and use its property pages to use the
  Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider to connect to the Northwind database
  (NWind.MDB) on your hard drive.

4. Add a command to the cnNWind connection. Rename the command "Customers," and
  use the SQL statement "SELECT CustomerID, City FROM Customers."

5. Drag-and-drop the CustomerID and City fields from the DataEnvironment onto
  your form.

6. Drag the Customers command from the DataEnvironment onto your form while
  holding down the right-mouse button. Select "Data Grid" from the available
  choices in the menu that appears when you release the right- mouse button.

7. Add two CommandButtons to your form. Name them cmdModifyData and cmdRequery.

8. Add the following code to your form:

        Private Sub Form_Load()
            cmdModifyData.Caption = "Modify Data"
            cmdRequery.Caption = "Requery"
        End Sub

        Private Sub ReBindMyControls()
            Set txtCustomerID.DataSource = DataEnvironment1
            Set txtCity.DataSource = DataEnvironment1
            Set DataGrid1.DataSource = DataEnvironment1
        End Sub

        Private Sub cmdModifyData_Click()
            Dim strSQL As String
            Dim strNewCity As String
            Dim intRecordsAffected As Integer

            strNewCity = InputBox("Enter a new value for the city")
            If strNewCity &lt;&gt; "" Then
                strSQL = "UPDATE Customers " &amp; _
                         "SET City = '" &amp; strNewCity &amp; "' " &amp; _
                         "WHERE CustomerID = '" &amp; _
                         DataEnvironment1.rsCustomers!CustomerID &amp; "'"
                  DataEnvironment1.cnNWind.Execute strSQL, _
                                       IntRecordsAffected, adExecuteNoRecords
                MsgBox intRecordsAffected &amp; " record(s) affected"
            Else
                MsgBox "No update performed"
            End If
        End Sub

        Private Sub cmdRequery_Click()
            DataEnvironment1.rsCustomers.Requery
            'ReBindMyControls
            MsgBox "Recordset reopened" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
                   "Current customer's city: " &amp; _
                   DataEnvironment1.rsCustomers!City
        End Sub

9. Run the project.

10. Click on the button marked "Modify Data" to enter a new value for the
  current customer's city. The code will modify that row in the database
  without changing the row in the recordset.

11. Click on the button marked "Requery" to re-run the query. You will see a
  message box that says that the recordset has been re-opened and displays the
  value for the current customer's city in the recordset object. You will see
  the value that you entered in step 9 in this message box, but the textbox
  will still display the old value and the data in the grid will remain the
  same.

12. Exit the project by clicking on the "X" button in the upper-right corner of
  the form.

13. Modify the cmdRequery_Click event and un-comment the following line:

        ReBindMyControls

14. Re-run the project.

15. Click on the button marked "Modify Data" to enter a new value for the
  current customer's city. The code will modify that row in the database
  without changing the row in the recordset.

16. Click on the button marked "Requery" to re-run the query. You will see a
  message box that says that the recordset has been re-opened and displays the
  value for the current customer's city in the recordset object. You will see
  the value that you entered in Step 9 in this message box. The grid and
  textbox will now display the new value.

  NOTE: You could also bind your controls to the recordset itself rather than
  to the DataEnvironment by placing the following code in the Form_Load event.
  If you use this method, you do not need to re-bind your controls:

        txtCustomerID.DataMember = ""
        Set txtCustomerID.DataSource = DataEnvironment1.rsCustomers
        txtCity.DataMember = ""
        Set txtCity.DataSource = DataEnvironment1.rsCustomers
        DataGrid1.DataMember = ""
        Set DataGrid1.DataSource = DataEnvironment1.rsCustomers
