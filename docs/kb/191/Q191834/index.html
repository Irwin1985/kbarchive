-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

User profiles that are stored on the server (roaming user profiles) may become
corrupted if contact with the remote server is terminated during the copy
process. This may happen in, but is not limited to, the following scenarios:

- The user prematurely turns the workstation off.

- The network connection from the workstation to the server is severed, for
  example, the cable is disconnected from the network card.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Ntuser.dat contains only part of the profile
information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It should be noted that this hotfix does not resolve the underlying cause of the
profile corruption. It merely prevents the user's NTUSER.DAT on the server from
being overwritten by the uploaded version, until the upload completes
successfully. If the profile does fail to copy successfully, then one of two
things will occur, depending on the user.

If the User Does Not Roam from Computer to Computer
---------------------------------------------------

The user will be prompted at the next logon to select between the local profile
and the remote profile. Because the upload process failed at the last logoff,
the date/time stamp on the remote Ntuser.dat file is older than the date/time
stamp on the local Ntuser.dat file. This causes Windows NT to prompt the user to
prevent a loss of data on the local workstation. If the user selects the remote
profile then any changes made to the user profile in the last session -- colors,
wallpaper, or other settings -- will be lost.

If the User Does Roam from Computer to Computer
-----------------------------------------------

Any changes made to the user profile in the last session -- colors, wallpaper, or
other settings -- session will be lost.

This does not affect any files saved to the Desktop, Personal folder, or other
profile folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

A change has been made that causes profile information to be stored in a
temporary file (Ntuser.dat.tmp) and then renamed to Ntuser.dat when logging
off.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
