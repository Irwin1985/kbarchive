The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience one or more of the following symptoms when you attempt to use
the Profile.exe program to configure the Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax:

- If you attempt to set the absolute break date to January 1, 2000 or later,
  the following error message is displayed:

  Invalid value.

- If you set the relative break time so that the gateway is configured to stop
  on January 1, 2000, and then start the gateway, the expected stop date is
  displayed as "01-01-19100" (without quotation marks) instead of "01-01-2000".

- If you set the absolute break date to January 1, 2000 or later, and then
  attempt to start the gateway, the following error message may be displayed:

  Break Date (year) "00" not valid

  Note that this problem can only occur if the individual fix for the first
  problem listed above has been applied. If this fix has not been applied, you
  cannot set the absolute break date to January 1, 2000 or later.

- If you set the absolute break date to January 1, 2000 or later, and then
  start the gateway, the expected stop date is displayed as "01-01-19100"
  (without quotation marks) instead of "01-01-2000".

  Note that this problem can only occur if the individual fix for the third
  problem listed above has been applied. If this fix has not been applied, you
  cannot start the gateway after setting the absolute break date to January 1,
  2000 or later.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain
the following fix.

This fix should have the following time stamp:

  Faxgtw.exe    7/24/98   1:23p   139,926 bytes (version 3.0.3)
  Profile.exe   7/24/98   1:25p    49,199 bytes (version 3.0.3)
  Profile.glb   7/29/98   5:16p       529 bytes (version 3.0.3)

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Faxgy2k.exe:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/gateways-public/All-Y2K/

The BREAKDATE= line in the Profile.glb file was modified to appear as follows:

     BREAKDATE=12/31/35

NOTE: If you have customized the default Profile.glb file, you should not use the
Profile.glb file that is included with this fix. Instead, you should modify the
BREAKDATE= line in your custom file so that it appears as above. If you use the
Profile.glb file that is included with this fix, your custom changes will be
lost.

STATUS
======

Fax version 3.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more
information.
