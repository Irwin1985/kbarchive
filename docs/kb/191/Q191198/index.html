SUMMARY
=======

Sfolder.exe is a self-extracting compressed file that contains a sample project
demonstrating how to find the directory path of a special folder, such as the
Programs folder. You can use this sample to find the directory path of these
special folders so that your program can search for or load files into these
folders. The project uses Windows API functions to access the special folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Sfolder.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60ent/Sample17/1/W9XNT4/EN-US/Sfolder.exe)

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

When you run the self-extracting executable file, the following files are
expanded into the Special Folders Path Sample Project directory:

- Form1.frm (14K) - The main form of the project.

- ITMalloc.tlb (3K) - The type library required to expose the Free method of
  the IMalloc operating system object. See the next section for more details.

- Project1.vbp (2K) - The project file.

- Project1.vbw (1K) - The workspace file.

- Readme.txt - You are currently reading this file.

How to Run the Sample
---------------------

After expanding all the files, open the project file in the Visual Basic
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). You need to make a reference to the
ITMalloc.tlb type library and add the Microsoft Windows Common Controls 5.0
ActiveX component to the project.

1. Load the sample project into Visual Basic.

2. Press the F5 key or click Start from the Run menu to start the project. The
  ListView controls display a list of all special folders, their constant names
  and values, and the operating systems or browsers that use these folders.

3. Click a Special folder name to display the directory path. If the constant
  does refers to a virtual folder, such as Control Panel
  Programs-CSIDL_CONTROLS, text indicating a function failure appears in the
  text box.

How the Sample Works
--------------------

Each special folder has a unique identification number that can only be accessed
by a pointer to this number. This pointer is called a PIDL. Some of these
folders map to a directory in your computer while others, such as CSIDL_DRIVES
that is equivalent to the My Computer icon, do not have a directory. The list of
special folders are shown in the code section of the sample project.

To get the a pointer to the PIDL of any special folder, use the
SHGetSpecialFolderLocation function. This function fills the SHELLEXECUTEINFO
user defined type with information about the special folder.

However, when you call the SHGetSpecialFolderLocation function, the calling
application is responsible for freeing this pointer. You can free the pointer by
using the Free method of the IMalloc operating system object through the
SHGetMalloc function. Visual Basic can only access the Free method if the method
is exposed through a type library. The ITMalloc.tlb type library to expose the
Free method is included with the self-extracting file.

Once you have the PIDL of a special folder, you can get the directory path of
this folder through the SHGetPathFromIDList function. This function fills a
string buffer with the directory path of a special folder if the folder exists
on the system. The function fails if you pass a special folder without a
directory, such as My Computer.
