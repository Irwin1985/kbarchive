information is provided when available.

For information about running games in MS-DOS mode, please see the "Running an
Application in MS-DOS Mode" section later in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Realms of Arkania - Blade of Destiny by Sir-Tech
------------------------------------------------

Executable: BLADE.BAT, BLADEM.EXE

Realms of Arkania attempts to calibrate the computer in a manner not compatible
with Windows 95. Running it in MS-DOS mode allows the calibration to succeed.

NOTE: The calibration problem occurs only in the program title sequence. To skip
the title sequence, double-click the BLADEM.EXE program icon instead of
BLADE.BAT. This avoids the calibration problem and allow the program to run in
Windows 95 without requiring MS-DOS mode.

Rebel Assault by Lucas Arts
---------------------------

Rebel Assault may require MS-DOS mode on some computers, particularly 386- based
computers or computers with less than 8 MB of RAM. Rebel Assault cannot play
sound on a ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound card unless it is using an 8-bit DMA
channel.

Relentless Twinsen's Adventure by Electronic Arts
-------------------------------------------------

Executable: RELENT.EXE

Relentless Twinsen's Adventure makes incorrect assumptions about the system
memory configuration when Windows 95 is running. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.


Return to Zork by ActiVision
----------------------------

Although you can install Return to Zork in Windows 95, it runs only in MS-DOS
mode. If you receive error messages on a blue background while installing Return
to Zork, ignore them.

Rise of the Robots by Time Warner Interactive
---------------------------------------------

Executable: RISE.EXE

Rise of the Robots has a problem in its timing code that causes it to pause for
long periods of time under certain conditions. The problems may be resolved in
MS-DOS mode.


Robinson's Requiem by Ready Soft
--------------------------------

Executable: START.EXE

Robinson's Requiem has a problem in its timing code that causes it to stop
responding (hang). There are also problems with the MS-DOS extender used by the
program.


Rodney's Funscreen by ActiVision
--------------------------------

Executables: RODNEY.BAT, RODNEY.EXE

The MS-DOS-based version of Rodney's Funscreen is unable to play sounds in
Windows 95. Note that there is a Windows-based version of the program, in the
same package, that works fine.

Sabre
-----

Executable: SABRE.EXE

Sabre requires MS-DOS mode.

Sam 'n Max Hit the Road by Lucas Arts
-------------------------------------

Sam 'n Max Hit the Road may require MS-DOS mode on some computers. On others, it
may run but with degraded sound quality. If you experience problems, run Sam 'n
Max Hit the Road in MS-DOS mode.

Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe by Lucas Arts
---------------------------------------------

The CD-ROM version of Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe experiences problems in
Windows 95. You may be able to avoid these problems in MS-DOS mode.

The floppy disk version appears to run in Windows 95 without any problems.

Shadowcaster by Origin
----------------------

If you have a computer without a math coprocessor, you must run Shadowcaster in
MS-DOS mode.

Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective by ICOM Simulations
--------------------------------------------------------

Sherlock Holmes requires MS-DOS mode.

SimCity Classic by Maxis
------------------------

SimCity requires MS-DOS mode.

SimHealth by Maxis
------------------

Executable: HEALTH.EXE

The MS-DOS extender used by SimHealth is not compatible with Windows 95. It must
be run in MS-DOS mode.

SimLife by Maxis
----------------

Executable: SIMLIFE.BAT

SimLife requires MS-DOS mode.

NOTE: Before installing this game on a 486-based computer, you may have to
restart your computer, press F8 when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

Simon the Sorcerer by Infocom
-----------------------------

Simon the Sorcerer requires MS-DOS mode.

Slam City with Scottie Pippen by Digital Pictures
-------------------------------------------------

Executable: SLAM.EXE

When you run Slam City for the first time it causes a fault in the MS-DOS
extender. The fault occurs because Slam City encounters a problem when it
attempts to determine the proper settings for your sound card. A file called
SLAMTEMP.$$$ is created in the root directory to record the problem. Do not
delete this file.

When you run Slam City a second time, it should detect that the previous attempt
to detect the sound card failed and display an appropriate message.

It may be necessary to restart your computer after you choose the sound card for
sounds to play properly. Depending on your sound card, sound may not work even
after you restart the computer. If this occurs, run Slam City in MS-DOS mode.


Sound Configuration Utility by Dynamix (Sierra Online)
------------------------------------------------------

Executable: SOUNDSET.EXE

This configuration program is used by many Dynamix games. This program accesses
memory after freeing it. Windows 95 memory protection terminates the program due
to an invalid operation. Run the program in MS-DOS mode to avoid the problem.


Space Adventure II by Knowledge Adventure
-----------------------------------------

Space Adventure II requires MS-DOS mode.

Speed Racer by Accolade
-----------------------

Executable: SR.BAT

When you exit Speed Racer, you receive an error message. The error message occurs
because Speed Racer accesses memory after freeing it. Windows 95 memory
protection terminates the program due to an invalid operation. Run Speed Racer
in MS-DOS mode to avoid the problem.


Stalingrad by Avalon Hill
-------------------------

Executable: STALIN.EXE

Stalingrad must be run in MS-DOS mode.

Star Crusader by GameTek
------------------------

Executable: SC.COM

Star Crusader (which comes pre-installed on some Leading Edge computers) runs
poorly in Windows 95. It runs better in MS-DOS mode.

Strike Commander by Origin
--------------------------

Executables: SC.EXE, SCCD.EXE

When you run Strike Commander you receive the following error message:

  Protected mode driver is not responding to EMS function calls. Make sure your
  EMS driver is not configured with the NOEMS option. If it is, replace the
  option "NOEMS" with "RAM."

This error is misleading as Strike Commander is really asking for Virtual Control
Program Interface (VCPI) services, not EMS memory. Windows 95 does not support
VCPI services, so you must run Strike Commander in MS-DOS mode.

Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo by GameTek
---------------------------------------

Executable: SSF2T.BAT

Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is not compatible with Win32. It must be run in
MS-DOS mode.

NOTE: This program does not run if you have a BLASTER environment variable with
no "T" attribute. Please contact GameTek for instructions on including an
appropriate "T" value in the BLASTER environment variable before running Super
Street Fighter 2 Turbo.


Syndicate (and add-ons) by Electronic Arts
------------------------------------------

Executables: SYND.BAT, SYND.EXE

When you run Syndicate or any of its add-ons in Windows 95, you receive the
following error message:

  DOS/16M error: [31] protected mode already in use in this DPMI virtual
  machine

Syndicate requires complete control of the computer and must be run in MS-DOS
mode.

System Shock by Origin
----------------------

Executables: SSHOCK.BAT, SSHOCK.EXE

System Shock has trouble reading the joystick if run from a Windows 95 MS-DOS
prompt. Either disable the joystick feature, or run System Shock in MS-DOS
mode.


The Treehouse by Broderbund
---------------------------

If you have more than 500K of free conventional memory, you can run The Treehouse
in Windows 95. Otherwise, you must run The Treehouse in MS-DOS mode.

Trump Castle 3 by Capstone
--------------------------

Executable: TC3.EXE

Trump Castle sets the timer rate to a speed faster than it can handle. Running it
in MS-DOS mode may resolve the problem.

Ultima VII - The Black Gate by Origin
-------------------------------------

Executable: ULTIMA7.COM

The Black Gate requires MS-DOS mode.


Ultima VII - Part II - Serpent Isle by Origin
---------------------------------------------

Executable: SERPENT.COM

Ultima VII - Serpent Isle refuses to run in a protected-mode operating system. It
must be run in MS-DOS mode.

To run Serpent Isle in MS-DOS mode, you must specify a new MS-DOS configuration.
The following sample CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files may work. If they do not,
please contact Origin for assistance.

  CONFIG.SYS:

  Files=25
  Buffers=25 (per Origin, PS/2 users should use Files &amp; Buffers of 50)

  AUTOEXEC.BAT:

  Path=&lt;Windows folder&gt;;&lt;Windows\Command folder&gt;;&lt;Serpent Isle folder&gt;
  C:\&lt;Path to mouse driver&gt;

Note that Origin recommends that you not run Serpent Isle with any disk
compression.

Ultima VIII - Pagan by Origin
-----------------------------

Executable: U8.EXE

Pagan requires MS-DOS mode.


Ultimate Football by Microprose
-------------------------------

Executables: FOOTBALL.BAT, FOOTBALL.EXE

Ultimate Football requires MS-DOS mode.

Ultrabots by Electronic Arts
----------------------------

Ultrabots sets the timer rate to a speed too fast for Windows 95 to handle
comfortably. It runs, although slowly. Running Ultrabots in MS-DOS mode allows
it to run at full speed.

Under a Killing Moon by Access Software
---------------------------------------

Executable: MOON.EXE

Under a Killing Moon uses the sound card in a way that is not compatible with
Windows 95. If you disable sound support for the game, it may run in Windows 95.
Otherwise, you must run and install Under a Killing Moon in MS-DOS mode.

US Navy Fighters by Electronic Arts
-----------------------------------

Executable: USNF.EXE

US Navy Fighters makes incorrect assumptions about the system memory
configuration when Windows 95 is running; therefore, it must be run in MS-DOS
mode.


Wing Commander II by Origin
---------------------------

Executable: WC2.BAT

Wing Commander manipulates expanded (EMS) memory in a manner incompatible with
Windows 95. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.


Wing Commander II - Special Operations Disk by Origin
-----------------------------------------------------

Executables: SO1.BAT, SO2.BAT, SO1.EXE, SO2.EXE

This add-on to Wing Commander II manipulates expanded (EMS) memory in a manner
incompatible with Windows 95. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.


Wing Commander Armada by Origin
-------------------------------

Executable: ARMADA.EXE

Wing Commander Armada requires Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) services,
which are not supported by Windows 95.

Wings of Glory by Origin
------------------------

Executable: GLORY.EXE

Wings of Glory requires Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) services, which
are not supported by Windows 95.

Wordtris by Spectrum Holobyte
-----------------------------

Wordtris requires MS-DOS mode.

World Atlas version 4 by Software Toolworks
-------------------------------------------

Executable: WA.BAT

World Atlas is unable to play sounds when run at a Windows 95 MS-DOS prompt due
to the way it uses the system timer. To work around this problem, disable the
sound in World Atlas or run it in MS-DOS mode.

World of Xeen - Might and Magic by New World Computing
------------------------------------------------------

World of Xeen requires MS-DOS mode.

Zephyr by New World Computing
-----------------------------

Executable: ZEPHYR.EXE

Zephyr requires MS-DOS mode.

Running an Application in MS-DOS Mode
-------------------------------------

Windows 95 usually runs programs that require MS-DOS mode in MS-DOS mode
automatically. If it does not, delete the corresponding .PIF file and
double-click the program icon again. Note that .PIF files usually have the same
name as the program file, but with a .PIF extension instead of the .BAT, .COM,
or .EXE extension. The corresponding .PIF file can be found in one of the
following locations:

- In the folder that contains the program file.

- In the hidden PIF folder in the Windows 95 folder.

- In a folder specified by your PATH statement.

To make certain you find all copies of the .PIF file, use the Find Files Or
Folders feature.

If Windows 95 does not configure the program to run in MS-DOS mode automatically,
follow these steps:

1. Click the executable file with the right mouse button, then click Properties
  on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

3. Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it.

4. You can usually use the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration option. However,
  some programs may require that you use the Specify A New Configuration
  option. Consult the program's documentation for sample CONFIG.SYS and
  AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

5. Click OK.

These steps cause the program to run in MS-DOS mode. You may need to optimize the
settings if the program requires a mouse, expanded memory, a CD-ROM drive, or a
sound card. Consult the program's documentation to determine if it has specific
needs.

NOTE: You may have to double-click the program icon in Windows Explorer or My
Computer, or type the program name in the Run dialog box, for the program's
settings to take effect. Typing the program name at an MS-DOS prompt does not
always cause the program's settings to be used.
