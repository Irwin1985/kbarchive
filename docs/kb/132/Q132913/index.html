SUMMARY
=======

Files on all but the first disk of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article are combined in cabinet form, and as such cannot be copied individually
to other disks or hard drives.

This article explains how to use the Extract utility to locate or copy any
individual files from the cabinet files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article is organized as follows:

- Where to get the Extract utility

- How to interrupt the Extract program

- Copying an entire CAB file

- Extracting all files from a CAB file

- Displaying all files in a particular CAB file

- Locating a particular file in particular CAB file

- Locating a particular file in an unknown CAB file

- Extracting a single file from a particular CAB file

- Extracting a single file from an unknown CAB file

- Extracting certain types of files from a particular CAB file

- Syntax of the EXTRACT utility

Where to Get the Extract Utility
--------------------------------

The Extract utility is located on Disk 1 of each of the disk sets listed above,
except for Works 4.0 for Windows 95. Copy the file Extract.exe from Disk 1 to
your computer and place it in a directory on your path. To extract files from
the CAB files on the Works 4.0 disks, use the copy of Extract.exe in your
&lt;Windows 95&gt;\Command directory.

In order to make best use of space, certain large files are spread among the
disks.

How to Interrupt the Extract Program
------------------------------------

You can cancel a running Extract program by pressing CTRL+C.

Copying an Entire CAB File
--------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  extract /c &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; &lt;destination&gt;

where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter, &lt;cabinetname&gt; is the name of the
cabinet file you want to copy, and &lt;destination&gt; is the full path and
filename of where you want the cabinet file to end up.

This command is necessary when you are copying an entire cabinet file from floppy
disks to a hard drive or network drive. If the cabinet file is already on the
hard drive or network drive, you can copy files to any hard drive or network
drive with a simple COPY command. The Extract utility is necessary only when you
are copying the file from floppy disks, because the floppy disks are formatted
in a new way, and require a special utility to read them.

For example, to copy a cabinet file named EXCEL2.CAB from drive A to the
directory C:\DISK2, use the following syntax:

  extract /c a:\excel2.cab c:\disk2\excel2.cab

Extracting All Files from a CAB File
------------------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  extract /e /a /l &lt;destination&gt; &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt;

The /E switch extracts all files on the specified cabinet(s).

The /A switch extracts all files on all disks, beginning with the first cabinet
specified. You can specify any cabinet file, and Extract will search that
cabinet file and all files that come after it. Be sure to place the disk
specified in the command line in the drive before executing this command.

The /L switch lists the locations of the files. First the destination of the
files expanded files is given, followed by a space and the source of the cabinet
files. If you omit this switch, Extract expands files into the current
directory.

For example, to copy all of the files from all cabinets on all disks to the
directory C:\FLAT, use the following command (and place disk 1 in drive A:):

  extract /e /a /l c:\flat a:\excel1.cab

To copy all of the files from the EXCEL4.CAB cabinet to the current directory,
use the following command:

  extract /e a:\excel4.cab

To copy all of the files from the WORD5.CAB file to the directory C:\DISK5, use
the following command:

  extract /e /l c:\disk5 a:\word5.cab

To copy all of the files from Word disks 5 through 7 to the directory C:\DISKS,
use the following command:

  extract /e /a /l c:\disks a:\word5.cab

Displaying All Files in a Particular CAB File
---------------------------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  extract /d &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt;

For example, to list all the files in EXCEL2.CAB, use the following command:

  extract /d a:\excel2.cab

Locating a Particular File in a Particular CAB File
---------------------------------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  extract /d &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; &lt;filename&gt;

For example, to see if ODBC.DLL is located in the WORD7.CAB file, use the
following command:

  extract /d a:\word7.cab odbc.dll

For example, to list all *.DLL files in the WORD7.CAB file, use the following
command:

  extract /d a:\word7.cab *.dll

Locating a Particular File in an Unknown CAB File
-------------------------------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  extract /a &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;firstcabinetname&gt; /d &lt;filename&gt;

For example, to find the file SOLVER.XLA when you don't know which cabinet it's
in, use the following command to look on all disks, starting with Disk 1 (be
sure to place Disk 1 in the drive before you start):

  extract /a a:\excel1.cab /d solver.xla

As Extract views the contents of each disk, it displays the name of the cabinet
file on the screen. When it finds the filename you are looking for, it displays
the file information on the screen.

NOTE: Extract will continue to search the remaining disks to see if there is a
duplicate filename. You must watch the screen carefully to see when the file
information is displayed, and note the cabinet name that was displayed above
it--this is the cabinet you are looking for.

HINT: If the cabinet files are all stored on a network drive or a hard drive, the
cabinet names may scroll off the screen before you can read them. Redirect the
Extract output to a file, and scroll through the file using Notepad or another
text editor.

NOTE: This method is not suitable for use with disks, as you receive no prompting
that Extract is waiting for the next disk.

Redirecting results to a text file
----------------------------------

1. Type the command above, adding a greater-than symbol (&gt;) and a text
  filename:

  EXTRACT /A A:\EXCEL1.CAB /D SOLVER.XLA &gt; LIST.TXT

2. Press ENTER.

3. The command-line prompt appears and a new file has been created in the
  current directory. The file LIST.TXT can be opened and read with any text
  editor.

Extracting a single file from a particular CAB file
---------------------------------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  extract &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; filename /l &lt;destination&gt;

For example, to extract the file CALENDAR.WIZ and copy it to the
C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE directory, use the following command:

  extract a:\word6.cab calendar.wiz /l c:\winword\template

Extracting a Single File from an Unknown CAB File
-------------------------------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  Extract /A &lt;Drive&gt;:\&lt;Cabinetname&gt; &lt;Filename&gt; /L
  &lt;Destination&gt;

Extract searches all the cabinet files in sequential order and then extracts the
file once it is found.

For example, to extract the MSSPEL2.DLL file from disks in drive A into the
WINDOWS\MSAPPS\PROOF directory on drive C, use the following command:

  extract /a a:\word1.cab msspel2.dll /l c:\windows\msapps\proof

Extract will look at every cabinet file, beginning with the first cabinet file
you specified. When Extract finds the file, it extracts it, and continues
looking through the rest of the disks.

Extracting Certain Types of Files from a Particular CAB File
------------------------------------------------------------

The syntax of this command is

  extract &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;cabinetname&gt; &lt;filetype&gt;
  &lt;destination&gt;

For example, to extract all the *.DLL files on Word's Disk 7, use the following
command:

  EXTRACT A:\WORD7.CAB *.DLL D:\WINWORD

Syntax of the EXTRACT Utility
-----------------------------

To obtain a complete list of command options for the EXTRACT, insert Disk 1 and
switch to the drive containing the disk. For example, type "A:" without the
quotation marks if the disk is in drive A. Then type EXTRACT or EXTRACT /? at
the command prompt to obtain a list of commands for EXTRACT. You will see the
list below:

EXTRACT [/Y] [/A] [/D | /E] [/L dir] cabinet [filename ...]
EXTRACT [/Y] source [newname]
EXTRACT [/Y] /C source destination

 cabinet  - Cabinet file (contains two or more files).
 filename - Name of the file to extract from the cabinet. Wild cards and
            multiple filenames (separated by blanks) may be used.
 source   - Compressed file (a cabinet with only one file).
 newname  - New filename to give the extracted file. If not supplied, the
            original name is used.
 /A         Process ALL cabinets.  Follows cabinet chain starting in first
            cabinet mentioned.
 /C         Copy source file to destination (to copy from DMF disks).
 /D         Display cabinet directory (use with filename to avoid
            extract).
 /E         Extract (use instead of *.* to extract all files).
 /L dir     Location to place extracted files (default is current
            directory).
 /Y         Do not prompt before overwriting an existing file.
