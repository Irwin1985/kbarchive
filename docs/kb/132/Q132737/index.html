-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Q. What are the system requirements for installing Windows 95?

  A. Your computer must meet these minimal requirements:

       - Computer:        386DX, 20 MHz (or higher) processor.

       - Memory:          4 MB (8 MB recommended).
                          8 MB is required to run The Microsoft
                          Network, Microsoft Exchange, or multiple
                          32-bit programs.

       - Hard Disk:       20 to 90 MB of available hard disk space.
                          The actual space required depends on whether
                          you are upgrading to Windows 95 and the
                          Setup option you choose.

       - Video:           VGA or higher resolution (SVGA recommended).

       - Peripheral:      High-density floppy disk drive, CD-ROM
                          drive, or the ability to install from
                          a network server.

       - Pointing Device: Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing
                          device.

2. Q. I upgraded to Windows 95, and now I do not see Program Manager. How do I
  run programs in Windows 95?

  A. All of your Windows 3.1 program groups are converted into cascading menus
  off the Start menu in Windows 95. To run your programs in Windows 95, click
  the Start button, point to Programs, point to the group containing the
  program you want to run, then click the program's icon. Note that you need to
  click the program icon only once to start the program; you do not have to
  double-click the icon.

  If you want to use Program Manager to run your programs, you can. To do so,
  click the Start button, click Run, type "progman" (without the quotation
  marks) in the Open box, and then press ENTER. Note that Program Manager does
  not use long filenames.

3. Q. How do I copy a floppy disk in Windows 95?

  A. Use the following steps to copy a floppy disk:

  1. Double-click My Computer.

  2. Use the right mouse button to click the floppy disk drive containing the
     disk you want to copy, and then click Copy Disk on the menu that appears.

  3. In the Copy From box, click the drive containing the disk you want to
     copy. In the Copy To box, click the drive containing the disk you want to
     copy to, and then click Start.

4. Q. How do I add or remove Windows 95 components?

  A. To add or remove Windows 95 components, use these steps:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

  3. Click the Windows Setup tab, and then follow the instructions on the tab.

5. Q. A friend has a version of Windows 95 that includes more features than my
  version. Why does my version not have the same features?

  A. Windows 95 is available on CD-ROM and floppy disks. More components are
  included in the CD-ROM version because of the additional space available on
  the CD-ROM. To obtain the CD-ROM Extras for Windows 95 upgrade on 3.5-inch
  high-density disks, use the coupon included in your Windows 95 package. You
  can also download the CD-ROM Extras for Windows 95 upgrade from the Microsoft
  Download Center. For more information about downloading the CD-ROM Extras for
  Windows 95 upgrade, please see the Extra.txt file in Windows 95.

6. Q. What is a shortcut, and how do I add one to the Start menu?

  A. A shortcut is a link to an object (such as a program or document). A
  shortcut can point to a file on your computer or a file on a network server.
  A shortcut can even point to a paragraph in a document. To add a shortcut to
  the Start menu, use the following two steps:

  1. Use the right mouse button to click the taskbar, and then click Properties
     on the menu that appears.

  2. On the Start Menu Programs tab, click Add and follow the instructions.

  For more information about creating shortcuts, click the Start button, click
  Help, click the Index tab, and search for "shortcuts."

7. Q. What is Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95?

  A. Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 is a software package that includes many
  add-ons for Windows 95, such as:

   - Microsoft Internet Explorer (so you can surf the Internet)

   - Dial-Up Networking Server (so other computers can dial in to your
     computer)

   - New DriveSpace(TM) disk compression

   - 3D Pinball

   - Desktop Themes (so you can personalize your desktop with wallpaper, icons,
     and screen savers)

8. Q. How can I view two drives at one time as I did using File Manager in
  Windows 3.1?

  A. To view two drives in Windows 95, open two instances of Windows Explorer or
  My Computer.

9. Q. How do I create or modify file associations in Windows 95?

  A. To create, modify, or remove file associations, use the following three
  steps:

  1. Double-click My Computer.

  2. On the View menu, click Options.

  3. Click the File Types tab. To create a file association, click New Type. To
     modify an association, click the file type in the Registered File Types
     box, and then click Edit. To remove an association, click the file type,
     and then click Remove.

  When you double-click a file type without an association, Windows 95 opens a
  dialog box so you can create an association if you want.

10. Q. Is it true that filenames in Windows 95 are not limited to eight
  characters plus a three-character extension?

  A. Yes. In Windows 95 you can create filenames with up to 250 characters. For
  example, you can create a filename called "June Summary Report.doc." If the
  program you are using does not recognize long filenames, Windows 95 supplies
  short MS-DOS filenames.

  For more information about long filenames, please see the following article
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
