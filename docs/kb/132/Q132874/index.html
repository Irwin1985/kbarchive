- Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists tips you can use to enhance performance of applications built
with Visual C++ Cross-Development Edition for Macintosh (VCMac).

NOTE: This article does not give you a comprehensive list of techniques that can
be used to speed your VCMac application. To get the best out of VCMac, you might
need to fine tune your application to run better on a Macintosh. Macintosh
architecture is different from Windows architecture, so a knowledge of Macintosh
programming is essential to build good Macintosh applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Tips for Improving Performance
------------------------------

- To determine which portions of the application need to be optimized, use the
  Profiler, which is documented in Appendix C of the 68K Programmer's Guide.

- The process of creating a memory DC, creating a bitmap, and selecting the
  bitmap into the DC is expensive when performed on the Macintosh. It is faster
  to create the DC and cache it instead of recreating it every time.

- Copying DIBs to the screen or to other DCs is expensive because the DIB color
  table must be converted and the DIB data must be reoriented. If a DIB will be
  rendered frequently, copy the DIB to a memory DC. For each screen update,
  copy the DC to the screen instead of the DIB.

- Currently PeekMessage and GetMessage call WaitNextEvent if there aren't any
  messages waiting in the internal queue. WaitNextEvent on the Macintosh is
  considerably slower than PeekMessage and GetMessage are under Windows. You
  may want to wrap calls to PeekMessage or GetMessage in functions that limit
  the frequency by which PeekMessage or GetMessage are called to every two
  ticks. For more information on ticks, please see TickCount in the Inside
  Macintosh documentation.

- Applications frequently perform background processing that is terminated as
  soon as there are messages to process. PeekMessage(PM_NOREMOVE) is often used
  to test for the existence of messages in the queue. To avoid the overhead
  associated with calling PeekMessage(), use GetInputState() instead.
  GetInputState doesn[ASCII 146]t call WaitNextEvent.

- If you allocate a lot of memory in fixed blocks (GlobalAlloc(GPTR) or
  LocalAlloc(LPTR)), switch to using relocatable blocks instead, and lock these
  blocks of memory while dereferencing them. This will reduce heap
  fragmentation and make memory allocations faster.

- Increase your partition size to reduce the amount of code swapping and to
  prevent thrashing. The partition size is determined by the SIZE resource
  defined in a project[ASCII 146]s .R file. The Generic.Mac sample contains an
  example .R file with a SIZE resource.

- Segment the application so that code segments can be swapped out efficiently.
  Use consistent segment sizes such as 30k to 50k. Additionally, use the
  Profiler to optimize segmentation.

- Use Compiler (speed or size) and Linker (opt:ref) optimizations available in
  the Project Settings. The debug Windows Portability Libraries perform a lot
  of parameter checking, so comparing speed and size with the debug libraries
  is not a valid exercise.

- To reduce the size of the application, remove MacsBug symbols from shipping
  code.

- To reduce the application size further, remove segment names from the CODE
  resources, and delete the MSCV resource used for debugging. Use an MRC script
  to do this.

- Use special case drawing and screen updating associated with user feedback.
  For example, if you want to drag a shape across the screen, the Windows way
  of invalidating the old location (updating data structures and waiting for
  the WM_PAINT message to draw the update) does not work well on the Macintosh.
  A more efficient method follows in pseudo code:

     hdc = GetDC(hwnd);
     do
     {
        msg = PeekMsg (mouse msgs only)

        switch (msg)
        {
           case WM_MOUSEMOVE:
              erase old one
              update data structure
              draw new location
              break;
           case ...

       } while msg != WM_MOUSEUP

- The startup and shutdown times can be negatively impacted by reading or
  writing a lot of preferences with ProfileString APIs. Try to limit the number
  of preferences to be written out.

- If the Profiler indicates that a specific WLM API is consuming too much time,
  use the wrapper functions to obtain the related data structure, and then call
  the appropriate Macintosh API directly.

- Property sheets and property pages implemented using MFC would be slow on the
  Mac. To workaround, use your own implementation of property pages. You could
  use native Mac calls to create property pages.
