-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Q. What can I do if I have a problem connecting to The Microsoft Network?

  A. Use the right mouse button to click The Microsoft Network icon on the
  desktop, and then click Connection Settings on the menu that appears. Click
  the Help button to start a connection troubleshooter that ends with a list of
  support phone numbers to use if you are still having trouble.

2. Q. How do I change my member ID, get a new password if I forget mine, or
  cancel an account?

  A. Answers to frequently asked questions about accounts and billing are
  located in Accounts And Billing Information in the Accounts And Billing
  folder of Member Assistance. To cancel an account, go to the For More
  Information page of Accounts And Billing Information and click the Cancel My
  Account icon.

  You cannot change your member ID on an existing account. The only way to get a
  new ID is to create a new account and cancel your old account.

  If you forget your password, you need to call Customer Service in your region.
  Customer Service numbers are available from the Help menu or from the For
  More Information page of Accounts And Billing Information.

3. Q. How can I change my member information?

  A. Use the following six steps to change your information:

  1. In The Microsoft Network, open e-mail.

  2. On the Tools menu, click Address Book.

  3. On the Tools menu, click Find.

  4. Enter your member ID, click OK, and then click your name.

  5. On the File menu, click Properties.

  6. Change or delete any of the information except your member ID.

  If you enter or change your date of birth, make sure to use the format
  MM/DD/YYYY or MM/DD/YY. If you omit the year, The Microsoft Network displays
  an error message indicating that the information could not be saved.

4. Q. Why is the Remember My Password check box on the Sign In screen
  unavailable?

  A. The Microsoft Network uses the Windows 95 password feature as part of its
  security. If you do not use a password to start Windows 95, the Remember My
  Password option for The Microsoft Network is not available. To set a Windows
  95 password, use the following five steps:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Passwords icon.

  3. On the Change Passwords tab, click the Change Windows Password button.

  4. Click OK.

  5. Type your password, then click OK.

5. Q. How secure is my credit card number when I use it on The Microsoft
  Network?

  A. Your credit card number is authorized through the credit card network just
  as it is when you make a purchase in a store. When we authorize your credit
  card, we use the same security procedures that are in place for retail
  merchants. Your number is kept in a highly encrypted form within The
  Microsoft Network. Your number is not available to network administrators,
  marketing programs, information providers, or even Customer Service.

6. Q. Can I read bulletin board (BBS) messages offline?

  A. No, The Microsoft Network does not have an offline reader. This feature is
  under review for a future release.

7. Q. Why do I not see BBS messages I saw previously?

  A. Because of the large number of BBS messages expected on The Microsoft
  Network, messages you previously opened do not appear in the message list. To
  see a previously opened message, click Show All Messages on the Tools menu.

  You should also check to make sure that the message is not part of a collapsed
  conversation (or thread). To make it easier to see all the messages in a BBS,
  click Expand All Conversations on the View menu, or click List on the Tools
  menu.

8. Q. Messages I posted to a BBS did not show up. Why?

  A. BBS messages do not go to the bulletin board immediately when you post
  them. Ordinarily, it takes only a few seconds to replicate a posting, but
  delays are possible.

9. Q. Does The Microsoft Network notify me if I have replies to BBS messages I
  posted?

  A. No, you need to open the bulletin board in question and check for replies.
  You can also place a shortcut to your message on the desktop or in a folder.

10. Q. Where can I get help if I have a problem sending e-mail from The
  Microsoft Network to other addresses?

  A. Send e-mail to "Postmaster" (without quotation marks) on The Microsoft
  Network. Please describe the problem you are having, including the address
  to which you are sending mail.
