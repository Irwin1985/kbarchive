MORE INFORMATION
================

1942: The Pacific Air War by Microprose
---------------------------------------

Executables: 1942.BAT, 1942.EXE

1942: The Pacific Air War requires MS-DOS mode.

Aces of the Deep by Dynamix (Sierra Online)
-------------------------------------------

Executables: AOD.BAT, AOD.EXE

If you run Aces of the Deep in Windows 95, it encounters internal assertion
failures. Run it in MS-DOS mode to resolve these errors.


Aegis: Guardian of the Fleet
----------------------------

Executables: AEGIS.EXE, AEGISV.EXE

Aegis sets the timer rate to a speed faster than the game can handle. Running it
in MS-DOS mode may alleviate some of the problem.

Archon Ultra by Free Fall Associates
------------------------------------

Executable: ARCHON.EXE

Archon Ultra sets the timer rate to a speed too fast for Windows 95 to handle
comfortably. Running it in MS-DOS mode allows the program to run at full speed.

Arctic Baron by Ready Soft
--------------------------

Executable: START.EXE

Arctic Baron requires MS-DOS mode to run in Windows 95.

Are You Afraid of the Dark? by Viacom
-------------------------------------

Executable: AFRAID.BAT

Are You Afraid of the Dark? uses virtual memory in a way that causes erratic
sound and speech. Depending on your system configuration, it may also fail
during sound and video playback. Run it in MS-DOS mode to resolve these
problems.


Battle Chess 4000 by Interplay
------------------------------

Battle Chess requires MS-DOS mode.

Battledrome by Dynamix (Sierra Online)
--------------------------------------

Executable: BD.EXE

Battledrome is not compatible with VSHARE; therefore, it must be run in MS-DOS
mode.


Beneath a Steel Sky
-------------------

Executable: SKY.EXE

Beneath a Steel Sky uses a memory model not compatible with Windows 95. Run it in
MS-DOS mode.


Bioforge by Origin
------------------

Executable: BIOFORGE.EXE

Bioforge makes incorrect assumptions about the system memory configuration when
Windows 95 is running. This causes it to fail to detect most of the memory
installed in the computer. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.


Bloodnet by Microprose
----------------------

Bloodnet works only when the DMA channel is set to 7 if you are using the Pro
Audio Spectrum sound card. The game tries to reconfigure the sound device to DMA
7 automatically. This is not tolerated by the virtual device driver (VxD).

To resolve this issue, you can use one of the following methods:

- Use Sound Blaster-compatible mode on your PAS.

- Reconfigure the PAS device to DMA 7.

- Use MS-DOS mode.

Brett Hull Hockey 95 by Accolade
--------------------------------

Executable: HOCKEY.EXE

Brett Hull Hockey 95 requires MS-DOS mode and a properly set BLASTER environment
variable in order to play sound.

enabled, your computer may (stop responding) hang after sound effects.

Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator,
Chuck Yeager's Air Combat by Electronic Arts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Executables: AFS.EXE, AFS.BAT

In order to play speech and sound effects through the computer's built-in
speaker, these programs set the timer rate to a speed too fast for Windows 95 to
handle comfortably. Running the programs in MS-DOS mode allows them to run at
full speed.

Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator may also encounter copy protection
problems if not run in MS-DOS mode.


Club Dead by Viacom
-------------------

Club Dead contains timing-related problems that cause the program to fail. It
must be run in MS-DOS mode.


Comanche Overkill by Nova Logic
-------------------------------

Executables: C.BAT, COMANCHE.EXE

Comanche Overkill requires complete control of the computer and must be run in
MS-DOS mode. Windows 95 should automatically run this program in MS-DOS mode. If
it does not, remove all .PIF files associated with COMANCHE.EXE or C.BAT and
restart the game.


Command Adventures Starship by Future Visionary, Inc. and Merit Software
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Executable: STARSHIP.COM

Command Adventures Starship does not check whether memory allocations were
successful and corrupts itself if a memory allocation subsequently fails. You
may be able to run this game in Windows 95 by adding "/NUMHANDLES=40" (without
the quotation marks) to the HIMEM.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file. This setting
increases the number of XMS handles available. If this does not work, run
Command Adventures Starship in MS-DOS mode.


Curse of the Catacombs by FroggMan

megabytes (MB) of memory or more. Contact the manufacturer if you are
encountering this problem.


Dark Forces by Lucas Arts
-------------------------

During the installation of Dark Forces, the sound detection must run twice to
detect AWE 32. Furthermore, Dark Forces may fail to run in Windows 95 on some
computers. If you encounter problems, run Dark Forces in MS-DOS mode.

comfortably and must be run in MS-DOS mode.

Grand Prix by Road and Track
----------------------------

Grand Prix does not run well in an MS-DOS session when you are using the PC
speaker as the designated sound output device. System performance slows
considerably because of the increased timer load by the PC speaker. To boost
performance with this game, run the game in MS-DOS mode, or turn off the PC
speaker sound.

it to run at full speed.

Running an Application in MS-DOS Mode
-------------------------------------

Windows 95 usually runs programs that require MS-DOS mode in MS-DOS mode
automatically. If it does not, delete the corresponding .PIF file and
double-click the program icon again. Note that .PIF files usually have the same
name as the program file, but with a .PIF extension instead of the .BAT, .COM,
or .EXE extension. The corresponding .PIF file can be found in one of the
following locations:

- In the folder that contains the program file.

- In the hidden PIF folder in the Windows 95 folder.

- In a folder specified by your PATH statement.

To make certain you find all copies of the .PIF file, use the Find Files Or
Folders feature.

If Windows 95 does not configure the program to run in MS-DOS mode automatically,
follow these steps:

1. Click the executable file with the right mouse button, then click Properties
  on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

3. Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it.

4. You can usually use the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration option. However,
  some programs may require that you use the Specify A New Configuration
  option. Consult the program's documentation for sample CONFIG.SYS and
  AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

5. Click OK.

These steps cause the program to run in MS-DOS mode. You may need to optimize the
settings if the program requires a mouse, expanded memory, a CD-ROM drive, or a
sound card. Consult the program's documentation to determine if it has specific
needs.

NOTE: You may have to double-click the program icon in Windows Explorer or My
Computer, or type the program name in the Run dialog box, for the program's
settings to take effect. Typing the program name at an MS-DOS prompt does not
always cause the program's settings to be used.
