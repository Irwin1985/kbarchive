SUMMARY
=======

This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Fax for Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What fax/modems does Microsoft Fax support?

  A. Microsoft Fax supports Class 1 and Class 2 fax/modems. Class 1 fax/modems
  can send documents to each other in an editable (or e-mail) format. Class 2
  fax/modems can send and receive faxes in facsimile format only.

2. Q. Why does my CAS modem not work with Microsoft Fax?

  A. CAS modems (such as the Intel SatisFAXtion 200i, Intel SatisFAXtion 400i,
  and GammaLink CAS modem) are not supported in Microsoft Fax. A firmware
  revision is available from Pure Data for the Intel SatisFAXtion 400i CAS
  modem to make it Class 1 compatible. For information about whether your modem
  can be made Class 1 compatible, please contact your modem manufacturer.

3. Q. Why does Microsoft Fax indicate that it is going offline when I use The
  Microsoft Network?

  A. This occurs because you have selected both Microsoft Fax and The Microsoft
  Network services in your Microsoft Exchange profile. When you launch
  electronic mail services using The Microsoft Network, Microsoft Exchange
  attempts to load all the installed providers, causing Microsoft Fax to be
  loaded as well. Microsoft Fax cannot initialize the communications port
  because The Microsoft Network is already connected. When you disconnect from
  The Microsoft Network, Microsoft Fax can go online automatically.

4. Q. I upgraded my shared Windows for Workgroups At Work Fax server to the
  Windows 95 network fax server and now I cannot connect to it using a Windows
  for Workgroups At Work Fax client. Why?

  A. The network fax server components have been redesigned in Windows 95,
  causing you to be unable to connect to Windows 95 network fax servers using
  Windows for Workgroups At Work Fax clients. A resolution for this problem
  should be available soon.

5. Q. Why is Microsoft Fax unable to initialize the modem when I start Microsoft
  Exchange? CompuServe Mail does not seem to have a problem accessing the
  modem.

  A. If you have both CompuServe Mail and Microsoft Fax services installed in
  your Microsoft Exchange profile and you have enabled the Retrieve Mail On
  Startup option for CompuServe Mail, Microsoft Fax cannot initialize the port
  until the CompuServe Mail service disconnects and releases the port. To work
  around this behavior, disable the Retrieve Mail On Startup option in
  CompuServe Mail so that Microsoft Fax can initialize the modem. Once
  Microsoft Fax has initialized the modem, connect to CompuServe and retrieve
  your mail.

6. Q. When I compose a new message and address it using the [FAX:XXX-XXXX]
  format, the prefix settings are ignored. Why?

  A. When you use this format to send a fax, Microsoft Fax does not use TAPI
  services to create a phone number to dial and ignores prefixes defined using
  TAPI. To work around this behavior, use the following format instead:

  [FAX:+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX]

7. Q. Why does my fax/modem connect at only 9600 bits per second (bps)?

  A. During the development and testing of Microsoft Fax, we found that some
  fax/modems are unreliable when sending at 14.4 bps in fax mode. High-speed
  transmission is disabled for these modems. If you feel your fax/modem
  supports high-speed transmission, you can enable high-speed transmission with
  the following steps:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Mail And Fax icon, click Microsoft Fax, then click
     Properties.

  3. On the Modem tab, click your modem, then click Properties.

  4. Click the Advanced button, then click the Disable High Speed Transmission
     check box to clear it. Click OK.

8. Q. Why can I send faxes but not receive them?

  A. To receive incoming faxes, you must start Microsoft Exchange and set the
  modem to Auto Answer or Manual Answer mode.

9. Q. When I send a fax in binary format I receive an error message stating
  "Editable format not supported." Why?

  A. To use binary format or advanced security options, both the sending and
  receiving fax/modems must be supported Class 1 fax/modems.

10. Q. Can I make my fax/modem answer the phone in one ring?

  A. No, there is no way to make the fax/modem answer in one ring. This is a
  limitation of Microsoft Fax.
