- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In order for Schedule+ users to be able to View Free and Busy Times, create
appointments to external resources, and have the calendar files updated
instantly, the "dynamic connection" method must be configured via the
ADMINSCH.EXE program.

The other View Free and Busy Time method, using SCHDIST.EXE, is not suitable
because the external resources' calendar files will not be instantly updated.
This is because the process would depend on the time intervals and succession of
SCHDIST.EXE and EXTERNAL.EXE.

In order for dynamic connection to work, each workstation must have the
capabilities to access the Mail servers where the Schedule+ calendar files are
stored. The workstations need to have the capabilities to connect to an external
Mail server, write to a calendar file as it books appointment to a resource, and
disconnect dynamically. This configuration task can easily be achieved in a
Microsoft Network or Novell NetWare environment. This is due to the fact that,
in either case, the workstations would already have efficient hardware and
software loaded to establish network connection to any server.

However, Mail and Schedule+ documentation do not address the underlying steps of
configuring a workstation to have full network connectivity in a mixed networks
environment, such as one made up of NetWare and Microsoft Network (NTAS). In
other words, it is assumed that the workstation network setup is already taken
care of by the organization network administration group, where the workstations
would already have the capability to access network resources (in this case,
Mail servers) that are on NetWare, as well as those that are on Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In some cases, under the limitations of current technology, dual protocols may
be required at the workstations. For example, considering the diagram below
where a user on Windows for Workgroups machine 1 would like to use the dynamic
connection method to View Free and Busy Times of a user's calendar on Windows
for Workgroups Machine 2, and vice versa.

  WFWG1 &lt;---&gt; NetWare Server      NTAS &lt;---&gt; WFWG2

In this scenario, workstations that resemble WFWG1 that are possibly loading
IPXODI/NETX (Real mode) must also be configured in WFWG Network Setup to
recognize Microsoft Networks, which results in loading Netbeui (Protect mode).
This will allow them to connect to the NTAS server. In return, workstations that
resemble WFWG2 that are possibly loading Netbeui must also be loading IPX/SPX
with Netbios.

Perhaps in the near future, new technologies and tools will make this task more
seamless and transparent.
