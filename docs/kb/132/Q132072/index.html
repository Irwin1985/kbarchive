Memory Configuration

To run Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1, you need a computer
with at least 500 kilobytes (K) of free conventional memory.
If your computer does not have an expanded memory manager
(EMM), you need 560K of free conventional memory. Flight
Simulator displays a message if your computer has
insufficient conventional memory, and you cannot run the
program.  Please refer to the "Troubleshooting Guide for
Setup" in Chapter 24 of the Flight Simulator Pilot's
Handbook for tips on optimizing your system performance.

You can significantly enhance Flight Simulator's performance
if you configure your computer for expanded memory.  Please
refer to the "Troubleshooting Guide for Setup" in Chapter 24
of the Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook or to your MS-DOS
manual for instructions on how to configure your computer
for expanded memory.

If you have no extended or expanded memory, or encounter out
of memory errors when running Flight Simulator, you will get
better performance if you turn off the sound option.  To do
this, choose Preferences from the Options menu, and then
choose the Sound button. In the Sound Preferences dialog
box, choose No Sound Device from the Sound Board list.  This
will save additional conventional memory and allow more
features to run.

If your machine has only 4 megabytes (MB) of memory, Flight
Simulator will run better if you use the RAM memory
parameter (see MS-DOS help on EMM386.EXE) with no EMS
limiter syntax used in the emm386 line in CONFIG.SYS for MS-
DOS version 6.0 or later. If you are running MS-DOS version
5.0, you will have better memory and system performance if
you upgrade to MS-DOS version 6.0 or later.

For example, the RAM memory parameter is as follows:

 DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM H=255 D=64

Your actual line may have slightly different arguments, but
the important thing is the presence of the RAM argument.
H=255 is the number of EMS handles, and D=64 is the number
of direct memory access buffers.  The values shown are best
for Flight Simulator.

Hard Disk Space Requirement

If your hard drive has 16K clusters (16384 bytes/cluster),
the save load time disk space requirement is 22 MB. If your
hard drive has 8K clusters (8192/cluster), the hard disk
space requirement is 15 MB.  The Setup program checks for 20
MB available on the hard disk.

Running Flight Simulator under Microsoft Windows

To run Flight Simulator under Windows, you must configure
your system for expanded memory.  Running Flight Simulator
under Windows with extended memory may cause memory errors.
In such a case, Windows terminates your Flight Simulator
session.  Please refer to the "Troubleshooting Guide for
Setup" in Chapter 24 of the Flight Simulator Pilot's
Handbook or to your MS-DOS manual for instructions on how to
configure your computer for expanded memory.

Loading Sound into Conventional Memory:

Flight Simulator loads sound files into XMS memory for
storage and quick playback.  Running under Windows can cause
this memory to be moved, resulting in noisy sounds or system
crashes.  Windows informs you of any system problems with an
error dialog.  If this occurs, choose Preferences from the
Options menu, and then choose the Sound button.  In the
Sound Preferences dialog box, change the Use XMS Memory
option to No.  When you select this option, Flight Simulator
uses additional conventional memory but resolves sound
playback problems that would occur using XMS memory.

If the aircraft in Flight Simulator are not flying smoothly
under Windows, you should run Flight Simulator directly from
MS-DOS.  This will result in a higher display rate and
smoother flying aircraft.

If you cannot get Flight Simulator to run properly under
Windows, you should run Flight Simulator in MS-DOS mode.
Refer to Windows online Help for information on running in
MS-DOS mode.

You can use FSSYSTEM to build a system startup disk to
configure your system so that it runs Flight Simulator
properly.  If you are running Windows with protected mode
drivers for your CD-ROM, FSSYSTEM will not be able to load
these drivers for you. You will need to add these drivers to
the configuration files on the system startup disk created
by FSSYSTEM.  Refer to your CD-ROM or computer manual for
information on setting up your CD-ROM drivers.

Running Flight Simulator Under OS/2 2.1

For best system performance, make sure that the following
settings are selected for your MS-DOS session:

   HW_TIMER = ON
   VERTICAL_RETRACE_EMULATION = OFF

If you are running SVGA graphics, switching back to the
desktop may cause screen refresh problems.  Press CTRL+ESC,
and then press ENTER to return to Flight Simulator.

To run Flight Simulator in a window, select VGA 320x200 256
color graphics mode.  Press ALT+HOME and you can toggle
between full screen and a window.

Joystick Support

You can operate thrust reversers with the joystick as
follows. Pull the joystick throttle all the way back, then
press F2 or KEYPAD 3 a few times to engage the thrust
reversers. Turn off the thrust reversers by pressing F1 (cut
throttle) or giving more than 1/8 forward thrust with
joystick (nudge the joystick throttle forward a bit).

A Colorado Spectrum Notebook Gameport driver is included for
use with the appropriate joystick. To use this driver, type
the following line in your FS5.INI file:

   DEVICE=CS_STIK.FSO

NOTE:  The gameport driver (NG.EXE from Colorado Spectrum)
must be installed for this to work.  For information on
installing gameport software, see documentation from the
manufacturer.

If your joystick has throttle control, then it is best to
calibrate the system with the throttle slightly off the full
closed stop.

Joystick Drivers

The following drivers exist:

   STICK2.FSO
   CS_STIK.FSO

When no other joystick driver is specified in the DEVICE=
line in the FS5.INI file, the CH products driver is the
default (CH Flightstick Pro works best this way).

STICK2.FSO supports a generic two-button joystick.
CS_STIK.FSO is discussed in the earlier paragraph on the
Colorado Spectrum Notebook Gameport driver.

SVGA Support

In order for the SVGA mode to function on an Orchid
Fahrenheit (S3) or Thunder &amp; Lightning (Cirrus) card, the
monitor selection must be correct.  Improper monitor
selection may cause the display to sync improperly resulting
in an unstable picture, or a screen that looks "squashed."
For more information, refer to the documentation for your
specific video board.

VESA 1.2 Compatibility

Some VESA 1.2 drivers are not fully implemented.  Function 7
and modes 100h or 101h must be implemented for Flight
Simulator to work in the SVGA mode.  Refer to the
documentation that came with your video board for more
information.  If Flight Simulator does not display properly
when you select SVGA using a VESA driver, run Flight
Simulator Setup again from the Flight Simulator directory
and select the VGA display option. Contact your video board
manufacturer for an updated VESA 1.2 compatible driver.

SVGA 320x200 Mode

Although this mode may run 10% to 20% faster than the VGA
320x200 mode, some graphics cards do not support this mode.
If your screen flashes or does not display at all, select
VGA 320x200 mode.  VESA support on SVGA  320x200 is
equivalent to selecting VGA 320x200.

ATI Mach 64 Cards

Older ATI Mach 64 cards may need a BIOS upgrade.  BIOS
versions .15, dated 1994/6/10 or newer is required.

Sound Support

Using Flight Simulator under Microsoft Windows NT, Windows
95, or Windows 3.X, PC Speaker sound causes problems.  Avoid
these problems by choosing No Sound Device from the Sound
Board list when you install Flight Simulator under Windows.

Running Microsoft Flight Simulator under DR DOS. PC Speaker
cockpit sounds cause problems under DR DOS.  Avoid these
problems by choosing No Sound Device from the Sound Board
list when you install Flight Simulator.  If you want to play
sounds other than cockpit sounds (plane crashes and wheel
screeches), choose Preferences from the Options menu, and
then choose the Sound button. In the Sound Preferences
dialog box, turn off the Cockpit Sounds check box. Then (and
only then) choose PC Speaker from the Sound Board list to
turn the sound back on.

Media Vision - Pro Audio Spectrum Sound Cards

You must correctly install the Media Vision driver
(MVSOUND.SYS) before setting Flight Simulator 5.1 to run
with this sound card. Please refer to the Media Vision
documentation for instructions.  If the driver is not
installed correctly, you will get an error message. If you
get poor sound support from the Media Vision - Pro Audio
Spectrum sound card, you may need to disable DMA sharing
with your card.  Please refer to the documentation that came
with the card for instructions.

To run Pro Audio Spectrum/Studio sound cards as Sound
Blaster compatible you must have a SET BLASTER line in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example:

   SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 H5 P330 T6

Additionally, you need the appropriate Media Vision driver
installed in the CONFIG.SYS file. For example, in the sound
card line of your CONFIG.SYS, you should see MVSOUND.SYS for
the Pro Audio Spectrum/Studio or PA3D.SYS for the Media
Vision Premium 3D sound card.  Flight Simulator only
recognizes the MVSOUND.SYS line. If you have another Media
Vision sound card, select Media Vision - Pro Audio Spectrum
sound driver during Flight Simulator Setup or choose
Preferences from the Options menu, and then choose the Sound
button.  In the Sound Preferences dialog box, change the
sound board accordingly.

Gravis Ultrasound Sound Card

The Gravis Ultrasound driver uses the SBOS or MEGAEM Sound
Blaster emulation.  Make sure that you have one of these
drivers loaded before running Flight Simulator.

Loading Sound into XMS Memory

Flight Simulator loads sound files into XMS memory for
storage and quick playback.  Certain memory configurations
can cause this memory to be moved, resulting in noisy sounds
or system crashes.  If this occurs, choose Preferences from
the Options menu, and then choose the Sound button. In the
Sound Preferences dialog box, change the Use XMS Memory
option to No. When you select this option, Flight Simulator
uses additional conventional memory but resolves sound
playback problems that would occur using XMS memory.

Navigation Information

The VOR frequency for Martha's Vineyard is 114.5, not 108.2
as shown on the New York and Boston Area chart.

The VOR frequency for Deer Park is 117.7, not 111.2 as shown
on the New York and Boston Area chart.

FSSYSTEM System Startup (Boot) Disk

If you created a system startup disk and transferred it to
your hard disk, temporary CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
are switched in when FS5.1 begins running.  Your system's
original CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are temporarily saved
in CONFIG.FSS and AUTOEXEC.FSS.  Under normal conditions you
should never have to use these files.  If something goes
wrong and the current CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are not
the correct files, copy these .FSS files back to your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  Then restart your
computer.

Do NOT create a system startup (boot) disk if you are
running under the Win NT operating system.

Scenery Add-Ons

Older scenery areas, such as New York, San Francisco, and
Paris should be installed in Flight Simulator SCENERY directory.

For example, If Flight Simulator version 5.1 is installed in
C:\FLTSIM5, then these scenery areas should be installed
into the C:\FLTSIM5\SCENERY subdirectory. Running Setup for
these scenery products installs everything correctly.
Ignore the message that states Disabling Scenery not Found.

Before using the Japan, Caribbean, and Europe 1 scenery
products with FS5.1 CD-ROM, read the README.DOC file in the
ADDONS directory of the CD-ROM.

Before running the performance booster(s) available with
scenery add-ons released on CD-ROM prior to 5/01/95, follow
these instructions. First, copy the booster from your
FLTSIM5 directory to the cache directory of the CD-ROM
product.  For example, if you are running Europe 1 from the
CD-ROM, then copy the booster file from C:\FLTSIM5 to
C:\FLTSIM5\EUROPE1.

This will overwrite the booster file shipped with Europe1.
This change affects Las Vegas and Europe 1 only.

If you are seeing scenery conflicts while flying in a
scenery add-on, turn off the FS5.1 performance booster that
corresponds to this area.  For example, while flying in the
Japan scenery area, turn off the FS5.1 Asia booster.

If you want to go to an airport in your add-on scenery
product that exists on the Flight Simulator CD-ROM as well,
choose Airports from the World menu, then chose the scenery
area you want and choose the airport you want. Make sure you
choose the airport from the scenery add-on and not the FS5.1
CD-ROM. For example, from the list of airports, choose JAPAN
- Japan Add-on (instead of Asia) to go to an airport in the
Japan scenery add-on.

Scenery Library

Metro areas should always be the highest layer priority
value (the lower the layer number, the higher the priority
value) in the regional scenery type.  For example, if there
are two regional scenery areas active then the FS5 Metro
area should be at the top of the regional areas (layer value
of 1).

Scenery areas and performance boosters must include an
appropriate SCENERY and TEXTURE directory under the main
scenery directory.  For example, the JAPAN scenery directory
must have a SCENERY subdirectory containing the appropriate
scenery files, and a TEXTURE subdirectory containing the
appropriate texture files.  If these directories do not
exist, Flight Simulator will report a DATABASE ERROR when
you are flying though these scenery areas.

World Airports

In the CD-ROM release, a document file exists that outlines
all new airports, facilities, navaids, and fuel boxes unique
to the FS 5.1 CD-ROM version.  This file is called:

   AIRPORTS.DOC.

The user will note the level of detail of the additional
airports is not 100%.  For example, taxiways may not exist
or there may be an absence of runway extensions. Fuel boxes
are available at most new airports to allow for around-the-
world flight.

Some airports have associated NDBs on their ILS runways.
The active NDB frequency is the closest station.  There will
be a limited delay (hysteresis) in station switching as your
closest station changes.

Airports listed in the Airport dialog box are not
necessarily grouped in the booster of the same name.  If you
go to a particular airport, and it is not there, try turning
on neighboring boosters.  For example, the San Jose airport
in Costa Rica, is listed in North America but is within the
South American booster.  Therefore, to go to the Costa Rican
airport, you must have the South America booster active in
the Scenery Library.
