-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following issues exist regarding password list files in Windows 95:

1. An algorithm that can be used to compromise the security scheme used in the
  Windows 95 password list (.pwl) file has been posted on the Internet. A
  person who can access the password list file on the hard disk of a Windows
  95-based computer may be able to use this decryption algorithm to generate
  unencrypted passwords.

2. If two users with user names containing the same first eight characters log
  on to the same Windows 95-based computer, the first user's password list file
  becomes invalid.

  Note that this second symptom occurs only with the Windows 95 Password Cache
  update (Mspwl32.dll version 9.00.951) available with Microsoft Windows 95
  Service Pack 1 and OEM Service Release 1.

CAUSE
=====

1. The encryption mechanism used specifically for Windows 95 .pwl files,
  including not only the algorithm itself but also the manner in which it is
  applied, may be susceptible to certain decryption techniques.

  Different encryption algorithms are applied elsewhere in Windows 95 to encrypt
  other information. These algorithms are not susceptible to the decryption
  techniques mentioned above.


2. When a user logs on to Windows 95, Windows 95 checks the System.ini file to
  see if that user has logged on before. If there is no entry for that user,
  the first eight characters of the user name are used to create a password
  list file for the user. If another password list file with the same name
  exists, it is overwritten.

  Note that this second symptom occurs only with the Windows 95 Password Cache
  update (Mspwl32.dll version 9.00.951) available with Microsoft Windows 95
  Service Pack 1 and OEM Service Release 1.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved in Microsoft Windows 98.

These issues are resolved by the following updated files for Windows 95 and
Windows 95 OEM Service Release 1:

  Mspwl32.dll version 4.00.952 (dated 4/26/96) and later&lt;BR/&gt;
  Net.exe (no version information) dated 12/11/95 and later

To install this update, follow these steps:

1. Download the Mspwlupd.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center to an empty
  folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Mspwlupd.exe file you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Download Mspwlupd.exe now

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The Mspwlupd.exe file contains the following files:

  File name     Version    Date/Time         Size     Destination folder
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mspwl32.dll   4.00.952    4/26/96 9:52am    21,504  Windows\System
  Net.exe                  12/11/95 9:51am   375,930  Windows


MORE INFORMATION
================

This update is an enhanced security component that substantially strengthens the
encryption used for the Microsoft Windows 95 password cache. The new component
uses a 128-bit key, increased from the 32-bit key used in the previous version.
The new component also includes enhancements to the method used to store
passwords in the .pwl file. With the 128-bit security, the new component is 2^96
times more difficult to decrypt.

This component replaces the Mspwl32.dll and Net.exe files. The previous .pwl file
is automatically upgraded to the new format.

Net.exe, which is usually used from the command line, no longer uses the password
cache. Users are prompted for passwords when using Net.exe to connect to
resources on the network.

NOTE: Because the same algorithm is used to cache passwords in Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, you may want to disable password caching in Windows for
Workgroups using Admincfg.exe. For information about using Admincfg.exe, please
refer to the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit.

NOTE: If you disabled password caching on a Windows 95-based computer as a
temporary workaround before installing this update, you can re-enable password
caching after installing this update. You can re-enable password caching by
reversing the procedure documented in the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q140557 Microsoft Windows 95 Password List Security Issue

To re-enable password caching, set the DisablePwdCaching value to zero (0) or
delete the DisablePwdCaching value.
