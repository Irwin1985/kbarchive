-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Q. How do I make backup copies of my original Windows 95 disks before I
  install Windows 95?

  A. Windows 95 disks are Distribution Media Format (DMF) disks and are not
  compatible with the MS-DOS COPY and DISKCOPY commands. You cannot create
  backup copies of the Windows 95 disks.

2. Q. What happens if the power fails or if my computer restarts during Setup?

  A. Windows 95 Setup has a feature called Safe Recovery. Depending on where
  Setup was interrupted, you may be able to simply turn your computer off and
  back on, run Setup again, and choose Safe Recovery when you are prompted.

3. Q. What do I do if Setup stops responding (hangs) while it is detecting the
  hardware in my computer?

  A. If Setup hangs while it is detecting the hardware in your computer, turn
  your computer off and back on, run Setup again, and choose Safe Recovery when
  you are prompted.

4. Q. Why does Setup tell me I am running virus-protection software when I
  cannot find any on my computer?

  A. Some computers have built-in virus protection. If virus protection is
  enabled in your computer's CMOS settings, Setup cannot continue. Please
  contact your hardware vendor for information about temporarily disabling this
  feature.

5. Q. How do I install a feature of Windows 95 that I did not install
  originally?

  A. If you want to add or remove a Windows 95 component, use the Add/Remove
  Programs tool in Control Panel. On the Windows Setup tab, click the items you
  want to add or remove.

6. Q. What is Setup doing when I see the "Getting ready to run Windows 95 for
  the first time" screen?

  A. After Setup restarts your computer, it must complete the installation
  process. Setup accomplishes the following tasks while the "Getting ready to
  run Windows 95 for the first time" screen is displayed:

   - Setup processes the Wininit.ini file and combines all the virtual device
     drivers listed in the [CombineVxDs] section of the file into one file
     called Vmm32.vxd. Combining these drivers provides faster startup times.

   - Setup renames all the files that were in use during the first portion of
     Setup. For example, Setup renames the User32.tmp file to User32.exe and
     renames the Command.new file to Command.com.

   - Setup makes a backup copy of the registry for troubleshooting purposes.

  After these tasks are accomplished, Setup starts the Windows 95 graphical user
  interface (GUI) and completes the installation process by converting program
  groups, setting up the Help system, and setting your location and time zone.

7. Q. If I run Setup over an existing Windows 95 installation, I receive the
  following two options:

   - Restore Windows files that are changed

   - Copy all Windows files again

  Setup seems to take just as long no matter which option I choose. Why?

  A. Both of these options verify the validity of Windows 95 files. Verifying
  the Windows 95 files takes as long as an original installation because Setup
  must open each cabinet file to verify the Windows 95 files. Setup uses the
  Setuplog.txt file to determine which files to check and marks each good file
  with an "S." This mode also rebuilds the Vmm32.vxd file and recopies any file
  with a lost long filename.

8. Q. Is there a way to remove Windows 95?

  A. Yes. To do so, you must choose to save your computer's system files on the
  hard disk during Setup. You cannot store the "uninstall" file on a network
  drive or floppy disk. To remove Windows 95, use these three steps:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

  3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Windows 95, and then click Remove.

  You can also remove Windows 95 by starting your computer with the Windows 95
  Startup Disk and then typing "uninstal" (without the quotation marks) at the
  command prompt.

  NOTE: You are not prompted to save the system files during Setup if any of the
  following conditions apply:

   - You are installing Windows 95 in an empty directory.

   - You are not running MS-DOS version 5.0 or later.

   - You are reinstalling Windows 95 over itself.

9. Q. I am not having any problems with Windows 95. How do I delete the
  "uninstall" files created by Setup?

  A. To delete the "uninstall" files and free disk space, use these three
  steps:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

  3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Old Windows 3.x/MS-DOS System Files,
     and then click Remove.

  Once you delete these files, you cannot use the Uninstall tool to remove
  Windows 95.

10. Q. Is there an Administrative Setup for network installations?

  A. The /A and /N Setup switches have been replaced by the Netsetup tool. This
  tool is available in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95. Network
  administrators can use this tool to set up a shared copy of Windows 95 that
  others can use to set up local or shared Windows 95 installations. Users can
  also create custom scripts to automate the Setup process from the shared
  copy of Windows 95.
