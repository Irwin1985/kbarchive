-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Q. Why doesn't my NetWare login script load my terminate-and-stay- resident
  programs (TSRs)?

  A. In Windows 95, TSRs loaded in a login script are run in an MS- DOS virtual
  machine, which is not available globally. The TSRs are closed after the login
  script has been processed when Windows 95 closes the MS-DOS virtual machine.

2. Q. How can I use Novell's Network Directory Services with the Microsoft
  Client for NetWare Networks?

  A. Microsoft has released the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
  (NDS). The Microsoft Service for NDS provides all the functionality that
  Information Systems Professionals need to connect to NDS servers and to run
  many important utilities.

  If you are running Windows 95, you can obtain the Microsoft Service for NDS
  from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) on several online services as a
  self-extracting file named Msnds.exe. For additional information about the
  Microsoft Service for NDS and how to obtain the Msnds.exe file, please see
  the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q138709 TITLE: Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
  Available

  If you are running Windows 98, the Microsoft Service for NDS is included as a
  network service. To install the Microsoft Service for NDS, follow these
  steps:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel

  2. Double-click Network.

  3. On the Configuration tab, click Add.

  4. Click Service, and then click Add.

  5. Under Manufacturers, click Microsoft, and then click Service For NetWare
     Directory Services under Network Services.

  6. Click OK, click OK again, and then click Yes when you are prompted to
     restart your computer.

3. Q. My NetWare login script does not run. What can I do?

  A. If your NetWare login script does not run, try the following four steps:

  1. Make sure to set a preferred server in the properties for the Microsoft
     Client for NetWare Networks.

  2. If the frame type for the IPX/SPX-compatible network protocol is set to
     Auto, change it to the frame type the NetWare server is using.

  3. If there is a "lastdrive=" statement in the Config.sys file, remove it or
     disable it by inserting a semicolon at the beginning of the line.

  4. Make sure the IPX/SPX-compatible network protocol appears on the Bindings
     tab in the properties for the network adapter in your computer.

  If you continue to have problems, it may be because the network adapter is not
  loading. Make sure the network adapter settings in Windows 95 match the
  actual network adapter settings.

4. Q. I cannot see my NetWare server on a token ring network. What can I do?

  A. You may need to enable source routing. To do so, use the following four
  steps:

  1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Network icon.

  3. On the Configuration tab, click the IPX/SPX-compatible network protocol,
     and then click Properties.

  4. On the Advanced tab, click Source Routing in the Property box, and then
     click "16 entry cache (recommended)" in the Value box.

5. Q. When I set up Windows 95 to use VLM or NETX, I am prompted for files.
  Where do I get these files?

  A. These files are available from Novell's BBS or Internet site. For
  additional information, please contact Novell.

6. Q. What does the "File and printer sharing for NetWare networks" component
  do?

  A. This component is a service that allows computers running Windows 95 to
  process NCP-based requests for file and printer input and output. Even
  real-mode VLM and NETX clients can access files and printers shared with this
  service. To install this component, there must be a NetWare server on your
  network.

7. Q. Does Windows 95 support the NetWare RPrinter tool?

  A. Windows 95 does not support the RPrinter tool. However, Windows 95 does
  include a tool called Microsoft Print Agent for NetWare Networks. This tool
  is similar to the RPrinter tool and allows computers running Windows 95 to
  spool print jobs from a NetWare print server to its local printer.
  Instructions for installing this tool are contained in the Prtagent.txt file.
  This file is located in the Admin\NetTools\PRTAgent folder on the Windows 95
  CD-ROM.

8. Q. Does the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks require any Novell
  real-mode drivers (such as ODI or NETX)?

  A. No. The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks works with protected-mode
  NDIS drivers and does not use any conventional memory.

9. Q. How do I use Btrieve(R) with Windows 95?

  A. For information about using Btrieve with Windows 95, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q118629
  TITLE: Using Novell Btrieve with Windows 95

10. Q. How do I enable long filename support on a Novell NetWare volume?

  A. To use long filenames on a NetWare volume, you must obtain a patch called
  311ptd.exe from Novell. You can obtain this patch from Novell's BBS or
  Internet site. After you enable long filename support on the NetWare volume
  using the instructions included in the patch, you must add the following
  lines to the System.ini file:

   
            [NWRedir]
            SupportLFN=2
        

  For more information about enabling long filename support on a NetWare
  volume, please contact your system administrator, Novell, or a local
  authorized Novell reseller.

You can download this document as a self-extracting compressed file named
Ww1192.exe.
