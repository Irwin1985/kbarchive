The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install and register an OLE control (.OCX) using
the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0 (ADT) Setup Wizard or a
third-party installation program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use an OLE control in a Microsoft Access run-time application, you must first
install the OLE control and its support files; then, you must register the
control in the REG.DAT file in the \Windows\SYSTEM directory. These two
procedures are described in detail below.

Installing OLE Custom Controls
------------------------------

If you plan to use a third-party installation program to set up your run- time
application, make sure the OLE control and its support files are installed in
the following directories:

  Directory         Filename        Description
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  \Windows\SYSTEM   OC1016.DLL      The OLE Control Support DLL shipped
                                    with the ADT.
  \Windows\SYSTEM   OC25.DLL        A support DLL required by controls
                                    created with the OLE Control
                                    Development Kit (CDK) for Microsoft
                                    Visual C\C++ version 2.0. If your
                                    control was not created with the CDK,
                                    this file is not needed.
  \&lt;application&gt;    MSAREG.EXE      The OLE Control registration tool.
  \&lt;application&gt;    &lt;control&gt;.OCX   The OLE Control file.
  \&lt;application&gt;    DAO2016.DLL     A DLL required for custom controls.

If you plan to use the Microsoft ADT Setup Wizard to create your distribution
disks, follow these steps to ensure proper installation of OLE controls:

1. Open the Microsoft ADT Setup Wizard (SETUPWIZ.MDB) located in your
  \ACCESS\ADT directory.

2. In the "Pick the files to include with your application" box, click the Add
  File button.

3. In the Add File box, enter the full path to your database. Select the "Show
  in Program Manager Group" and "Run with MSARN200" options. In the INI File
  box, type the full path to your application's .INI file, and then click the
  OK button.

4. In the "Pick the files to include with your application" box, click the Add
  File button.

5. In the Add File box, type the full path to the OLE control (.OCX) file, and
  click OK.

6. If you are using a third-party OLE control, repeat steps 4 and 5 to add any
  support DLLs for the OLE control.

  If you are using an OLE control included with the Microsoft ADT (the
  MSACAL20.OCX, MSASB20.OCX, or OUTL1016.DLL files), the Setup Wizard prompts
  you with the message "The file you've selected depends on 1 file(s). Do you
  want to see a list?" Click the No button. In the Add File box, click OK. The
  Setup Wizard adds the OLE support file, OC1016.DLL.

7. After you add the OLE control (and its supporting DLLs), click the Next
  button in the "Pick the files to include with your application" box.

8. In the "What optional features does your application support?" box, make sure
  the OLE 2.01 option (or OLE 2.02, if you installed the Microsoft Access 2.0
  Service Pack) is selected.

9. In the "What is the name of your application" box, type a name for your
  application. Also, type a name for the directory that your custom setup
  program suggests as a default directory, and then click Next.

10. In the "Do you want to run another application after Setup is finished?"
  box, click Next.

11. In the "Where do you want to create the disk images" box, type a path for
  your application's SETUP directory, select a type of disk setup, and then
  click Finish.

  At this point, you can use your distribution disks to set up you run- time
  application and register any OLE control.

Registering OLE Controls
------------------------

If you use the Microsoft ADT Setup Wizard to create your distribution disks, your
OLE controls are registered automatically when you set up your run-time
application. The Microsoft Access Setup program installs and runs the file
MSAREG.EXE that registers any .OCX files you picked in the ADT Setup Wizard.

If you plan to use a third-party installation program, make sure all OLE controls
are registered properly in the REG.DAT file of the \Windows\SYSTEM directory. To
register an OLE control, follow these steps:

1. In Windows 3.x, in Program Manager or File Manager, click Run on the File
  menu. In Windows 95, click the Start Button, and then click Run.

2. In the Command box (or Open box in Windows 95), type a command similar to the
  following line:

  " MSAREG.EXE C:\&lt;application&gt;\&lt;control&gt;.OCX " (without the
  quotation marks)

  For example, to register the Calendar control type the following line:

  " MSAREG.EXE C:\ACCESS\ADT\MSACAL20.OCX " (without the quotation marks)

3. Click OK to run the MSAREG.EXE file and to register the OLE control.

NOTE: OLE controls created with the OLE Control Development Kit (CDK) for
Microsoft Visual C\C++ version 2.0 require users to install OLE version 2.02.
