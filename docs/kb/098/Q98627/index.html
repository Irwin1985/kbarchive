SUMMARY
=======

Alckey.exe is a Windows for Pen Computing sample that demonstrates how to use
the ALC values (defined in Windows for Pen Computing) to set how an hedit (or
bedit) control filters its input.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

ALC values can be set to define what values are recognized in a pen edit control
(either hedit or bedit). For example, by setting ALC_NUMERIC, only numeric
values are recognized in that particular control. Using ALC values allows
developers greater freedom to customize how their application responds to ink.
By defining a small subset of only the types of values wanted in an edit
control, recognition of those values increases.

The AlcKey sample has two edit controls, hedit and bedit. By selecting the ALC
flags desired via the ALC dialog box, the hedit control is set to those values.
The bedit control is not altered, allowing the developer to view the difference
between the settings of the two controls.

The AlcKey sample also demonstrates the use of the ShowKeyboard() application
programming interface (API), including the recommended way of interfacing to the
virtual keyboard via a "keyboard" button; which is OwnerDraw. Note that the
virtual keyboard always stays on top, but never has the focus. The output of the
keyboard is directed to the last control that had the focus. Note also that the
virtual keyboard in Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0 is not affected by the
filtering effects of the ALC values. Only recognized ink is affected; the
keyboard does not involve inking, so it bypasses this step.
