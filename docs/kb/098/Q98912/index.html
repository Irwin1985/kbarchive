The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to install version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail for
Windows Postoffice Upgrade for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.

The focus of these directions is based on working from the Windows for Workgroups
station on which the Windows for Workgroups postoffice is installed. To complete
the upgrade process, perform the following steps. You may need to make
adjustments, as needed, if your postoffice is located on a Novell or LAN Manager
server.

NOTE: Be sure all users on the postoffice have exited and signed out of Mail
before installing the upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To upgrade the existing Windows for Workgroups postoffice to a full version 3.2
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice, run the SETUP.EXE program from the
Setup Postoffice disk. You will be prompted with a series of screens and
questions.

Follow the instructions, inserting disks as prompted, until the upgrade process
is finished. The screens and questions are as follows:

- Welcome screen

  Setup can do the following:

   - Update a Workgroup postoffice

   - Copy Microsoft Mail server programs

   - Copy Microsoft Mail client programs

- Prompt screen

  Setup then prompts for:

   - Location of the postoffice data files

   - Administrators mailbox name and password

   - Postoffice and network name

   - If you are running gateways earlier than version 3.0

   - If you are moving the postoffice

   - Server programs to install

   - Client programs to install

- Postoffice Directory Screen

  Please specify the directory containing the Workgroup postoffice. The
  postoffice must exist in this directory.

  Setup suggests the following directory:

     C:\MAILDATA

  NOTE: The Windows for Workgroups postoffice may be located in C:\WINDOWS\WGPO
  or in another location. If you are not sure, check with your network
  administrator.

- Mailbox screen

  Enter your administrator name:

- Password screen

  Enter your password:

- Gateway Installation screen

  Will you run Microsoft Mail gateways earlier than 3.0?

- Postoffice Relocation screen

  No relocation
  Microsoft LAN Manager Compatible Novell

- Server programs screen

  Select Server programs you want to install

  Done
  Administration and Utilities
  Server agents
  Modem scripts files

  NOTE: You must choose to install the Administration and Utilities programs
  here in order to access the postoffice administrator program ADMIN.EXE. This
  utility replaces the Windows for Workgroups Postoffice Manager. You will be
  prompted for a directory location for the Mail executable files.

  Setup suggests the following directory:

     C:\MAILEXE

  WARNING: Do NOT specify the Windows directory.

- Client Programs screen

  Select the client programs you want to install

  Done
  Windows and Presentation Manager
  MS-DOS

  NOTE: You should always install the MS-DOS-based workstation even if all your
  users will be running different workstation software. The MS-DOS client
  installation copies files needed by other Microsoft Mail components. It may
  also be helpful when troubleshooting the Mail system.

  NOTE: You must choose to install Windows and Presentation Manager client files
  here, if you plan to update your users' local workstations to the latest
  version of the Windows or Presentation Manager client. If you choosing not to
  install the files at this time, you must rerun this portion of Setup before
  you can complete the client upgrades.

- Confirm Choices screen

- Updating screen

  NOTE: You will see files being copied.

- Installation Complete screen

  Setup has successfully installed Microsoft Mail Extensions.

- From File Manager, share the mail executables directory with Full Rights.
  From File Manager, share the postoffice directory with Full Rights (if you
  have not already done so).

- For Macintosh users only: Use the Apple Macintosh Workstation disk and refer
  to Chapter 1 of the Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide."

- Locate the postoffice and use the ADMIN.EXE program on a nondedicated Windows
  for Workgroups server.

  NOTE: Nondedicated refers to a Windows for Workgroups computer being used as a
  workstation and as the postoffice server.

Schedule+ Installation
----------------------

- Create the Schedule+ Admin Mail account "adminsch." For more information
  about how to do this, see Chapter 2 of the Schedule+ "Administrator's Guide."

- Use the Schedule+ disks and follow the instructions in the Schedule+ for
  Windows "Administrator's Guide" to upgrade the server portion of Schedule+.

After the Windows for Workgroups postoffice has been upgraded to a full Mail 3.2
postoffice, the administration functions are handled through the MS-DOS-based
Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE).

ADMIN.EXE is located in the Mail executables directory. By default, the
Administrator program looks for the postoffice on the current or root directory
of drive M. There are several ways to make the Administrator program
successfully locate the postoffice; use the method best suited for your
configuration:

- Use the -d command-line parameter.

  When using a drive other than M for the postoffice, you can specify that drive
  using the -d&lt;drive letter&gt; parameter. For example, if you want to use
  the N drive, use the following syntax:

  c:\mailexe\admin -dn

  NOTE: The postoffice must be located in the current or root directory of the
  specified drive.

  The following is an example of incorrect usage of the -d parameter:

  c:\mailexe\admin -dn:\wgpo

-or-

- Copy ADMIN.EXE to the root of the postoffice directory.

  You can copy ADMIN.EXE to the postoffice directory rather than use a drive map
  for the MAILEXE directory. The following example uses N:\WGPO as the
  postoffice location. Copy ADMIN.EXE from the MAILEXE directory to N:\WGPO.
  Then invoke the Administrator program with the following syntax:

  n:\wgpo\admin -dn

-or-

- Use the MS-DOS SUBST command.

  If you are using a peer-to-peer network and the postoffice is located on a
  nondedicated server, you can elect to use the MS-DOS SUBST command to assign
  the root of drive M to the postoffice. You should add the SUBST command to
  your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example:

  subst m: c:\windows\wgpo

The server-based portion of the mail system update is now complete. You need to
update the client side (local workstation files) for the Windows-based and OS/2
Presentation Manager-based client, and the Schedule+ client.

Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager Upgrade
---------------------------------------------

To complete this section, you must have specified that the Windows and
Presentation Manager client files be installed during the server-based portion
of setup.

Complete the following steps at each user's workstation:

1. From File Manager, connect drive M to the shared postoffice directory.

2. Connect to the shared mail executables directory (any drive letter).

3. Double-click the SETUP.EXE file located in the mail executables directory.
  You will be prompted for a directory location to install Microsoft Mail.

  Setup suggests the following directory:

     C:\MSMAIL

Follow the instructions until the Microsoft Mail Windows client upgrade is
complete.

Schedule+ Upgrade
-----------------

Complete the following steps from each user's workstation:

1. From File Manager, connect drive M to the shared postoffice directory.

2. Connect to the shared Schedule+ directory (any drive letter).

3. Double-click the SETUP.EXE file located in the shared Schedule+ directory.
  You will be prompted for a directory location to install Schedule+.

Follow the instructions until the Schedule+ client upgrade is complete.
