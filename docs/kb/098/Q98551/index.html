- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 is fully supported running on a
computer with one 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch high-density disk drive and a hard disk
with 9.5 megabytes (MB) available memory (14.5 MB is recommended).

This article contains information on installing Windows for Workgroups 3.1 for
use on workstations without hard disks. Microsoft does not support running
Windows for Workgroups with any type of "diskless" workstation.

Windows for Workgroups was not designed to be installed on workstations without
hard disks (that is, computers without hard disks that are connected to a
network). However, there is a workaround that may allow Windows for Workgroups
to be set up on such workstations.

NOTE: A true diskless workstation (one with no floppy disk drive or hard disk
drive) using a network adapter with a boot ROM does not work with Windows for
Workgroups. This is because the boot ROM establishes a network connection and
does not allow the Windows for Workgroups network drivers to coexist with the
boot ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up Windows for Workgroups on workstations without hard disk drives that
are connected to a network, use the procedures below.

Setting Up and Sharing Windows for Workgroups on the Server
-----------------------------------------------------------

Select a computer with an 80386 or higher processor and at least 4 MB of RAM to
be the file server that shares the Windows for Workgroups program files. This
computer must run Windows for Workgroups whenever any other workstation is also
running Windows for Workgroups from the shared directory. This computer also
requires at least 22 MB free hard disk space, plus at least an additional 1 MB
of free disk space per user. To set up the server, do the following:

1. Install Windows for Workgroups using the SETUP /A command. When prompted for
  the network directory, use the name WFWSHARE. This expands and copies the
  Windows for Workgroups files to this directory. It does not set up Windows
  for Workgroup itself; setup will be accomplished in the next step.

  NOTE: Users upgrading from Windows 3.1 created with SETUP /A should remove the
  Windows 3.1 shared directory before continuing. For more information on
  upgrading a shared networked Windows directory, query on the following words
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  setup /n and attrib and sdl

2. Run SETUP /N from the WFWSHARE directory. Enter your computer name, workgroup
  name, and confirm your network adapter. After this installation is complete,
  you can restart your computer and run Windows for Workgroups by typing WIN.
  Any errors from the CONFIG.SYS file, AUTOEXEC.BAT, or Windows for Workgroups
  should be resolved before proceeding.

  NOTE: Windows 3.1 directories created with SETUP /N can only be upgraded to
  Windows for Workgroups with SETUP /N. Windows 3.1 installations created with
  SETUP must be upgraded by SETUP.

3. Open File Manager and select the WFWSHARE directory from the directory tree.
  Share the directory by choosing Share As from the Disk menu or choosing the
  Share Directory button.

4. Create a user directory for Windows for Workgroups workstations without hard
  disks. This directory may be named C:\WFWUSERS. Share the WFWUSERS directory
  (as in step 3), but grant the users full access by selecting the Full Access
  option button. This directory will be used to keep Windows for Workgroups
  user directories for each workstation. For example:

  C:\WFWUSERS\STEVE
  C:\WFWUSERS\TERRI
  C:\WFWUSERS\JOHN

Making a Workstation Boot Disk
------------------------------

A workstation boot disk contains the MS-DOS operating system and files necessary
to establish a network connection to the file server created in the steps above.
Once Windows for Workgroups is set up for each workstation, this boot disk will
no longer be needed. To create this disk, do the following:

1. Format a high-density 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch MS-DOS bootable system disk. The
  disk size depends on the bootable floppy drive of your workstation. To format
  and transfer the operating system to a floppy disk, open File Manager, and
  choose Make System Disk from the Disk menu; or, type format "a: /s" (without
  the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

2. Quit Windows for Workgroups on the file server. Using the disk created in the
  previous step, reboot the file server and change to the drive and directory
  where the WFWSHARE files are located.

3. Run SETUP /I /N from the WFWSHARE directory. Choose Custom Setup and change
  the directory to C:\WFWTEMP. Select your temporary computer name, workgroup
  name, workstation network adapter, and its settings.

  NOTE: This temporary directory is needed only to create the workstation boot
  disk and can be removed after the files have been copied and the
  configuration files (AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS) have been updated.

  During the setup process, the following error message appears:

  Setup cannot find or cannot update your system files on drive A:. If you
  started your system from a floppy disk, be sure to remove write-protection
  from your system startup (boot) disk. Then insert the disk into drive A and
  choose Retry.

  To copy system files to your Windows directory choose Cancel.

  This is normal. Choose the Retry button.

4. After Setup is complete, copy the SYSTEM.INI file from the WFWTEMP directory
  to the network boot disk. Edit this SYSTEM.INI file and add the following
  line to the [network] section:

        [network]
        AutoStart=full

  The boot disk should now contain the following files:

  Filename        Size  Date      Time    Function

                        251689 bytes free

  The following lines should have been added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS
  files:

  AUTOEXEC.BAT                      CONFIG.SYS
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  A:\SMARTDRV.EXE                   DEVICE=A:\HIMEM.SYS
  A:\net start                      device=A:\protman.DOS /i:A:\ 
  PATH=C:\WFWTEMP;c:\wfwshare       device=A:\workgrp.sys
  SET TEMP=C:\WFWTEMP\TEMP          device=A:\NDISDRVR.DOS
                                    STACKS=9,256
                                    LASTDRIVE=Z

5. With all disks removed, reboot the file server and start Windows for
  Workgroups by typing WIN at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER.

The workstation boot disk can now be used to start up workstations on the network
and set up Windows for Workgroups as instructed in the section below. If any
errors from the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT are reported, they should be resolved
before proceeding.

NOTE: If there are different types of network adapters on the workstations, the
steps 1-5 above may need to be repeated for each type of network adapter so that
individual workstations with different types of network adapters can access the
network.

Setting Up Windows for Workgroups on the Workstation(s)
-------------------------------------------------------

This process requires that you boot the workstation with the network boot disk
created in the section above, then replace the disk with a blank formatted
system disk before running Windows for Workgroups Setup. For more information on
formatting system disks, see step 1 under "Making a Workstation Boot Disk."

1. Start each workstation with a network boot disk. Confirm logon name and enter
  a password. Verify the creation of password cache list file, which has the
  extension .PWL.

2. Connect to the WFWSHARE and WFWUSERS directories on the file server by typing
  the following commands at the MS-DOS command prompt and pressing ENTER after
  each

  net use d: \\&lt;servername&gt;\wfwshare
  net use c: \\&lt;servername&gt;\wfwusers

  where &lt;servername&gt; is the name of the computer assigned in step 2 under
  the "Setting Up and Sharing Windows for Workgroups on the Server" section. If
  the connection was made successfully the message "Command Completed
  Successfully" will appear for each command issued.

3. Replace the network boot disk with a formatted system disk in the floppy disk
  drive. This system disk will be used as a permanent network boot disk for
  this workstation.

4. Change to network drive D and run the SETUP /N command. Choose Custom Setup
  and change the directory to C:\&lt;NAME&gt; (where &lt;NAME&gt; is the
  workstation name). Select your computer name and workgroup name, then confirm
  your network adapter.

5. After this installation is complete, return to the MS-DOS command prompt and
  copy the SYSTEM.INI file from C:\&lt;NAME&gt; to your permanent network boot
  disk. Edit this SYSTEM.INI file and add the following line to the [network]
  section:

  [network]
  AutoStart=Full

  NOTE: The value "Full" can be changed to "Basic" to save approximately 30
  kilobytes (K) of the amount of memory used by the network redirector.

6. Reboot the workstation with your permanent network boot disk and log in and
  verify the creation of password cache list file, which has the extension
  .PWL. Connect to the WFWSHARE and WFWUSERS directories on the file server
  with the following commands, pressing ENTER after each line:

  net use d: \\&lt;servername&gt;\wfwshare
  net use c: \\&lt;servername&gt;\wfwusers

  where &lt;servername&gt; is the name of the computer assigned in step 2 under
  the "Setting Up and Sharing Windows for Workgroups on the Server" section. If
  the connection was made successfully, the message "Command Completed
  Successfully" appears for each command issued.

You should now be able to run Windows for Workgroups on this workstation. Repeat
the above steps 1-6 for each workstation without a hard disk on the network.

NOTE: If there are different types of network adapters on the workstations, steps
1-5 under the "Making a Workstation Boot Disk" section may need to be repeated
for each type of network adapter so that individual workstations with different
types of network adapters can access the network.

Notes on Using Workstations Without Hard Disks
----------------------------------------------

- A workstation without a hard disk must meet the same system requirements for
  running Windows for Workgroups 3.1 as a workstation with a hard disk. Note
  that the RAM requirement may be greater if you are using a RAM drive.

- Since a SYSTEM.INI file resides on both the network boot disk and the user's
  directory; changes made in the Networks dialog box in Control Panel do not
  update the SYSTEM.INI file on the boot disk. If you make changes in the
  Networks dialog box in Control Panel, you must recopy the SYSTEM.INI to the
  boot floppy disk before changes can take effect.

- To share local workstations resources (such as floppy disk drives, printers,
  and CD-ROM drives), you must create a RAM drive and change your SET TEMP
  environment variable to its location. The RAM drive must be of considerable
  size (2048K or larger) if you are planning to share a local printer because
  Print Manager queues jobs into the RAM drive. To set up a 2-MB RAM drive, add
  the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

  device=a:\ramdrive.sys 2048 /e
