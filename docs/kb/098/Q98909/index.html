SUMMARY
=======

Chip's Challenge is a multilevel maze game. The objective in Chip's Challenge is
to help heroic Chip find all the computer chips he needs on one level so that he
can plug into the cosmic computer socket and pass through the exit square to the
next level. Along the 144 levels, you've got to keep Chip safe from the many
dangers he may encounter. Using the arrow keys on the numeric keypad or the
mouse to move Chip, your job is to help him find the tools he'll need to unlock
doors, walk through fire, bridge water, avoid bombs, and find the correct paths
to the exit square.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The screen for Chip's Challenge is divided into two windows. The Action window
and the Information window. The Action window is the inside of the maze, where
you play the game. The Information window, located to the right of the action
window has four displays: the Level display, the Time display, the Chips Left
display, and the inventory/Hint Box display.

To move Chip
------------

On the numeric keypad, press the UP ARROW, DOWN ARROW, LEFT ARROW, or RIGHT
ARROW. You can also use the mouse. Just click the square you want Chip to go to,
no matter how close or far away.

To start a new game
-------------------

From the Game menu, click New Game, or press F2.

NOTE: When you click the New Game command, it returns you to level 1, resets your
score to zero, and erases all your passwords.

To restart an existing game
---------------------------

If you restart Chip's Challenge after a short or long break, all you have to do
is press the arrow keys or click the mouse and Chip is back in action. The game
remembers your score and all your passwords.

NOTE: Be sure not to click the New Game command to restart an existing game or
all your past achievements are lost.
