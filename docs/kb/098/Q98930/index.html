SUMMARY
=======

Klotski (or Klocki) is the Polish word for blocks. The original game was a small
wooden board that could be arranged into several puzzles, where the blocks were
manipulated until a master block was freed. Polish children played this game to
develop basic strategy skills.

Microsoft Klotski is a challenging computer brain teaser. The object of the game
is to move the red block out of a case through a single exit and to a corner of
the screen indicated by indentations. However, to do so you must maneuver other
blocks of varying shapes and sizes to allow the red block to reach its
destination.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Klotski, a block can only be moved into any open space where it fits. Blocks
cannot be moved through the casing, marked in dark blue. Further, only the red
block can be moved through the exit of the case, marked in light blue.

To Start a New Game
-------------------

From the Game menu, click Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3, then choose which board
you want to solve in that level.

To Move a Block
---------------

Just click the block you want to move and drag it to where you want the block to
go.

Smaller blocks are easier to maneuver than larger blocks because they don't
require large amounts of open space. So, you should try to get smaller blocks to
surround the red block because you can more easily open a path for the red
block.
