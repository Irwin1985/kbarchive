SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how the Net Logon command on MS-DOS LAN Manager
workstations functions in relation to LANA numbers. It describes how to
determine which LANA to use for a logon validation request, and explains the
relative importance of validation. For more information on LANA numbers, LANA
bases, and send/receive order, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  LANAs and MS-DOS


MORE INFORMATION
----------------

The Rule
--------

On MS-DOS LAN Manager workstations (not OS/2), logon requests are sent out ONLY
on the first valid network--defined as a loaded and bound protocol driver with
the lowest LANA number, which is not necessarily LANA 0. Therefore, in order to
be validated during logon, a domain controller must be running the same protocol
that you have loaded for your workstation's first valid network.

NET LOGON Flow
--------------

Two fundamental functions occur when you logon: validation and local name
registration. The next two sections list and explain possible events that can
take place within each function.

A. Validation
-------------

1. The domain controller receives your logon request.

  a. Your account name is recognized and your password is authenticated. You
     will receive the message "The server SERVERNAME successfully logged you on
     as USERID." Go to B.

  b. Your account name is recognized but your password fails authentication.
     The message "NET3779: Your logon attempt has failed due to an incorrect
     username or password" is displayed. Go to End.

  c. Your account name and password were recognized but your password has
     expired. You will be prompted to enter a new password. Go to B.

  d. The domain controller receives your request but it does not know your user
     ID. See step 2 below. Same symptoms; go to 2.

2. No domain controller receives your logon request. You receive the message
  "You were logged on, but have not been validated by a server. Net 3778: ..."
  Ignore the 3778 error. The important information here is that you were logged
  on, which really means that Step B below was completed. You were not
  confirmed or denied by a domain controller.

B. Name resgistration
---------------------

Register your account name and password in your local tables. This information is
used whenever you try to access a network resource. For example: When you do a
NET USE you pass your user ID and password to the server, which checks the
privilege level you have for that resource. This is the key security mechanism,
not validation.

The only logon possibility that truly fails is 1b: account recognized but
password not validated. All the others allow you to register your account and
password locally on your system. This is much more important in the overall
security scheme than validation.

NET LOGON Network Frames
------------------------

The NET LOGON command issues frames on the LAN destined for the NETLOGON service
running on a domain controller. A maximum of four mail slots addressed to
\\MAILSLOT\NET\NETLOGON will be sent out to the domain. The mail slot transact
Server Message Block (SMB) is sent on NetBIOS Send_Datagram frames addressed to
the domain name. Which transport these travel on can vary according to protocol.
For NetBEUI, the datagram is sent to the multicast address [0300000000001] that
all other NetBEUI systems register as a group address. TCP/IP sends the datagram
as a broadcast to the broadcast station address [FFFF FFFF FFFF hex].

There is no way to limit the number of frames sent out during validation. NET
LOGON always sends a maximum of four \\MAILSLOT\NET\NETLOGON frames. When a
controller responds to a request, no more attempts are submitted.

NET LOGON Miscellaneous Notes
-----------------------------

There is no way to override the LANA used during validation. The WRKNETS
parameter does not affect the NET LOGON command.

The LAN Manager server processes a validation request on all protocols it has
loaded regardless of load order, LANA number, etc. SRVNETS is the only way to
disable a server protocol from participating in validation.

On LAN Manager workstations, use the /DOMAIN: option to specify which domain you
want to be validated in. For example:

NET LOGON USERID PASSWORD /DOMAIN:domain_name
