-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article contains a copy of the information in the Readme.wri file
included in Windows NT version 4.0. Setup copies this file to the System32
folder.

Microsoft Access for Windows 95
-------------------------------

Under Windows NT version 4.0, Microsoft Access for Windows 95 may generate
errors that it can't resolve, particularly when using the Form wizard. This
problem will be fixed in a later version of Access 95. Contact Microsoft
Access Product Support for more information.

Microsoft Bookshelf '94
-----------------------

Bookshelf '94 may exhibit unexpected behavior when you click some of the
options on the main menu bar.  An example of this behavior  is when you
click the Tools menu. The menu title displayed as "ls Books" instead of
"Tools" as expected.  This can be solved by changing  MENUPATTERN=1  to
MENUPATTERN=0  in the [OPTIONS] section of BS94.ini.

Microsoft C/C++ 7.0a
--------------------

CodeView for Windows (CVW.EXE) is not supported. To debug 16-bit Windows-
based applications, use the Windows NT debugger, WINDBG.EXE or the
character-mode version of CodeView.

Microsoft Dinosaurs
-------------------

Microsoft Dinosaurs does not install the Macromind Multimedia Player (MMP)
when installed on Windows NT. You must copy MMCMMP.DRV and MMP.DLL from the
\XFILES\DRIVERS folder on the Microsoft Dinosaurs compact disc to the
\systemroot\SYSTEM directory. After copying the files you must add the
following entries to the Registry by using Registry Editor:

Add the REG_SZ value MMMovie=MCIMMP.DRV to the key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\MCI

Add the REG_SZ value mmm=MMMOVIE.DRV to the key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
\MCI Extensions

Microsoft Encarta 95
--------------------

There are known problems printing from Encarta 95 to PCL printers in 24bpp
when metafile spooling is turned on. You can work around this problem by
either turning off metafile spooling or by switching to 8 color or 256
color depth in the printer's document properties dialog box. To change the
settings, click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers. Right-
click the printer, then click Document Defaults. If necessary, click the
Advanced tab. Click Document Options to disable metafile spooling.

Microsoft Entertainment Pack, Idlewild
--------------------------------------

To use Idlewild screen savers with Windows NT, the full path to the screen
savers must be added to the system path. You can either add the screen
savers directory to the path in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or use the System
icon in Control Panel to add an environment variable containing the path.

Microsoft Excel 5.0
-------------------

A General Protection Fault occurs when saving a file with an embedded
PowerPoint(r) object. The RISC version of Excel returns different function
values than values returned by x86 compatible versions.

Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT
----------------------------------

The RISC versions of Microsoft Excel 5.0c for Windows NT for DEC Alpha,
MIPS, and PowerPC return different function values than values returned by
x86 compatible version.

Windows NT version 4.0 allows you to compress NTFS drives. If you use the
File Open dialog box in Excel 5.0c for Windows NT to view files on a
compressed  NTFS drive, files will not be displayed. This might also affect
any macro commands designed to open or read files. This situation occurs
only on the x86 platform. The Digital Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC, and 16-bit
versions of Microsoft Excel are not affected. Excel 5.0c for Windows NT
reads non-compressed NTFS or FAT drives correctly.

There are two ways to view your Excel 5.0c for Windows NT spreadsheet files
on a compressed drive:

- From the File Open dialog box in Excel 5.0c for Windows NT, type the name of
  the file you want to open in the File Name box, and then press ENTER

  - Or -

- From Explorer, double click the spreadsheet file you want to open.

Microsoft Explorapedia
----------------------

The Readme file included with Microsoft Explorapedia states that non-intel
( MIPS, Alpha,  PPC, or RISC processors ) running Windows NT are not
supported. Windows NT version 4.0 now supports these processors.  You must
have administrator privileges to install this software application.

Microsoft Money for Windows 95
------------------------------

Under Windows NT, the Microsoft Money 95 application experiences problems
with online banking and online stock quotes. This will be fixed in a future
release of Money 95.

Microsoft Money for Windows 95, version 4.0 or 4.0a
---------------------------------------------------

To use online banking and online stock quotes in Money for Windows 95 on a
computer running Windows NT Workstation, you must be able to dial out.
Before you can dial out using TAPI services, replace the Xsnpc.dll file in
the system folder of MSMONEY with the Windows NT version 4.0 release of the
Microsoft FAST Xsnpc.dll file dated March 29, 1996.

This file can be found at www.microsoft.com and this file will be included
in the next release of  Money for Windows 95.

Microsoft Office 95 Applications
--------------------------------

Changing window focus with any Microsoft Office 95 application open may
cause screen refresh or display problems, particularly on multiprocessor
systems. Contact Microsoft Product Service Support for a new version of
mso95.dll which resolves the problem.

Microsoft Office Standard for Windows 95 version 7.0
----------------------------------------------------

If you install Microsoft Office Standard for Windows '95 version 7.0 onto a
machine running Windows NT version 4.0, you will receive an error stating
"Failure to load expression service" when using the Access ODBC driver from
Office applications such as Excel or Word.

To correct this problem you need to obtain the Microsoft Office for Windows
'95 version 7.0b release from Microsoft Product Support.  You can obtain a
copy of this release by calling the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561.
If you are outside of the United States, contact the Microsoft Subsidiary
in your area. To locate your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide
Offices Web site at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm

Microsoft ODBC SDK 2.1
----------------------

The setup program for Microsoft ODBC SDK 2.1 does not correctly identify
Windows NT as the current operating system and displays the following
message:

  "This application uses CTL3D32.DLL which is not the correct version. This
  version of CTL3D32.DLL is designed only for WIN32s or Windows 95 systems?

Rename the file %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\CTL3D32.DLL and copy the file
\ODBCSDK\REDIST32\WINNT\CTL3D32.DLL to %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32.
The user interfaces for version 2.9 Microsoft ODBC 32-bit drivers, except
for SQL Server, do not function properly under Windows NT.

Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0 and PowerPoint for Windows 95
------------------------------------------------------

The Genigraphics driver included with PowerPoint 4.0 is not supported.
Under Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95 may
generate errors it can't resolve, particularly when opening files or
inserting clipart. For more information, contact Microsoft PowerPoint
Product Support at (425) 635-7145.

Microsoft Project for Windows 95
--------------------------------

Microsoft Project 95 does not run under Windows NT. To obtain an updated
version, part number 098-63461, call the Microsoft Distribution Center at 1
(800) 426-9400.

Microsoft Publisher for Windows 95
----------------------------------

When running Publisher under Windows NT, the text on some buttons is
truncated.

Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0
-----------------------

When running under Windows NT, Schedule+ 7.0 requires the CTL3D32.DLL. This
DLL is not installed by the Office 95 Setup Program, so you must copy it
from the Office Pro compact disc #1. Copy the file OS\SYSTEM\CTL3D32.DLL to
your systemroot\system32 directory.

If you are upgrading from Windows NT 3.51 and have already installed Office
for Windows 95 prior to upgrading, you will not need to copy this DLL.

Microsoft SNA Server
--------------------

The SNA Administrator currently displays the wrong version number when you
click About on the Help menu. On the MIPS platform only, SNA Server 2.11
and the SNA Server Windows NT client display incomplete text in dialog
boxes. To obtain an update, contact:

  the MSSNA forum Lib #4 (unsupported third-party library)

Running SNA Server:

During the course of testing SNA Server 2.0 on Windows NT, two problems
were discovered in SNA Server 2.0 as a result of the improved parameter
checking and fault detection included in Windows NT. These do not affect
the operation of SNA Server 2.0 on Windows NT 3.1.

The symptoms include SDLC and X.25 SNA connections that will not activate
and 802.2 SNA connections that cause an exception in SNALINK.EXE. Fixes for
these problems are available in the Library 2 section of the MSSNA forum on
CompuServe.

If you have SNA Server 2.0 installed on your system, please copy the
contents of the SNA directory to your snaroot\SYSTEM directory after you
have upgraded your system to Windows NT version 4.0.

The contents of the SNA directory are:
IBMSDLC.DLLIBMX25.DLLSNADLC.DLL

Microsoft recommends that you use SNA Server version 2.1 or 2.11 on all
Windows NT version 4.0 systems. Please refer to the MSSNA forum on
CompuServe for any additional updates or notices.

Microsoft SQL Server for Windows
--------------------------------

If you create a new window using Tools/Windows/Form Window,
Tools/Windows/Table Window, Tools/Windows/DialogBox, or
Tools/Windows/MDIWindow, the form window box shows the title "frm1 tled"
instead of "frm1 (untitled)."

At the end of installation, always choose Replace Existing Program Group,
even on the first installation. If you choose to create a new program
group, any name used will be considered invalid.

Report templates which are created or modified using Report Windows cannot
be saved. The application reports it cannot create temporary files. This
problem is fixed in Windows SQL Server 6.0.

Microsoft Systems Management Server
-----------------------------------

The following notes apply to Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
version 1.1 under Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 4.0.

Using Automation to Upgrade Clients to Windows NT version 4.0:

Sending Windows NT version 4.0 unattended upgrade jobs using SMS version

Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.52
---------------------------------

This version of Visual C++ does not compile applications on RISC platforms.

Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0
------------------------

If you install Microsoft Visual C++(r) 2.0 (x86-based version) under Windows
NT version 4.0, and attempt to run a Help file, the following error message
appears:

  Call to undefined dynalink.

This problem occurs because Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0 Setup installs a
Windows 95 version of a Windows Help extension DLL file (Msvcbook.dll) when
you install Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0 under Windows NT. This problem has
been corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ 2.1 and 2.2.

To work around this problem, copy Msvcbook.dll from the \msvc20\bin
directory on the Visual C++ 2.0 compact disc to your %systemroot%\system32
directory (for example, c:\winnt\system32).

Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 and 4.1
--------------------------------

The Visual C++ 4.0 and 4.1 Help Compiler (Hcw.exe) on RISC machines
requires Cfm30.dll to run. If this .dll file is not present on your
computer, or you experience other problems with this executable, please
retrieve a later version of Hcw.exe, which does not require Cfm30.dll, from
the Windows NT version 4.0 SDK found on the August 1996 MSDN compact disc.

Microsoft Windows 95 Plus! Pack
-------------------------------

The Windows 95 Plus! Pack does not install under Windows NT.

Microsoft Windows Messaging 4.0
-------------------------------

Dragging a window over a message being composed in Windows Messaging
version 4.0 may cause screen refresh or display problems, particularly on
multiprocessor systems. Contact Microsoft Product Service Support.

Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0a
---------------------------------------

Windows NT does not support computer-based tutorial (CBT) files. The Help
files use CBT files for the Examples, Demos, and Quick Previews. When you
view sections of Help that use the CBT files, the following error appears:

You cannot run the CBT with this operating system" or "CBT directory not
found.

Microsoft Word 5.5 for MS-DOS
-----------------------------

When using Word with a foreign language keyboard, start the application
using the forcedos command. This enables you to compose accented characters
with two keystrokes. For more information, see the forcedos topic in the
Command Reference section of Windows NT Help.

MS-DOS-based applications can set only standard VGA modes directly under
Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 4.0. The higher
graphics modes (30 lines, 80 columns, 16 color and higher) offered by Word
are not supported. The 25 line, 80 column, 16 color graphics mode is
supported.

Microsoft Works 3.0
-------------------

Windows NT does not support computer-based tutorial (CBT) files. The Help
files use CBT files for the Examples, Demos, and Quick Previews. When you
view sections of Help that use the CBT files, the following error appears:

You cannot run the CBT with this operating system" or, "CBT directory not
found.

Milestones, Etc
---------------

Closing multiple windows quickly may prevent the desktop from responding to
the keyboard and mouse. Close Milestones windows individually.

Millie's Math House
-------------------

This application requires MFC version 3.0 DLLs, but does not install them.

Netscape Navigator
------------------

Netscape Navigator 2.0 is available in several Beta versions. Do not
install one version over another. Registry entries from one version
conflict with earlier versions. Remove earlier versions before installing a
new version.

Norton Utilities for Windows 95
-------------------------------

The programs in Norton Utilities for Windows 95 do not run under Windows NT
Workstation or Windows NT Server version 4.0. You can use the programs from
Windows 95 on dual boot systems to operate on FAT-formatted drives created
or modified by Windows NT.

Because of differences in the way Windows NT and Windows 95 generate short
filenames, the Norton Utilities programs may incorrectly report that short
filenames created by Windows NT are no longer associated with their
original files. If the programs attempt to "fix" the Windows NT filenames,
the files may no longer be accessible.

Norton Navigator, and AntiVirus for Windows 95
----------------------------------------------

These applications are specific to the Windows 95 operating system and are
not intended for use on Windows NT version 4.0. They correctly detect that
Windows 95 is not present and do not install.

Norton NT Tools 1.0
-------------------

You cannot enter a colon or the designations "AM" or "PM" directly into the
Norton Control Center virus scans scheduling edit box. You can schedule
virus scans by copying a time from an application such as Notepad to the
Windows clipboard and pasting it in the edit box. You can also set the
scheduled time by choosing Scheduler on the Tools menu in the Norton
AntiVirus Scanner.

Some of the buttons in Norton System Doctor's alarms such as Task Manager
and System Settings fail to work on Windows NT version 4.0.  Contact
Symantec at www.symantec.com for more information.

Now Up-to-Date 95
-----------------

Although this application can be installed, early versions do not run.

This application requires MFC version 3.0 DLLs, but does not install them.
For more information, see "Windows 95 Applications and Microsoft Foundation
Class Libraries" earlier in this document.

OfficeBlox
----------

Some versions of OfficeBlox install but do not run. This application
requires MFC version 3.0 DLLs, but some versions do not install them. For
more information, see "Windows 95 Applications and Microsoft Foundation
Class Libraries" earlier in this document.
Labels and values may not appear in the CalcSheets for CalcBlox objects
embedded in the WorkBlox demonstration application in some early versions.
Contact Alpha Blox for upgrade information.

Omniform
--------

Omniform fails to install because it interprets the Windows NT 4.0 version
number incorrectly. Contact Caere Corporation, 100 Cooper Court, Los Gatos,
CA 95030, (800) 535-SCAN for upgrade information.

OzCIS
-----

OzCIS requires that you create a .PIF file prior to installing under
Windows NT. See "Creating PIF Files." If OzCIS loses characters when
transmitting data, try using a lower baud rate.

PackRat 5.011 for Windows
-------------------------

On RISC-based computers, the PackRat setup program generates illegal
instructions when trying to modify the path. Select No when the PackRat
setup program asks if you would like to add the PackRat directory to your
path. After installation, add the directory to your path manually.

pcAnywhere 2.0
--------------

Installing pcAnywhere 2.0 for Windows or pcAnywhere 2.0 for Windows 95
under Windows NT can lead to lost files on NTFS-formatted drives. For more
information, contact Symantec at http://www.symantec.com.

pcAnywhere III for MS-DOS

include the dosonly command in the custom configuration file. For more
information, see "Running MS-DOS-based Remote Control Applications" earlier
in these Release Notes.

pcAnywhere32
------------

You need pcAnywhere32 version 7.5 to enter Host mode under Windows NT
version 4.0. Contact Symantec at http://www.symantec.com for upgrade
information.

Peachtree Accounting 3.05
-------------------------

Peachtree Accounting causes a General Protection Fault with long printer
names. Create a local printer and rename the printer to less than 15
characters in length.

PixelPro
--------

PixelPro does not install or run under Windows NT.

PowerDesk
---------

PowerDesk for Windows 95 does not run after installation. PowerDesk
requires the Windows 95 Kernel32.dll file, which is not available in
Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server. The PowerDesk ExplorerPlus
tool runs, but some folder and drive names are garbled and some functions
do not work as expected. Microhelp does not support PowerDesk on Windows
NT.

Procomm 2.0
-----------

When setting up Procomm 2.0 for Windows, Setup does not properly install
its icon. Instead, you can create a shortcut to start the program. To
create a shortcut:  right-click the desktop. Click New, click Shortcut.
Type the location and name or use the Browse button.

Qmodem Pro for Windows 95
-------------------------

ToolTips may not appear. Contact Mustang Software (805.873.2500) for
upgrade information.

Quantum Gate
------------

When installing Quantum Gate, do not select the actual audio driver, but
select Other.

Quark Xpress
------------

This application warns that a font or fonts are not properly installed. You
can uninstall offending fonts or ignore error messages. The font name box
will sometimes overlap the left justification button and completely cover
the center and right justification buttons.

Quattro Pro
-----------

Some embedded OLE objects may not behave as expected in files opened with
Quattro Pro 6.0. Quattro Pro 6.01 has improved OLE implementation. Contact
Novell at (800) 861-2774.

In Quattro Pro for MS-DOS (RISC only), keyboard response may be
exceptionally slow.

In Quattro Pro for Windows 1.0, multiple-copy printing is not supported.
When you select Redirect To File in the Printer Setup dialog box, the
printer output will be redirected to a file in the \systemroot\system32
directory, even if you choose a different directory using the Browse
button. The file will overwrite an existing file of the same name without
any warning message. Another file with the same name will also be created
in the directory you select using the Browse button, or in the Quattro Pro
directory by default. This file will not contain any printer information
and will have a size of zero bytes.

Quattro Pro may display printers in its Printer Setup dialog box that are
no longer available. A General Protection Fault may occur if you try to
print to an unavailable printer. To see if a printer is still available,
click Start  point to Settings, click Printers, and then double-click the
printer to view the status.

Quick View Plus
---------------

Close and exit Quick View Plus, including any open viewing windows, before
attempting to remove Quick View Plus by using Add/Remove Programs in
Control Panel.

Quicken version 4.0
-------------------

The communications portion of Quicken version 4.0 will only run on Windows
NT version 4.0 if it is installed on x86-compatible computers.

Quicken version 5.0 and Quicken Deluxe version 5.0
--------------------------------------------------

Quicken 5.0 will not install on Window NT version 4.0 because the
installation program is looking for Program Manager (Progman.exe) in the
Windows directory. Windows NT includes a 32-bit version of Progman.exe in
the System32 directory.

If Windows NT version 4.0 has not been installed in the same directory as
Windows 95 or Windows version 3.1,  copy Progman.exe into the systemroot
(for example c:\winnt) directory before installing Quicken 5.0. After
Quicken is installed, delete Progman.exe from the systemroot directory.

If Windows NT version 4.0 has been installed in the same directory as
Windows 95 or Windows version 3.1, the Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 version of
Progman.exe will already be in the Windows directory.

Copy the existing version of Progman.exe to another directory before
copying  the 32-bit version of Progman.exe from the System32 directory to
the Windows directory. After Quicken is installed, copy the Windows 95 or
the Windows 3.1 version of Progman.exe back into the Windows directory.

Reflection 2
------------

Only a small portion of the printer icon appears in the Print dialog. If
you have more than one printer, you can select any of them in the Print
Setup dialog, but the change is not reflected in the Print dialog and all
hard copy is sent to the default printer.

Remotely Possible/32
--------------------

If you have Remotely Possible/32 version 2.0 or 2.1 installed on computer
running Windows NT 3.51, you must uninstall Remotely Possible before
installing Windows NT 4.0. If you do not, Windows NT will not install
correctly. You can uninstall Remotely Possible by running the Remove.bat
file located on the Remotely Possible distribution disk. After you have
upgraded to Windows NT, you can reinstall Remotely Possible.

Remotely Possible/32 versions 2.0 and 2.1 do not enter Host mode under
Windows NT version 4.0. Remotely Possible/32 can be run in client mode
under Windows NT version 4.0 and can connect with Window NT 3.51 and
Windows 95 hosts. Contact Avalan at http://www.avalan.com for upgrade
information.

Remove-It 95
------------

Remove-It 95 fails to install under Windows NT version 4.0.

Rumba
-----

Connectivity Software earlier in this chapter.

Sammy's Science House
---------------------

See "Software Applications by Edmark" earlier in this document.

Serif PagePlus Home/Office
--------------------------

When Serif PagePlus Home/Office is installed, the program group icons
"PagePlus Home Office Online Documentation", "PagePlus Home Office Readme"
and "Serif PagePlus Home Office" icons are not added to the Start menu.
Normally, the icons would appear when you click Start, point to Programs,
and then click Serif Applications/(missing filename). The icons do not
appear because the application's install program creates a filename with a
forward slash (/) in it ("...Home/Office").  Because Windows NT maintains
POSIX compatibility, forward slashes are directory separators.

Seattle Film Works Photoworks
-----------------------------

This application's depth of color cannot be converted to an optimized

--------------

The application is not supported because it relies on incompatible 16-bit
device drivers.

Symantec C++ 7.2
----------------

- The 16-bit IDE interprets the Windows NT version incorrectly and displays
  user interface elements incorrectly. The 32-bit IDE interprets the Windows NT
  version number incorrectly and looks for the wrong filenames when you chose a
  Help menu option or click a Help button in a dialog box. You can add the
  necessary help files by following the "Instructions for users running NT 3.50
  only" in the Using Symantec C++ Help on Windows NT section of the Readme.txt
  file located on the Symantec C++ CD in the \sc\readme directory.

- When setting the colors using the Color tab in the Settings dialog box in the
  16-bit IDE, many of the color changes in the color selection boxes are not
  accurately reflected in the color boxes of the dialog boxes or in the 16-bit
  IDE itself. (The Settings dialog box is accessed by clicking Environment
  Setting on the Environment menu.)
