-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft LAN Manager, versions 2.2, 2.2a, 2.2b, 2.2c 
- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Local area network administrators often want users running MS-DOS clients (Lan
Manager 2.2c, Network Client 3.0) to go directly into Microsoft Windows or to
run some application immediately upon logging on. This is often attempted by
executing the application at the end of a logon script. Unfortunately, memory
problems are often experienced because logon scripts are spawned on a second
copy of COMMAND.COM, and NET.EXE still resides in memory from the unfinished
execution of NET LOGON.

RUN.EXE is a utility in the Lan Manager Resource Kit (version 2.1) that allows
you to specify a command to execute upon the completion of your logon script. It
provides support similar to Novell NetWare's login script option:

  EXIT "cmdline"


RUN.EXE avoids the memory problems mentioned above by executing your command at
the original MS-DOS prompt. It works with logon scripts in both the Lan Manager
server and Windows NT server environments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HOW RUN.EXE IS USED
-------------------

The following files are included with RUN.EXE

   Filename        Description
   --------        -----------
   RUN.EXE         Executable
   README.TXT      This file

Place RUN.EXE in your current working directory or somewhere in your path. At the
end of your logon script add:

  RUN &lt;cmdline&gt;

where &lt;cmdline&gt; specifies the command line for the application that you
want to start after you have logged in. &lt;cmdline&gt; is limited to 14
characters (see "Important Notes" below).

Example:

Suppose you would like to have Windows start up after your logon script executes.
Place RUN.EXE somewhere in your path, and add the following line to the end of
your logon script:

  RUN WIN

Windows will immediately start after your NET LOGON command finishes, without the
memory loss caused by NET.EXE and a second copy of COMMAND.COM running.

HOW DOES RUN.EXE WORK?
----------------------

RUN.EXE simply takes the command line you specify and dumps it into the keyboard
buffer. The keyboard buffer will be emptied at the first available opportunity.
If you use RUN.EXE at the end of your logon script, the first opportunity will
be after NET LOGON has finished executing. Therefore, your original MS-DOS
prompt will receive the input.

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

The keyboard buffer is limited to 16 characters. Therefore, because one character
is taken for the line feed and another for the tail pointer, &lt;cmdline&gt; is
limited to 14 characters. If more than 14 characters are specified, RUN.EXE will
ignore them.

RUN.EXE was designed to be run exclusively on MS-DOS. It is a real mode
application that will not execute from OS/2. The whole reason for running
RUN.EXE is lost in OS/2 since the memory problem is not an issue. Similarly you
should be careful when logging in from Windows. Again the functionality of this
utility in such an environment would be questionable. Limited tests have shown
that RUN.EXE has no effect when logging on from Windows.

If you need more than 14 characters to specify the command(s) that you need to
execute, create a batch file and have RUN.EXE call your batch file. This would
be useful if you wanted to do something like set a variety of environment
variables.

RUN.EXE writes directly to the keyboard buffer. Computers that are not fully
IBM-compatible could have some problems with RUN.EXE. It has been successfully
tested on a variety of AT-compatible computers as well as some PS/2's.

Persistent Connections are restored after the logon script executes. If a
Persistent Connection requires a password, the command line specified with
RUN.EXE will be inserted at the password prompt and thus will not run at the
MS-DOS command line. If you are using RUN.EXE, be careful that this does not
happen. If you need to connect to a share that requires a password different
from the one you logged on with, you should add the NET USE for this share to
the batch file that RUN.EXE executes.
