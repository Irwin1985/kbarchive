S15728      MFCPART7.EXE          The MFCPART7.EXE file contains the source
                                 code for the article named "Programming
                                 Windows 95 with MFC, Part VII: The
                                 Document/View Architecture," by Jeff
                                 Prosise.

                                 The document/view architecture of
                                 Visual C++ 4.0 really simplifies
                                 the development process. Code to
                                 perform routine chores is provided
                                 by the framework. So is code to
                                 transform your app's documents into
                                 OLE container, simplify printing, and
                                 more.

S15729      WEBSTER.EXE           The WEBSTER.EXE file contains the source
                                 code for the article named "Write a
                                 Simple HTTP-based Server Using MFC and
                                 Windows Sockets," by David Cook.

                                 You may be surprised at how easy it is
                                 to write a World Wide Web server. Our
                                 sample server, Webster, is without
                                 question a bare-bones "baby" server,
                                 but it does demonstrate some of the
                                 basic techniques of Internet
                                 programming.

                                 Class Noise and Total Joy from Your Games
                                 with DirectSound and DirectImput" by
                                 Dave Edson.

                                 DirectSound ensures that you'll get
                                 swell audio with wave mixing from
                                 your games, while DirectInput is a
                                 much needed standard for handling
                                 the joystick. Both are components of
                                 the new Game SDK for Windows 95.

                                 sample for the column, "Under the Hood,"

                                 sample for the column, "C/C++ Q &amp; A,"
                                 by Paul DiLascia, page 107.

S15734      VISL0296.EXE          The VISL0296.EXE file contains the code
                                 sample for the column, "The Visual
                                 Programmer," by Joshua Trupin, page 93.
