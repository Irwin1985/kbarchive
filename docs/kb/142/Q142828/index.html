SYMPTOMS
========

The following pairs of bitmaps that come with Visual Basic are identical, but
they should be different:

  \bitmaps\outline\open.bmp      AND    \bitmaps\tlbr_w95\open.bmp
  (222 bytes)                  (246 bytes)

  \bitmaps\assorted\delete.bmp   AND    \bitmaps\tlbr_w95\delete.bmp
  (382 bytes)                  (246 bytes)

RESOLUTION
==========

Although they are not installed correctly, there are two different versions of
Open.bmp and Delete.bmp included on the distribution media for Visual Basic 4.0.
The Extract.exe program, which comes with Visual Basic, can be used to extract
the Windows 95 toolbar versions of Open.bmp and Delete.bmp from the installation
disks or CD. These files can then be copied over the files in the tlbr_w95
directory.

To extract the Open.bmp file, open an MS-DOS command window, change to the drive
that your installation disk resides in, and enter the following line: extract /a
/e /l c:\temp vb4-1.cab open.bmp where c:\temp is the name of a temporary
directory that the new copy of Open.bmp will be extracted to. The '/a' switch
tells Extract.exe to search all .cab files for the file(s) specified.

After pressing ENTER, Extract.exe starts searching, and finds and extracts the
first copy of Open.bmp (which is already installed). It continues searching and
finds the second copy, at which point it will ask if it's ok to overwrite
Open.bmp. Choose OK and let Extract.exe finish up. The second version of
Open.bmp now resides in the directory specified in the command. All that remains
now is to copy it to the tlbr_w95 subdirectory. Repeat the same steps to extract
the other version of Delete.bmp. For more information on Extract.exe enter
'extract /?' at a command prompt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or if it is already running, choose New Project from the
  File menu.

2. Double-click twice on the Image button in the Toolbox to add two image
  controls to the form. Move one of the image controls so both are visible.

3. Change the Picture property of Image1 to:

     &lt;path to your VB directory&gt;\bitmaps\outline\open.bmp

4. Change the Picture property of Image2 to:

     &lt;path to your VB directory&gt;\bitmaps\tlbr_w95\open.bmp

The pictures in the two image controls should be different, but they're not.

Manually extracting the second Open.bmp from the installation disks or CD will
allow access to both bitmaps.
