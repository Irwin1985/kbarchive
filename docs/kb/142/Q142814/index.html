SUMMARY
=======

The error "Error in loading DLL" (code 48) occurs when you call a dynamic-link
library (DLL) procedure and the file specified in the procedure's Declare
statement cannot be loaded. You can use the Microsoft Windows API function
LoadLibrary to find out more specific information about why a DLL fails to load.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The API function LoadLibrary loads a DLL and returns either a handle or an error
code. If the return value is less than 32, it indicates one of the errors listed
below. A return value greater than or equal to 32 indicates success and you
should call the FreeLibrary function to unload the library.

LoadLibrary Error Codes
-----------------------

0  System was out of memory, executable file was corrupt, or
   relocations were invalid.

2  File was not found.

3  Path was not found.

5  Attempt was made to dynamically link to a task, or there was a
   sharing or network-protection error.

6  Library required separate data segments for each task.

8  There was insufficient memory to start the application.

10 Windows version was incorrect.

11 Executable file was invalid. Either it was not a Windows
   application or there was an error in the .EXE image.

12 Application was designed for a different operating system.

13 Application was designed for MS-DOS 4.0.

14 Type of executable file was unknown.

15 Attempt was made to load a real-mode application (developed for
   an earlier version of Windows).

16 Attempt was made to load a second instance of an executable file
   containing multiple data segments that were not marked read-only.

19 Attempt was made to load a compressed executable file. The file
   must be decompressed before it can be loaded.

20 Dynamic-link library (DLL) file was invalid. One of the DLLs
   required to run this application was corrupt.

21 Application requires Microsoft Windows 32-bit extensions.

Steps to Create Example Program
-------------------------------

The following program demonstrates how to call LoadLibrary to load a library and
display a resulting error code.

1. Create a new Standard EXE Project in Visual Basic, Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Enter the following code into the general declarations section of Form1:

     #If Win32 Then
        Private Declare Function LoadLibraryEx Lib "Kernel32" Alias "LoadLibraryExA" _
           (ByVal lpLibFileName As String, _
           ByVal hFile As Long, _
           ByVal dwFlags As Long) As Integer
        Private Declare Sub FreeLibrary Lib "Kernel32" (ByVal hLibModule As Integer)
     #Else
        Private Declare Function LoadLibrary Lib "kernel" (ByVal f$) As Integer
        Private Declare Sub FreeLibrary Lib "Kernel" (ByVal h As Integer)
     #End If

3. Enter the following code into the Form Click event handler:

        Private Sub Form_Click ()
           Dim hInst As Integer
           ' Enter the name of your DLL file inside the quotes below.
           ' The file WIN.COM is not a valid DLL and demonstrates an error.
           #If Win32 Then
              hInst = LoadLibraryEx("win.com", 0, 2)
              If hInst &gt; 32 Then
                 MsgBox "LoadLibrary success"
                 FreeLibrary (hInst)
              Else
                 MsgBox "LoadLibrary error " + Format$(hInst)
              End If
           #Else
              hInst = LoadLibrary("win.com")
              If hInst &gt; 32 Then
                 MsgBox "LoadLibrary success"
                 FreeLibrary (hInst)
              Else
                 MsgBox "LoadLibrary error " + Format$(hInst)
              End If
           #End If
        End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the program. Then click Form1. The program displays
  the error code returned from LoadLibrary. Look up this error code in the list
  of errors above to find an explanation.
