-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience any of the following symptoms:

- When you try to insert an object from a network location, you may receive an
  error message similar to one of the following messages:

  - Word cannot obtain the data for the
  &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename.ext&gt; link.

  - Cannot insert object.

  - The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. You should
  reinstall the server application.

- When you attempt to set the default directory for Microsoft Word documents to
  a location on a mapped network drive, you may receive the following error
  message:

  The directory is not valid.

- When you attempt to use Microsoft Backup to perform a backup to a network
  drive mapped using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
  (MSNDS), you may receive the following error message:

  Microsoft backup could not create a file on the device you want to back up
  to. Make sure you specify a valid name for the device, and that you have the
  necessary network access rights, and then try again. For more information,
  contact your network administrator.

  If you attempt to connect to the share using Network Neighborhood, you are
  able to do so.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur when the object you are attempting to insert exists on a
network drive mapped using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
(MSNDS).


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, instead of using an MSNDS-mapped drive, use the
Browse button to find the network location of the object in Network
Neighborhood. This uses the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path for the
object, rather than mapping a drive letter to the network location where the
object exists.

This issue is resolved by the following updated file(s) for Windows 95 and OSR2,
as well as later versions of these file(s):

  NWNP32.DLL  version 4.00.969  dated 12/20/95 10:09am  138,752 bytes

This file is included in Windows 95 Service Pack 1. For more information on
obtaining Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q142794: Availability of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1

NOTE: This file is named NWNP32.NW4 before it is installed.


If a version of Mprserv.dll later than 4.00.950 is installed, the following
updated file is also required:

  MPRSERV.DLL  version 4.00.959  dated 4/13/98 9:59am  127,488 bytes

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: For additional information about the resolution to this problem, see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184838 OLE Problems Using MSNDS Are Not Resolved By NWNP32 Update

This problem does not occur with network drives accessed with other clients for
Windows 95.

The updated Nwnp32.dll file causes NDS-connected network drives to appear
differently in Windows Explorer. Instead of "ShareName on ServerName," you see
each drive with a name like "ServerName.tree on $nds &lt;drive letter:&gt;." You
cannot change this new drive description format.

This update applies only to 32-bit Windows 95-based programs. It does not resolve
problems for 16-bit programs. A fix for 16-bit programs must be program-specific
and generated by the program developer.

file, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
