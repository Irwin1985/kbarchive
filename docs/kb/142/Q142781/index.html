- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, you can hide a
recipient mailbox from the Address Book. If this is done, the mailbox will not
show up in any Microsoft Exchange database table. This means the mailbox will
not appear in the Global Address List, in any hierarchy container, as a member
of a Distribution List, or as a manager or direct report. Also, except in the
case when the Distinguished Name (DN) of the mailbox is used, the mailbox will
not be suggested as a possible Ambiguous Name Resolution match.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The only way to select a hidden mailbox is to use the Distinguished Name (DN)
for that mailbox. The DN is an address that is unique in the entire
organization. The following is an example of a DN:

  /o=EXCHNG_ORG/ou=EXCHNG_SITE/cn=Container1/cn=Container2/cn=Alias

In the above example:

- EXCHNG_ORG is the Exchange Organization Name.

- EXCHNG_SITE is the Exchange Site Name.

- Container1 and Container2 are Container names with Container2 being a
  subcontainer of Container1.

- Alias is the mailbox alias name and is present in Container2.

The DN can be constructed if the above pieces of information are known.

The DN for a mailbox can also be obtained from the Raw Properties of the
mailbox.

WARNING: Using the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in raw mode should
only be done under the direction of a Microsoft Exchange Support Engineer.
Incorrectly configuring the Administrator properties in raw mode can cause
serious, system-wide problems that may require you to reinstall Microsoft
Exchange Server to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
resulting from the incorrect use of the Administrator program in raw mode can be
solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To obtain the Raw Properties, follow the steps below:

1. Run the Exchange Administrator Program using the /raw command line option.

2. Select the mailbox whose Raw Properties you want to obtain and then choose
  the Raw Properties command from the File menu. This will bring up a dialog
  box displaying the Raw Properties for that mailbox.

3. From the Object Attributes listbox, select the item called Obj-Dist-Name.

4. The DN for that mailbox should now be displayed in the field labeled
  Attribute Value.

Mailing to a Hidden Recipient
-----------------------------

In the Compose New Message To: box, type the DN for the recipient of the message.
On the Tools menu, click Check Names (or press CTRL+K). If the DN corresponds to
a valid mailbox, the DN will be replaced by the underlined Display Name of the
mailbox.

To add this address to the Personal Address Book, double-click the underlined
Display Name. This will bring up the Properties of the mailbox in question. On
the General Page of the Properties, click Personal Address Book, which will add
the address to the Personal Address Book. In the future, the address can be
selected from the Personal Address Book, instead of typing in the DN for the
mailbox.

The above procedure can also be used when you create an Inbox Assistant or Public
Folder rule involving a mailbox hidden from the Address Book.
