-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When a client computer connects to a Systems Management Server logon server
using Remote Access Service (RAS), the inventory runs even though it is a slow
network connection.

CAUSE
=====

When Netspeed.com reads Netspeed.dat through a hardware or software
compression-capable link, the contents of the file may be compressed which
causes Netspeed to return a false speed reading.

For additional information about Netspeed errorlevels and troubleshooting, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q131011 SMS: Netspeed.com Internals

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

It may be possible to work around this problem by making the following adjustment
in the registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components
     \SMS_MAINTENANCE_MANAGER

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Select the following entry: Slow Net Threshold Speed.

3. On the Edit menu, select DWORD.

4. Change the Data to 150 (decimal) (see paragraph below).

5. Click OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. At the next watchdog cycle, the Maintenance Manager service will generate a
  new Netspeed.com in the \SMS\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\client.src directory. This
  file will not be built in the Netlogon share and will not be copied there.

7. If necessary, copy the file to the login scripts directory.

The value that works best will depend on your network environment. This should be
tested in two ways:

- Make certain that the Systems Management Server script still runs for clients
  not dialing in to your network. This is especially important in a wide area
  network (WAN) environment, make sure that remote sites are still being
  inventoried.

  -and-

- Test the fastest dial-up client so they are not inventoried. It may take
  several adjustments to locate the ideal threshold speed for your network
  environment.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When Smsls.bat or Smsls.cmd runs from a logon script, Netspeed.com and
Netspeed.dat are used to determine if the network link is above a pre- defined
speed threshold. Depending on the threshold speed set in the registry and the
policy set in the Systems Management Server Administrator Tool, Smsls.bat or
Smsls.cmd prompts the user to confirm whether they want inventory performed when
a slow link is detected.

You can use the command

     netspeed.com /v

to determine the link speed that Systems Management Server is using. The possible
return values are as follows:

  0 - Net is fast
  1 - Net is slow
  2 - Net is slow, prompts user

NOTE: Because of file caching on some operating systems, netspeed.com /v will
only return a valid result the first time it is run. Disconnecting and
reestablishing the dial-up connection clears the file cache.
