The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you install a custom application created with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT), the Setup program creates a new, unsecured system
database (named SYSTEM.MDA) and modifies the custom .INI file so that it
references the new SYSTEM.MDA. This article explains how you can customize the
Setup program to use your secured system database instead of the new, unsecured
SYSTEM.MDA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to supply your own system database, there are two general steps to
follow. First, in the ADT Setup Wizard, you add the custom system database along
with the other files for your application. Second, after creating your
distribution disks, you modify the SETUP.STF file to prevent the creation of a
new SYSTEM.MDA file and to set the system database name for the [Options]
section of your application's .INI file.

To modify the SETUP.STF file to use your system database instead of a new,
unsecured SYSTEM.MDA, you can follow this procedure.

NOTE: This procedure makes changes to the SETUP.STF file which is not supported
by Microsoft. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without warranty of
any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.

1. Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file located in your DISK1 directory (or
  in the shared directory of the administrator's installation on the network
  server), and name the backup copy SETUPSTF.BAK.

2. Open the SETUP.STF file using an application that supports a delimited- text
  file format, such as Microsoft Excel.

3. In the first column of the SETUP.STF file, scroll down to the row that
  contains ObjID. Note that the ObjID row contains column headings. Three of
  these column headings (ObjID [column 1], Title [column 3], and Object Data
  [column 6]) are referenced in steps 4 through 10.

4. In the ObjID row, move the pointer to the Title column (column 3).

5. In the Title column, scroll down to the row that contains "Create
  SYSTEM.MDA." This row is usually located near the bottom of the SETUP.STF
  file.

6. In the Create SYSTEM.MDA row, move the pointer the ObjID column (column 1),
  and write down the ObjID value.

7. Move the pointer to the Title column (column 3), and scroll to the row that
  contains "User Non File Work."

8. In the User Non File Work row, move the pointer to the Object Data column
  (column 6), and delete the ObjID value that you wrote down in step 6.

9. In the Title column (column 3), scroll to the row that contains
  "USER_UserINI_1."

10. In the USER_UserINI_1 row (or the USER_UserINI_2 row), move the pointer to
  the Object Data column (column 6), and replace the name "SYSTEM.MDA" with
  the name of your system database. For example, if your system database is
  called SECURE.MDA, you can change the following sample line:

  "%322\myapp.ini", "Options", "SystemDB", "%26\SYSTEM.MDA"

  to:

  "%322\myapp.ini", "Options", "SystemDB", "%26\SECURE.MDA"

  NOTE: This step ensures that your program will find and use the custom system
  database, regardless of the application path specified by any user at the
  time the user installs your application.

11. Save the SETUP.STF file as a delimited-text file.
