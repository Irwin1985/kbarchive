SUMMARY
=======

This article details how AS/400 commands are constructed, gives examples of how
they are used, and references sources of help on the AS/400.

Information for this article was taken mainly from AS/400 system documentation.
Sections preceded by &amp;&amp;&amp; are copies of displays. This article is
most useful if viewed using a fixed-width font.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AS/400 Command Formats:

AS400 commands are generally constructed using syntactical blocks. These blocks
are concatenated together to produce commands. Generally, the first block on a
command details the action to be taken by the command, and all subsequent parts
of the command are modifiers. For example, the command WRKSYSVAL is composed of
three major blocks, one action, and two specifiers of the action's object:

  WRK stands for WoRK, SYS stands for SYStem
  VAL stands for VALues

  WRKSYSSTS is composed of three blocks:

     WRK for WoRK
     SYS for SYStem
     STS for STatuS

The blocks are relatively consistent from command to command. Generally, the same
action block will be used with a variety of objects that can be affected by its
purpose. For example:

  WRKSYSVAL    (WoRK with SYStem VALues)
  WRKSPLF      (WoRK SPooLed Files)
  WRKOBJ      (WoRK with OBJects)
  WRKCFGSTS   (WoRK ConFiGuration STatuS)

The object part is also relatively consistent between actions. A single object
block may be used with different actions. Example:

  CRTDEVD      (CReaTe DEVice Description)
  DLTDEVD      (DeLeTe DEVice Description)
  WRKDEVD      (WoRK DEVice Description)

Apart from the CL (Command Language) Reference Guides, the better sources of
OS/400 command documentation are contained within OS/400 itself. It should be
noted that the OS/400 Help Facility is an optional component, and some AS/400's
may not have it installed.

&lt;F4&gt; in any command line for a user with sufficient privileges brings up
the major command groups. The major command groups is a menu based help facility
that catalogues commands in intuitive groups based on object function.

The SLTCMD command (SeLecT CoMmanD) allows the user to create a list of commands
that adhere to a specific pattern or group. For example:

&amp;&amp;&amp;{
MAIN                           AS/400 Main Menu
                                                           System: RAINIER
Select one of the following:

     1. User tasks
     2. Office tasks

     4. Files, libraries, and folders

     6. Communications

     8. Problem handling
     9. Display a menu
    10. Information Assistant options
    11. PC Support tasks

    90. Sign off

Selection or command
===&gt; SLTCMD CMD(WRKD*)

F3=Exit   F4=Prompt   F9=Retrieve   F12=Cancel   F13=Information Assistant
F23=Set initial menu

}&amp;&amp;&amp;

Will give the user the display shown below:

&amp;&amp;&amp;{
                                Select Command

Type options, press Enter.
  1=Select

Opt  Command     Library     Text
     WRKDBFIDD   QSYS        Work with DB Files using IDDU
     WRKDDMF     QSYS        Work with DDM Files
     WRKDEVD     QSYS        Work with Device Descriptions
     WRKDIR      QSYS        Work with Directory
     WRKDIRLOC   QSYS        Work with Directory Locations
     WRKDIRSHD   QSYS        Work with Dir Shadow Systems
     WRKDOC      QSYS        Work with Documents
     WRKDOCCVN   QSYS        Work with Document Conversions
     WRKDOCLIB   QSYS        Work with Document Libraries
     WRKDOCPRTQ  QSYS        Work with Document Print Queue
     WRKDOCSET   QSYS        Work with Document Sets
     WRKDOCTYP   QSYS        Work with Document Types

 More...
Parameters or command
===&gt;
F3=Exit      F4=Prompt   F5=Refresh   F9=Retrieve   F11=Display names only
F12=Cancel   F16=Repeat position to   F17=Position to

}&amp;&amp;&amp;

The user can then select the desired command from the list. Note that the
wildcard will only work at the end of a string.

If the user types in a command on a command line, and the presses the F4 key, all
default parameters for that particular command will be shown, some with default
values. AS/400 has field level help. If the user has any questions on the
definition or use of a particular parameter, the user should position the cursor
over the desired field or item, and press F1. A window with the AS/400 help
facility will be displayed.

NOTE: The AS/400 help facility is not a required item to install. Although many
users install it as part of their operating system, some users do not in order
to save DASD (disk array) space. Note also that the help facility is sensitive
to security requirements. If the user does not have enough privileges to use a
command, he will not have privileges to use help against it either.

COMMANDS
--------

WORKING WITH LINES

The following are some objects blocks used for referring to lines:

  DLT (DeLeTe), DSP (DiSPlay), WRK (WoRK):

     - LIND       (LINe Description)

  CHG (CHanGe), CRT (CReaTe):

     - LINETH    (LINe ETHernet)
     - LINSDLC   (LINe SDLC)
     - LINTDLC   (LINe TDLC [Twinax])
     - LINTRN   (LINe Token RiNg)
     - LINX25   (LINe X.25)

Generally the simplest way to verify the configuration for a line is by using:

  WRKLIND {line description name}

To get a listing of all the lines on an AS/400:

  WRKLIND *ALL

This command displays a list of all the lines that are configured in the system,
and that the current user has sufficient privileges to view. The user interface
in the Work with Line Descriptions facility allows the user to scroll through
the list using the PageUp/PageDown keys, and has a single character field in
front of each line name to allow the management of each line under the Opt
heading:

&amp;&amp;&amp;{
                         Work with Line Descriptions
                                                           System:RAINIER
Position to  . . . . .                Starting characters

Type options, press Enter.
  2=Change   3=Copy    4=Delete   5=Display   6=Print   7=Rename
  8=Work with status   9=Retrieve source

Opt   Line         Type     Text
 _    ANDERSEN     *SDLC    sdlc dial-out for AC; Pass thru source.
 _    CHICAGO      *SDLC    'sdlc dial-in  for AC;
 _    ETHLINE      *ELAN    ETHERNET LINE
 _    ETHLINE2     *ELAN    ETHERNET LINE
 _    HNETHOST     *SDLC    Help/NET Product Support
 _    LANLINE      *TRLAN   TOKEN RING LINE
 _    L02124BSC    *BSC     EDI/400 BSC manual dial line at 02400 baud.
 _    MPGLIN       *SDLC    MPG - Midrange Performance Group line LIN011
 _    QESLINE      *SDLC    IBM DIAL OUT LINE - LIN021

 More...
Parameters or command
===&gt;
F3=Exit   F4=Prompt   F5=Refresh   F6=Create   F9=Retrieve   F12=Cancel
F14=Work with status
}&amp;&amp;&amp;

The user interface for this command allows the user to do all the functions that
any of the other commands allow. The codes on the top of the screen are the
allowed codes for the option field. To display the parameters for line
description ETHLINE2, type a 5 in the Opt field to its left.

WORKING WITH CONTROLLERS AND DEVICES

Apart from the fact that the actual configuration parameters are distinct because
the objects being dealt with are different, the device and controller commands
are very similar to the line commands. The more important commands for working
with devices and controllers are built with these blocks:

  DLT (DeLeTe), DSP (DiSPlay), WRK (WoRK):

     - DEVD       (DEVice Description)
     - CTLD         (ConTroLler Description)

  CHG (CHanGe), CRT (CReaTe):

     - DEVAPPC      (DEVice APPC)
     - CTLAPPC      (ConTroLer APPC)

The user interface is very similar to the user interface for WRKLIND.

WORKING WITH HARDWARE RESOURCES

Line descriptions are configuration parameters for a type of connection over a
specific hardware resource (hence the resource name parameter in the line
description). The following command displays, and offer a user interface for
handling communication hardware components of an AS/400:

  WRKHDWRSC *CMN
  [WoRK with HarDWare ReSourCes - *CoMmuNications]

If the line being troubleshot is a Twinax line, use the following command to look
at Local WorkStations:

  WRKHDWRSC *LWS
  [WoRK with HarDWare ReSourCes - *Local WorkStations]

The interface is similar to the interface offered by WRKLIND. This command may be
necessary to use if unable to configure correctly a line on the AS/400.

WORKING WITH CONFIGURATION STATUS

Line descriptions are not useful until they have been activated for use. This
activation process is known as Vary On. The opposite of this function takes a
line off-line, Vary Off. The importance of having the lines varied on when
attempting to communicate with and AS/400 cannot be over-stressed. A varied off
line is not accessible, even if it is configured correctly.

The more useful commands when either querying the status of a line, controller,
or device, or attempting to vary it on or off are the following:

  VRYCFG CFGOBJ({description}) CFGTYPE(*LIN|*DEV|*CTL)  STATUS(*ON|*OFF)
  [VaRY ConFiGuration]

  WRKCFGSTS CFGTYPE(*LIN) CFGD({description[optional]})
  [WoRK with ConFiGuration STatuS]

VRYCFG simply changes the status of the line and has no user interface, while
WRKCFGSTS will provide a user interface through which the user can monitor the
status and make changes as appropriate.

DISPLAYING AND CHANGING NETWORK ATTRIBUTES

Network attributes on the AS/400 are the equivalent of the Server Properties on
the SNA Server Admin. It displays general networking information on the AS/400
such as: Network Name, Local (to the AS/400) Control Point Name, APPN node type.
Access the network attributes using the following commands:

  DSPNETA
  [DiSPlay NETwork Attributes]

  CHGNETA
  [CHanGe NETwork Attributes]

OTHER AS/400 COMMANDS

These commands may prove to be useful in some situations:

  DSPMSG &lt;message queue&gt;
  [DiSPlay MeSsaGe]
  View messages sent to a particular queue. If no message queue is
  specified, the command brings up the current user's message queue. The
  message queue used by default for system generated error, warning,
  and informational messages, is the queue for QSYSOPR:

     DSPMSG QSYSOPR

  allows the user to view any messages for any event requiring attention.
  Messages needing a reply can be identified by a blank line under the
  message. Set the cursor over a message using the arrow keys, and press
  the F1 key to get more information about that message. The help
  information displayed may include suggested troubleshooting steps.

  WRKSPLF
  [WoRK with SPooLed Files]
  View, change properties, and delete spooled files in queue for a print
  device (or to be sent to a print device). Generally, when a device fails
  while in session, an entry is created with details of all the errors
  that occurred while that device was in session. Useful for
  troubleshooting specific station problems.

  WRKACTJOB
  [WoRK with ACTive JOBs]
  Displays and allows system operators to manage jobs that are currently
  active in the system. Displays useful information such as the job's
  creator, time and date of creation, job attributes and parameters, CPU
  load, CPU share of a job.

  WRKSYSVAL *ALL
  [WoRK with SYStem VALues - *ALL]
  Displays a full list of all system values in the AS/400. Includes items
  such as QAUTOCFG (switch for auto-configuration) and QAUTOVRT (virtual
  devices to create).

  WRKMODD
  [WoRK with MODe Description]
  Provides user interface for managing all modes defined in the system.
  The user interface is similar to the user interface used for changing
  line and device descriptions.

  WRKFLR
  [WoRK with FoLdeRs]
  Provides user interface for displaying and managing all shared folders
  created in the system.

  WRKSBSD
  [WoRK with SuBSystem Description]
  Provides user interface for management of the properties of all or some
  subsystems on the AS/400. Subsystems are processes that are responsible
  for managing resources for a particular group of jobs, such as 5250
  display or printer sessions. This command is usually used for
  troubleshooting whether a particular subsystem can support a particular
  device type.

NOTE: Security commands are not included in this document. Refer to OS/400 system
documentation for more details.
