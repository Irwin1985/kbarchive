Last Modified: 11-SEP-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On your computer running the TCP/IP protocol and connected to the Internet, some
or all network services are rendered unavailable and error messages such as the
following appear on the network client screen:

  The connection has been reset by the remote host.

This symptom of all network services being rendered unavailable may also occur on
a computer running an operating system other than Windows NT, for example, UNIX.

CAUSE
=====

Your computer has become the target of a malicious attack known as TCP/IP "SYN
Flooding" or "SYN Attacks."

"Computer hackers" can target an entire machine, or a specific TCP service such
as web services. The attack is focused on the TCP protocol used by all computers
on the Internet, and is not specific to the Windows NT operating system.

How SYN Flooding Works
----------------------

SYN Flooding works as follows: (see also CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.21 at
ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories

- A TCP connection request (SYN) is sent to the target computer. The source IP
  address in the packet is "spoofed," or replaced with an address that is not
  in use on the Internet, or that belongs to another computer. An attacker will
  send many of these TCP SYNs to tie up as many resources as possible on the
  target computer.

- Upon receiving the connection request, the target computer allocates
  resources to handle and track the new connection, then responds with a
  "SYN-ACK". In this case, the response is sent to the "spoofed" non- existent
  IP address.

- No response is received to the SYN-ACK. A default-configured Windows NT 3.5x
  or 4.0 computer will retransmit the SYN-ACK 5 times, doubling the time-out
  value after each retransmission. The initial time-out value is three seconds,
  so retries are attempted at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 seconds. After the last
  retransmission, 96 seconds are allowed to pass before the computer gives up
  on receiving a response, and deallocates the resources that were set aside
  earlier for the connection. The total elapsed time that resources are in use
  is 189 seconds.

How to Verify Your Computer is Under a SYN Attack
-------------------------------------------------

If you suspect that your computer is the target of a SYN attack, you can type the
following command at a command prompt to view connections in the "SYN_RECEIVED"
state:

" netstat -n -p tcp " (without the quotation marks)

This command may cause the following text to appear on your screen:

  Active Connections

     Proto  Local Address         Foreign Address       State
     TCP    127.0.0.1:1030        127.0.0.1:1032        ESTABLISHED
     TCP    127.0.0.1:1032        127.0.0.1:1030        ESTABLISHED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1256     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1257     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1258     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1259     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1260     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1261     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1262     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1263     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1264     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1265     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:21        10.57.14.154:1266     SYN_RECEIVED
     TCP    10.57.8.190:4801      10.57.14.221:139      TIME_WAIT

If a large number of connections are in the SYN_RECEIVED state, it is possible
that the system is under attack. A network analyzer can be used to track the
problem down further, and it may be necessary to contact your Internet Service
Provider for assistance in attempting to trace the source.

The effect of tying up connection resources varies, depending upon the TCP/IP
stack and applications listening on the TCP port. For most stacks, there is a
limit on the number of connections that can be in the half-open (SYN_RECEIVED)
state. Once the limit is reached for a given TCP port, the target computer
responds with a reset to all further connection requests until resources are
freed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the following update for Windows NT 3.51 or the latest Service Pack for
Windows NT 4.0

Microsoft is committed to providing the best possible protection against these
attacks from within the Windows NT operating system and has made a number of
changes to its TCP/IP components available to customers in response to this
threat.

This global key has been designed to protect against attacks and sets the other
keys mentioned later in the article to known effective values. This key avoids
having the administrator guess about which values would offer the most
protection. It is strongly recommended that the following global keys be used:

SynAttackProtect
Key: Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD
Valid Range: 0, 1, 2
0 (no synattack protection)
1 (reduced retransmission retries and delayed RCE (route cache entry) creation if
the TcpMaxHalfOpen and TcpMaxHalfOpenRetried settings are satisfied.)
2 (in addition to 1 a delayed indication to Winsock is made.)

NOTE: When the system finds itself under attack the following options on any
socket can no longer be enabled : sScalable windows (RFC 1323) and per adapter
configured TCP parameters (Initial RTT, window size). This is because when
protection is functioning the route cache entry is not queried before the
SYN-ACK is sent and the Winsock options are not available at this stage of the
connection.

Default: 0 (False)
Recommendation: 2
Description: Synattack protection involves reducing the amount of retransmissions
for the SYN-ACKS, which will reduce the time for which resources have to remain
allocated. The allocation of route cache entry resources is delayed until a
connection is made. If synattackprotect = 2, then the connect on indication to
AFD is delayed until the three-way handshake is completed. Also note that the
actions taken by the protection mechanism only occur if TcpMaxHalfOpen and
TcpMaxHalfOpenRetried settings are exceeded.

NOTE: The following keys should only be altered if the above global key has
proven to be ineffective or specific resource limits are being hit.

The changes are listed here:

*******************************************************************
*  1. Tcpip.sys times out half-open connections faster            *
*******************************************************************

A new version of Tcpip.sys has been produced that allows control of the number of
times a response to a TCP connection request (SYN-ACK) will be retransmitted.
Control is handled through a new registry parameter:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SYSTEM
  \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
    \Tcpip
     \Parameters
      \TcpMaxConnectResponseRetransmissions
          Value Type: REG_DWORD
          Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
          Default: 2

The default value for this parameter is now 3. The following table shows Windows
NT 4.0 TCP/IP behavior for various values of this parameter:

Value  Retransmission Times  Elapsed Time  Comments
3      3, 6, and 12 seconds  45 seconds    Cleanup 24 secs after last retx
2      3, and 6 seconds      21 seconds    Cleanup 12 secs after last retx
1      3 seconds             9  seconds    Cleanup 6  secs after last retx

This parameter changes the default time that it takes to clean up a half- open
TCP connection from 189 seconds to 45 seconds, and provides more granular
control to the administrator. A site that is under heavy attack might set the
value as low as "1". A value of "0" is also valid; however if this parameter is
set to 0, SYN-ACKs will not be retransmitted at all, and will time out in 3
seconds. With the value this low, legitimate connection attempts from distant
clients may fail.

*******************************************************************
*  2. NetBT has a Higher, Configurable Backlog                    *
*******************************************************************

NetBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) uses TCP port 139 and is used by Microsoft Network
Services such as file and print sharing. Version 3.51 and 4.0 NetBT has a
"backlog" of connection blocks available that is two plus an incremental number
depending on the NetBT clients (such as the redirector, server, and any NetBIOS
applications running). On a typical server, this number will be 7-11. A new
version of NetBT has been produced that automatically allocates more connection
blocks as needed, in a configurable manner.

On a connection event, it now checks to see if the number of free blocks is below
2, and if so, adds an "increment" number of blocks, where "increment" is
configurable in the registry as shown here:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SYSTEM
  \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
    \NetBt
     \Parameters
      \BacklogIncrement
          Value Type: REG_DWORD
          Valid Range: 1-0x14  (1-20 decimal)
          Default: 3

Each connection block consumes 78 bytes of memory. The total number of connection
blocks that can be allocated by NetBT is also registry configurable:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SYSTEM
  \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
    \NetBt
     \Parameters
      \MaxConnBackLog
          Value Type: REG_DWORD
          Valid Range: 1-0x9c40 (1-40,000 decimal)
          Default: 1000

MaxConnBackLog defaults to 1000, but can be set as high as 40,000. Connection
blocks are "scavenged," or recycled, when the SYN-ACK retransmission timer
expires and TCP fails the connection attempt.

*******************************************************************
*  3. Afd.sys has been modified to withstand large numbers of     *
*     "half-open" connections efficiently                         *
*******************************************************************

Windows Sockets applications such as ftp servers and web servers have their
connection attempts handled by Afd.sys. Afd.sys has been modified to support
large numbers of connections in the "half-open" state without denying access to
legitimate clients. This is accomplished by allowing the administrator to
configure a dynamic backlog.

The new version of Afd.sys supports four new registry parameters that can be used
to control the dynamic backlog behavior.

EnableDynamicBacklog is a global switch to enable or disable dynamic backlog. It
defaults to 0 (off), and this setting provides no change from the existing
versions. Setting it to 1 enables the new dynamic backlog feature.

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SYSTEM
  \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
    \AFD
     \Parameters
      \EnableDynamicBacklog
          Value Type: REG_DWORD
          Valid Range: 0,1
          Default: 0
          Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: 1

MinimumDynamicBacklog controls the minimum number of free connections allowed on
a listening endpoint. If the number of free connections drops below this value,
then a thread is queued to create additional free connections. This value should
not be made too large, as the dynamic backlog code engages whenever the number
of free connections falls below this value. Too large a value may lead to a
performance reduction.

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SYSTEM
  \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
    \AFD
     \Parameters
      \MinimumDynamicBacklog
          Value Type: REG_DWORD
          Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
          Default: 0
          Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: 20

MaximumDynamicBacklog controls the maximum number of "quasi-free" connections
allowed on a listening endpoint. "Quasi-free" connections include the number of
free connections plus those connections in a half- connected (SYN_RECEIVED)
state. No attempt is made to create additional free connections if doing so
would exceed this value.

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SYSTEM
  \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
    \AFD
     \Parameters
      \MaximumDynamicBacklog
          Value Type: REG_DWORD
          Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
          Default: 0
          Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: Memory
          dependent. This value should not exceed 5000 for each 32 MB of
          RAM installed in the server, in order to prevent exhaustion of
          non-paged pool when under attack.

DynamicBacklogGrowthDelta controls the number of free connections to create when
additional connections are necessary. Be careful with this value, as a large
value could lead to explosive free connection allocations.

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \SYSTEM
  \CurrentControlSet
   \Services
    \AFD
     \Parameters
      \DynamicBacklogGrowthDelta
          Value Type: REG_DWORD
          Valid Range: 0-0xFFFFFFFF
          Default: 0
          Suggested value for a system under heavy attack: 10 (0xa)


MaximumDynamicBacklog,


To take advantage of the changes to Afd.sys, Windows Sockets applications must
specifically request a backlog greater than the value configured for
MinimumDynamicBacklog when they issue their listen() call. Microsoft
applications such as Internet Information Server (which has a default backlog of
25) are configurable. Application-specific details are available from the
Microsoft Knowledge Base at http://www.microsoft.com/kb.
