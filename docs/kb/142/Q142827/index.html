SYMPTOMS
========

After placing a DBList control onto a SSPanel with the AutoSize property set to
'3 - AutoSize child sized to panel,' the DBList control flashes continuously.

RESOLUTION
==========

A combination of the DBList control and SSPanel with AutoSize set to 3 will
always cause this problem. It will not occur if the SSPanel's AutoSize property
is anything other than '3 - AutoSize child sized to panel.'

Note that a primary use for setting AutoSize to 3 was to give "a three-
dimensional look to standard controls such as list boxes." In this case, there
is no need to use a 3D panel, because the DBList control has an Appearance
property and a 3D look can be achieved solely by setting this property.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of the article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or if it is already running, choose New Project from the
  File menu.

2. If the 3D controls (panel, command button, etc.) are not in the Toolbox,
  right-click the Toolbox and select 'Custom Controls' from the pop-up menu. In
  the Custom Controls dialog box, double-click the entry labeled 'Sheridan 3D
  Controls' and click OK to add all of the 3D controls.

3. Double-click the SSPanel button in the Toolbox to add a SSPanel to the form.
  Resizing the panel to a larger size will make it easier to perform the next
  step.

4. Add a DBList control to the form as a child of the SSPanel by clicking the
  DBList button in the Toolbox and dragging the DBList on top of the SSPanel.

5. Click and select the SSPanel control, and change the AutoSize property to '3
  - AutoSize child sized to panel'. The DBList control will resize itself and
  then start flashing. The SSPanel control can be selected in the Properties
  window and its AutoSize property changed to any value outside of 3 to stop
  this behavior.
