SYMPTOMS
========

Unattended setup of network cards from the Drvlib directory of the Windows NT
compact discs requires that you copy the network adapter setup files to a
separate directory and specify the path to Oemsetup.inf in the unattended setup
answer file.

This article describes a method for including network cards from the Drvlib
directory in the Windows NT distribution files on a network share so that they
are part of the default available network adapters at setup time.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide problems
before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
modification of the Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file modifications at
your own risk.

In the following procedure, assume that drive D is the CD-ROM drive and drive X
is a network share from which you run unattended installations:

1. At a command prompt, type the following to copy the Windows NT distribution
  files to a network share:

  "copy d:\i386\*.* x:\ " (without the quotation marks)

2. At a command prompt, type the following commands to copy the network adapter
  related files:

  " d:
  cd \drvlib\netcard\x86\&lt;nicname&gt;
  copy *.* x:\
  x:
  cd \
  rename oemsetup.inf oemnadxx.inf " (without the quotation marks)

  Note that &lt;nicname&gt; is the name of the subdirectory of the Drvlib
  directory that matches the network adapter.

  Because all network adapter setup script files are called Oemnad*.inf, you
  need to choose a name Oemnadxx.inf that does not already exist in the Windows
  NT compact disc distribution files (for example, Oemnad3c.inf for a 3Com
  adapter).

  Oemnadxx.inf will refer to this file and xx.sys will refer to the driver file
  name.

3. During the first phase of unattended setup, all system files are temporarily
  copied to C:\$Win_nt$.~LS and C:\$Win_nt$.~BT. Dosnet.inf describes the files
  that have to be copied. You must modify Dosnet.inf so that all the necessary
  files are included.

  Edit X:\Dosnet.inf at the end of the [Files] section, and add one line for the
  INF file and one line per existing file under
  Drvlib\netcard\x86\&lt;nicname&gt;

     d1,OEMNADxx.INF
     d1,&lt;nicdrv&gt;.SYS        &lt;replace with the proper file name&gt;
     d1,file1

  and so on for all other existing files under the subdirectory described above.

4. Txtsetup.sif is used during the text mode phase of the unattended setup. It
  tells the setup process which files have to be copied to the hard disk. You
  must modify the Txtsetup.sif file: at the end of the [Files] section, add the
  following line for the setup information file:

  Oemnadxx.inf = dx,d7,,2,0,0

  Add a line for the network adapter driver so that it will be copied to
  System32\drivers directory:

  xxDRV.sys = dx,d19,,4,1

  For all other files xx.xxx in the Drvlib\Netcard\x86\&lt;nicname&gt;
  directory, add a line:

  xx.xxx = dx,d4,,2,0,0

  These files will be copied to the System32 directory.

5. Oemnadzz.inf is a global setup script file that includes the definition of
  all network adapters from Drvlib directory. Because you want to use the
  OemnadXX.inf file that was copied on the flat distribution files, not the
  Oemsetup.inf file from Drvlib\netcard directory, the matching option in
  Oemnadzz.inf must be disabled. To do this, run the following batch commands
  at the command prompt:

  x:
  cd \
  attrib -r oemnadzz.in_
  expand -r oemnadzz.in_
  del oemnadzz.in_

  Edit Oemnadzz.inf and comment out all lines including a network adapter option
  defined in the Oemsetup.inf [Options] section. To comment a line, place a
  semicolon (;) in front of it.

  For example, 3C595 and 3C590 are the options to disable for the 3Com PCI
  adapter defined in the Drvlib\Netcard\x86\el59x directory.

6. The Oemsetup.inf setup script files in the Drvlib directory do not support
  the unattended setup mode. During an unattended setup, the global variable
  !STF_GUI_UNATTENDED is set to yes and setup script files test its value to
  determine whether the network adapter information has to be retrieved from
  Unattend.txt.

  To prevent user interaction during Setup, modify the OemnadXX.inf file. For
  additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q143134
  TITLE : OEMSETUP.INF Modifications for Automated Windows NT Setup

7. The unattended setup answer file (Unattend.txt) includes a line to refer to
  the right network adapter option:

  [NetworkAdapterData]
  !AutoNetOption = "&lt;OEMNIC&gt;"

  You can also use the [AdapterParameters] section if you follow the
  instructions provided in the Knowledge Base article referenced in step 6.

  You are now able to run X:\Winnt32 /U:X:\Unattend.txt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The unattended setup answer file (Unattend.txt) includes a section for the
network adapter information. (Please refer to the default Unattend.txt file for
more details.)

To install a network adapter from the Drvlib directory, you must copy all the
related network adapter files from the Drvlib directory to a directory C:\Oem.
Then Unattend.txt includes a section similar to the following:

  [NetworkAdapterData]
  !AutoNetOption = "&lt;OEMNIC&gt;"
  !OEMNetOption = YES
  !OEMNetDrive = C:\OEM\
  !OEMNetInfFile = C:\OEM\oemsetup.inf
