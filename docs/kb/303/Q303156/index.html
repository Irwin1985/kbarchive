SYMPTOMS
========

When connections over a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
protocol-based network do not work, the message transfer agent (MTA), or
Emsmta.exe, may generate error messages in the Application event log that are
similar to the following:

  Event ID: 9322
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Description: An interface error has occurred. An MtaBindBack over RPC has
  failed. Locality Table (LTAB) index: %1, NT/MTA error code:1722. Comms error
  %3, Bind error %4,Remote Server Name %5, Protocol String &lt;IP Address of
  Server&gt;.

  Event ID: 9318
  Source: MSExchangeMTA - Interface
  Description: An RPC communications error occurred. Unable to bind over RPC.
  Locality Table (LTAB) index: 151, NT/MTA error code: 1722. Comms error 1722,
  Bind error 1722, Remote Server Name SERVERNAME [MAIN BASE 1 500 %10] (14)

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MTA uses remote procedure call (RPC), a synchronous socket protocol for
intrasite and site connections. The methodology that provides the bind and bind
back changes in the post-Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3) build 2651.75;
the Exchange Server 5.5 SP3 build of the MTA is 2650.24. In particular, build
2651.75 or later of the MTA requires fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
resolution for normal operation, which is accomplished with Domain Name System
(DNS) or HOSTS files.

Each Exchange Server computer must have a valid host (A) record in either a DNS
or a HOSTS file with the FQDN of each Exchange Server to which the Exchange
Server computer connects added to the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\Etc folder.
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4 (SP4) and Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server
require that the TCP/IP protocol be installed on the server.

Consider a two-server scenario in which one server, ServerA, is multihomed. It is
important to note that a multihomed server (a server with multiple network
interfaces such as a network interface card [NIC], a MODEM card, or an
Integrated Services Digital Network [ISDN] card) causes bind back errors on the
server that is hosting the adjacent MTA, yet mail flow is not interrupted. This
behavior is expected because ServerA's MTA successfully binds to ServerB on the
network segment that is common to both the servers. While SeverA binds to
ServerB, passing each available bind string in sequence, ServerB logs a bind
back failure for each bind that passes a string that ServerB cannot resolve.

Consider two servers, each with multiple network interfaces. Only one network,
Net3, is common to the servers. Both servers have different names on each
network:

- ServerA:

   - ServerA.Net1.&lt;Company&gt;.com

   - ServerA.Net2.&lt;Company&gt;.com

   - ServerA.Netn.&lt;Company&gt;.com

- ServerB:

   - ServerB.Net1.&lt;Company&gt;.com

   - ServerB.Net2.&lt;Company&gt;.com

   - ServerB.Netn.&lt;Company&gt;.com

ServerA binds to ServerB by using the first TCP transport stack that is
available, and then passes the associated string,
TCP:ServerA.Net1.&lt;Company&gt;.com as the bind back string. ServerB attempts
to bind back to ServerA using the following string:

  TCP:ServerA.Net1.&lt;Company&gt;.com

ServerB fails. ServerA recognizes the failure and binds to ServerB with the next
available transport stack by using the following new string:

  TCP:ServerA.Net2.&lt;Company&gt;.com

ServerB attempts to bind back to ServerA by using the following new string:

  TCP:ServerA.Net2.&lt;Company&gt;.com

ServerB fails. ServerA recognizes the failure and binds to ServerB with the next
available transport stack by using the following new string:

  TCP:ServerA.Net3.&lt;Company&gt;.com

ServerB attempts to bind back to ServerA by using the following new string and
succeeds:

  TCP:ServerA.Net3.&lt;Company&gt;.com

A standard MTA session ensues and mail is transferred between the servers.
ServerB logs two bind back failures, but mail transfer is not affected. The
process is reversed for ServerB. A server continues to try all of the available
networks until a success on one network, or until all connections fail.
