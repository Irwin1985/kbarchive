MORE INFORMATION
================

Lab Manual, page iii: Incorrect Number of Core Elective Exams
-------------------------------------------------------------

On page iii, in the third paragraph,

Change:
"The new certification program is composed of four core requirement exams and
three core elective exams."

To:
"The new certification program is composed of four core requirement exams and
four core elective exams."


Page xxiv: Incorrect Hardware Requirements
------------------------------------------

On page xxiv, under Hardware Requirements,

Change:
"32-bit 166MHz Pentium processor
64-MB memory for networking with one to five client computers; 128 MB minimum is
recommended for most network environments"

To:
"133 MHz or higher Pentium-compatible CPU
256 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum; 128 MB minimum supported"


Page 30: Incorrect Information About Host Name And Computer (NetBIOS) Name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 30, in the second Note section,

Change:
"The host name does not have to be the same as the computer name, NetBIOS, or any
other naming protocol."

To:
"The host name is always the same as the computer (NetBIOS) name. In Windows
2000, you cannot specify different host (Directory Naming Service, or DNS) and
computer (NetBIOS) names."


Page 61: Incorrect Weighted Total
---------------------------------

On page 61, in Table 2.1, change:

"Maximum: 35"

To:

"Maximum: 25"


Page 80: NT DNS Does Not Meet Active Directory DNS Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------

On page 80, in the paragraph above the Note section, in the last sentence,
change:

"If you organization is currently running Windows NT 4 DNS, your DNS service is
also compatible with Active Directory DNS requirements."

To:

"If you organization is currently running Windows NT 4 DNS, your DNS service is
not compatible with Active Directory DNS requirements."


Page 146: "Domains" Should Be "Trees"
-------------------------------------

On page 146, in the first paragraph under "Implications of Using Multiple
Trees",

Change:
"When determining whether to define multiple domains"

To:
"When determining whether to define multiple trees"


Page 195: Correction To Point 3
-------------------------------

On page 195, in point 3, change:

"3. If the OU is allowed to set its own membership, place the administrator group
inside the OU. If the OU is not allowed to set its own membership, place the
administrator group outside the OU."

To:

"3. If the administrator group is allowed to set its own membership, place the
administrator group inside the OU. If the administrator group is not allowed to
set its own membership, place it outside the OU."


Page 201:  Publish Should Be Assign
-----------------------------------

On page 201, Change:

"..and another group policy to publish software on management workstations"

To:

"..and another group policy to assign software on management workstations"


Page 202: Incorrect Caption In Figure 5.11
------------------------------------------

On page 202, in Figure 5.11, change:
"OUs defined to hide objects"

To:
"OUs defined to implement Group Policy"


Page 221: Incorrect Domain Local Group Membership In Figure 5.9
---------------------------------------------------------------

On page 221, in Table 5.9, groups with both read-only access and full access
needs to the Customer database and Tracking database (as defined in Table 5.8)
are being incorrectly made members of the same domain local groups:
"CustDatabase" and "TrackDatabase".

Only global groups that share the same access needs should be made members of the
same domain local group to ensure proper access permission assignment. There
should be separate domain local groups created for different access needs.

Change:
"CustDatabase - Security, domain local - Domestic Dispatchers, International
Dispatchers, Managers, Delivery Representatives

TrackDatabase - Security, domain local - Distribution Trackers, Managers,
Distribution Handlers"

To:
"CustDatabase - Security, domain local - Domestic Dispatchers, International
Dispatchers, Managers

CustDatabase2 - Security, domain local - Delivery Representatives

TrackDatabase - Security, domain local - Distribution Trackers, Managers

TrackDatabase2 - Security, domain local - Distribution Handlers"


Page 253: "Pull" Should Be "Push" For Intrasite Replication In Table 6.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 253, in Table 6.2, in the "Instrasite replication" - "Replication model"
cell, "pull" should be "push".

Change:
"To reduce replication latency, replication partners notify each other when
changes need to be replicated and then pull the information for processing."

To:
"To reduce replication latency, replication partners notify each other when
changes need to be replicated and then push the information for processing."


Page 306: Incorrect Child Domain Names In Figure 7.6
----------------------------------------------------

On page 306, in Figure 7.6,

Change:
"london.microsoft.com, chicago.microsoft.com, redmond.microsoft.com"

To:
"london.sales.microsoft.com, chicago.sales.microsoft.com,
redmond.development.microsoft.com"


Page 346: Incorrect Subdomain Names In Diagram
----------------------------------------------

On page 346, in the diagram, the subdomain names listed are incorrect.

Change:
au.a-100times.com
asia.a-100times.com
na.a-100times.com
sa.a-100times.com
africa.a-100times.com
euro.a-100times.com
th.a-100times.com
br.a-100times.com

To:
au.corp.a-100times.com
asia.corp.a-100times.com
na.corp.a-100times.com
sa.corp.a-100times.com
africa.corp.a-100times.com
euro.corp.a-100times.com
th.asia.corp.a-100times.com
br.sa.corp.a-100times.com"


Page 363: Incorrect Information About Schema Master And Domain Naming Master
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 363, the diagram lists multiple schema masters (SM) and domain naming
masters (DN) in different domains. This is incorrect. At any time, there can be
only one schema master and one domain naming master in the forest.

In the diagram, please remove all the SMs and DNs, except for the SM and DN at
hq.corp.f-1000times.com.

And in the last bulleted item on the same page:

Change:
"... the forest-wide roles were assigned to DC1s."

To:
"... the forest-wide roles were assigned to DC1 at hq.corp.f-1000times.com."
