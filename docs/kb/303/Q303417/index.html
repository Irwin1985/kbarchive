-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If multiple files with the same file name are found during a software inventory
scan, these files are not necessarily treated as unique. Because of this, only a
single instance of the file is reported with a creation date that corresponds to
the last file found during the scan. This problem was initially reported and
resolved prior to Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2). The
fix was included with the client hotfix bundle for SMS 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1)
as described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q238762 SMS: Software Inventory Creation Date Is Incorrect in SMS Database

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the fix for this issue was deployed, reports of using this fix in
production indicated scalability concerns because of the software inventory
database table growing excessively large. The problems that were created by the
software inventory table growing to excessive size included delays in loading
software inventory, delays processing software inventory queries, and so on.

Because of scalability concerns, this fix was removed prior to the release of SMS
2.0 SP2. Because of this, for installations of SMS 2.0 SP2 or later (of those
installations that are still running SMS 2.0 SP1 but without the client hotfix
bundle installed), the misreporting of the file creation date for those files
with the same name is to be expected.
