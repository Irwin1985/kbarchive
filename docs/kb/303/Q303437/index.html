-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the security update that is referred to in Q259496 (MS00-024),
the SHGetFolderPath function in Shfolder.dll may not work correctly, and it may
generate "access denied" error messages when it is called by an account that is
not a member of the administrators group.

CAUSE
=====

Because of changes that are made by the security patch, the SHGetFolderPath
function does not work when it makes an Open/Write call to a key in the
registry. Because the function was unable to access this key by using write
access, an "access denied" error message is generated. When this happens, some
third-party programs may stop working.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or 6.0 service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date           Time    Version         Size    File name     Platform
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  July 11, 2001  02:42p  5.50.4719.1100  23,312  Shfolder.dll  Intel

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem has been resolved by changing the method in which the GetFolderPath
function accesses the registry key so no "access denied" error message is
generated.
