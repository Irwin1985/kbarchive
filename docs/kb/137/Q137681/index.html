-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, when you run a Visual FoxPro application's .exe file, the
application opens in a screen or window that is not maximized. This article
gives two methods you can use to change this behavior to force the application
to run maximized. You can do it by using a command in the main program or by
setting a property for the .exe file at the level of the operating system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using Commands in the Main Program
----------------------------------

To maximize the screen by using a command in the main program file, enter one of
the following two commands in the main program of the application:

     zoom window screen max

  -or-

     _screen.windowstate = 2

In the first case, the command treats the desktop screen like a window and
maximizes it the way it would any other window.

In the latter case, because the Visual FoxPro desktop screen (_screen) is itself
created as an object, you can manipulate its properties. The command resets the
screen's WindowState property, which controls whether the screen (or window) is
run as normal (0), minimized (1), or maximized (2).

NOTE: these commands have no effect if issued from the Config.fpw file. They take
effect only if issued from the program's main program file. This means that the
desktop screen will always first appear as not maximized. The screen will then
be resized by whichever command is issued in the main program and the user will
see the resize taking place. These commands do not hide the resizing from the
user.

Using the Operating System
--------------------------

Alternatively, you can change the size of the opening screen at the Operating
system level. In Windows version 3.11 and Windows NT, in the program item
properties, you can specify that the .exe file be run minimized. This will hide
the screen from users when it first is run. Then you can use the zoom window
command or _screen.windowstate to maximize the screen. This may be most
effective on faster computers.

In Windows 95, you can create a shortcut for the .exe file, and set the run
property to maximized. To do this, create a shortcut, right-click the shortcut,
click Properties, click the Shortcut tab, and click Maximized. If you use this
alternative, you don't need to use a command in the main program to run the
application maximized.
