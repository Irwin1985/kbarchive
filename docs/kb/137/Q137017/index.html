The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows versions 4.0, 4.0a

SUMMARY
=======

Several types of files make up your Visual Basic application; some need to be
controlled, and some don't. Keep the following in mind when you are deciding
which files to add to your source code controller (Visual SourceSafe):

- Custom files (files that you have customized for a particular application)
  should be added to your source code controller.

- Files that are "off the shelf" or that can be generated by using other files
  that are under source code control probably don't need to be controlled by
  your source code controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Project Files
-------------

The following file types make up your Visual Basic version 4.0 project and are
automatically pulled into your source code controller if you specify:

  .frm, .frx - form
  .bas       - visual module
  .cls       - class module (new in Visual Basic version 4.0)
  .vbp       - project make file (same as the .mak file in earlier
               versions)

When a form is first added to a project and saved, the .frm file is created. The
.frm file is a text file that contains the source code for the form along with
information about the positions and properties of the controls on that form.
Once any graphic controls (such as a picture box or grid) are added and the form
is saved, the .frx file is automatically created to hold the binary information
about the graphic controls. It is very important that both files are controlled
together -- checked out and in together -- even though the .frm file is text and
the .frx file is binary.

The following additional file types may also be a part of your Visual Basic
version 4.0 project. You should add these files manually to SourceSafe so they
can be controlled, especially if they are customized:

  .ini       - initialization file (for 16-bit applications only)
  .bmp, .ico, .rle, .wmf, .emf, .dib - graphics

The following file types are not automatically pulled into your source code
controller. You can add these files to SourceSafe, but it is not necessary.

  .exe       - application executable
  .dll       - application dynamic link library
  .res       -

You should only store copies of these binary files in SourceSafe if you do not
have the source code for them. For example, if your project calls a
third-party-compiled dll, store the dll in SourceSafe. If your project builds a
dll, do not store the dll in SourceSafe, just the files necessary to build it.

Database and Other Data Files
-----------------------------

In general, you should not store data files in SourceSafe. If you do, these
should be only small data files used for testing your application, not live data
files.

The following are additional file types that may be a part of your Visual Basic
version 4.0 project. These files can be added to SourceSafe and controlled if
you choose:

  .mdb       - Microsoft Access database
  .dbf, .ndx, .mdx - dBASE table and index files
  .dat, .ddf - Btrieve database and index
  .dbf, .dbc, .cdx, .idx - FoxPro free table, database container, and
                           index files
  .dat       - data file created for your application
  .txt       - text file created for your application
  .xls       - Microsoft Excel file created for your application

Custom Control and Registry Files
---------------------------------

The following additional file types may be a part of your Visual Basic version
4.0 project. These files need to be added to SourceSafe if they have been
customized:

  .vbr       - the registry file
  .tlb, .olb - type library
  .vbx       - custom control file for 16-bit applications only
  .ocx       - custom control file for both 16- and 32-bit applications
  .dll       - dependency file (listed in Swdepend.ini).
