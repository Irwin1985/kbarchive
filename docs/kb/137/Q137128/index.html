Common Solutions To Making Sounds Play:  Midi Audio
===================================================

Midi Audio Does Not Play in Windows or a Windows Program

When a program that supports MIDI doesn't play the MIDI audio, it is
commonly due to one or more of the following reasons:

- The audio card is not installed properly, does not support MIDI, or
  is conflicting with another Windows device.

- A MIDI driver is not installed or is improperly configured.

- The MIDI Mapper is improperly configured.

NOTE: Before attempting any complicated troubleshooting, try
restarting Windows or rebooting your computer and see if your system
functions correctly.

MIDI Troubleshooting with Media Player
======================================

Window 3.x and Windows 95
-------------------------

Media Player is a program that can play MIDI files. It is normally
located in the Accessories group in the Program Manager or Programs
group. It allows you to check the MIDI installation in a simple way.
After using the File Open command to load a .MID file into Media
Player (there should be some .MID files in the Windows directory),
press the Play button. The following message may occur:

  "The current MIDI Mapper setup refers to a MIDI device that is not
  installed on the system. Use MIDI Mapper to edit the setup."

If this message appears, then your MIDI Mapper is not configured
properly. The first thing to do in this case is to check to see if
your MIDI Mapper configuration was changed.

1. Look for a file called MIDIMAP.OLD in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory. If this file exists, it means that your original MIDI
Mapper configuration file was replaced.

2. If you see a MIDIMAP.OLD, then rename MIDIMAP.CFG to MIDIMAP.BAK.

3. Now rename MIDIMAP.OLD to MIDIMAP.CFG.

4. Try playing a MIDI file in Media Player.

In Windows 3.x if this procedure fails or is inapplicable, run Control
Panel (usually in the Main group of the Windows Program Manager) and
check the setup in the MIDI Mapper.

In Windows 95, run Control Panel, select Multimedia, then choose the
Advanced tab. Check what MIDI device is installed and compare it to
what is selected as Single Instrument in the MIDI tab. If the Single
Instrument selected is different, then choose custom configuration and
set it up to the appropriate driver from the advanced tab for each
instrument.

For example, if the Ad Lib driver is installed in the Drivers part of
the Control Panel, the MIDI Mapper should be set for Ad Lib. If a
different MIDI device is installed, choose an appropriate setup for
the device. For more information on setting up the MIDI device
drivers, look in the manuals that came with your audio card.

Make Sure That The Midi Driver Is Installed
===========================================

Windows 3.x
-----------

Check to see if the MIDI driver is installed by double-clicking the
Drivers icon in the Control Panel. If the sound card is Ad Lib
compatible, try using the Ad Lib driver that shipped with Windows 3.1.

The Midi Sequencer command should be available in the Media Player's
Device menu.

Windows 95
----------

Check to see if the MIDI driver is installed by entering the
Multimedia section of Control Panel. In here click on the advanced tab
and select MIDI devices and instruments. If there are no MIDI drivers
listed, install the appropriate driver that audio card manufacturer
suggests.

6. CD-ROM Problems

Common Solutions for Problems with CD-ROM Drives

NOTE:  Do not remove the encyclopedia compact disc from your CD-ROM
drive while running Encarta Encyclopedia.

If the encyclopedia cannot find the data files it needs to run, you
will see an error message prompting you to correct the problem.

To find the source of the problem

1. Make sure the encyclopedia compact disc is correctly inserted into
the CD-ROM drive.

2. Make sure that the drive is connected to your computer correctly
and is functioning in MS-DOS. If you have an external CD-ROM drive,
make sure the power is turned on. You can test the function at an MS-
DOS prompt by viewing a directory of the drive at an MS-DOS prompt.
To do this, change to the CD-ROM drive at an MS-DOS prompt, type DIR,
then press ENTER.

3. In Windows 3.x make sure that the Encarta Encyclopedia program is
looking for the compact disc on the correct drive. Check that the
ENCARTA.INI file is in the Windows directory. The section called
[96Options] should have an entry called "BookPath." The path should be
set to the ENCYC96\ directory on the drive that your CD-ROM appears
as. For example, if your CD-ROM drive is drive D, the entry would
appear like the following:

  [96Options]
  BookPath=D:\encyc96\ 

If you still see an error message after checking the points above,
check the manuals that came with your CD-ROM drive for information on
how a CD-ROM is to be set up, or contact the company that supplied the
drive.

In Windows 95 you can check for conflicts with your CD-ROM by clicking
on the My Computer icon with the right mouse button and selecting
properties. On the System Properties screen select the Device Manager
tab and look for the CD-ROM in the list. If it appears with an
exclamation point to the right of it, there is a conflict with the
hardware setup, and you should check the manuals that came with your
CD-ROM drive for information on how a CD-ROM is to be set up, or
contact the company that supplied the drive.

7. Word Processors and Encarta 96 Encyclopedia

Tips And Troubleshooting
------------------------

Encarta Encyclopedia allows you to create multimedia reports by
copying and pasting pictures and sounds into Microsoft Write or your
word processor of choice. Audio clips can be pasted as icons into
other applications. Double-clicking these icons will play the audio
clip. Photos, illustrations, and maps can be pasted into other
applications also.

Note that some applications will use black or white "placeholders" for
pictures when they are pasted into that application. This is to
improve performance, since actual pictures in word processing
documents can slow down scrolling and other functions. The pictures
should appear properly when you print a document that has been using
placeholders for pictures.

Remember that anything that you copy into another application should
be accredited with a footnote or acknowledgment. See the encyclopedia
documentation for details.  Please obey copyright laws.

Selecting a Word Processor to Access from Encarta Encyclopedia
--------------------------------------------------------------

By clicking the Settings command from the Information menu, you can
use the Choose Word Processor button to select any Windows application
as the word processor that you will call up with the encyclopedia's
Word Processor menu item.

Troubleshooting Word Processor problems
---------------------------------------

A few tips will help you use the encyclopedia's Word Processor tool:

- Once you open your application with the Word Processor menu item,
  you can use this menu command to bring the Word Processor back
  after you have minimized it. This makes research and report writing
  more convenient.

- If you encounter problems bringing your word processor back up with
  the Encarta Encyclopedia Word Processor command, you can use
  several methods to switch to your word processor. In each case,
  make sure your word processor is open before using the Task List.

- Hold down the ALT key, and press TAB repeatedly. This will cycle
  each open Windows application to the foreground in order. When you
  see the application you want, let go of the ALT key, and that
  application will appear.

- You will get an Error Message from the encyclopedia Word Processor
  command if you select a word processor and then delete that word
  processor from your hard disk, or if the encyclopedia cannot find a
  valid Windows application from your selection. In this case, you
 must choose a new word processor using Options before the Word
 Processor command will work for you.

- You may have trouble pasting text into some word processors. If so,
  try using the Paste Special command and selecting unformatted text.

8. Mouse Cursor Problem

If you find that the mouse cursor jumps around on the screen when you
perform certain actions in the encyclopedia, and you are using
Microsoft Intellipoint mouse software, you need to turn off the "snap-
to" option. Open the Control Panel, usually found in the Main group in
Program Manager, and select the Mouse option. Turn off the snap-to
option in the Mouse Manager dialog and close the Mouse Manager and the
Control Panel.
