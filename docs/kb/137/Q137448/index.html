SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes it is useful to have report output directed to a file first and
printed at a later time. When this is done, the printer commands are embedded in
the text of the file at the time the report is executed. This file can then be
printed directly from Visual FoxPro to either PCL or PostScript printers.

This can be done at the time a report is created (design mode or from the Report
Wizard) or after the report is saved (programatically or from the Print dialog
box). There are only a few steps to print to a file, and the steps are similar
under the Windows, Windows 95, and Windows NT operating systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

Follow your Windows User's guide to install any new printers. Once a printer is
installed, create a new printer of the same type, and connect it to the File:
port. Set this printer up to be the default printer. As your default printer,
any new reports will be printed directly to a file along with any
printer-specific language. You can create a report with the Report Wizard or the
Report Designer.

When you save a report, the printer driver and printer output device information
are stored in the internal structure of the report. When a report is saved and
the output device is File:, the printer driver and printer output device
settings are saved with the report. So each time a report is printed, the user
is be prompted for a file name and the report is printed to a file.

To print the files, first check that the destination printer is the same as the
printer used during report creation. Then from the Print Setup dialog box,
verify that the default printer is now connected to a real printer port such as
LPT1. Next, issue the print command or click Print on the File menu.

In the Type list, click ASCII File. You receive a warning that the file will be
sent directly to the printer and should have all printer-specific language in
the file. Enter the file name, and click OK. The file will be sent to the
printer and printed exactly the as if the report had been sent directly to the
printer.
