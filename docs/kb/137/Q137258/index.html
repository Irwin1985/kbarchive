The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
- Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the steps required to set up Creative Writer or Fine
Artist to run from a network file server. The benefit of this type of setup is
that multiple users can save their documents to the server. In addition,
multiple users can gain access to the CD-ROM version of the product at the same
time. (Note that only versions 1.1 and 1.1a are provided on CD-ROM).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To Install Creative Writer and Fine Artist on the Server
--------------------------------------------------------

1. From any computer on the network, connect to the folder on the file server
  where you want to install Creative Writer or Fine Artist. Make sure it has a
  drive letter assigned to it. This folder is the default location for storing
  documents created in Creative Writer and Fine Artist.

2. If you are installing version 1.1 or 1.1a, make sure that the CD-ROM drive is
  shared on the network and that it is also accessible from the individual
  workstations.

3. Connect to the shared CD-ROM drive and make sure it has a drive letter
  assigned to it.

4. Run Creative Writer or Fine Artist Setup. In the first screen in the Setup
  program, click Next. In the second screen, click Network or File Server.

5. In the list of drives, select the appropriate drive for the file server.

6. Click Next and wait for the puzzle to complete. Then, click either Done or
  Quit.

To Install Creative Writer or Fine Artist on Each Individual Workstation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. From the workstation, connect to the shared MSKids folder (and shared CD-ROM
  drive if you are using version 1.1 or 1.1a) on the file server and assign a
  drive letter to each shared resource.

2. Run Netsetup.exe, Maxsetup.exe, or Magsetup.exe, depending upon which product
  you are installing from the MSKids folder.

3. Click Next. Wait for the puzzle to complete, and then click Done.

4. Whenever you want to run the program, make sure the drive letters and
  connections are the same as when you first ran Setup.

  NOTE: If your network connections change, repeat steps 1-3.

5. Repeat steps 1-4 on each of the workstations from which you want to run the
  program.

NOTE: In Microsoft Windows 95/98, you may not need to assign the network drives a
letter. However, if you have problems after you attempt to start one of the
programs, you may try assigning a letter to the drives and following the
previous steps again.
