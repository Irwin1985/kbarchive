-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the viruses that have been detected on hardware after
unsuccessful attempts to install Visual FoxPro. After these viruses were
detected and cleaned from the hard disk, no further problems were encountered
during installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is important that computer hardware be checked frequently by a virus
detection and cleaning utility. Because the number and signatures of viruses are
always changing, so are the utilities that can successfully detect and clean
them. Microsoft recommends that you consult your local software retailer for
information on the latest and best anti-virus utilities.

Preliminary Trouble-Shooting Steps
----------------------------------

1. Perform a "clean boot." For information about how to perform a clean boot,
  please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q95314 How to Perform a "Clean Boot" for FoxPro

2. Ensure a Permanent Minimum Swap File Size of 10 meg (Windows 3.x).

3. Remark out any unnecessary drivers that are loading in Windows.

4. Use a plain VGA video driver.

5. Ensure that shell=Progman.EXE.

6. Ensure that the "load=" and "run=" lines of the Win.ini file are blank, or
  commented out.

7. Remove all programs from the Startup Group.

8. Perform a Scandisk (Chkdsk /f if not using MS-DOS version 6.0 or later).

9. Perform a Virus Scan with whatever software is available.
