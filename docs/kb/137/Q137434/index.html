The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When users of then same server-based Mandatory User Profile log on from various
different locations, different default printers may be selected at different
workstations.

A roving user of a Mandatory User Profile may see different printers selected as
the default printer as the user moves from workstation to workstation.

It can be difficult to predict exactly which printer will be selected as the
default.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by incorrect configuration of the server-based Mandatory User
Profile. Specifically, the default printer named in the profile is a printer set
up in Print Manager via "Create Printer" (as opposed to "Connect to Printer") on
the workstation where the profile administrator last edited the profile, but a
printer with this name has not been created on all the workstations where the
profile may be used.

If a user of the profile logs on at a workstation where the same printer name is
defined, that printer name is selected as the default printer as expected.
However, if a user of the profile logs on at a workstation where the same
printer name is NOT defined, another printer name is selected instead.

If different printer names are configured on different workstations, the printer
name selected as the default printer varies from workstation to workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the Mandatory User Profile to specify a default printer name that is set
up via Print Manager's "Create Printer" facility, and ensure that this printer
name is present on all workstations where the profile is used.

-or-

Modify the Mandatory User Profile to specify a default printer that is set up via
Print Manager's "Connect to Printer" facility. If you choose this option, bear
in mind that, for example, a connection to a printer in Seattle may not be very
useful when the user is in New York, and users of the profile will need to be
educated appropriately.

NOTE: Printer settings in a User Profile can be changed by logging on as a user
of the profile who is also an Administrator, making the required changes in
Print Manager and then using User Profile Editor to save the changes.

For more information on Print Manager, User Profile Editor, and setting up and
modifying Mandatory User Profiles, refer to the Concepts and Planning Guide and
the System Guide provided with Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1 and the
Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51.
