-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.52, 1.52b 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An override of CSocket::OnMessagePending is not called for an application that
has an active timer.

One symptom might be painting problems because the default implementation of
OnMessagePending is responsible for allowing the processing of WM_PAINT messages
during blocking CSocket operations.

CAUSE
=====

The function CSocket::PumpMessages is responsible for the message processing
during a blocking CSocket operation. It uses its own timer to enable idle-time
processing to occur periodically.

In this function, the processing of WM_TIMER messages occurs before the
processing of other messages, except for the socket notification messages
themselves. When a WM_TIMER message arrives for a different timer, the
PumpMessages function simply leaves it in the queue. The problem with this is
that when a WM_TIMER message is found, the processing of other messages does not
occur.

All messages are being retrieved using PeekMessage(), and because the
unidentified WM_TIMER message is not removed from the queue, it is the only
message, other than the socket messages, that are retrieved in subsequent calls
to PeekMessage.

Because OnMessagePending is only called for non-WM_TIMER messages, and because
the only message being retrieved by PeekMessage() IS a WM_TIMER message,
OnMessagePending won't be called for any messages after the first WM_TIMER
message is received.

RESOLUTION
==========

For 32-bit MFC (Included with Visual C++ 2.x)
---------------------------------------------

The resolution entails changing the PumpMessages function so that it always calls
OnMessagePending. Currently it only calls OnMessagePending when a non- WM_TIMER
message is received:

1. Override the PumpMessages function in your own CSocket-derived class. Borrow
  the implementation that already exists. It can be found in this file:
  \&lt;MSVC Directory&gt;\Mfc\Src\Sockcore.cpp

2. Replace the following code in your own PumpMessages implementation.

  Change this code:

        else if (::PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE) &amp;&amp;
                   OnMessagePending())
        {
            // allow user-interface updates

  to this code:

        if (::PeekMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE) &amp;&amp;
              OnMessagePending())
        {
            // allow user-interface updates

3. Include the header file &lt;afxpriv.h&gt; in your CSocket-derived class'
  implementation file.

4. There is reference to the DELETE_EXCEPTION macro in this function. The
  DELETE_EXCEPTION macro is used internally by MFC. Delete this line:

     DELETE_EXCEPTION(e);

For 16-bit MFC
--------------

The default implementation of PumpMessages (in Sockcore.cpp) accesses private MFC
data structures. Because of this, you cannot easily reimplement this code in
your application. It might be possible to temporarily remove the timer (set by
SetTimer) that is causing the problem, but if that is not the case, then the
simplest workaround would be to rebuild the MFC library with the change shown
above (changing the 'else if' to 'if').


Once the change has been made, you can rebuild the MFC libraries to incorporate
the change. For details on how to rebuild the MFC libraries, please see the
Readme.txt file in the Mfc\Src directory and Appendix A of the Class Library
User's Guide. Microsoft recommends building the static versions so that you do
not have to rely on the presence of your modified library. Otherwise, you will
need to rename MFC250(D).DLL so that it does not conflict with other versions of
the DLL that might be on a user's system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in the version of MFC that
ships with Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0.
