SUMMARY
=======

AutoClipArt is a Wizard in PowerPoint for Windows 95 that assists you by
suggesting clip art images that complement keywords found in your presentation.

When you run the Wizard, the words in your presentation are scanned and compared
to a preset list. When a match is found, that word's related clip art is
suggested.

The AutoClipArt list is stored in a binary format and cannot be edited.
