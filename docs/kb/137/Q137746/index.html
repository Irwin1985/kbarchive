INSTALLING PC CARD (PCMCIA) MODEMS
==================================

If you are using a PC card (PCMCIA) modem for your Dial-up Networking
connection to the Internet and have not yet installed the modem,
you may have to enable Windows 95 PC card socket support before
running the Internet Setup wizard.

To enable PCMCIA socket support:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
  Control Panel.

2. Double-click the PC Card (PCMCIA) icon to start the PC Card
  Wizard, and then follow the instructions on your screen.

  NOTE: If you can't find the PC Card icon, you may need to install
  the PC card (PCMCIA) drivers. To do this, double-click the
  Add New Hardware icon, click No, click PCMCIA Support from
  the list of hardware items, and then follow the instructions
  on your screen.

USING SERIAL LINE INTERNET PROTOCOL (SLIP) SUPPORT
==================================================

Setting Up A SLIP or CSLIP Connection
-------------------------------------

The Internet Jumpstart Kit supports three kinds of Dial-up Networking
connection protocols: point-to-point protocol (PPP), serial line
Internet protocol (SLIP), and compressed SLIP (CSLIP). The Internet
Setup wizard creates only PPP dial-up connections. If your Internet
service provider requires you to use a SLIP or CSLIP connection, do
the following:

1. Create the Dial-Up Networking connection by running the Internet
  Setup wizard while setting up Microsoft Plus!.

  You can also do this after setting up Microsoft Plus! by clicking
  the Start button, pointing to Programs, then pointing to
  Accessories, then pointing to Internet Tools, and then double-
  clicking Internet Setup Wizard.

  If your Internet service provider requires you to enter a sequence
  of commands to establish the SLIP or CSLIP connection, make sure
  the "Bring Up Terminal Window After Dialing" box is checked.

  TIP: You may also be able to use Dial-Up Scripting to automate
  entering the required sequence of commands. See "Using Scripting
  For Dial-Up Networking" below for more information.

2. Double-click the My Computer icon, and then double-click the
  Dial-Up Networking folder.

3. Click the connection you created in step 1, and then click
  Properties on the File menu.

4. Click Server Type, click either SLIP or CSLIP in the Type Of
  Dial-Up Server list, and then click OK.

Running the Internet Setup Wizard If You Have an Existing SLIP Connection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have set up an existing Internet Dial-Up Networking connection
to use SLIP as the server type and you run the Internet Setup Wizard,
the wizard will change the server type for the existing connection to
PPP.

To change the server type for the connection back to SLIP:

1. Double-click My Computer, and then double-click Dial-Up Networking.

2. Using the right mouse button, click the connection you want to
change, and then click Properties.

3. Click Server Type.

4. In the Type of Dial-Up Server list, click SLIP: UNIX Connection,
and then click OK.

5. In the Properties dialog box, click OK to save your changes.

MANUALLY LOGGING ONTO AN INTERNET CONNECTION
============================================

Some Internet service providers require you to manually log on in
order to establish an Internet connection. If you are running the
Internet Setup Wizard to create such a connection, make sure you
check the Bring Up Terminal Window After Dialing box.

You can also select this option after you have run the wizard by
doing the following:

1. Double-click My Computer, and then double-click Dial-Up Networking.

2. Using the right mouse button, click the connection you want to
change, and then click Properties.

3. Click Configure, and then click Options.

4. Make sure the Bring Up Terminal Window After Dialing box is
checked, and then click OK.

5. In the Properties dialog box, click OK to save your changes.

TIP: You can also use Scripting for Dial-Up Networking to automate
logging onto the Internet. For more information, see the following
topic.

USING SCRIPTING FOR DIAL-UP NETWORKING
======================================

You can use Scripting for Dial-Up Networking to automate the manual
steps required by certain Internet service providers to establish a
connection to the Internet. If your Internet service provider
recommends using an automated connection script, after running the
Internet Setup wizard, you can create a script file, and then Use the
Dial-Up Scripting Tool to associate this file with the Dial-Up
Networking connection you created.

For more information about creating a Dial-Up Networking script and
associating it with your Internet Dial-Up Networking connection:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Help.

2. Double-click the Microsoft Plus! For Windows 95 book.

3. Double-click the Using The Network And The Internet book, and
  then click Automating A Dial-Up Networking Connection.

4. Follow the instructions in the Help topic.

USING A LOCAL AREA NETWORK PROXY OR FIREWALL
============================================

If you want to use a proxy or firewall to protect your Local Area
Network from being accessed by other on the Internet, follow these
steps:

1. Run the Internet Setup wizard while setting up Microsoft Plus!.

  You can also run the wizard after setting up Microsoft Plus! by
  clicking the Start button, pointing to Programs, then pointing to
  Accessories, then pointing to Internet Tools, and then double-
  clicking Internet Setup Wizard.

2. Configure your computer to connect to the Internet by using TCP/IP
  on your local area network.

3. When asked for the gateway address, type the address supplied by
  your network administrator only if your organization uses gateways
  for routing information over the network.

  NOTE: The gateway computer is not the same as the proxy or firewall
  computer which protects your local area network from the Internet,
  so do not type your proxy or firewall address here.

4. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
  Panel.

3. Click the Internet icon, and then click the Advanced tab.

5. Make sure the Use Proxy Server box is checked.

6. Type the Http server address and the port number for the computer
  you want to use as the proxy server in the Proxy Server box. The
  following is an example of a proxy server address and port number:

  HTTP://MYPROXY.MYCOMPANY.COM:80

  In the Bypass Proxy On box, type the names of the computers,
  domains, and ports on the Internet that, when accessed, will
  not go through the proxy server. Separate each item you type
  with a comma.

  If you do not know what to type in the Proxy Server, or Bypass
  Proxy On boxes, see your network administrator. For Help on these
  items, click the ? in the title bar, and then click the item.

USING PROGRESSIVE NETWORKS' REALAUDIO SUPPORT
=============================================

The Internet Jumpstart Kit includes support for Progressive Networks'
RealAudio. This enables you to listen to audio files in real time over
a dial-up modem or direct-network Internet connection. To use
RealAudio, you must have a Windows 95-supported sound card installed
in your computer. RealAudio works best on 486/33 or faster processors.

To try RealAudio, connect to HTTP://WWW.REALAUDIO.COM.

NOTE: RealAudio will not work if your connection is routed through
a local area network proxy or firewall.

USING INTERNET EXPLORER WITH VIRTUAL MEMORY
===========================================

Internet Explorer requires you to use virtual memory. Otherwise,
Internet Explorer will not run properly. To make sure you are using
virtual memory:

1. Click the Start button, then point to Settings, and then click
  Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon, and then click the Performance tab.

3. Click the Virtual Memory button.

4. If you are specifying your own virtual memory settings, make
  sure the Disable Virtual Memory box is unchecked. If this box
  is checked, then you are not using virtual memory and Internet
  Explorer won't run.

  TIP: You can let Windows manage virtual memory for you by
  selecting the Let Windows Manage My Virtual Memory Settings option.
