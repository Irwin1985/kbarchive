SUMMARY
=======

This article is designed to help you properly set up and troubleshoot network
and serial communications between a PC and a Macintosh for file transfer and
debugging.

This article is divided into four sections:

1. Verify network communication parameters

2. Verify serial communication parameters

3. Troubleshoot file transfers

4. Troubleshoot remote debugging

MORE INFORMATION
================

SECTION 1: VERIFY NETWORK COMMUNICATION PARAMETERS
--------------------------------------------------

Verify the Physical Network Connection
--------------------------------------

What type of network cable are you using: ThinNet (coax cable that looks like
cable TV wire), ThickNet (fat cable with 15 pin connectors on the ends), or
Twisted Pair (looks like telephone wire)?

ThinNet and ThickNet are considered active networks and allow direct connections
between the two computers. Twisted Pair is a passive network and requires both
computers to be plugged into a net hub or similar device before the network
connection can be active between the two machines. Simply hooking up two
machines using Twisted-pair will not work unless one of the network cards is a
net hub or there is a net hub between the two network cards.

Verify the Macintosh Network Settings
-------------------------------------

1. Verify the Macintosh communications setup by clicking the Macintosh Control
  Panel on the Apple Menu (the Apple icon at the leftmost position of the menu
  bar). Verify these settings:

  a. Sharing Setup control panel

     Under Network Identity, type and note the Macintosh Name. Don't worry about
     the Macintosh Owner field; Visual C++ doesn't use it.

  b. Network control panel

     Ensure you are using EtherTalk. Note the Zone you are located in. If it
     says &lt; No zones available &gt;, you are in a peer-to-peer network and
     no zone is required.

  c. Visual C++ Debug Monitor control panel

     Make sure this and the other Visual C++ Macintosh components are installed.
     Ensure that Network (AppleTalk) is highlighted in the connection list.
     Click Settings; then type and note the debug password (Case sensitive).

2. Restart the Macintosh computer to ensure that the current network and debug
  settings are used.

3. Make sure the Visual C++ File Utility and WLM Debug Output are both up and
  running. You can check this by looking in the Application Menu. Click the
  icon that appears in the far right of the menu bar. This is similar to the
  Task List in Windows.

  NOTE: These can be made to start automatically when the computer starts by
  creating aliases to these two programs and moving the aliases to the System
  Folder:Startup Items: folder. To create an alias, click the program icon and
  then click Make Alias on the Finder File menu.

  You are now finished verifying the Macintosh communications setup

Verify the PC Network Settings
------------------------------

1. Ensure that Appletalk is installed and running under Windows NT. Check this
  by clicking the Networks icon in the Control Panel. If it isn't installed,
  click Add Protocol, and add AppleTalk.

2. Within the Visual C++ development environment, complete these steps:

  a. On the Project menu, click Settings, and then click the Debug tab.

     "Executable for Debug Session:"

     This is the location for the executable on the local Windows NT computer.
     Under a Debug build, it is usually here:

  &lt;project_dir&gt;\MacDebug\MyProgram.EXE

     For Release build, it is usually here:

  &lt;project_dir&gt;\MacRel\MyProgram.EXE

     "Remote Executable Path and File Name:"

     This is where you want the remote executable to be placed. Macintosh uses
     colons (:) as a separator between folders (analogous to directories on
     PCs). Unlike PCs, Macintosh hard drives are addressed by their full volume
     names as opposed to single hard drive letters. The proper format for
     specifying the full path on the Macintosh is:

  &lt;Macintosh HD name&gt;:&lt;Folder&gt;:&lt;Program Name&gt;

     So, to specify a filename "My MacProg" to be stored on a hard drive named
     "BobHD" in a folder (directory) named "Testing", you would enter:

  BobHD:Testing:My MacProg

  b. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Debug tab.

     1. Ensure that Remote Debugging is enabled.

     2. Click the Connection button.

         - Ensure that Platform: is set to Macintosh.

         - Ensure that Connection: is set to Network (AppleTalk).

         - Click Settings, and make sure Macintosh Name, Macintosh Zone, and
           Debug Monitor Password all match up with what is set on the
           Macintosh (see previous section). If there is no Zone, enter "*" as
           Macintosh Zone.

SECTION 2: VERIFY SERIAL COMMUNICATION PARAMETERS
-------------------------------------------------

Due to a bug with serial communications on the Visual C++ Cross-Development
Edition, the network Macintosh Name and Zone are required.

Ensure that you have the null modem cable properly connected between the two
computers. Also note which serial port you are using on both machines. For
Windows NT, it may be COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4. For Macintosh, it may be either
MODEM (phone handset symbol) or PRINTER (printer symbol).

Verify the Macintosh Serial Settings
------------------------------------

1. Verify the Macintosh serial settings by clicking the Macintosh Control Panel
  on the Apple Menu (the Apple icon at the leftmost position of the menu bar).
  Verify these settings:

  a. Sharing Setup control panel

     Under Network Identity, type and note the Macintosh Name. Don't worry about
     the Macintosh Owner field. Visual C++ doesn't use it.

  b. Network control panel

     Note the Zone in which you are located, even if it says &lt; No zones
     available &gt;.

  c. Visual C++ Debug Monitor control panel

     Make sure this and the other Visual C++ Macintosh components are installed.
     Ensure that Serial is highlighted in the connection list. Click Settings.
     Note the connection settings and make sure you are using the correct port
     the serial cable is attached to.

2. Restart the Macintosh to ensure the current serial and debug settings are
  used.

3. Make sure the Visual C++ File Utility and WLM Debug Output are both up and
  running. You can check this by looking in the Application Menu. Click the
  icon that appears in the far right of the menu bar. This is similar to the
  Task List in Windows.

  NOTE: These can be made to start automatically when the computer starts by
  creating aliases to these two programs and moving the aliases to the System
  Folder:Startup Items: folder. To create an alias, click the program icon and
  then click Make Alias on the Finder File menu.

  You are now finished verifying the Macintosh communications setup

Verify the PC Serial Settings
-----------------------------

Verify the PC serial settings within the Visual C++ development environment by
following these steps:

1. On the Project menu, click Settings, and click the Debug tab.

  Executable for Debug Session

  This is the location for the executable on the local Windows NT computer.
  Under a Debug build, it is usually here:

  &lt;project_dir&gt;\MacDebug\MyProgram.EXE

  For a Release build, it is usually here:

  &lt;project_dir&gt;\MacRel\MyProgram.EXE

  Remote Executable Path and File Name

  This is where you want the remote executable to be placed. Macintosh uses
  colons (:) as a separator between folders (analogous to directories on PCs).
  Unlike PCs, Macintosh hard drives are addressed by their names as opposed to
  single letters. The proper format for specifying the full path on the
  Macintosh is:

  &lt;Macintosh HD name&gt;:&lt;Folder&gt;:&lt;Program Name&gt;

  For example, to specify a filename "My MacProg" to be stored on a hard drive
  named "BobHD" in a folder (directory) named "Testing," you would enter this:

  BobHD:Testing:My MacProg

2. On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Debug tab.

  a. Ensure that Remote Debugging is enabled.

  b. Click the Connection button.

  c. Set Platform: to Macintosh.

  d. Set Connection: to Network (AppleTalk).

  e. Click Settings and make sure Macintosh Name and Macintosh Zone match up
     with what is set on the Macintosh. If there is no zone or Macintosh name,
     type anything for the Macintosh name and "*" as the Macintosh Zone.

  f. Leave the Debug Monitor Password blank, and click OK.

  g. Set Connection: to Serial, and click OK. You are now finished verifying
     the PC communications setup.

SECTION 3: TROUBLESHOOT FILE TRANSFERS (MFILE)
----------------------------------------------

MFILE is the utility that Visual C++ uses to transfer files between the PC and
the Macintosh. This is usually executed by: the build process, the "Update
Remote Output File" option under the Tools menu, or a command entered at the
command line.

1. Ensure that the communication settings are correct on both the Macintosh and
  the PC as documented in Section 1 or 2 of this article. Improper
  configuration and setup are the main causes of communication problems.

2. If you are using a serial connection:

  a. Exit Visual C++. Visual C++ takes over the serial port when it starts.
     This will prevent you from testing the serial connection.

  b. Try to use Terminal or a similar communications program to communicate to
     a communications program running on the Macintosh. This is all documented
     in the Macintosh Components Help file on the Macintosh in the Visual C++
     2.0 Folder. There is a help section called "Troubleshooting: Communication
     Problems" that explains this in more detail.

  c. Ensure that the Visual C++ File Utility is up and running. As noted in
     Section 2 of this article, you need to make sure the Macintosh Name and
     Zone are entered into the Network connections settings on the PC side.

3. If you are using a network connection:

  a. Ensure that the cables are connected properly. If you are on a network
     with other computers, check to see if you can "see" other computers or
     printers on the network.

  b. Ensure that the network protocols are installed and running on each of the
     computers.

  c. Go through Section 1 of this article, and verify that everything is is set
     correctly.

4. Ensure that the Macintosh has a name in the Sharing Setup applet in the
  Control Panel. Also make sure the name set in the Connection Settings on the
  PC matches. Check the Help file mentioned in Step 2 of this section for
  additional suggestions.

5. If you are receiving an MFILE error (MFxxxx), check to make sure the Visual
  C++ File Utility is actually running and that it is in the user's Startup
  Folder on the Macintosh. This error occurs when the Macintosh can't be found
  or the Visual C++ File Utility is not started.

6. If you are receiving one of the following errors, make sure the name of the
  remote output file is specified on the Debug tab reached by clicking Settings
  on the Project menu:

   - 

  MF4017 (no Mac specified for volume mount) or

   - 

  MF4007 (all source files must be on the Mac xxx is not)

  The typical cause of these errors is that the name of the remote output file
  is not entered correctly. Please refer to Section 1 or 2 of this article for
  a discussion of how it should be entered.

SECTION 4: TROUBLESHOOT REMOTE DEBUGGING PROBLEMS
-------------------------------------------------

Ensure the communication settings are correct on both the Macintosh and PC as
documented in Section 1 or 2 of this article. Improper configuration and setup
are the main causes of communication problems.

1. Check for conflicting INITs. INITs are like device drivers. They are in the
  System Folder in the Extensions Folder. There is already at least one known
  conflict with the Procomm SCSI drivers (see the release notes). Remove any
  unnecessary INITs.

2. Try to run the application standalone. Just like the Intel debugger, a very
  unstable application can cause unusual behavior in the debugger.

3. Try building and debugging one of the sample applications such as HELLO. If
  you can debug the sample application, there may simply be a problem with your
  application binary itself.

4. Restart the Macintosh. Sometimes the Macintosh may have been in an unstable
  state that prevented proper debugging to occur.

5. Try switching the connection from Serial to Network or vice-versa. This will
  require use of a Null-modem cable for a serial connection. It may be just the
  physical connection or driver problem.

6. If you are using a Macintosh with a 680x0 processor, check the Memory Control
  Panel. In one unconfirmed case, 32-bit addressing being off caused a debugger
  failure.

7. If possible, try accessing another Macintosh. If this works, you may have a
  configuration problem with the Macintosh or a conflict with at least one of
  the INITs installed.
