SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the three parts of the following error message:

  Invalid VxD dynamic link call from &lt;Part 1&gt; to device &lt;Part 2&gt;,
  service &lt;Part 3&gt;

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, an Invalid Dynamic Link Call error message is the result of an
incompatibility between driver versions, or a damaged or missing driver. Try
uninstalling and then reinstalling any programs or components that you installed
recently (before the error message occurred).

The error message stated above may occur because your computer is configured
incorrectly. This may be due to a device driver that was added or removed
recently.

Part 1
------

- Part 1 may be divided into an encoded device name, object number, and offset,
  such as "VMM(0A) + 0000001C." This example means the problem was detected in
  the VMM virtual device driver, in object 0A, at offset 0000001C.


- If Part 1 is an eight-character sequence of letters and numbers, such as
  "C13A1EC6," a device driver jumped to an invalid location. The identity of
  the driver could not be determined.

  If this is the case, restart your computer in Safe mode by pressing the F8 key
  when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, then choosing Safe Mode from
  the Windows 95 Startup menu. If the error message does not reoccur, the
  problem may be caused by one of the installed device drivers. For information
  about how to create a new System.ini file without third-party drivers, see
  the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140441 Creating a New System.ini File Without Third-Party Drivers

Part 2
------

- If Part 2 is the name of a device (such as VMD), the named device driver
  should be upgraded to a Windows 95-compatible version.

  When this type of error occurs, it means Part 1 requested that Part 2 perform
  an operation that Part 2 does not support. This typically means that there is
  a version mismatch between the two drivers.

  If this is the case, make certain Part 1 and Part 2 are compatible. If the
  driver identified in Part 2 is provided with Windows 95, make sure the driver
  identified in Part 1 is designed for Windows 95.


  The driver identified in Part 2 may not be compatible with Windows 95
  because a newly installed program may have replaced the Windows 95
  standard driver with a customized driver. This is typically the case
  for device drivers marked with an exclamation point in the table below.

- If Part 2 is a four-character sequence of letters and numbers, such as
  "0418," a device driver required by the system could not be found. See the
  below table for a list of commonly encountered device drivers and their
  identification numbers.

  If this is the case, install the missing driver or remove the driver
  identified in Part 1 that requires it.

Part 3
------

Part 3 provides the service ordinal (for example, it identifies which service
from Part 2 was requested but could not be satisfied).

If the service number is unusually large (for example, the first two digits are
not both zero), the problem may be that Part 1 is damaged. However, service
numbers as large as 0191 are not unusual if the device driver identified in Part
2 is VMM.

If Part 3 is unusually large, reinstall the driver identified in Part 1.
Remember, Part 1 may contain a device name, an object number, and an offset.

How to Determine a Device Driver's Source
-----------------------------------------

1. The device driver name may suggest the name of the program that installed it.
  For example, CCVKD is the virtual keyboard device driver installed by Carbon
  Copy. Virtual devices often begin with the letter "V" and end in the letter
  "D." For example, VNAVD is the Norton Anti- Virus device driver.

  If you are successful in identifying the source of the driver, remove the
  corresponding program.

2. The device driver name may begin with the letters "NW," suggesting that it
  may be a Novell NetWare networking driver. Other clues that may identify a
  driver as network-related are the presence of the letters "NDIS," "NET," or
  "SERVER."

3. If you are unable to identify the program or component that installed the
  driver, search the [386Enh] section of the System.ini file for a line with
  the following form

     Device=&lt;DeviceName&gt;.386

  where &lt;DeviceName&gt; is the name of the device driver, possibly with a
  path, or possibly with a slightly modified name. For example:

     Device=ccvkd.386

4. If the driver that needs to be replaced is one of the Windows 95 standard
  drivers, run Windows 95 Setup again, and choose to verify the installation.

The following table lists virtual device drivers you may encounter.


Legend:

# - Indicates a standard Windows 95 driver.

! - Indicates a standard Windows 95 driver that may have been replaced by a
third-party product.

$ - Indicates a driver provided by a third-party manufacturer.

3.0 - Indicates a driver from Windows 3.0.

3.1, 3.11 - Indicates device drivers that have been superseded by drivers in
Windows 95.
