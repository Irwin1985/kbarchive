SYMPTOMS
========

After you add a new set of personal folders to your active profile in Microsoft
Exchange, you can configure Microsoft Exchange so that new mail is delivered to
the new set of personal folders. When you do so, Inbox, Outbox, and Sent Items
folders are created in addition to the existing Deleted Items folder.

If you then configure Microsoft Exchange so that new mail is delivered to a
different set of personal folders, the Inbox, Outbox, and Sent Items folders are
not removed from the personal folders that new mail was previously delivered to.
If you attempt to delete these three folders or the Deleted Items folder, the
following error message is displayed:

  An object could not be deleted. You cannot delete the Inbox, Outbox, Deleted
  Items, or Sent Items folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the Inbox, Outbox, and Sent Items folders from a set of personal
folders, you must remove the set of personal folders and then add it back again.
If the set of personal folders contains messages that you want to keep, move
those messages to a different folder, remove the set of personal folders and add
it back again, and then move the messages back to their original location.

To remove a set of personal folders and then add it back again, follow these
steps:

1. Double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop to start Microsoft Exchange.

2. On the Tools menu, click Services.

3. Click the set of personal folders that you want to remove, and then click
  Remove.

4. Click Add.

5. Click Personal Folders, and then click OK.

6. Type a filename for the new personal folders file in the File Name box, click
  Open, and then click OK.

7. Click OK.

You can rename the set of personal folders by using the right mouse button to
click the Personal Folders icon, and then clicking Rename on the menu that
appears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Exchange, your profile contains one set of personal folders by
default. This set of personal folders is called Personal Folders, and contains
an Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, and Deleted Items folder. In addition to this
default set of personal folders, you can add a new set of personal folders by
clicking Services on the Tools menu, clicking Add, and then clicking Personal
Folders in the list of available information services. The new set of personal
folders contains only a Deleted Items folder by default.

All new mail is delivered to the Inbox folder in Personal Folders by default.
When you add a new set of personal folders, you can configure Microsoft Exchange
so that new mail is delivered to the new set of personal folders. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Delivery tab.

3. Click the set of personal folders to which you want new mail to be delivered.
