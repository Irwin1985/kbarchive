The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
- Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 editions 
- Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95 and Bookshelf 95 
- Microsoft Works for Windows 95, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses differences between the various editions of Bookshelf
1995.

Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows, 1995 Edition
---------------------------------------------

The original edition of Bookshelf 1995 is the 16-bit version.

Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95
---------------------------

This updated CD-ROM is a dual-platform disc. It includes the 16-bit and 32-bit
versions. This CD replaces the 16-bit only version and is labeled:

  Bookshelf 95 for Windows 95

Microsoft Works version 4.0 for Windows 95 &amp; Bookshelf 95
---------------------------------------------------------

On this disc, Bookshelf 95 is the 32-bit version only.

Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Professional Edition with Bookshelf
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Office 95 Professional With Bookshelf has two discs marked "Disc 1" and "Disc 2".
Bookshelf is integrated into Disk 2.

NOTE: Early packages of Office 95 Professional With Bookshelf bundled the Office
95 CD-ROM with the Bookshelf 95 CD-ROM. This Office disc is marked Office
Standard. The Bookshelf CD-ROM is exactly the same as the standard Bookshelf 95
dual-platform disc.

NOTE: No content changes occur with the various editions of Bookshelf 95. Only
code changes, which are discussed below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

New Features in the 32-bit version:

- Supports Windows 95 features such as Autorun, long filenames, common dialog
  boxes, and more.

- 32-bit Setup, Program and Help files. This provides improved performance,
  especially for sound and video playback.

- Option to run from the CD-ROM drive does not require any hard disk space. The
  16-bit version of Bookshelf must use the hard drive.

- Basic integration with all Office 95 programs and Works 4.0. Both
  applications have a Lookup Reference located on the Tools menu. This works
  through OLE automation and the Windows 95 Registry. This mechanism also
  supports other new reference titles, such as Encarta Encyclopedia for
  Windows, 1996 edition.

- Special integration with Microsoft Excel 7.0 using a Microsoft Excel Visual
  Basic for Applications macro. Microsoft Excel has a Define shortcut context
  menu accessed using the right mouse button. Bookshelf has a Copy to Excel
  option provided by OLE automation.

32-bit Setup
------------

- Setup.exe installs the 32-bit version if the system is running:

  - Microsoft Windows 95
  - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51

- Setup.exe installs the 16-bit version if the system is running:

  - Microsoft Windows, version 3.x
  - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.x
  - Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.1 or 3.5

- The Works 95 &amp; Bookshelf Setup.exe is a smart menu program, with an
  option to run Bookshelf if the application is already installed. If the
  program is not installed, the options are to run Works Setup or Bookshelf
  32-bit Setup.

- Office 95 Professional With Bookshelf has one integrated Setup program.

- Network setup of Bookshelf is not implemented using the Setup program.
  Customers who purchase a network license for Bookshelf receive the Bookshelf
  95 Network Administrators guide. For information on Office Professional
  network setup as it relates to Bookshelf, please refer to the file
  Network.txt on Office Disc 1.


Updated 32-bit QuickShelf
-------------------------

- The 32-bit QuickShelf contains a Shortcut Bar mode. To use the Shortcut Bar
  mode, drag the QuickShelf icon to any edge of the desktop to activate the
  screen-width mode. To return to the floating toolbar mode, drag the object
  away from the edges of the desktop.

- The Office 95 Shortcut Bar and QuickShelf can be combined into one Shortcut
  Bar. For more information on the Shortcut Bar, see your Readme.txt file for
  details.

  NOTE: Microsoft Office Professional on CD-ROM already has QuickShelf and the
  Office Shortcut Bar combined. You will not see a separate QuickShelf toolbar.

- The program includes the new Autohide option, a feature similar to the
  Windows 95 taskbar Autohide feature.

- The Customize button has been removed. To customize, with your right mouse
  button click the Title bar or click the Control menu. This activates
  Customize, Help, and other special options.

- There isn't a Small Buttons option. Instead, you have a Large Buttons feature
  that you can activate. The Off setting is similar to Medium Buttons. The new
  Autofit option is similar to Small buttons, if Large Buttons is turned off.

- QuickShelf Keys, the keyboard shortcuts for QuickShelf, are no longer
  available.

Integration with Microsoft Works for Windows
--------------------------------------------

- 16-bit Bookshelf integrates with the Multimedia Editions of Works, versions
  2.x or 3.x.

- 32-bit Bookshelf integrates with Works 4.0 for Windows 95. As with Office 95,
  Works has a Reference Lookup item on the Tools menu. This works in
  conjunction with the Registry to launch the Reference Title, and contains
  various search options. A special feature is in Works is the Reference
  toolbar button.

Word Integration
----------------

- 16-bit Bookshelf integrates with Word 6.x (16-bit) only. 32-bit Bookshelf
  integrates with Word 7.0.

- No integration is possible with Word 6.x and 32-bit Bookshelf 95. QuickShelf
  can be used to provide reference lookup features manually.

- In addition to the basic integration to Office 95 programs, special
  integration is provided to Word 7.0 through the functions of a 32- bit .wll
  file.

- Bookshelf Daily and Define are no longer on the View menu as in Word 6.x.
  Word 7.0 has a Define shortcut context menu accessed by clicking the right
  mouse button.

- Bookshelf Daily is not part of the Word 7.0 integration.

- Bookshelf has a Copy to Word option. This is provided by OLE automation with
  Word 7.0, and through Bsctw.exe with Word 6.x.

- NOTE: Word 8.0 (which comes with Office 97) does not support the Define
  option on the contextual menu with Bookshelf 95. Upgrade to Bookshelf 1996-97
  or Bookshelf 98 in order to get this functionality.
