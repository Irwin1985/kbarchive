WHERE TO FIND HELP
===================

For detailed information on usage, please see the online Help in
Bookshelf '95. The Troubleshooting section in Help covers a variety of
topics such as improving performance and resolving audio difficulties.

REMOVING BOOKSHELF '94
======================

Bookshelf '95 Setup does not automatically remove Bookshelf '94 from
your computer. To remove Bookshelf '94, re-run Setup for Bookshelf '94
and choose "Remove All." (This removes only the Bookshelf-specific
files. Shared files, such as DLL's and DRV's, installed in the Windows
System directory are not removed.)

You may also need to do the following:

-  If you have moved the Bookshelf '94 and/or QuickShelf icon into a
  different Program Group since installing the application, Setup
  will not be able to detect the new location of the icon and delete
  it from Program Manager. After running Remove All from Setup,
  delete the icon(s) from Program Manager.

- The BOOKS94 directory (or whatever directory was identified as the
  destination directory during setup) will not be removed. If this
  directory is not being used for other files, use File Manager or
  the Explorer to delete the directory.

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
===================

- When copying 256-color images, be aware that unless you copy to a
  program that can handle 256 colors, such images will appear in
  16 colors.

- Pictures copied from Bookshelf using the Copy to Word command will
  include the caption, but pictures copied using the Copy Picture
  command will not.

- The Pronunciation Key pop up included in the Bookshelf Dictionary
  can be copied to the Clipboard by pressing CTRL+C.

- Under Windows 95, it is important to not remove the Bookshelf '95
  disc immediately after inserting it. Please wait for the Microsoft
  Bookshelf '95 box to appear and choose Cancel. Once the box has
  closed, it is safe to remove the disc.

Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16/16ASP
------------------------------------

Compressed audio clips may fail to play if you are using a Sound
Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster 16 ASP sound card. For example, you may
not be able to play any sounds in the Dictionary, but animations in
the Encyclopedia may play correctly. This problem occurs because some
computers are unable to use the 16-bit DMA (direct memory access)
channel on the Sound Blaster cards.

To correct this problem, switch the HDMA channel to use DMA or 8-bit
DMA. You must change this setting in the following two places:

1. The Drivers dialog box in the Windows Control Panel.

2. The SBCONFIG.EXE configuration program included with the Sound
  Blaster cards.

To change the settings, follow these steps:

1. Choose the Drivers icon in the Windows Control Panel.

2. Select the Sound Blaster 16 Wave/Midi driver and choose Setup.

3. Under the HDMA setting, set the selection to DMA.

4. Choose OK. Choose Do Not Restart Now.

5. Exit Windows.

6. At the MS-DOS prompt, switch to the SB16 directory and run
  SBCONFIG.EXE.

7. Follow the instructions provided by this configuration program.
  It assists you in selecting and testing the following variables:

  Variable            Select
  ========           ========

  Base I/O port      Autoscan
  MidiPort address   Autoscan
  DMA interrupt      Current
  8-bit DMA          Current
  16-bit DMA         Use 8-bit DMA

  After you have finished making these selections, the SBCONFIG
  program will restart your computer.

8. Restart Windows.

Compressed audio should now play correctly.

For more information about Sound Blaster cards and about this problem,
contact Creative Labs technical support at (405) 742-6622.

Sound Blaster is manufactured by Creative Technology Ltd., a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding this product's performance or reliability.

Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum
-------------------------------

Audio clips may sound "scratchy" (that is, distorted) when played from
the Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum. To correct this problem, change
the Media Vision driver DMA setting to 7.

To change the driver settings:

1. Choose the Drivers icon in the Windows Control Panel.

2. Select the Media Vision Wave/MIDI/Aux driver and choose Setup.

3. Under the DMA setting, set the selection to 7.

4. Choose OK. Choose Restart Now.

Audio clips should now play correctly.

Turtle Beach Monte Carlo
------------------------

When using the Turtle Beach Monte Carlo sound card, sounds may play
correctly the first time then fail on subsequent attempts. To correct
this problem, run the Monte Carlo driver utility and change the setup
to use the Standard drivers and not the V-synth driver. Audio clips
should now play correctly.

For additional information about using the Monte Carlo or Turtle Beach
drivers, consult the documentation from the hardware provider. The

Aztech Labs (AZI)
-----------------

You may experience problems playing compressed wave audio when using
any of the following Aztech Labs (AZI) sound cards:

- Multimedia Pro
- NX Pro 16
- Sound Galaxy Basic 16
- Sound Galaxy Pro 16

To resolve the problem try the following:

1. Add a D=64 parameter at the end of the Device=EMM386 line in the
  CONFIG.SYS file. For example, if your EMM386.EXE file is in the DOS
  directory on drive C, you would use the following line:

     Device=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE D=64.

2. Change the DMABufferSize setting in the [386enh] section of the
  SYSTEM.INI file to "DMABufferSize=064" (without the quotation
  marks). If the line does not exist, add it.

3. Do the following:

  a) Note the driver listed in the Wave= line in the [drivers]
     section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

  b) Find the section by that name in the SYSTEM.INI file.
     For example, if Wave=mm16.drv, find the [mm16.drv] section.

  c) Add a "SingleModeDMA=True" line (without the quotation marks)
     to this section.

  d) If the driver in the Control Panel for the particular AZI
     card has separate 8-bit and 16-bit DMA settings, try setting
     the 16-bit to None.

Some 16-bit AZI sound card drivers do not have separate 8-bit and 16-
bit DMA settings. If the problem still persists, you may need a sound
driver update. For more information, contact Aztech Labs technical
support at (800) 886-8879 or Sound Galaxy Support at (510) 623-8988.

The Aztech products discussed here are manufactured by Aztech, a
vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.

BOOKSHELF '95 DISPLAY
=====================

Requirements
------------

Microsoft Bookshelf '95 requires a 256-color display to run. If your
computer's display is less than 256 colors, you need to install a 256
color driver, or obtain one from your video card's manufacturer.

A set of generic 256 color drivers (which support most non-accelerated
Super VGA adapters) has been included on the Microsoft Bookshelf '95
disc (see the README.TXT supplied with the drivers for more
information on supported video adapters). The file (SVGA.EXE) is
located in the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory (assuming D:\ is the drive
letter of your CD-ROM).

Note: Video adapters based on the S3 chip set will not work with the
generic 256 color driver (SVGA.EXE). In this case you will find
specific S3 drivers (also located in the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory)
for these video adapters. The driver you select depends on the
specific S3 chip set your video adapter uses. For more information on
the version of the S3 chip set your video card uses, see the user's
manual included with your video card. Once you have determined the
version of the S3 chip set your video card supports, use the following
table to determine which file to copy to your hard disk.

  Chip set     Copy file
  =======      =========

  801/805      S3-801.EXE
  924          S3-924.EXE
  928          S3-928.EXE

To install the driver, you will first need to copy the appropriate
driver file from the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory on the Microsoft
Bookshelf '95 CD to your hard disk (Note: do not copy this file to the
C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories).

Once the file has been copied to the hard disk you will need to
"extract" the video driver by either typing the name of the file and
pressing the Enter key from the MS-DOS prompt (i.e., SVGA &lt;Enter&gt;) or
by double-clicking on the file (SVGA.EXE) in the File Manager.

Once the files are extracted, complete the installation of the video
driver by opening the DISPLAY.TXT file located in the directory where
the expanded video driver resides. Find the section entitled
"Installing a Display Driver" and follow the steps.

For further information on installing a different display driver,
choose Contents from the Help menu in the Windows Setup application or
consult your Windows documentation.

Display Problems
----------------

In some situations, Bookshelf '95 may encounter video display problems
when using high-resolution video drivers from various video card
manufacturers. The problems include:

- Images and illustrations appearing grainy or having "glitches."

- Videos displaying garbled images or causing General Protection
  Faults.

Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video
card manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video card to
determine if there are newer versions available. Their phone number
should be in the manuals that came with your video card or personal
computer. Another option for obtaining updated drivers is the
Microsoft Download Service, an electronic bulletin board that can be
accessed via a modem at (206) 936-MSDL (6735).

Font Display Problems
---------------------

Bookshelf '95 uses TrueType fonts for its display. If you receive  a
message stating that one of the fonts is unavailable, make sure that
TrueType fonts are enabled on your computer.

1. From the Windows Control Panel, select Fonts and then click
  the TrueType button.

2. In the TrueType dialog box, make sure the Enable TrueType Fonts
  check box is selected (an X appears in the check box when it is
  selected).

3. If the Enable TrueType Fonts check box is selected, then go back
  to the Fonts dialog box and click the Help button for more
  information on adding fonts.

To view fonts currently installed in Windows, open the Control Panel.
&gt;From the Control Panel, select Fonts. Fonts currently in use by
Windows are listed in the Installed fonts box.

Bookshelf '95 uses and installs the following TrueType fonts:

- Arial (TrueType)
- Arial Bold (TrueType)
- Arial Bold Italic (TrueType)
- Arial Italic (TrueType)
- Bookshelf Symbol 1 (TrueType)
- Bookshelf Symbol 2 (TrueType)
- Bookshelf Symbol 3 (TrueType)
- Symbol (TrueType)

If any of the above are missing, run the Bookshelf '95 Setup program
and choose Remove All. Once Setup is complete re-run the Bookshelf '95
Setup program to reinstall Bookshelf '95.

NOTES ON QUICKSHELF IN WINDOWS 3.1 and WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS
=============================================================

QuickShelf Keys and MS-DOS Use
------------------------------

QuickShelf keys allow you to look up selected text in Bookshelf from
any Windows application. However, you cannot bring up Bookshelf using
QuickShelf keys from an MS-DOS application or from the MS-DOS prompt.
Additionally, selected text in an MS-DOS application will not be used
to perform a QuickShelf lookup when using the QuickShelf buttons.
Other Windows applications that do not copy text in the standard way
also may not work with QuickShelf.

QuickShelf and the Clipboard
------------------------------

Clicking a QuickShelf button or using a QuickShelf key combination
replaces the contents of the Clipboard.

Moving the QuickShelf Toolbar
------------------------------

Open the QuickShelf Customize menu by either right-clicking on the
Toolbar or by left-clicking the down arrow button at the right end of

In some instances the Address Builder may be unable to suggest a ZIP
code based on a street address alone. In this case, try using a city
name (spell it correctly) and/or a state name to narrow down ZIP code
information.

NOTES ON THE SPELLING FEATURE
=============================

- The Automatic Spelling feature is unable to check multiple words.

-  The Automatic Spelling feature functions in three places in
  Bookshelf: the Contents Tab, Find Tab, and Advanced Find dialog.
  When the Spelling dialog box comes up from the Contents Tab, it
  uses a custom dictionary that has only Table of Contents items.
  When the Spelling dialog box comes up from either the Find Tab or
  Advanced Find dialog, it uses the standard spelling dictionary.

RUNNING ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT
===============================

The following are known issues related to using Bookshelf with Windows
NT. Where possible, solutions or work-arounds are provided.

QuickShelf Find on Windows NT 3.5
---------------------------------

When your machine is running Windows NT 3.5, you can experience
problems when you select a word in 32-bit applications and use
QuickShelf to perform a full-text search on the word in Bookshelf.
Bookshelf will appear, but the search will not be performed because
QuickShelf cannot move the text out of the application running in NT.

Keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon, so you have easy
access to it from other applications when you want to do a full-text
search on a word.

QuickShelf Keys and Windows NT 3.5
----------------------------------

When your machine is running Windows NT 3.5, you can experience
problems when you use QuickShelf key combinations in 32-bit
applications because QuickShelf cannot move text out of these NT
applications.

In this case, keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon; this way
you will have quick access to it.
