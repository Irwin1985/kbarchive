The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a document, an error message similar to the following may appear
if you run Word under Windows 95:

  The disk is full or too many files are open. (C:\WINWORD\DOC1.DOC)

A similar error message may occur when Word performs an AutoSave operation:

  The disk is full or too many files are open. (C:\WINWORD\~WRANNNN.ASD)

Also, when you try to run ScanDisk on Windows 95, you may receive the following
error message:

  ScanDisk cannot check the drive as it is not properly formatted or a utility
  has locked it, format the hard disk or wait for the utility to finish and
  re-run ScanDisk.

If you save your document as Rich Text Format (RTF), the following error message
may appear:

  Word is unable to write some or all of the embedded objects due to
  insufficient memory or disk space.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur for either of the following reasons:

- You are running the Bgmail.exe utility.

  -or-

- The document contains corrupted or invalid links.


WORKAROUND
==========

If You Are Using Bgmail.exe
---------------------------

Bgmail.exe is a tool installed on AT&amp;T computers to provide access to
AT&amp;T proprietary mail services.

Bgmail.exe prevents Windows 95 tools from locking the hard disk properly. Note
that Bgmail.exe is loaded from either the Winstart.bat file or the Autoexec.bat
file.

If you are running the Bgmail utility, edit the Winstart.bat file or the
Autoexec.bat file, and place a semicolon (;) at the beginning of the Bgmail.exe
line to temporarily turn it off. Save and close the file, and then restart
Windows 95 and run ScanDisk.

The Document Contains Corrupted or Invalid Links
------------------------------------------------

This problem is known to occur with Microsoft Equation Editor objects. However,
this problem can also occur with corrupt or invalid links of other object types
as well.

Equation Editor, a special version of the MathType equation editor from Design
Science, Inc., is customized for use with Microsoft applications. For more
information about MathType, please visit the following MathType Web address:

  http://www.mathtype.com/

Using Equation Editor, you can build complex equations by picking symbols from a
toolbar and typing variables and numbers. As you build an equation, Equation
Editor automatically adjusts font sizes, spacing, and formatting in keeping with
mathematical typesetting conventions. You can also adjust formatting as you work
and redefine the automatic styles.


Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1: Save Your Word Document as Rich Text Format

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. In the Save As dialog box, change the Save as type box to Rich Text Format.

  NOTE: You may also want to change the File name box to a new name for your
  document to prevent accidentally overwriting your original document.

3. Click Save.

4. On the File menu, click Close.

5. On the File menu, click Open, and then open the Rich Text Format file that
  you saved in steps 1 through 3.

  NOTE: In the Open dialog box, you may need to change the Files of type box to
  Rich Text Format before you can see you new file. If the Convert File dialog
  box appears, make sure that Rich Text Format (RTF) is selected, and then
  click OK.

6. After the Rich Text Format document is open, click Save As on the File menu,
  and resave your new document as a Word Document with a new file name.

  NOTE: It is recommended that you not save your new Word document back to the
  original file name. Instead, save your new Word document by using a new file
  name. If the problem with the document has been corrected, you can delete the
  problem document (the original Word document) and rename your new Word
  document to the original file name later.

Method 2: Test for Invalid Object Links

To test for invalid object links in your Word document, you need to update the
fields in Word. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

2. Press F9.

Word should display the following message on the status bar when it is updating
fields:

  Word is updating the fields in the document

If an error message appears at this point, one or more of the fields may be
invalid and may show a message similar to the following in place of the equation
object:

  Error! Object cannot be created from editing field codes.

It may be possible to unlink the problem equation field, or it may be necessary
to delete the equation object and recreate it. In either case, do the following
steps:

1. On the Edit menu, click Undo Update Fields.

2. Do one of the following:

   - Click the problem equation object. Then press CTRL+SHIFT+F9 to unlink the
     equation object. After the object is unlinked, you cannot edit the object
     in Equation Editor. However, you may be able to save your Word document.

     -or-

   - Delete and recreate the equation object. For more information, please see
     Method 4 later in this article.

Repeat these steps for each problem equation object in your Word document.

Method 3: Paste the Problem Object as a Picture

You may be able to identify a problem equation object in your Word document.

NOTE: Using this method causes your equation editor object to become a picture,
and you cannot edit the equation object in Equation Editor. However, you may be
able to save your Word document. If you need to edit the equation object, you
need to recreate it. For more information, please see Method 4 later in this
article.

1. Click the problem equation object.

2. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

3. Make sure the insertion point is located where you want the equation object
  to appear, and then click Paste Special on the Edit menu.

4. In the Paste Special dialog box, click Picture and click OK.

Method 4: Recreate the Microsoft Equation Object

Delete the problem equation object and recreate it in Microsoft Equation Editor
3.0.

For more information about how to create a new equation object, click the Office
Assistant, type "insert equation" (without the quotation marks), click Search,
and then click to view "Insert an equation."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, click the
