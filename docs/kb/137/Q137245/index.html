IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

NOTE: In this article, the term "Windows Messaging" refers to both
Microsoft Exchange and Windows Messaging.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Windows Messaging or Microsoft Outlook 97, or compose
or open a message in Windows Messaging or Outlook 97, you may receive one of the
following error messages:

- EXCHNG32 caused an exception 05h in WMSFR32.DLL

- EXCHNG32 caused an invalid page fault in module WMSFR32.DLL

- EXCHNG32 caused an invalid page fault in module WMSUI32.DLL

- Some information could not be read. Microsoft Exchange Client - 9992 -
  [81002708]

- The item could not be displayed. The object could not be found. Microsoft
  Windows Messaging System Forms Registry - 13085 - [8004010F]

- The item could not be displayed [80004005]

- The item could not be displayed [81003355]

- The command you specified could not be carried out. The object could not be
  found. Microsoft Windows Messaging System Forms Registry - 13085 - [8004010F]

- The command you specified could not be carried out. The form cache file
  &lt;frmcache&gt; is not valid. Contact your administrator. Error code
  0x81003364. Microsoft Windows Messaging System Forms Registry - 13156 -
  [80040119]

- The Mapi spooler has shut down unexpectedly.

In addition, you may find that the long folder name associated with the Program
Files\Microsoft Exchange folder is damaged or that the Program Files folder has
been renamed to $!$!$!$!.$!$.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions exists:

- The Wmsfr32.dll, Wmsui32.dll, or Frmcache.dat file is missing or damaged.

- The long folder name associated with the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange
  folder is damaged or the Program Files folder has been renamed to
  $!$!$!$!.$!$.

- The Exchange or MlSet values under the Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\ Microsoft
  registry key are missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To resolve this issue, perform the following steps. After performing each step,
check to see if the problem has been resolved.

1. Verify that the Frmcache.dat file is not missing or damaged. To do so,
  perform the following steps. Before performing each step, rename the
  Frmcache.dat file in the Windows\Forms folder, if it exists. After performing
  each step, check to see if the problem has been resolved.

  a. Double-click the Mlset32.exe file in the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange
     folder.

  b. Copy the Frmcache.bak file in the Windows\Forms folder to Frmcache.dat.

  c. Obtain a copy of the Frmcache.dat file from a computer on which Windows
     Messaging is functioning properly and then copy the file to the
     Windows\Forms folder on your computer.

2. Verify that the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange folder exists. To do so,
  attempt to locate the folder using Windows Explorer. If the folder name that
  appears in Windows Explorer is Program Files\Micros~1 or Progra~1\Microsoft
  Exchange, or if the Program Files folder has been renamed to $!$!$!$!.$!$,
  please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q143395 Microsoft Exchange Folder Truncated to "Micros~1"

3. Rename all copies of the Wmsfr32.dll and Wmsui32.dll files on your hard disk,
  and then extract new copies of the Wmsfr32.dll and Wmsui32.dll files from
  your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to the Windows\ System folder. The
  Wmsfr32.dll and Wmsui32.dll files are located in the Win95_06.cab cabinet
  file on the Windows 95 CD-ROM or the Win95_07.cab cabinet file on disk 7 of
  your original Windows 95 disks.

  For information about using the Extract tool, type "extract" (without
  quotation marks) at a command prompt, or see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q129605 How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

  NOTE: If you have installed the Microsoft Exchange Update for Windows 95, you
  should not extract new copies of the Wmsfr32.dll and Wmsui32.dll files from
  your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM. After you rename all copies of the
  files on your hard disk, you should reinstall the Microsoft Exchange Update
  from the online source from which you originally installed it.

4. Verify that the Exchange and MlSet values under the following registry key
  are not missing or damaged:

  Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft

  The Exchange value should have the following value:

  C:\Progra~1\Micros~1\exchng32.exe

  The MlSet value should have the following value:

  C:\Progra~1\Micros~1\mlset32.exe

  If either of these values is missing or incorrect, create or modify the value
  manually.

5. Remove and reinstall Microsoft Exchange. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

  b. Click the Windows Setup tab and then click the Microsoft Exchange check
     box to clear it. If you are prompted to remove Microsoft Fax also, do so.

  c. Click OK.

  d. After Microsoft Exchange is removed, remove all files in the Windows\Forms
     folder and then restart Windows 95.

  e. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

  f. Click the Windows Setup tab and then click the Microsoft Exchange check
     box to select it. If you also removed Microsoft Fax, click that check box
     to select it also.

  g. Click OK.

Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, version 4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem with Terminal Server, copy the Frmcache.dat file from the
%SystemRoot%\Forms folder to the %SystemRoot%\Profiles\ %username%\Windows\Forms
folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Frmcache.dat file is created during the initial configuration of Windows
Messaging, either by the Microsoft Exchange Setup Wizard or later when you add
the first service. The Frmcache.dat file contains standard forms and other
information that Windows Messaging uses to perform tasks such as displaying and
sending messages. If the information associated with a particular task is
missing or damaged, you receive an error message when you attempt to perform
that task. If all other information in the file is not damaged, Windows
Messaging appears to function properly when performing all other tasks.

The size of a valid Frmcache.dat file is usually 16K or larger. Many programs add
information to the Frmcache.dat file when they are installed, causing the file
to increase in size. The Frmcache.bak file is created when the Frmcache.dat file
is first created and is typically not modified when a program adds information
to Frmcache.dat file. Therefore, if you replace the Frmcache.dat file with the
Frmcache.bak file, any information added to the Frmcache.dat file is lost. This
information must be replaced manually by reinstalling the program that
originally added it.

The following situations can cause the Frmcache.dat file to become damaged:

- You backed up and restored the files on your computer, but long file names
  were not recognized correctly. After the files were restored, the path for
  the Program Files\Microsoft Exchange folder did not match the associated
  registry entries.

- Your computer contains a preinstalled copy of Windows 95. When an image of
  Windows 95 is placed on a hard disk, Windows Messaging may appear to be
  installed correctly, but the Frmcache.dat file may not have been created
  correctly.

The Microsoft Exchange Configuration Wizard (Mlset32.exe) is run for the first
time when Windows Messaging is first installed. It can be used as a
troubleshooting tool after Windows Messaging has been installed, but it is not
always successful in rebuilding the Frmcache.dat file.
