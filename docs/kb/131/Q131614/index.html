SUMMARY
=======

Appendix G of the Systems Management Server Administrators Guide discusses the
customizing of computer inventory and the method to deliver the custom MIF forms
to the Systems Management Server clients. This article outlines an alternate
method to achieve this. The alternate method has the additional benefit of
automatically downloading the new forms for all new clients when added to the
Systems Management Server site.

NOTE: If you run Systems Management Server Setup and add components or upgrade
your site after following the procedure below, the files you modified
(CLI_*.TXT) will be replaced with the original or newer versions. Therefore,
this method is not supported by Microsoft for Systems Management Server versions
1.0 through 1.2. If you decide to use the method below, Microsoft recommends
that you make backup copies of the CLI_*.TXT files you modify.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The steps described below are similar to the documented method in the Systems
Management Server Administrators guide. The main difference is the modification
of the CL_*.txt file (where * indicates the client operating system). The change
specifies which files should be downloaded to the client computers. You should
specify the new forms you have created in this file.

The remainder of this article will reference the CLI_WIN.TXT for purposes of
demonstration. If you are using other client operating systems with Systems
Management Server, follow the steps below to modify the appropriate copylist
file for each operating system platform.

1. Create the new form.

  Follow the steps outlined in Appendix G for Customizing the Computer Inventory
  and Creating forms. Save the new forms in the
  \SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\&lt;platform&gt; (where &lt;platform&gt; is
  all platforms currently installed [for example, X86.BIN]). Forms saved in
  this location will automatically be copied to the logon servers.

  NOTE: All forms should be saved with the .XNF filename extension.

2. Modify CL_WIN.TXT.

  Modify the \SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\CL_WIN.TXT file to include the new
  form(s) you have created. You can add the appropriate lines to this file in
  one of several locations. However, Microsoft recommends you add the lines in
  the STANDARD NETWORK FILES section. This file will automatically be
  replicated to all logon servers.

3. Create a package to update clients.

  Write a batch file to connect to the \SMS_SHR share on a logon server and run
  CLI_DOS.EXE /U from the appropriate platform subdirectory. This will prepare
  the client to be updated at the next logon and the specified XNF files to be
  downloaded to the client where they will be available to the MIF Entry
  utility.

  Sample batch file:

       C:
       net use t: \\smsserver\sms_shr
       t:
       cd x86.bin
       cli_dos /u
       c:
       net use t: /d

4. Distribute CLI_WIN.TXT to clients.

  Deliver the above batch file to the client machines where the new forms should
  be available. When the job is executed on the client, the above batch file
  will prepare the client for update at the next logon. This file will also be
  delivered to all new Systems Management Server clients and will result in the
  automatic installation of the desired XNF forms.
