SUMMARY
=======

Chapter 14 of the Visual C++ User's Guide for Visual C++ version 2.x and Chapter
17 of the Visual C++ User's Guide for Visual C++ version 4.0 describe how to
install the Remote Debug Monitor (Msvcmon.exe) and how to configure the remote
connection. Query on "Remote Debug" if you are using Visual C++ versions 5.0 and
6.0. This article provides further details and gives two methods to help you get
started. Note that Visual C++ versions 4.2 and 5.0 do not support WIN32S and
Macintosh platforms; versions 5.0 and 6.0 do not support Serial connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The remote debug monitor is a small program on the target computer that
communicates with the debugger and controls the execution of the program you are
debugging.

To install the remote debug monitor:

- On a Windows 95 or NT computer, the remote debug monitor consists of the
  following files: Msvcmon.exe, Msvcrt40.dll, Tln0com.dll, Tln0t.dll, and
  Dmn0.dll. Copy these files to the remote computer.

  If you are using Visual C++ version 5.0, then copy Msvcmon.exe, Msvcrt.dll,
  Tln0t.dll, Dm.dll, Msvcp50.dll and Msdis100.dll to the remote computer. If
  the remote computer is Windows NT 4.0, then copy Psapi.dll also.

  If you are using Visual C++ version 6.0, the remote debug monitor consists of
  the following files: Msvcmon.exe, Msvcrt.dll, Tln0t.dll, Dm.dll, Msvcp60.dll,
  and Msdis110.dll. For Windows NT only, the remote debugger also requires
  psapi.dll. Copy these files to a remote target computer directory, move
  Msvcrt.dll to the System32 directory, and restart. If you are using Windows
  95 or Windows 98, move the msvcrt.dll file to the Windows System driectory
  and restart.

- On a Win32s computer, the remote debug monitor consists of Msvcmon.exe,
  Tlw3com.dll, and Dmw3.dll. These files are installed automatically during
  setup.

- On a Macintosh, the remote monitor is a control panel, called VC++ Debug
  Monitor, installed automatically by the Visual C++ for Macintosh setup
  program.

- On a Power Macintosh, the remote debugger is an application, called VC++
  PowerMac Remote Monitor, installed automatically by the Visual C++ for
  Macintosh setup program. Setup also installs the following files: VC++ Power
  Macintosh File Utility, VC++ Power Macintosh ADSP Transport, VC++ Power
  Macintosh TCP/IP Transport, and VC++ Power Macintosh Serial Transport.

Method One - Windows NT Host, Win32s Remote
-------------------------------------------

If you are using Visual C++ versions 4.2 and 5.0, the host and remote machines
can be either a Windows NT machine or a Windows 95 machine, as can the local
machine. Therefore, the project can reside in the local machine of your choice.

1. Set up a shared directory that both the local Windows NT machine and the
  remote machine can view. The shared directory can be on either machine or a
  network drive. The easiest option is to share the directory on the local
  Windows NT machine that contains the project's executable.

2. Load the project into the Visual C++ development environment running on
  Windows NT.

3. Open the Project Setting dialog box. (In Visual C++ 2.x, choose Settings from
  the Project menu; in Visual C++ 4.0, choose Settings from the Build menu; in
  Visual C++ 5.0 and 6.0, choose Settings from the Project menu.) Click the
  Debug tab. Set the following sections:
   - Executable for Debug Session: Enter the name and path of the executable as
     the local Windows NT computer sees it.

   - Additional DLLs: Enter the name and path of any DLLs as the local Windows
     NT computer sees them.

   - Remote Executable Path: Enter the name and path of the executable as the
     remote computer sees it.

   - Working Directory: Should be blank.

4. Start the remote debugger on the remote computer by starting MSVCMON.EXE. For
  the Win32s platform, find the Visual C++ Win32s program group, and select the
  Visual C++ Debug Monitor icon. Choose the connect button to start the
  connection.

5. On the Windows NT host computer, check the connection information. In the
  Visual C++ 2.x, choose Options from the Tools menu. Then click the Debug tab.
  Make sure Remote Debugging is selected. Choose the Connections button, and
  confirm the type of connection. Also, click Settings and confirm the
  settings. In Visual C++ 4.0, choose Remote Connection from the Tools menu.
  Confirm the choices for Platform and Connection. Click Settings to configure
  the specified connection.

  In Visual C++ 5.0 and 6.0, choose Debugger Remote connection from the Build
  menu. Choose Network (TCP/IP) then Settings. Enter remote machine name or IP
  address, no password needed. You can ignore the symbolic information not
  found messages for the system DLLs when the debugger is started in Step 6
  below.

  NOTE: For Intel (x86) machines, Visual C++ 2.x only supports remote debugging
  via serial connections. In Visual C++ 4.0, it is possible to debug using a
  network connection with TCP/IP except on Win32s, which requires a serial
  connection.

6. Start Debugging.

Method Two
----------

If you can't make a shareable directory, copy the executable and any needed DLLs
to the remote computer. With this method you need to be sure that the
executables and DLLs are re-copied whenever changes are made. All the other
steps remain the same.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the development environment can't find the executable, make sure the correct
directories for the correct computers are given in step 3.

Because Visual C++ version 5.0 supports only TCP/IP connection, check for correct
machine name and proper network connection with TCP/IP protocol available. The
following troubleshooting does not apply to version 5.0 or 6.0.

If the connection fails:

- Test the COM port by running Terminal (a Windows version 3.x and Windows NT
  applet) on both your Windows NT computer and your Win32s computer. (For
  information on how to use Terminal, please see your Windows manual.) Anything
  typed into Terminal on one computer should show up in Terminal on the other.

- Check the COM port settings. The most reliable setting is 9600 baud with
  XON/XOFF.

- Try a different cable (a null modem cable).

- Try a different COM port.

- If you are using the Windows debug kernel, use the normal kernel.

- On Win32s, complete a Windows clean boot, and do not start any applications
  other than the remote monitor.

For additional information about how to perform a clean boot, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q87290 What Is a Clean Boot for Windows 3.1?

  Q90511 What Is a Clean Boot for Windows for Workgroups?
