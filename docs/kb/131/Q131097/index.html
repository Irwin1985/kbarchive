The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Macintosh client is designed to be used in conjunction with Microsoft Mail
Server; however, it is also possible to use Windows NT Mail (MSMAIL32.EXE) to
establish a postoffice that is usable by both PC and Macintosh clients through
Services for Macintosh (SFM).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following two versions of Microsoft Mail for the Macintosh are available:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh workstation, version 3.0

To gain enterprise mail connectivity between PCs and Macintoshes when using
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks and Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, you
must also use the Microsoft Mail Connection gateway.

NOTE: For details on the Microsoft Mail Connection gateway hardware and software
requirements and installation instructions, see your Microsoft Mail and
Microsoft Mail Connection manuals.

To gain mail connectivity between PCs and Macintoshes in smaller networking
environments without the additional software and hardware requirements mentioned
above, you can use the Macintosh client in conjunction with Windows NT Mail.

The Macintosh client is included in the following products.

- Microsoft Mail Server Version 3.2

- Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ Extensions (also known as the Postoffice Upgrade
  for Microsoft Windows for Workgroups)

For pricing and availability information on the above products, call Microsoft
Sales Information Services (MSIC) at 800-426-9400.

To establish mail connectivity between PCs and Macintoshes using Windows NT Mail
and the Macintosh client, configure the computer running Windows NT Server as
follows:

1. Run User Manager for Domains and create user accounts for the Macintosh
  clients. For details about how to use User Manager for Domains, see your
  Windows NT Server System Guide.

2. Run Control Panel, choose Network, and install Services for Macintosh (SFM).

3. If you have already started Windows NT Mail for the first time on the Windows
  NT server, and the workgroup postoffice is already on an Windows NT file
  system (NTFS) partition, skip to step 6 below.

4. If you have already started Windows NT Mail for the first time to establish a
  workgroup postoffice on the Windows NT server, and the workgroup postoffice
  is not already on an NTFS partition, proceed with the following steps and
  then skip to step 6 below.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

  a. Move the workgroup postoffice directory structure (the root is named WGPO
     by default) to an NTFS volume.

  b. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

  c. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:

        \Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail
   

  d. Modify the ServerPath value to reflect the new postoffice location.

  e. Ensure the share established for the workgroup postoffice is active and
     reflecting the appropriate path.

5. If you have not yet started Windows NT Mail for the first time on computer
  running Windows NT Server, start Windows NT Mail and follow the on-screen
  instructions for creating a workgroup postoffice. Create it on an NTFS
  partition.

6. Run File Manager, select the workgroup postoffice directory (WGPO by
  default), and choose the MacFile menu. Create a Macintosh-accessible volume.
  For details about using the MacFile menu, see your Windows NT Server Services
  for Macintosh guide.

7. Select the File, Share, and MacFile permissions and set them as follows (to
  ensure that the all Mail users are able to use the workgroup postoffice):

  a. The file permissions should be set such that all Windows NT Mail users
     have the full control permission to the workgroup postoffice root
     directory (WGPO by default) and all of its subdirectories and files.

  b. The share permissions should be set such that all Windows NT Mail users
     have the full control permission to the workgroup postoffice share (WGPO
     by default).

  c. The MacFile permissions for the workgroup postoffice volume (WGPO by
     default) should be set such that all Macintosh client users accessing this
     postoffice have the See Files, See Folders, and Make Changes permissions
     to the workgroup postoffice root directory (WGPO by default) and all of
     its subdirectories and files. The volume security should not be set for
     read-only.

On the Macintosh client, follow the installation instructions found in Chapter 1
of the Microsoft Mail Workstation Software for the Macintosh User's Guide to
install the Macintosh client.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

When you send a file attachments from a Macintosh client, you can choose the
format that is used to send the file (Mac format or PC format); however, Windows
NT Mail attaches files in PC format only.

Because the Macintosh client is designed to be used in conjunction with Microsoft
Mail Server, all Macintosh client features may not be available or function as
expected when used in conjunction with a Windows NT Mail workgroup postoffice.
