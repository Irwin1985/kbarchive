SUMMARY
=======

You may wish to create your own printer control language (PCL) separator file.
This article provides you with an example after which you can pattern your own
separator file.

This article includes the following sections:

- Non-Annotated Separator File Text Example

- Annotated Separator File Text Example

- Description of Output From the Separator File Example

- Separator File Command Summary

Additional references for more information on the structure of the PCL language
are listed at the end of this article.

NOTE: Microsoft is responsible for solving problems with the Windows NT separator
file processor, but not for developing custom printer-language code.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a separator file:

1. Type or paste the text from the example below into an ASCII text file.

2. Save the file to the print server hard disk drive.

3. Reconfigure Print Manager to use the separator file:

  a. From the Printer menu, choose Properties.

  b. Choose Details.

  c. Type the path to the separator file in the Separator File text box.

  d. Choose OK, and then choose OK again.

4. After you have test the file, modify it to meet your needs.

Annotated Separator File Text Example
-------------------------------------

Like most PCL separator files, this example contains a mix of separator file
commands and PCL code. The individual PCL commands are a combination of the
value and the command. For example, 16v indicates a 16 point font. Only the last
command in the PCL string should be capitalized (to indicate the end of the
command). Although there can be multiple PCL commands per line, each new command
string must start with an &lt;Esc&gt; code.

NOTE: Some variable must be strung together in a specific order to function
correctly. For more information, see the PCL references mentioned at the end of
this article.

\

  The first line of any separator file is a delimiter character by itself. The
  separator file interpreter looks for the backslash (\) character on the first
  line, and uses it as the delimiter for its command strings in the rest of the
  separator file.

\H1B\L%-12345X@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL

  If you want to send printer language commands, and those commands include
  unprintable characters, you must send those characters by writing "\H"
  followed by the character's hexadecimal value. Because most PCL commands
  begin with an ESC character (hex value 0x1B) and are followed by printable
  text, many PCL separator file lines begin with \H1B, followed by \L, and then
  a literal string containing the rest of the PCL command. Remember that PCL
  commands are case sensitive. The line above tells HP print devices with
  multiple languages ("personalities") to switch to PCL.

\H1B\L&amp;l1T\0

  This line toggles job separation and moves the cursor down one line.

\H1B\L(19U\H1B\L(s1p16v0s0b16602T

  There are two PCL commands in this line; the first sets the symbol set and
  the second sets the font spacing, size, and name:

  &lt;ESC&gt;(19U sets symbol set to 19U (Windows 3.1 Latin 1)
  &lt;ESC&gt;(s1p sets spacing to 1 (1=proportional, 0=fixed)
  16v sets font size to 16 points
  0s0b16602T sets font to Arial (Plain)

  If you want to use a different symbol set, size, or font, you need to change
  this command (spacing is usually defined by the font, and is not
  configurable). To get a list of the available fonts on an HP 4 Si print
  device, use its front panel: from the TEST menu, choose the PCL TYPE LIST
  entry and push the ENTER key. The resulting pages include lines that provide
  the commands to set the font spacing and name. For example:

  Arial Scale

  &lt;esc&gt;(&lt;xx&gt;&lt;esc&gt;s1p&lt;yy&gt;v0s0b16602T I 029

  where &lt;xx&gt; represents an open box symbol designating "Symbol set" and
  &lt;yy&gt; represents a closed box symbol designating "Point size"

  Note: You will see the above all on one line.

  The &lt;xx&gt; box is a placeholder for the symbol set value. The example PCL
  command above sets this value to 19U; other useful values are 579L
  (Wingdings), 19M (Symbol), 10U (PC-8, code page 437), and 12U (PC-850,
  Multilingual). Symbol set lists are available in many printer user manuals,
  and in Appendix C of the PCL 5 Comparison Guide (available from
  Hewlett-Packard).

  The &lt;yy&gt; box is a placeholder for the point size.

\H1B\L&amp;a10L\LDate: \D\H1B\L&amp;a60L\LJob: \I\H1B\L&amp;a94L\LTime: \T

  The PCL command &lt;ESC&gt;&amp;a#L sets the horizontal cursor position on
  the current line to column #. This line positions the Date:, Job:, and Time:
  labels horizontally at columns 10, 60, and 94, respectively, and prints the
  current date, the job number, and the time after their respective labels.

\9\5

  This line moves the cursor position down 14 lines. The \n separator file
  command moves the cursor down n lines. Although n must be a single digit (0
  through 9) number, you can move nine lines, and then five lines, to move a
  total of 14 lines.

\H1B\L(19U\H1B\L(s1p36v0s0b16602T

  This line redefines the current font, increasing the size from 16 to 36
  points.

\H1B\L&amp;a17L
\H5C\H5C\LServer\H5C\LShare
\9\6

  These lines set the left margin at column 17, print "\\Server\Share", and
  then move down 15 lines. You can change the "Server" and "Share" strings to
  the names of your print server and it's print share. This command sets the
  left margin at 17 because this roughly centers the text "\\Server\Share"
  horizontally. If your server and share name create a longer or shorter
  string, you may want to adjust this margin to maintain the centering. There
  is no separator file command to center text automatically.

\H1B\L(19U\H1B\L(s1p96v1s0b4116T

  This line redefines the current font to 96-point Marigold Windows 3.1 Latin 1
  symbol set). This example uses the Marigold font simply to demonstrate that
  you can get multiple fonts on the same page; you can change it to the font of
  your choice.

\H1B\L&amp;a10L\N

  This line sets the left margin to column 10 and then prints the user's name.

\H1B\LE

  There are two final lines in the file. The first is a PCL printer reset
  command (&lt;ESC&gt;E), and the second is the carriage return-linefeed pair
  that follows the printer reset command. Don't forget the carriage
  return-linefeed pair.

Description of Output From the Separator File Example
-----------------------------------------------------

The precise output you get when you use the sample separator file varies
depending on the values for the date, job number, time, the share specified, and
the user's name. However, the basic layout of the page may be described as
follows: near the top of the separator page you will see one line with the word
"date" with a value on the left, the word "job" and a number in the center, and
the label "time" and its current value at the right. The text in this line will
be in Arial 16 font. Roughly centered on the page will be the "\\Server\Share"
name in the Arial 36 point font. On the lower half of the sheet, and also
centered left to right on the page, will be the user name in a 96 point script
font.

Separator File Command Summary
------------------------------

Escape Code   Function
----------------------
 \           On its own line, at the very beginning of the
             separator file, defines the "\" character to be the command
             delimiter character for this separator file.

 \N          Prints the user name of the person that submitted the job.

 \I          Prints the job number.

 \D          Prints the date the job was printed. The representation of
             the date is the same as the Date Format in Control Panel
             (International).

 \T          Prints the time the job was printed. The representation of
             the time is the same as the Control Panel (Time).

 \Lxxx       Prints all the characters (xxxx) following it until another
             escape code is encountered.

 \Fpathname  Prints the contents of the file specified by pathname,
             starting on an empty line. The contents of this file are
             copied directly to the print device without any processing.

 \Hnn        Sends the nn (hexadecimal) ASCII character. \Hnn is often
             used to send a printer-specific control sequence. To
             determine appropriate control sequences, see your printer
             manual.

 \Wnn        Sets the width of the separator page. The default width is
             80; the maximum width is 256. Any printable characters beyond
             this width are truncated.

 \B\S        Prints text in single-width block characters until \U is
             encountered.

 \E          Ejects a page from the printer. Use this code to start a new
             separator page or to end the separator page file. If you get
             an extra blank separator page when you print, remove this
             code from your separator page file.

 \n          Skips n lines, where n is a digit from 0 through 9. Skipping
             0 lines simply moves printing to the next line.

 \B\M        Prints text in double-width block characters until \U is
             encountered.

 \U          Turns off block character printing.
