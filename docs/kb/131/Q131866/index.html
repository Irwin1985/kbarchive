SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears when you try to switch to your public
folders window from your private folders window in Microsoft Mail:

  There was an error switching between private and shared folders.
  Check your message file and your network connection to the postoffice.

The following error appears when you try to open a shared folder in the shared
folders window:

  The action cannot be completed because that shared folder is busy.
  Try performing the action again later. If the problem persists,
  contact your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

You do not have the appropriate permissions to the WGPO\FOLDERS\PUB directory or
the files in it.

Mail requires that you assign Full Control permission to all Mail users for the
workgroup postoffice directory (WGPO by default) and all of its subdirectories
and files. If you do not have sufficient directory permission to the PUB
subdirectory, or the files in it, Mail displays only your private folders window
when you start Mail (if that window was open the last time you quit Mail). If
you had only your shared folder window open the last time you quit Mail, Mail
displays only your outbox.

To open a new private folders window, choose New Window from the Window menu. If
you try to switch to your shared folders window before you correctly set the
directory permissions, the first error referenced above appears.

If directory permissions are revoked while you are in Mail, and you have your
shared folders window open, the second error message referenced above appears
when you try to open one of the shared folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, run File Manager on the workgroup postoffice server
and:

1. Select the WGPO\FOLDERS\PUB subdirectory.

2. From the Security menu, choose Permissions.

3. Add your user account or a group to which you belong (for example,
  Mailusers). The account of group must have the Full Control permission. Make
  sure you select "Replace Permissions on Existing Files." Verify that your
  user account or group does not currently have the No Access permission
  assigned to that directory.

4. Choose OK.

You should now be able to access your shared folders.
