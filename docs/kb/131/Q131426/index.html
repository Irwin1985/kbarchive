-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some Windows-based applications need direct access to a range of physical
addresses so that they can interact with memory-mapped hardware interface cards
or read the computer's CMOS settings. This article outlines two methods 16-bit
Windows-based applications can use to access a region of physical memory
directly. Neither method, however, provides memory allocation and management;
applications must use the standard memory management functions for allocating
and managing memory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method One: Exported Selectors (Preferred)
------------------------------------------

The 16-bit Windows kernel (KRNL386.EXE) exports several selectors that should be
used by 16-bit applications that need to read or write to physical memory
addresses below 1 megabyte (MB). The exported selectors are:

  __0000h, __0040h, __A000h, __B000h, __B800h, __C000h, __D000h,
  __E000h, and __F000h

To use one of these selectors, place it onto a segment register and access the
memory or create a far pointer. Here are examples using the Microsoft Macro
Assembler (MASM) and Microsoft C:

    In MASM:    extern  __0040h
                ...
                mov ax, __0040h
                mov es, ax

       In C:    extern   WORD _0040h;
                LPSTR    lpBIOSDataArea;
                ...
                /* Note the ampersand (&amp;) and underscore (_) below */ 
                lpBIOSDataArea = (LPSTR)MAKELONG(0, &amp;_0040h);

     In C++:    extern "C" WORD _0040h;
                LPSTR    lpBIOSDataArea;
                ...
                /* Note the ampersand (&amp;) and underscore (_) below */ 
                lpBIOSDataArea = (LPSTR)MAKELONG(0, &amp;_0040h);

Each of these selectors is limited to addressing 64K. Attempts to read or write
data beyond the 64K limit cause a general protection (GP) fault. Applications
must not free these selectors.

Applications should use exported selectors unless they do not provide access to
the necessary area of physical memory. In which case, you can try method two.

Method Two: Selector Synthesis
------------------------------

When an application needs to access physical memory that is not addressable with
the selectors exported from the Windows kernel, it can allocate a new selector
and initialize the associated descriptor with the appropriate base address and
limit. The Windows kernel and the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) server
(part of Windows) provide functions for applications to do this. Each required
function is described below:

Map Physical To Linear

  (DPMI: Interrupt 31h, AX=0800h) Obtains a 32-bit linear address that
  corresponds to a specified 32-bit physical address. This function is needed
  because the selector functions require linear addresses. In Windows version
  3.1 standard mode, this function is not required because linear addresses are
  the same as physical addresses.

AllocSelector(WORD wSelector)

  (Kernel) Allocates a new selector or array of tiled selectors and copies the
  attributes of wSelector to the new selectors. If the limit of wSelector is
  less than or equal to 64K, a single selector is allocated. If the limit of
  wSelector is larger than 64K, an array of tiled selectors is allocated such
  that each selector points to one 64K portion of the limit of wSelector.

FreeSelector(WORD wSelector)

  (Kernel) Frees either a single selector or an array of tiled selectors
  depending on the limit of wSelector. Frees one selector for each 64K portion
  of the limit of wSelector. The selector or array of tiled selectors being
  freed must have been allocated previously by AllocSelector. Furthermore, the
  limit of wSelector must be identical to that used by the selector as a
  parameter in the call to AllocSelector.

SetSelectorBase(WORD wSelector, DWORD dwBase)

  (Kernel) Stores the starting linear address of the desired region in the
  descriptor of wSelector.

SetSelectorLimit(WORD wSelector, DWORD dwLimit)

  (Kernel) Stores the length of the desired region in the descriptor of
  wSelector.


PrestoChangoSelector (WORD wSourceSelector, WORD wDestSelector)

  (Kernel) Copies the attributes of wSourceSelector into wDestSelector and
  toggles the code/data attribute. That is, if wSourceSelector is a code
  selector, the wDesSelector will be a copy of it, except wDestSelector has the
  data attribute instead of the code attribute. wDestSelector must have been
  allocated previously by AllocSelector.

Four Caveats to Keep in Mind
----------------------------

1. Allocating selectors does not actually allocate any memory. It merely creates
  a pointer that can be used to access existing memory (memory previously
  allocated or provided by a memory-mapped hardware device). Do not confuse
  allocating selectors with allocating memory.

2. Selectors that alias (point to) a memory block allocated by Windows are not
  updated if the memory block is moved. To ensure that the memory block is not
  be moved, call GlobalFix() on it before creating a selector that aliases it.
  However, if the synthesized selector points to memory provided by a physical
  device, there is no need to call GlobalFix() because the device's memory was
  not allocated by Windows.

3. The Windows memory manager does not keep track of which task allocated
  selectors with these functions, so you must ensure that the task frees them
  correctly. In particular, make sure it does not free more or less selectors
  than it allocates. The sample code below demonstrates the proper way to
  allocate and free selectors with these functions.

4. Allocating large numbers of selectors is discouraged because selectors are a
  limited resource.

The following code was written using the inline assembly feature of the Microsoft
C and C++ compilers. This code illustrates how to create a huge pointer to a
range of physical addresses.

Sample Code
-----------

  DWORD MapPhysicalToLinear(DWORD, DWORD);
  void __huge * CreateHugePointer (DWORD dwLinearBase,
                                   DWORD dwLength);
  void FreeHugePointer (void __huge * hPtr);

  DWORD dwPhysical, dwLinear, dwLength;
  char __huge *hpPhysMem;  // Will point to physical addresses
  WORD  segment, offset;   // These variables are necessary only
                           // if the target memory is addressed
                           // with a "real-mode" style SEG:OFFSET
                           // pointer.

  dwLinear = ((DWORD)segment &lt;&lt; 4L) + offset;

     /*

       If the selector will point to memory above 1 MB, dwPhysical
       should contain the 32-bit physical address. Call DPMI to
       convert dwPhysical to a linear address. Note that you must
       pass the physical address and the length (limit) to DPMI.
     */

                             // (for example purposes only).

       0x10000 because the segment contains byte offsets 0 to 0xFFFF.
       Note that a segment with a limit of 0 is actually a single byte
