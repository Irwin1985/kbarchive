8.  CD-ROM Problems
-------------------

COMMON SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS WITH CD-ROM DRIVES

Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs requires a minimum of a double-speed
CD-ROM drive to function properly.

NOTE: Do not remove the Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs compact disc
from your CD-ROM drive while running Home Cooking with Master Chefs . Removing
the CD will cause errors and/or incorrect displays or functionality.

If Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs cannot find the data files it
needs to run, you will see an error message prompting you to correct the
problem. To find the source of the problem, do the following:

- Make sure the Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs compact disc is
  correctly inserted into the CD-ROM drive.

- Make sure that the drive is connected to your computer correctly and that it
  is functioning in MS-DOS. If you have an external CD-ROM drive, make sure the
  power is turned on. You can test the function by viewing a directory of the
  drive in MS-DOS. For example, if your CD- ROM drive is drive D:
  1. Go to MS-DOS.

  2. At the prompt, type D: and press ENTER.

  3. Type DIR and press ENTER

- Make sure that the Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs program is
  looking for the compact disc on the correct drive. Also check that the
  MSJULIA.INI file is in the \WINDOWS subdirectory and that it points to the
  correct location.

If you still see an error message after checking the points above, check the
manuals that came with your CD-ROM drive for information on how a CD-ROM is to
be set up, or contact the company that supplied the drive.

9.  Running on Microsoft Windows 3.1
------------------------------------

To run Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs under Windows 3.1, you must
run Windows in Enhanced mode. To see if you are running Windows in Enhanced
mode, choose About Program Manager from the Program Manager Help menu (or choose
About File Manager from the File Manager Help menu ). In the bottom section of
the dialog box, you should see the phrase 386 Enhanced Mode. If you do not see
this phrase, you can force Windows to run in Enhanced mode by typing WIN/3 or
WIN/E at the DOS prompt when launching Windows.

Windows for Workgroups always runs in Enhanced mode and no message is displayed
in the About dialog box.

10.  Running on Microsoft Windows NT
------------------------------------

To run Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs on Windows NT, Setup may need
to copy some files to your system directory. In order for Setup to do this, you
must be a member of the Administrator group when you log on. Otherwise, Setup
will not be able to copy these files to your drive. You can check your user
status with the User Manager.

Home Cooking with Master Chefs runs well on Windows NT with the following
exceptions:

- The videos in Home Cooking with Master Chefs will not run on Windows NT
  version 3.1. You must have Windows NT version 3.5 or later.

- Home Cooking with Master Chefs will fail on exit if Run in Separate Memory
  Space is selected in the Properties dialog (in Program Manager, select the
  Home Cooking with Master Chefs program icon, click File, and then click
  Properties). The default setting has this option turned off so that Home
  Cooking with Master Chefs will run properly.

- Home Cooking with Master Chefs will not run on non-Intel Windows/NT machines.

- White text on a black background will not display when you run Home Cooking
  with Master Chefs using NT 3.5 or later with an ATI video driver set to
  display 65 thousand colors or 16 million colors. All you will see is a black
  box. To correct this problem, change the number of colors to 256.

11.  Running under Microsoft Windows 95
---------------------------------------

Changing your video resolution from high-resolution (800 x 600 or greater) to low
resolution (640 x 480) while running Home Cooking with Master Chefs under
Microsoft Windows 95 causes the Windows 95 taskbar to cover up part of the Home
Cooking with Master Chefs screen (primarily the button bar). To avoid this
problem, do not change your video resolution while Julia Child: Home Cooking
with Master Chefs is running. If you want to change the video resolution, close
Home Cooking with Master Chefs, change the settings, and then re-start Home
Cooking with Master Chefs.

12.  Mouse Cursor Problem
-------------------------

If you find that the mouse cursor jumps around on the screen when you perform
certain actions in Home Cooking with Master Chefs, and you are using Microsoft
IntelliPoint mouse software, you need to turn off the "snap-to" option. Open the
Control Panel, usually found in the Main group in Program Manager, and select
the Mouse option. Turn off the "snap-to" option in the Mouse Manager dialog and
then close the Mouse Manager and the Control Panel.

Solution: When you add a note to a recipe or create a shopping list, Julia Child:

on your computer in the location that Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master
Chefs was installed. If these files have been moved, deleted, or corrupted,
Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs will not run correctly. The easiest
way to correct this problem is to run Setup again.

Additionally, if Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs does not have enough
memory available to load or save the notes or shopping list files, it will shut
down or not function correctly. Please refer to the section titled Performance
Issues earlier in this document for memory, disk space issues, and swap file
information.

NOTE: Make sure the RCPNOTES.DAT and SHOPLIST.DAT files are not read- only and
the disk isn't write-protected.

Below is an example of MSJULIA.INI settings (This assumes that the CD- ROM drive
is D and that Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs has been installed on
the C drive in a directory named MSJULIA):

      [Options]
      BookDirectory=D:\msjulia
      CodeDirectory=C:\msjulia
      DataDirectory=C:\msjulia\ ( Directory location for the files
                                RCPNOTES.DAT and SHOPLIST.DAT)
      MediaDirectory=D:\msjulia\video
      ShopListFile=C:\MSJULIA\SHOPLIST.DAT
      NotesFile=C:\MSJULIA\RCPNOTES.DAT
      NoUISound=0
      NoAmbientSound=0

      [PrintOptions]
      Directions=1
      Ingredients=1

14.  Copying Recipes to the Clipboard
-------------------------------------

Because Julia Child: Home Cooking with Master Chefs uses multiple fonts to
display fractions and the Microsoft Windows Clipboard only supports a single
font at a time, copying recipes from Home Cooking with Master Chefs causes all
fractions in the ingredient list to be converted incorrectly. For example, if
you copy a recipe that calls for 1/2 pound of breadfruit to the Clipboard and
then paste it into a word processor (such as Microsoft Word) it will get
converted into 1 pound of breadfruit.

To work around this problem, while you are in the word processor (i.e. Word),
select the number(s) that should be displayed as fraction and then change the
font to MSReference 2.

NOTE: Selecting the entire recipe and then changing the font to MSReference 2
will result in misplaced fractions.
