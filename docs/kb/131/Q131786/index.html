-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install the 33rd SNA Server DLC 802.2 link service, SNA Server
Setup fails with the following error:

  The installation process failed

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server setup program generates a unique link service name during
installation of SNA Server DLC 802.2 link services. The link service names are
generated as follows:

  SNADLC1, SNADLC2, ... SNADLC9, SNADLCA, SNADLCB ... SNADLCU

However, after SNADLCU, the link service name generation fails, causing a link
service name of SNADLC to be generated for the 32nd, and all additional, link
services. When the 33rd link service is installed (with a name of SNADLC), the
32nd link service already exists with that name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to SNA Server version 2.11. Link service names
are now generated using 1 or 2 digit index with base 36. For example:

  SNADLC1, SNADLC2, ... SNADLC9, SNADLCA, ... SNADLCZ, SNADLC10, SNADLC11,
  SNADLC12, ... SNADLC19, SNADLC1A ... SNADLC1Z, SNADLC20, ...

There is no workaround for customers using SNA Server 2.0 or 2.1. These versions
are limited to 32 unique 802.2 link services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0 and 2.1.
This problem was corrected in SNA Server version 2.11.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This restriction only affects customers who want SNA Server to emulate more than
32 physical units to the same host system, through a single host TIC address. In
this configuration, a unique link service must be defined for each PU, where
each link service would be configured with a unique local SAP address. For more
information, see Q107192.

Because multiple connections to the same AS/400 are not supported, AS/400
connections are not affected For more information, see Q131625.

SNA Server supports up to 128 unique 802.2 connections over a single 802.2 link
service. The restriction described here affect only configurations involving
more than 32 802.2 link services.

Each 802.2 link service configured over a given adapter must have a unique SAP
address. The first SNA SAP address is 0x4, with subsequent SAP addresses
specified in multiples of 4 (for example, 0x04, 0x08, 0x0c, 0x10, 0x14, etc.),
through 0xEC (addresses from 0xF0-FF can't be used). Because the SAP address is
a single digit, only 59 SNA SAP addresses (and, thus SNA DLC 802.2 link
services) can be configured over one adapter.

Because the problem exists in SNA Setup when generating a link service name,
regardless of the number of LAN adapters installed in the server, adding a
second LAN adapter does not alleviate the problem.
