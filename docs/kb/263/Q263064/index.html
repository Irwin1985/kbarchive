-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Blackberry pager service can monitor multiple Exchange Server computers for
new e-mail activity. If one of the monitored Exchange Server computers goes
offline, the Blackberry pager service may stop responding, or "hang."

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because one thread is waiting for a server response to a
remote procedure call (RPC). However, a response never comes because the
Exchange Server computer is offline. In some instances, two other threads are
blocked because they are waiting for the first thread to finish, and many other
threads are blocked because they are waiting for a critical section that is held
by one of the two threads.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information Store

+----------------------------+
| File name    | Version     | 
+----------------------------+
| Emsmdb32.dll | 5.5.2652.61 | 
+----------------------------+



Install this fix on the Blackberry server. The Blackberry server acts as a client
to the Exchange Server computer. There may be more than one instance of the
Emsmdb32.dll file on the server, depending on the applications that are
installed on that server. You need to replace all instances of the Emsmdb32.dll
file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
