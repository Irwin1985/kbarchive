Display Troubleshooting Methods

Check Minimum System Requirements:

Many Microsoft games require a video adapter with at least 4 megabytes(MB) of
video memory. Make sure that the video adapter meets the minimum requirements
required to play the game.

For all boxed games please see the System Requirements listed on the box.

Use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to determine how much video memory is available.
To do this:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. Click the Display or Display 1 tab.

4. Note how much video memory is on the Approx. Total Memory line, and then
  click Exit.

NOTE: The DirectX Diagnostic tool is automatically installed with newer versions
of Microsoft DirectX.

Install the Latest Video Driver for Your Video Adapter:

For additional information about how to identify the driver version of your video
adapter, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q159487 Games: How to Determine the Version of Installed Video Driver

Contact your video adapter manufacturer to inquire about how to obtain and
install the latest video driver for your video adapter.

following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp

For additional information about how to download and install the latest version
of DirectX, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Adjust Display Settings:

Many newer Microsoft games require a video card and monitor that can run a
resolution of at least 800 x 600 at High Color (16 bit). Set your Windows
display resolution to 800 x 600 at High Color (16 bit), and then test the game.

To do so:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. Move the Desktop Area or Screen Area slider to the 800 x 600 pixels setting.

5. In the Color Palette or Colors box, click High Color (16 bit).

6. Click OK, and then click OKagain.

7. Click Yes to accept the settings.

NOTE: After changing your video resolution, you may have to adjust your monitor
settings so that your screen displays correctly. See your monitor documentation
for more information.

If you know what resolution your game is set to run at, set your Windows display
settings to the same resolution as the game. You may also try setting your
display resolution to 640 x 480 High Color (16 bit).

Check or Turn on Direct 3D:

To check or turn on Direct3D acceleration:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

3. On the Display tab, verify that all DirectX features are turned on. If any
  are disabled, click Enable next to the feature.

  NOTE: If some DirectX features are unavailable, please verify that your video
  adapter meets the minimum requirements.

Reduce Graphics Hardware Acceleration:

To reducing graphics hardware acceleration:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
  None (the Basic acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

7. Test the game. If the issue continues to occur, repeat these steps to
  increase the graphics hardware acceleration by moving the Hardware
  Acceleration slider one notch to the right (the Most acceleration setting) in
  step 4.

NOTE: If your game runs with video acceleration turned down, it may indicate that
you need to update your video driver or it may indicate that your display
adapter cannot run your game at full acceleration.

Adjust Refresh Rate:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Advanced.

4. On the Adapter tab, under Refresh Rate, select Adapter default.

5. Click OK, and then clickOK again.

Remove Multiple Adapters Using the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (Windows 95 and Windows 98 Only):

To remove multiple adapters:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag -ghost" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. Click the More Help tab.

4. Click the Inactive button.

5. Click the item on the left, and then click Backup.

6. Repeat until all the items have been removed from Inactive Window.

7. Click Exit.
