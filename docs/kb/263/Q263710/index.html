Last Modified: 28-OCT-2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If the Exchange Server computer that performs directory replication in your system does not have an anti-virus application
programming interface (API) mode virus scanner installed, this article does not apply.

SYMPTOMS
========

Replication between sites may stop working sporadically and the following event
IDs may be logged on the directory replication bridgehead servers:

  Source: MSexchangeDS
  MessageId=1102
  Severity=Warning
  During intersite replication, the directory replication agent (DRA) closed the
  connection to the mail service in response to error %1. Will attempt to
  connect again later.

  Source: MSexchangeDS
  MessageId=1103
  Severity=Warning
  During intersite replication, the directory replication agent (DRA) received a
  non-delivery report (NDR) for messages submitted for the directory at %1. The
  diagnostic is %2. The reason is %3.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 makes
virus-scanning APIs available to speed up attachment scanning.


Because of this, certain replication problems can occur if the replication
messages contain attachments. For additional information, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q259163 XADM: Recipients Cannot Open Attachments If Virus Scanning Interfaces
  Are Enabled

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, temporarily uninstall the anti-virus application
programming interface (API) scanner and apply the information store fix, build
5.5.2652.42, that is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q262491 XADM: Information Store Crashes When Using Antivirus Application
  Programming Interface

That fix includes the fix that is described in the following Knowledge Base
article:

  Q259163 XADM: Recipients Cannot Open Attachments If Virus Scanning Interfaces
  Are Enabled

Then reinstall anti-virus application programming interface (API) scanner.
