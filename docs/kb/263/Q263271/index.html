-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a collection that is based on a query in Systems Management
Server (SMS) version 2.0, the query may be removed silently when you save the
collection. Also, when this occurs, you do not receive an error message that
states the query has not been saved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In a hierarchy with multiple service pack levels, all sites that have SMS
Service Pack 2 (SP2) applied either have the query added successfully or
generate an error message. If the site does not have SP2 or higher, then the
query may not be saved by the collection when the collection is saved in the
Administrator console.

In SP2, an error message is now generated when a collection that is based on an
invalid query is created. An additional method has also been added to the
provider to validate query rules before the query runs.

The following sample query (that searches for Office 97 SR-1) does not get saved
on an SP1 or earlier site while it is saved to a collection in an SP2 site.

select distinct SMS_R_System.Name from  SMS_R_System inner join 
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile on SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.ResourceID = SMS_R_System.ResourceId where SMS_R_System.SystemRoles is NULL and (SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileName = "excel.exe" and 
(SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileVersion = "8.0a" or 
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileVersion = "8.0b" or 
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileVersion = "8.0c" or 
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileVersion = "8.0d")) or 
(SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileName = "winword.exe" and 
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileVersion = "8.0" and 
SMS_G_System_SoftwareFile.FileSize = 5324560)

The new method is:

  boolean SMS_CollectionRuleQuery::ValidateQuery([in] string WQLQuery);

This modifies the query, converts it to SQL, and allows SQL to parse the query
without actually running it. If it passes this, it should be alright.

Added validation of the rule (by using the SQL "set parseonly on/off" command,
you can have SQL validate the resulting query without actually running it) to
Membership Rule properties. This is done by using a new provider method that
validates the rule to see if it will be accepted when it is added to the
collection.
