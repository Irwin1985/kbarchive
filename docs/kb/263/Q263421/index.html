SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, collections defined at a parent site do not appear in the
collection hierarchy of a child site. A symptom of this problem is the
generation of status message "2528." This status message defines which
collection (or subcollection) is causing the problem. After the collection has
been identified, you may find that one or more of the .psd files, which are
pending in the SMS\INBOXES\Colleval.box file for the collection, are
experiencing problems.

CAUSE
=====

This problem typically occurs when defining a subcollection. When you add this
new subcollection, the parent collection (including the new subcollection) must
be copied down to the child site. This is because the addition of a
subcollection is considered a change to the parent collection.

When the collections are received at the child site, the new subcollection is
saved, but the parent is not. The parent site then checks to make sure that each
of its children exist in the database. Child sites that do not exist in the
database are placed back in the queue for reprocessing at a later time.

WORKAROUND
==========

On the parent site under collections, click Update Collection Membership for the
missing collection. It is not necessary to update all subcollections because
they will still be waiting to be processed at the child site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem seems to occur in sites that were upgraded from Systems Management
Server (SMS) 1.2 to SMS 2.0.
