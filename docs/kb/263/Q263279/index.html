-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run an advertised program on a Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation or Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional computer, the targeted
computer fails and generates the following error status message:

  10003
  An error occurred while preparing to run the program for advertisement
  "DEF20001" ("Test Running APP from Network Drive" - "Run TESTAPP from O:
  drive"). The operating system reported error 2147500037: Unspecified error
  Additional program properties: Command line: O:\TESTAPP.EXE Working
  directory: C:\WINNT\MS\SMS\clicomp\apa\Bin\ Drive letter (? = any): UNC
  Possible cause: This message most commonly occurs when the program?s
  command-line executable file could not be found, when a required drive letter
  connection to a distribution point could not be established, or when the
  program is configured to use the Windows NT Client Software Installation
  Account but the account is not specified, could not be found, or does not
  have the appropriate permissions. Solution: Check each of the items listed
  above.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when both of the following conditions are true:

- The Advertised Program's command line includes a reference to a network path.
  For example, O:\Setup.exe, where O: is mapped by the logged on user to a
  network share resource.

- The Advertised Program's environment properties specify "Run with
  Administrative rights."

WORKAROUND
==========

When advertising programs where the command lines reference network resources
directly, you can use either of the following two methods:

The Program Does Not Need to Be Run with Administrative Rights
--------------------------------------------------------------

In the Program's Environment settings, under Run Mode, click to select the "Run
with user's rights" option.

The Program Must Be Run with Administrative Rights
--------------------------------------------------

- In the Program's Environment settings, under Run Mode, click to select the
  "Run with administrative rights" option.

- Click to select the option "Use Windows NT client software installation
  account".

- For the Program command line, specify a valid UNC path, including the program
  name and any required parameters. For example:

  \\server\share\directory\setup.exe /parameter1 /parameter2

NOTE: To use the Windows NT client software installation account, some
prerequisites must be met:

- You must create a valid Windows NT client software installation account in
  the domain that is a member of at least one global group.

- You must specify the Windows NT client software installation account in the
  Site Settings, under "Component Configuration - Software Distribution".

- You must set the "Program can run:" option to "Whether or not a user is
  logged in" or "Only when no user is logged in".

MORE INFORMATION
================

A typical scenario may involve running a command line from a network resource
(other than a Systems Management Server Distribution Point) accessible by the
user. However, when the option "Run with administrative rights" is selected in
the Environment tab of a program, this forces the program to launch under the
context of the local SMSCliToknAcct&amp; account on a Windows NT Workstation or
Windows 2000 Professional computer. The SMSCliToknAcct&amp; has no access to
network resources, and the attempt to execute the program fails. A connection is
provided to valid distribution points by the Systems Management Server Client so
it does not have to authenticate against the network.

installation account, click the article number below to view the article in the
