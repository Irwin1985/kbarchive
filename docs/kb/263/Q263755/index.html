The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The Migration Wizard that is included with Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1
and later allows you to migrate mailboxes and calendars from Lotus Notes. The
documentation that is included with these service packs contains instructions
about how to use command-line options to migrate information from a Lotus Notes
server. However, this documentation is incomplete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1, the Readme.rtf file contains the
instructions about how to use the Migration Wizard to migrate information from
Lotus Notes. In Exchange Server 5.5 Service Packs 2 and 3, the Readmigr.rtf file
contains these instructions.

The existing instructions include the following text:

  

  Using Command-Line Options
  --------------------------

  You can run the Migration Wizard using a combination of command-line options
  and a control file. For general information on command-line options, see
  Microsoft Exchange Server Migration, which is included in the Exchange Server
  5.5 documentation.

  The specific control file option for migrating from a Lotus Notes server is
  Mode and the value is NOTES.

  The accounts file, specified by the Accounts option in the control file, lists
  the specific accounts to migrate. The format for names in the optional
  accounts file is different than the format that appears in the Migration
  Wizard. To list specific accounts, use the following format:

  &lt;First name&gt; &lt;Last name&gt;/&lt;Notes Organization Name&gt;

  For example: Maria Black/FergBard

  If the Lotus Notes address book uses the Middle Initial field, use the
  following format:

  &lt;First name&gt; &lt;Initial&gt; &lt;Last name&gt;/&lt;Notes Organization
  Name&gt;

  For example: Maria R Black/FergBard

  NOTE: Any option that applies when Mode is CCMAIL also applies when Mode is
  NOTES.

The above text from the existing instructions does not indicate that the
following keywords can be used in the control file when you migrate from a Lotus
Notes server:

- Notesini: Location of the Notes.ini file. This keyword is required. By
  default, the Migration Wizard attempts to locate the file in the Winnt
  folder.

- Accounts: Location of the file that contains a list of user accounts to
  migrate. This keyword is required. By default, the Migration Wizard migrates
  all of the user accounts on the Lotus Notes post office.

- Schedule: Specifies whether or not to extract schedule information. This
  keyword is optional. The valid values for this keyword are TRUE and FALSE.
  The default value is TRUE.

- Tasks: Specifies whether or not to migrate tasks. This keyword is optional.
  The valid values for this keyword are TRUE and FALSE. The default value is
  TRUE.

- DocLinkConversion: Specifies how Lotus Notes document links are converted
  within the messages being migrated. This keyword is optional. The valid
  values for this keyword are:

   - URL: Document links are converted to hyperlinks within the message.
   - OLE: Document links are converted to OLE attachments within the message.
   - RTF: Document links are converted to Rich Text Format (RTF) attachments
     within the message.

  The default value is RTF.

All of the other keywords that you can use for a Lotus Notes migration are the
same as the keywords that you use for a Lotus cc:Mail migration.

When you use command-line options to migrate information from a Lotus Notes
server, use the following syntax

  "mailmig /c:control file /a:User.ID file /p:password" (without the quotation
  marks)

where control file is the location of the Notes.ini file, User.ID file is the
location of the Lotus Notes User.ID file, and password is the password
associated with the User.ID file.

the Migration Wizard and the keywords that you can use in the control file,
