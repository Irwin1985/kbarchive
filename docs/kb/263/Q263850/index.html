-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 SP2 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0, used with:
   - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user uses Exchange Client 5.0 (version 5.0.1457.3) running on a Windows
2000 Professional-based computer to connect to an Exchange Server 5.0 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) computer, the user may not be able to forward e-mail messages that
contain attachments. When the user opens an e-mail item that contains an
attachment and clicks Forward, the user may receive the following error
message:

  The item could not be opened.

When the user clicks OK, the user receives the following error message:

  The action could not be completed.

When the user clicks OK, the user receives the original error message again.

The user can forward e-mail messages that do not contain attachments. If the user
configures an Offline Storage (.ost) file and works offline, this problem does
not occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains
this fix.

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
