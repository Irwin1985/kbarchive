-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management server (SMS) site server, the SMS Executive service may
appear to stop responding (hang) after startup. When this occurs, most of the
threads of the SMS Executive service may not record anything in their respective
logs (if logging is enabled). There are no error messages in either the Event
Log or the SMS status system.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur after another program that uses shared ODBC DLL files has
updated those DLL files to a substantially newer version than the version that
is included with the currently installed SMS service pack. This can cause the
initialization of the License Metering thread of the SMS Executive service to
fail, and can generate the following message in the service context:

  ODBCINT.DLL - the version of this DLL is not valid.

  Hit OK to continue or CANCEL to quit.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: The following workaround may cause interoperability or compatibility
issues with the third-party program that updated the DLL files. Because of this,
you should use caution if you decide to proceed with the following workaround.

To work around this issue, restore the following ODBC DLL files from the
\SMS\Bin\i386\System32 folder on the SMS 2.0 service pack CD-ROM you are using
to the %windir%\System32 folder on the SMS site server after you stop all SMS
services:

  Odbc16gt.dll
  Odbc32.dll
  Odbc32gt.dll
  Odbccp32.dll
  Odbccr32.dll
  Odbcint.dll
  Odbctrac.dll

For example, the SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) version of these DLL files should
be 3.510.3002.13. Right-click a file, and then click Properties to view the file
version information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cisco Secure version 2.4 (a RAS Access software), is known to update these
shared ODBC DLL files.

You can start SMS Executive service as a console program by starting a command
prompt on the site server, changing the current working directory to
%windir%\System32, and then using the "D:\sms\bin\i386\smsexec.exe /e" (without
the quotation marks) command.

This generates messages about DLL version conflicts on the desktop that otherwise
would be present in the service context.
