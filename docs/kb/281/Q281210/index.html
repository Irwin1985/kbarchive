-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some cases, the CPU usage on a Systems Management Server (SMS) client or
server computer may reach 100 percent and may remain at 100 percent. This
article describes one potential cause of this behavior.

Note that the behavior that is described in this article is not the only cause of
100-percent CPU usage on an SMS client or server computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the logging that is performed by the SMS client or
server services in conjunction with the Cheyenne InocuLAN antivirus program
cause the CPU usage to reach 100 percent. This behavior has been observed in,
but is not limited to, the Smsapm32 client-side process and the Sms_Executive
service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

- Stop the Cheyenne InocuLAN antivirus server service

  -or-

- Disable all logging for the SMS process or processes that are involved

NOTE: In some cases where hardware is either extremely busy or underpowered, you
may have to spend a considerable amount of time to move through and stop the
InocuLAN service.

RESOLUTION

To resolve this behavior, use InocuLAN driver version 5.0.4521.1 or later for
Microsoft Windows 2000 or InocuLAN driver version 4.0.4521.1 for Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0. This driver is located in the Ino_fltr.sys file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CPU usage can remain at 100 percent until you stop the InocuLAN service or
restart the computer.

To check the version of your driver, click the Version tab in the properties of
the Ino_fltr.sys file in the Winnt\System32\Drivers folder. Note that you must
restart your computer to replace the existing driver files.
