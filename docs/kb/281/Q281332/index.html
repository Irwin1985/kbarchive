The information in this article applies to:

- Interix versions 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running Server Manager or User Manager for Domains results in the following
error message:

  Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service. Do you
  want to select another domain to administer?

The primary domain controller (PDC) may have 2,048 \PIPE\samr connections.
Rebooting the PDC temporarily alleviates the problem.


This article deals specifically with causes related to running Microsoft Interix
software in your environment.

CAUSE
=====

When using the Interix software at the clients' Windows NT or 2000 domain,
administrators may notice a high number of connections to the \Samr named PIPE.
Looking at a Windows NT 4.0 domain controller, these connections show up with a
blank username. When looking at a Windows 2000 domain controller, they show up
with the username of the client's computer name with a dollar sign ($) at the
end.

If the number of connections exceeds the 2048 samr connection count limit on a
given domain controller, that domain controller may return errors when
performing samr operations.

In a master domain environment, all of the client SAMR connections go to the PDC.
For performance reasons the Interix client does not close all handles to the SAM
(Security Account Manager) database on the domain controller. The Interix
software makes heavy use us SID to name translation, which requires this
connection.

In addition, a bug exists where only in a master domain environment the domain
controller contacted is the PDC. In a resource domain environment the client
correctly picks any domain controller for the connection, which may or may not
be the PDC.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Interix service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date       Time    Version    Size     File name   Platform
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  03/05/2001 9:34PM  2.2.428.7  129,552  Posix.exe   Intel
  03/05/2001 9:35PM  2.2.428.7   96,960  Psxdll.dll  Intel
  03/05/2001 9:33PM  2.2.428.7   58,672  Psxrun.exe  Intel
  03/05/2001 9:34PM  2.2.428.7  524,160  Psxss.exe   Intel


To resolve this problem, follow two steps on the Interix client computers. First,
install the Interix hotfix from this article. After you apply the fix, samr
traffic is distributed to other domain controllers and not to the PDC. The fix
also enables the DCSweepInterval registry key. This key specifies how often the
client should close the samr connections with the server. To apply the fix:

1. Install the Interix fix from this article.

2. Use the following steps to add the DCSweepInterval key to the registry:

  a. Click Start, click Run, type "regedit32" (without the quotation marks) in
     the Open box, and then press ENTER.

  b. Locate and click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Softway Systems\Interix

  c. Click Add Value on the Edit menu, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value name: DCSweepInterval
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Decimal
  Value: Number of seconds for every "sweep" of the domain controller cache

3. Quit Registry Editor.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The reason that the connections show up as no user is because the Interix client
makes the connection with the system context (NULL connection).
