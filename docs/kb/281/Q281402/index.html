-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some systems encounter Internet Information Services (IIS) failures, logon
problems, and Dr. Watson exceptions after security patches are applied.

CAUSE
=====

The patch may have been installed before all components were at the required
service pack level. All components need to be at the service pack level that is
described in the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that are associated with the
service packs.

NOTE: Even if you have previously applied Service Pack 5 or Service Pack 6a, it
is possible to have some older dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) if you have
installed other software that has replaced them.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have not yet installed the security patch, apply the service pack before
you install the patch.

If you have already installed the patch and are now experiencing IIS, File
Transfer Protocol (FTP), or similar problems, follow these steps to resolve the
problem:

1. Type "prmcan4i -x" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt to
  extract the files within the hotfix executable file.

2. Type "hotfix -y /m" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt to
  unistall the hotfix.

3. Reapply the service pack and restart your computer.

4. Type "prmcan4i" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt to
  reinstall the hotfix.

5. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Refer to the Knowledge Base article that is associated with the security update
for more information. To determine which Knowledge Base article is associated
with the security update, read the security bulletin that is associated with the
patch.
