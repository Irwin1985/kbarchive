SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Active Directory Services For Microsoft
Windows 2000 Technical Reference, ISBN 0-7356-0624-2.

The following topics are covered:

- Page 129: Incorrect Statement About Group Policy Inheritance

- Page 170: Incorrect Information About Distributed Security Client

- Page 313: CaseIgnoreString Settings Incorrect

- Page 357: Incorrect Information About Trust Relationship Between Domain Trees

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 129: Incorrect Statement About Group Policy Inheritance
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 129, it states that a Group Policy can be inherited/proagated across
domains. This is incorrect. A Group Policy is never inherited across domains.
You must explicitly link a GPO from another domain in order to apply Group
Policies across domains.

On page 129, ignore the first sentence in the last paragraph:

"The reason these domains were put into this domain tree structure was so that a
Group Policy could be set in the mfg.corp.iseminger.com domain and propagated to
all domains in the tree."


Page 130: Incorrect Statement About Group Policy Inheritance
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 130, it states that a Group Policy can be inherited/proagated across
domains. This is incorrect. A Group Policy is never inherited across domains.
You must explicitly link a GPO from another domain in order to apply Group
Policies across domains.

On page 130, ignore the third bulleted item:

"A Group Policy can flow down a domain tree, and such inheritance can make the
application of administratively controlled Group Policy objects easier to
control."


Page 170: Incorrect Information About Distributed Security Client
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On page 170, in the "Real World" box at the top of the page, remove:

"If you aren't using Windows 2000 on all your clients, you can upgrade Windows
95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4 Server and Workstation computers to the
Distributed Security Client. The distributed Security Client software is
available free from http://www.microsoft.com and includes Kerberos V5 security
software."

Note: At the time of writing, the Distributed Security Client was in the works,
and planned for release. Since publication, that software has been pulled and
will not be offered by Microsoft.


Page 313: CaseIgnoreString Settings Incorrect
---------------------------------------------

On page 313, in the table under the columns oMSyntax and attribute-Syntax, for
CaseIgnoreString, change the settings from:

"0 attributeSyntax 2.5.5.4"

To:

"20 attributeSyntax 2.5.5.4"


Page 357: Incorrect Information About Trust Relationship Between Domain Trees
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 357, under "You can add a new domain tree to a forest", it states, both
in the text and in Figure 13-1, that an explicit trust must be established
between the forest root and the top domain of any trees that you add. This is
incorrect.

Change:
"When you deploy multiple trees in a forest, you must establish an explicit trust
between the forest root and the top domain of any trees that you add."

To:
"Each time you create a new domain tree in a forest, a two-way transitive trust
relationship is created implicitly (automatically) between the forest root and
the top domain of any trees that you add."

Figure 3.1 is incorrect both in caption and illustration. For a correct
illustration of the trust relationship between domain trees in a forest, please
refer to the "Understanding domain trusts" section in Windows 2000 Server Help.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
