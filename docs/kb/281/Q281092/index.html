MORE INFORMATION
================

Page lxi: Incorrect Reference About Glossary
--------------------------------------------

On page lxi, in the second bulleted item,

Change:
"The glossary (presented only in the e-book version, located on the Supplemental
Materials CD-ROM) provides definitions for..."

To:
"The glossary provides definitions for..."


Page 11:  Reference To Missing Appendix B
-----------------------------------------

On page 11, the Note in Exercise 1 indicates that "If you need to create the
Setup disks, see Appendix B, 'Creating Setup Boot Disks.'" However, Appendix B
is not included in the book.

The self-extracting archive file, W2kAAppB.exe, contains an AppendixB.txt file.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  W2kAAppB.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win2000platform/mspress/1.0/NT5/EN-US/W2kAAppB.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


Page 20: Winnet.exe And Winnet32.exe Should Be Winnt.exe And Winnt32.exe
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 20, in step 3,

Change:
"Use Winnet.exe for an installation using Windows 3.x on the source system, and
use Winnet32.exe for an installation using Windows 95, 98, NT4.0..."

To:
"Use Winnt.exe for an installation using Windows 3.x on the source system, and
use Winnt32.exe for an installation using Windows 95, 98, NT4.0..."


Page 466: Incorrect Path
------------------------

On page 466, in step 21, change:
"\chapt03\"

To:
"\chapt08\"


Page 572: Incorrect Arrow Directions In Figure 10.1
---------------------------------------------------

In Figure 10.1 on page 572, the arrow directions for step 1 and step 8 are
transposed.

These arrows should be reversed, with step 1 pointing upward to the Local Name
Server, and step 8 pointing downward to the DNS Client.


Page 625: Duplicate Entries For "044 WINS/NBNS Servers"
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 625, in Table 11.3, there are duplicate entries for "044 WINS/NBNS
servers". The first entry should be ignored.


Page 629: Incorrect Steps In "Follow these steps to allow dynamic updates for DHCP clients that do not support Dynamic DNS updates"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 629, in the bulleted section, there is a list of the steps for enabling
the "dynamic update for DHCP clients that do not support dynamic DNS updates"
option through the DNS management console. This is incorrect, as this option is
enabled through the DHCP, not DNS, management console.

Change:
"1. Click Start, point to Program, point to Administrative Tools, then click
DNS.
2. In the console tree, click the applicable zone."
...

"5. Select Only Secure Updates If Your Zone Type is Active
Directory-Integrated."

To:
"1. Click Start, point to Program, point to Administrative Tools, then click
DHCP.
2. In the console tree, click the applicable server."
...

"5. Click Start, point to Program, point to Administrative Tools, then click
DNS.
6. In the console tree, click the applicable zone.
7. In the General property tab, select Only Secure Updates if your zone type is
Active Directory-integrated."


Page 1055: Incorrect Term For AGP
---------------------------------

On page 1055 in the bottom-right "Solution" column, change:

".. Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) permission is ..."

To:
".. Apply Group Policy (AGP) permission is ..."


Page 1071: Incorrect Lesson Reference
-------------------------------------

On page 1071, in the "Important" note,

Change:
"Refer to the "RIS Server and Client Requirements" section in Lesson 6,
"Implementing RIS," before attempting to set up RIS."

To:
"Refer to the "RIS Server and Client Requirements" section in Lesson 5 before
attempting to set up RIS."


Pages 1182 and 1183: Incorrect Path For Installing Terminal Services Client
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 1182 and 1183, steps 11 and 15 are identical.

On page 1182, remove step 11.

On page 1183,

Change:
"15. In the Open text box, type \\server01\c$\ProgramFiles\terminalServicesClient
and then click OK"

To:
"15. In the Open text box, type
\\server01\c$\WINNT\system32\clients\tsclient\win32\disks\disk1 and then click
OK"
