SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the guidelines for moving a mailbox that has been
configured with Event Service scripts that are installed in the Inbox folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you move a mailbox, the script(s) must be detached from the Inbox folder
before the mailbox is moved. This procedure prevents issues from occurring after
the move operation is complete, for example, a disabled Agents tab on the
Outlook client.

NOTE: The Microsoft Exchange Event Service must be installed and working properly
on the server that the mailbox is moved to.

To move a mailbox with Event Service scripts:

1. Log on to the mailbox that you are going to move, right-click the Inbox
  folder, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Agents tab, and then click Edit.

3. Cut and paste the script in a text file, and then save this file to a disk to
  ensure that you have a copy of the original script.

4. Repeat this process for all scripts that are installed on the mailbox.

5. After you have saved a copy of the script, delete each script that is
  installed in the mailbox's Inbox folder.

6. Move the mailbox from the source to the destination server, and then verify
  that this operation was completed successfully.

7. Add this mailbox to Client Permissions in the EventsConfig system folder on
  the new server.

8. Log on to the mailbox on the new server.

9. Right-click the Inbox folder, and then click Properties.

10. Click the Agents tab and reinstall the script(s) in the mailbox's Inbox
  folder.

11. Verify that you have entered the new server's name in the Server box on the
  Agents tab. This step ensures that the script is installed in that server's
  EventsConfig system folder.
