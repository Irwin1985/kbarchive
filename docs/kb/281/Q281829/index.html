SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to upgrade Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 with
Service Pack 3 (SP3).

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you upgrade SMS 2.0 with SP3, the steps to upgrade may vary depending on
the status of your current SMS 2.0 installation. Please read these instructions
completely before you download SP3 for SMS 2.0.

NOTE: SMS 2.0 SP3 and all future SMS service packs require that SMS 2.0 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) be installed before you upgrade. It is recommended that you install
the SMS 2.0 SP2 Full Installation CD. Information about how to obtain this CD is
available later in this article.

SMS 2.0 SP3 supports the following installation methods:

- A new secondary site installation that is created from the SP3 CD source.

- The SMS Administrator console installation that is installed using the SP3 CD
  source.

- A primary site upgrade from an existing SMS 2.0 SP2 site only.

- A secondary site upgrade from an existing SMS 2.0 SP2 secondary site only.

- An SMS Administrator console upgrade from an existing SMS 2.0 SP2 console
  only.

- Removing an SMS 2.0 SP3 site.

- Modifying or resetting an SMS 2.0 SP3 site.

SMS 2.0 SP3 does not support the following methods:

- A primary site installation that does not have an existing SMS 2.0 SP2 site.
  Note that SP3 can only upgrade a primary site.

- An installation which uses an SP3 installation image to add optional
  components to an SP2 site.

SMS 2.0 SP3 requires SP2 for installation. If you need to upgrade an SMS 2.0
primary site, secondary site, or Administrator console that has not already been
upgraded to SP2, you must first upgrade it to SP2, and then upgrade it to SP3.

For additional information about determining whether the SMS-based server has SP2
installed, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

- Members of volume programs such as Open or Select can order the SP2 Full
  Installation CD by calling 1-800-248-0655.

- Retail customers can order the SP2 Full Installation CD as replacements for
  existing SP1 or no service pack (noSP) media by calling Microsoft Sales at
  1-800-426-9400.

- The SP2 Full Installation CD is shipped with all new SMS 2.0 Server Licenses.

- The SP2 Full Installation CD is located in the August 2000 issue of Microsoft
  Select.

- The SP2 Full Installation CD is included with all SMS products that are
  shipped after July 2000.

  site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/downloads/sms20sp2.asp

NOTE: The SP2 Upgrade CD can be also be ordered from this Web site.
- The SP2 Upgrade CD is located in the August 2000 issue of TechNet.

If your SMS 2.0 installation already has SP 2 installed, you can download SP3
from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/downloads/sms20sp3.asp

NOTE: SP3 does not use the CD Patch tool that is used in the previous SMS SP1 and
SP2 downloads.

Installing SP3
--------------

To install SMS 2.0 SP3, follow these steps:

1. Download the language version of SP3 that you need to a local computer.

  that you want to upgrade.

4. Run Setup.exe from the SP3 image that you extracted.
