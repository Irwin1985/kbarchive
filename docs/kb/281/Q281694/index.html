SUMMARY
=======

Many SDLC and X.25 link services rely on adding appropriate drivers for use by
SNA Server. However, some adapters from Eicon Networks install a WAN layer and
use an external configuration program to configure settings such as NRZ/NRZI,
dial or point-to-point, packet size, and poll address.

This article describes how to install and configure the Eicon S-51 Adapter on
Windows NT 4.0.

Some of the following information is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base
article Q147625, Configuring Connections Using Eicon SDLC Link Services. This
article is intended to be a step-by-step guide specifically for Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0.

Installation in Microsoft Windows 2000 is detailed in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

  Q281774 Install Eicon S-51 Link Service in Windows 2000

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps draw a general outline of how to install and configure an
Eicon adapter. Specific details follow.

1. Physically install the adapter into the system and configure hardware
  resources.

2. Logically install the adapter into the operating system.

3. Configure the adapter using the Eicon Administration program.

4. Install drivers for SNA Server.

5. Install the Eicon Link Service for use by Microsoft SNA Server.

The adapter drivers and INF files are included in Windows NT 4.0 distribution
media, but newer drivers may be installed from the Connections for Windows NT
CD-ROM from Eicon Networks or downloaded from the Eicon Web site
(http://www.eicon.com). Drivers for Microsoft SNA Server are included with SNA
Server 3.0 and 4.0 and are also available on the Eicon distribution media or
downloaded from the Eicon Web site.

The following instructions assume that the latest drivers available from Eicon
will be used.

To install an Eicon adapter for use by Microsoft SNA Server running on Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0:

1. In Control Panel, open the Network utility, and then select Adapter.

2. Select Add, click Have disk, browse to the directory with the updated
  connections for Windows NT software, and then click OK.

3. A "Select OEM Option" screen is presented with Eicon WAN Adapters listed.
  Click OK.

4. An Eicon WAN Services Installation screen appears next. Choose Automatic
  Installation. The installation will continue with program group and
  destination directory information and then begin the search for adapters.

5. Once the adapters have been located, the program will display the card type,
  I/O port, Interrupt Request (IRQ) and base memory the card is using. Save
  this information for later, and then click OK to complete the process.

6. Start the Eicon Configuration program (ECAdmin.exe), which is added to the
  Start menu when the adapter is installed.

7. The configuration program layout is layered. Select the displayed card, S51
  for example. Double-click on the adapter to display the IRQ, I/O port, and
  other information. The top layer sets up whether the card is dial or direct,
  X.25, SDLC, PPP, HDLC, or frame relay. The next layer is the protocol.
  Assuming SDLC, the window size, frame size and link station (poll address)
  are set along with the T1, T2, and T3 timers. The next layer sets the
  time-outs for connection. And the last layer, labeled Sync, sets the line
  interface, duplex, type, modem interface, data encoding, and clocking. This
  is where to configure NRZ/NRZI, RS232/V.35 and other line-related settings.
  The information in SNA Server Manager should match these settings. If
  different from SNA Server, these are the operative settings, as documented in
  Q14762.

  The card configuration is complete. Now the Microsoft SNA Server must be
  configured to use this adapter.

8. To add the Eicon Link Service from the SNA Server Manager, from the Tools
  menu, choose External Link Services (Linkset.exe). Select Links, and then
  click Add. A message box will list the available link services. Choose Other,
  and then enter the path to the location of the Eicon SNA Link Service files.
  The tool is looking for a .INF file accompanied by a .SRL file, which is the
  installation script.

9. A link services setup screen is presented. Set the options in this screen to
  match the settings in the Eicon Configuration program, and then click
  continue.

10. On the next screen, select the newly installed link service, and then click
  continue. This procedure will add the link service to the link services
  folder for use by a connection.
