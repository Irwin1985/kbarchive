IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When content is located on a UNC share, File Change Notifications are lost.
Changes to the content are not detected and cached content is sent to the
client. This affects both static content and dynamic ASP content that is located
on a UNC share.

CAUSE
=====

An unexpected network problem causes the File Change Notification request to be
lost. This can be the result of any number of network related problems that
cause the current session between IIS and the file server to close. When a
request is made for content that is not in the cache, a new session may get
established if the network conditions that caused the initial session to close
have been resolved. However, IIS does not request File Change Notifications
again. Therefore, any new content changes do not appear until the Web service is
stopped and restarted.

NOTE: If the cause of the File Change Notification being lost is due to the
connection being closed or reset from the IIS server, make sure that you apply
the hotfix for Q282185. This hotfix corrects an issue where the redirector
incorrectly parses server message block (SMB) packets and closes the session
unexpectedly. For additional information, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q282185 Indexing Service Loses File System Change Notification Request

WORKAROUND
==========

As a troubleshooting step and/or workaround, disable ASP and static file
caching:

To disable ASP file caching:

1. Open the Internet Service Manager (ISM).

2. Right-click the &lt;computer name&gt;, and then click Properties.

  where &lt;computer name&gt; is the name of your computer.

3. Click Edit to edit the WWW Service Master Properties.

4. On the Home Directory tab, click Configuration.

5. On the Process Options tab, select the "Do not cache ASP files" option.

6. Click Apply, and then click OK to save your changes and then restart IIS.

To disable static file caching editing registry warning: WARNING: If you use
Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you
to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can
solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.
You must add a value to the registry:

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inetinfo\Parameters

DisableMemoryCache: REG_DWORD: 1

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in IIS 4.0 and 5.0. This problem
was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some network related problems do not cause the server message block (SMB)
session between IIS and the file server to be lost. Instead, File Change
Notifications are simply not returned or do not contain valid file information,
which causes IIS to miss changes to the content. This fix cannot address those
kinds of issues. Also, there are several conditions that can cause this symptom.
Some of these conditions can cause the problem to persist or cause performance
degradation, even when you apply the fix listed in this article. In these cases,
it is necessary to identify why the File Change Notifications are not being
returned or why they do not contain valid information.

Some of the known issues and conditions are listed in this section.
Troubleshooting information is provided to help identify the root cause of the
symptoms.

Common Causes for Losing File Change Notifications
--------------------------------------------------

Some common causes for losing or not establishing File Change Notifications are
loss of network connectivity, lack of permissions or invalid user accounts,
exceeding the maximum command limit or work contexts for the redirector or
server, the file server not returning complete information, or the file server
not returning any notification at all.

  a Remote UNC Path

  Q271148 MaxMpxCt and MaxCmds Limits in Windows 2000

Loss of Network Connectivity:

The network connection, on which the SMB session is established, may become
disconnected. Therefore, the SMB session is lost. When the SMB session is lost,
open file and directory handles are invalidated. Directory handles are used to
establish File Change Notifications. Prior to this hotfix, when a session loss
occurs, IIS loses any outstanding File Change Notifications and does not try to
re-establish them, because the directory handle being used becomes invalid. With
this fix, IIS now attempts to re-establish file change notifications on the
first successful re-connection of an SMB session. For example, the next time an
HTML file is retrieved from the file server, a new SMB session is created. At
this time, IIS also attempts to re-establish File Change Notifications.

Loss of network connectivity can occur for several reasons, including hardware
problems, bugs in the client redirector, or bugs in the server code. One known
cause is a bug in the Microsoft Windows 2000 redirector. This bug has been
addressed by the fix included in Q282185. By using a network analyzer, you
should be able to determine where the loss of connectivity is originating. See
the "Troubleshooting" section of this article for more information.

Lack of Permissions or Invalid User Accounts:

For File Change Notifications to work, a directory handle must be created on the
directory in question. When an SMB session is established, a specific user
context is used. This context must have sufficient permissions to create a file
handle on any of the directories. The account used by IIS is the account created
when the virtual directory or Web site is created and a UNC path is used. The
"Connect As" account must be an account with sufficient permissions on the file
server for the directory tree in question. A supported configuration is the use
of a domain account that is trusted by both servers. Often, users want to use
non-domain accounts or no account at all (also known as Pass-Through
Authentication). This method is not supported by Microsoft. Additionally, mapped
drives are also not supported. This often fails because when IIS first starts,
it enumerates the virtual directories, which include virtual directories on UNC
shares, and then attempts to create a directory handle for each and establish
File Change Notifications on them. This can fail because there is no account, an
account without sufficient permissions, or an account that is unknown to the
target file server. In those cases, the SMB session is not established or is
established with a guest account that does not have proper permissions.

Exceeding the Maximum Command Limit or Work Contexts for the Redirector or Server:

This can occur if the amount of long term commands is greater than the negotiated
maximum command limit between the client (IIS server) and file server. If an IIS
server has a large number of sites or virtual directories mapped to a UNC path,
they can exceed these limits. The solution is to increase the values for MaxCmds
on the IIS server and MaxMpxCt on the file server side. This is important
because each outstanding File Change Notification requires a work context. If
there are not enough work contexts or if MaxCmds is too low, some File Change
Notification requests will not be satisfied. The limit that can be used is the
lesser of MaxCmds or MaxMpxCt, and the explicit number is sent from the server
to the client in the negotiation part of an SMB session setup.

  Q221790 IIS Runs Out of Work Items and Causes RPC Failures When Connecting to
  a Remote UNC Path

  Q271148 MaxMpxCt and MaxCmds Limits in Windows 2000

The File Server Does Not Return Complete Information or the File Server Does Not Return Any Notification:

When a File Change Notification is requested, IIS specifies whether to be
notified only for changes in the current directory or to include changes in any
subdirectories. ASP specifies only the current directory, and IIS specifies to
include subdirectories. If the file server responds to a File Change
Notification that occurs in a subdirectory, but it does not send complete path
information, it is not possible to know which file in the cache to flush.
Therefore, it will appear that IIS did not respond to the File Change
Notification. A common indicator that this is a problem is that ASP pages in
that same subdirectory may seem to get updated, while static HTML content does
not. In other cases, a file server may respond with a status other than SUCCESS,
but not include any other file change information. In that case, the return is
ignored and treated as an error. This is normal. Some Samba systems exhibit this
behavior. Another situation that can occur is a file server that does not send a
notification at all. This can occur with system that attempt to multiplex their
replies. For example, if a change occurs in a directory that IIS and ASP have
both requested File Change Notifications for, the file server should send two
replies; however, it may only respond to one. In each of these cases, analyzing
a network trace will show what is occurring.

Troubleshooting
---------------

It is important to note some common troubleshooting tools and methods that apply
to all causes of this symptom. Because the problem is network related, almost
all of the causes can be identified by examining the network traffic between the
IIS server and the file server. A network capture tool, such as Microsoft
Network Monitor, can often provide the most useful and complete information in
determining the cause. For example, by using Microsoft Network Monitor, the
following steps have proved very effective in capturing the needed network
traffic for inspection.

The goal in using a network analyzer is to see all of the communication between
IIS and the file server from the time that IIS starts until the File Change
Notifications stop occurring, as indicated by stale content, and so on. Although
this can result in a large capture file, it is necessary to capture valid data.
An incomplete network trace can waste more time than it saves.

1. Stop all IIS services, and make sure that the IIS process is not running. In
  IIS 4.0, you can do this by closing the Internet Information Server
  Management console, and then running the following command at a CMD prompt:

  "NET STOP IISADMIN /Y" (without the quotation marks)

  In IIS 5.0, you can do this by closing the Internet Services Manager console,
  and then running the following command at a CMD prompt:

  "iisreset /stop" (without the quotation marks)

  Verify that the IIS process is not running by checking the Task Manager to
  make sure Inetinfo.exe is not loaded.

2. Configure Network Monitor. Start Network Monitor on the IIS server and
  configure it to capture data on the network between the IIS server and the
  file server where the content resides. To do this:

  a. On the Capture menu, click Networks.

  b. Choose the correct interface that is used to communicate with the file
     server.

  c. Configure the buffer settings to allow enough space to capture the entire
     communication up until the problem occurs. The size needed depends on the
     load as well as how long it takes before the problem appears. Common sizes
     are 100 MB to 2 GB. To set the buffer size, click Buffer Settings on the
     Capture menu, enter the size, and then make sure that the Frame Size is
     set to Full.

  d. Set a trigger to stop the tracing when the buffer is full. To do this,
     click Trigger on the Capture menu, select Buffer Space, and then choose
     100%. For Trigger Action, select Stop Capture.

3. Start capturing. To do this, click Start on the Capture menu.

4. Start the IIS services. In IIS 4.0, you can do this by running the following
  command at a CMD prompt:

  "NET START W3SVC" (without the quotation marks)

  In IIS 5.0, you can do this by running the following command at a CMD prompt:

  "iisreset /start" (without the quotation marks)

5. When the problem occurs, stop the capture. To do this, click the Capture
  menu, and then click Stop. If the capture has stopped automatically because
  of the trigger and the problem has not yet occurred, you need to repeat the
  above steps by using a larger buffer.

6. When the problem has been captured successfully, save the capture by clicking
  the File menu, and then clicking Save As.

NOTE: Although it is common to set filters to reduce the size of the trace, it is
not recommended, because important frames may be missed. Microsoft recommends
that you do not have any Microsoft Windows Explorer windows open or any mapped
drives to the file server on the IIS server. This will reduce the number of
sessions and applications that make File Change Notifications, so that the trace
only contains the sessions and notifications for IIS. This makes analyzing the
trace much easier.

Things to Look for in the Captured Trace:

The first things to identify in the trace are the SMB sessions that were
established when IIS first started. This shows the account context used, as well
as the negotiated worker contexts. You also want to identify that File Change
Notification requests that were sent by IIS for each of the virtual directories.
File Change Notification requests are long term commands, because the server
does not reply to them until a file change actually occurs. When you have
verified that they were sent from IIS, see if any were replied to by the server.
Typically, you should use a known file that is not getting updated. For example,
if Test.htm in a directory that has stale content, verify that a File Change
Notification request was made for that directory or its parent directory (with
the watch subdirectories flag set), and then see if the file server ever replies
that a change was made. Examining the traces requires some knowledge of the SMB
(CIFS) spec. In general, once you have found a File Change Notification request,
you can use the MID (Multiplex ID) to find any corresponding reply from the
server.
