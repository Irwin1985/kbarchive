The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you configure Windows NT 4.0 to use Windows NT LAN Manager version 2 (also
known as NTLMv2), your computer may not be able to connect to network resources.
When you attempt to use the "net use" command to connect to a shared resource,
you may receive error 1788. This error message maps to the following error
message:

  The trust relationship between the primary domain and the trusted domain
  failed.

Also, after you try to connect to a computer that is in a different domain, the
secure channel between the domains appears to be broken.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the computer that is configured with NTLMv2 tries to
authenticate because the computer looks at the wrong data in the buffer. When
this occurs, the authenticating computer returns ACCESS_DENIED to the calling
computer which causes the secure channel to be broken.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

- If computer 2 is the domain controller for domain 2

  -and-

- If there is a two-way trust between domain 1 and domain 2

  -and-

- If workstation 1 is a member of domain 1

  -and-

- If user 2 is a user in domain 2
