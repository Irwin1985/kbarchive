-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If multiple, dependent local Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC)
LUs are configured with the Member of default outgoing local APPC LU pool check
box enabled, and an APPC or Common Programming Interface for Communications
(CPIC) application specifies a blank Local LU alias when it attempts to allocate
a conversation to a Remote APPC LU, the APPC or CPIC application may fail to get
a LU 6.2 session.

The exact symptoms depend upon the APPC or CPIC application. If the application
is designed to wait until an LU 6.2 (APPC) session is available, the application
may appear to stop responding (hang) while it waits for an available LU 6.2
session. If the application is designed to time out when a session is not
available within a certain period of time, the underlying APPC [MC_]ALLOCATE may
fail with the following error message:

  primary_rc = 0x0003 (AP_ALLOCATION_ERROR)
  secondary_rc = 0x00000005 (AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_RETRY)

A CPIC application may fail with the following error message:

  rc = 20 (CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR)

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server may choose a pooled, dependent Local APPC LU that is defined on a
host connection where the requested Remote APPC LU is not explicitly defined.
This occurs even though there is a pooled Local APPC LU available on another
host connection where the requested Remote APPC LU is explicitly defined.

This can only occur if the host connection where the Remote APPC LU is not
explicitly defined has the Supports Dynamic Remote APPC LU Definition option
selected in its connection properties in SNA Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+-------------------------------------+
| File name    | Date       | Time    | 
+-------------------------------------+
| Snaservr.exe | 12/05/2000 | 11:24AM | 
+-------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



Host Integration Server 2000

WORKAROUND
==========

If there is no need to dynamically create remote APPC LUs, disabling Supports
Dynamic Remote APPC LU Definition in the connection properties prevents this
problem from occurring.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
3.0 (all Service Packs), 4.0, 4.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0
SP4, and Host Integration Server 2000.
