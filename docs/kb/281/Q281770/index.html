SUMMARY
=======

Many issues that are experienced while running the Windows operating system
occur because of the use of an incompatible or corrupt program that you are
running simultaneously. To help determine if this is the case, you have to
either perform a "clean boot", or restart Windows without these programs
starting.

This article describes how to perform clean-boot troubleshooting to determine if
the problem in question is with the core operating system or with a program
loading in the Windows environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To perform clean-boot troubleshooting, it is necessary to make changes and
restart the computer several times to determine if the problem is with something
in the operating system environment and, if this is the case, what specific
component.

The overall structure of clean-boot troubleshooting that is presented in this
article is categorized in the following way:

1. Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking Support

2. Removing Unsigned Drivers

3. Removing Registry Entries

4. Testing User Profiles

5. Disabling Third-Party Services

6. Uninstalling Programs

Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking Support
----------------------------------------------

The first step to troubleshoot potential environmental issues is to boot into
Safe mode or Safe mode with networking support. If the issue is with a program
that does not depend on network connectivity, Safe mode is appropriate. If the
issue is with a network program and you are are using a network adapter to
connect to a network, Safe mode with networking support may enable you to test
the networking program, including browser issues.

Note: You cannot use Safe mode with networking support when using a modem or PC
Card connection to a network, since modem drivers and PC Card drivers do not
load in Safe mode or Safe mode with networking support.

If you boot into Safe mode or Safe mode with networking support and you can
perform an operation normally, one with which you were previously experiencing
issues, the issue is most likely due to an issue with the environment. Refer to
the "Removing Registry Entries" section in this article for information about
how to determine what program components may be causing the issue.

Note: You may not be able to test some operations in Safe mode because not all
services and devices load in Safe mode or Safe mode with networking support. For
example, you cannot test multimedia issues that involve sound, or suspend or
hibernate issues in Safe mode. Also, any network programs that rely on the
Remote Procedure Call Subsystem (RpcSS) do not work because the RpcSS service
does not load in Safe mode with networking support.

If you boot into Safe mode or Safe mode with networking support and the issue
still occurs, there may still be an environmental issue; many Function or Filter
drivers installed by third-party software may still load in Safe mode.

Therefore, it may be necessary to take an additional step to test and remove
third-party drivers in Safe mode.

Removing Unsigned Drivers
-------------------------

All the drivers that are included with Windows 2000 use digital signatures to
verify that they have been tested by the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL).
Many third-party programs are written for Windows 2000 that need to install
additional drivers, but which have not been tested by WHQL, so they do not
receive a digital signature.

Note: Some third-party vendors have tools that they can use that generate a valid
digital signature and yet were not tested by WHQL. The following procedure
cannot be used to determine if these drivers are installed.

Windows 2000 includes the File Signature Verification tool (Sigverif.exe). You
can use this tool to find all files on your computer that are not digitally
signed. For the purposes of Windows 2000 clean-boot troubleshooting, only the
files in the %Windir%\System32\Drivers folder need to be tested.

To use Sigverif.exe:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "sigverif" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. Click Advanced, click "Look for other files that are not digitally signed",
  navigate to the Winnt\System32\Drivers folder, and then click OK.

3. Click Start.

After Sigverif.exe is finished, a list of all unsigned drivers installed on your
computer are displayed.

Note: Many video drivers are not digitally signed. The following steps may cause
problems with using your video resolution and in some cases may cause you to be
unable to boot.

The list of all signed and unsigned drivers found by Sigverif.exe can be found in
the Sigverif.txt file in the %Windir% folder, typically the Winnt or Windows
folder. All unsigned drivers are noted as "Unsigned".

When you determine what drivers are unsigned, create a folder in which to place
the unsigned drivers. Typically, SysDriversBak is an easy folder name to
remember.

Restart your computer without presence the unsigned drivers in the
Winnt\System32\Drivers folder and test your program or other functionality to
see if the same error messages or issues occur.

Note: Because most driver files are associated with registry entries that have
not yet been changed, you receive the following error message:

  At least one driver or service failed to start...

If the issue no longer occurs, the issue was due to a third-party unsigned filter
or function driver. A function driver is a driver to load a specific device that
uses one of the computer buses. A filter driver loads at a level above or below
a function driver to add or alter the behavior of the function driver.

To determine which unsigned driver is at fault, use one of the following
techniques:

- Place drivers that are related to the same program or device back together in
  the same test.

- Place the top half of the drivers back in the same test.

The first technique is generally better to determine the cause of an issue, but
it may not be possible to determine related drivers, so either technique should
work.

After you determine the particular driver that is causing the issue, you can
either uninstall the driver or program, or disable the driver or service.
To disable a service:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Services.

3. Double-click the service, click Disabled in the Select Startup Type drop-down
  box, and then click OK.

4. Restart your computer.

Check for drivers or other program updates or replace the software or driver with
a program or driver that is written specifically for Windows 2000.

To disable a driver:

1. Right-click My Computer, click Manage, and then click Device Manager.

2. Double-click the device, select Disable from Device Usage, and then click OK.

3. Look for an updated driver for the device from the vendor.

Note: Not all devices and services are listed in user interface for Windows
2000.

If the device or service is not available in the Windows 2000 interface, use the
Recovery Console to disable the driver or service. For additional information
about the use of Recovery Console, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Removing Registry Entries
-------------------------

If you no longer encounter problems running programs in Safe mode, the issue is
mostly likely due to programs that are loading while the Windows 2000 computer
is booting.

Programs that are a part of the boot process for Windows 2000 are generally added
to one of the following locations:

- The Startup folder under the Programs menu.

- The Run line for all users in the registry.

- The Run line for particular users in the registry.

- The "load" entry for all users in the registry.

Note: Because the registry is the location for all computer and program settings
for Windows 2000, it is necessary to make a backup of the registry and
particular registry entries in case you are no longer able to boot after editing
the registry.

To back up the Windows 2000 registry:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click Backup.

2. On the General tab, click Emergency Repair Disk and follow the provided
  directions.

The Startup folder icons are loaded from two locations. To remove these entries:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click "Taskbar and Start Menu
  Properties".

2. On the Advanced tab, click Advanced.

3. Open the Startup folder for the user account with which you logged on, and
  then click Cut on the Edit menu.

4. Create a SysDriversBak folder, create a UserStartup folder under the folder,
  open the UserStartup folder, and then click Paste.

5. Repeat steps 1 through 2 and navigate to the All Users\Start
  Menu\Programs\Startup folder.

6. Click Cut on the Edit menu, navigate to the SysDriversBak folder, create an
  AllUsersStartup folder, and then click Paste.

To remove values for the Run line in the registry for all users:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. Navigate to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

3. Open the Run key and note the entries on the right pane.

4. For each value except for the Default value, click the value, click Export
  Registry File on the Registry menu, navigate to the SysDriversBak folder, and
  then save the file using the following naming convention

  HKLMRun_(&lt;valuename&gt;)

  where (&lt;valuename&gt;) is the name of the value that you are exporting.

5. Click Delete on the Edit menu.

6. Repeat these steps for each value under the Run key.

7. Check the related RunOnce and RunOnceEx keys to see if a program was not
  completely installed and repeat steps 3 through 5, except that you need to
  change the naming convention to reflect RunOnce or RunOnceEx.

To remove values for the Run line in the registry for the user account with which
you are logged on as:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. Navigate to the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

3. Open the Run key.

4. Highlight the first value below "Default (value not set)", click the value,
  click Export Registry File on the Registry menu, navigate to the
  SysDriversBak folder, and then save the file using the following naming
  convention:

  HKCURun_(&lt;valuename&gt;)

  where (&lt;valuename&gt;) is the name of the value that you are exporting.

5. Click Delete on the Edit menu.

6. Repeat these steps for each value under the Run key.

7. Check the related RunOnce key to see if a program was not completely
  installed and repeat steps 3 through 5, except that you need to change the
  naming convention to reflect RunOnce.

To remove value data under "load":

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. Navigate to the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows

3. If the value "load" (without quotation marks) has any value data, click
  Export Registry File on the Registry menu, navigate to the SysDriversBak
  folder and save the file as "HKCUload" (without the quotation marks).

4. Double-click the "load" value and clear the value data.

5. When you have completed these steps, restart your computer, and test.

If the problem no longer occurs, then you should merge the values in the
following suggested order:

1. Startup icons from both the All Users group and the user account with which
  you log on

2. HKCURun_ values

3. HKLMRun_ values

4. HKCUload

To add the icons for the Startup menu:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Windows
  Explorer.

2. Navigate to the SysDriversBak folder that you created earlier, open the
  AllUsersStartup folder, click Select All, and then click Copy on the Edit
  menu.

3. Navigate to the following folder, and then click Paste:

  \Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

4. Navigate to SysDriversBak\UserStartup folder, and then click Copy on the Edit
  menu.

5. Navigate to the following folder, and then click Paste:

  \Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

  where &lt;username&gt; is the name of the user that you have logged on as.

6. Restart your computer and test.

Testing User Profiles
---------------------

Sometimes, a user's specific information may be corrupted, but other users on the
same computer may have no problem. To determine if this is the case, log on as a
new user or create a new user account, and then test it.

Note: Sometimes, a program may work correctly when you log on with the default
Administrator account only. Older programs may have this problem.

If the default Administrator profile becomes corrupt, you need to reinstall
Windows 2000 to correct this problem.

All user-specific configuration information (which is displayed in Registry
Editor as HKEY_CURRENT_USER) is stored in the Ntuser.dat file in the \Documents
and Settings\&lt;username&gt; folder.

Disabling Third-Party Services
------------------------------

It is sometimes necessary to disable third-party services that are installed to
eliminate problems. Safe mode and Safe mode with Networking do not load
third-party services, so if Safe mode works, the problem may be due to a
third-party service that is loading.

The following table is a partial list of core operating system services that
load; however, this varies according to the services that are installed and the
version of Windows 2000 that is in use:
