-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

For the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks External (MTA) program to transfer mail
between postoffices a network drive must be connected to each postoffice from
the workstation that will be running the EXTERNAL.EXE program. This article
describes the software needed and how to set up the operating system to have the
External program process mail on both a Novell NetWare server and Microsoft
Windows NT or Microsoft LAN Manager servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NetWare workstations communicate with the NetWare server using NetWare Core
Protocol (NCP) packets and Microsoft network workstations (LAN Manager, Windows
for Workgroups, and NT workstation) communicate with Windows NT or LAN Manager
servers using Server Message Blocks (SMBs). For this reason one workstation with
a single protocol and redirector cannot connect to both types of servers, unless
a workstation can be configured for dual protocols and redirectors.

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 or Workgroup Add-On for MS- DOS
version 3.11 provides a Microsoft Windows Network by default. Novell NetWare can
be added for dual protocol/redirector configuration. After a proper
installation, a drive letter can be assigned to a Windows NT or LAN Manager
server, and a drive letter mapped to a Novell NetWare server. The Microsoft Mail
EXTERNAL.EXE (MTA) can then use the two drive letters for transferring and
delivering mail.

NOTE: Microsoft network workstation is a native protocol/redirector for Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 and Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS, so you only need to add
Novell NetWare to have dual connectivity.

To add Novell NetWare support for Windows for Workgroups 3.11:

1. Select the Network Setup icon in the Network program manager group.

2. Choose Network, and select Other to install Windows Support for Additional
  Networks.

3. Select Novell NetWare (Workstation Shell 3.x) or Novell NetWare (Workstation
  Shell 4.x) depending on if you are using NETX.EXE or VLM.EXE.


4. Setup will prompt for Novell files NOT included with Windows for Workgroups
  3.11. Novell makes these files available on its bulletin board service (BBS)
  and in the Novell CompuServe forum (GO NOVFILES).

  The current filenames are WINDR2.EXE and NWDLL2.EXE. However, it may change
  from time to time. Contact your Novell service person or the Novell
  CompuServe forum for more information on availability.

NOTE: If you use NETX.EXE, a LastDrive=P will be placed in your CONFIG.SYS. If
you use VLM.EXE, the LastDrive will equal Z.

When LastDrive is set to P: NetWare drives are Q: through Z:, but local MS- DOS
drive letters can be remapped to NetWare drives. For example, if a Windows NT or
LAN Manager server is connected using

  NET USE M: \\Server\Share

where the Novell drive N: can then be mapped to MAP N:=SYS:MAILDATA. EXTERNAL.EXE
can now be executed with a -DMN to service these two postoffices.

NOTE: Once installed you should not attempt to run EXTERNAL.EXE from a MS-DOS
prompt while in Windows. Instead you should boot the computer and start the
network with a NET START BASIC command. Establish (NET USE or MAP) the
postoffice drive letters, and execute EXTERNAL.EXE.

To add Novell NetWare support for Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS 3.11:

- Run the SETUP program from floppy diskette while logged into your Novell
  Network.

  This will provide you the Microsoft network protocol/redirector, while keeping
  your Novell NetWare configuration.
