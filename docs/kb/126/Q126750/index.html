-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple Microsoft Mail Externals access the same postoffice located on a
PC-NFS server, the following errors may appear in the SYSTEM.LOG:

  [005] Mail retry count exceeded sending to: MAILNET /MAILP0
  [016] Message was not sent due to missing message file.

  Missing file is M:MAI\MA3\000162B3.MAI.

  [021] Message was not delivered due to missing routing file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when two or more Externals attempt to access the
INQUEUE3.MBG and INQUEUE3.KEY files simultaneously. Normally, file locking is
used to avoid a conflict. The above errors occur when PC-NFS file locking has
not been enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

PC-NFS requires two procedures to enable file locking on shared file systems
located on Sun servers. First, install the lock daemon included with PC-NFS on
the server. Second, include the /MUSTSHARE or /MS command to the command line of
the mount command that each External performs. The command is detailed on page
76 in the "Administration Guide" of PC-NFS version 5.0.

  Example: NET USE     M: server:/usr1/mail32 /ms

The command can be performed on the command line, or it can be entered in the
DRIVES.BAT file and performed when the redirector is started.

The network can be started using a NETWORK.BAT file in the directory including
the NFS files on the local drive. The file will include entries indicating the
user or workstation login.

  Example: NET START RDR wkstation *

The machine specific addresses are located in the hosts file on each workstation.
There is also another hosts file located on the server that will include the
addresses of each user's workstation.

  Example:   130.50.55.115   wkstation
     130.50.5.55     server

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify that the workstations have the /MS option enabled, perform a trace on
the network. If the /MUSTSHARE option is enabled, the workstation will send UDP
packets to the server. Network Monitor will show the following text in the
description of the UDP packet:

  Src Port: Locus PC-Interface Conn Server

Testing was done with version 5.0 of PC-NFS. File locking is described in PC-NFS
Administration Guide appendix A. PC-NFS is a product of SunSelect, which is a
Sun Microsystems business.
