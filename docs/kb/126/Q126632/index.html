SYMPTOMS
========

When you are setting up Windows, the mouse attached to your computer is
incorrectly identified as a PS/2-style or an Inport (bus) mouse and the mouse
does not work.

CAUSE
=====

Setup detects mouse ports in the following order: Inport, PS/2, serial. When the
detection routine finds the mouse port, it stops searching. For example, if
Setup finds an Inport card, it stops searching for the mouse.

Inport Card
-----------

If an Inport-style mouse card is installed in the computer, the detection routine
sees this card first and uses it, even if the mouse is not attached to it. This
occurs because the Inport card is the circuit board for the mouse. Detaching the
mouse from the card does not disable the card.

PS/2-Style Mouse
----------------

If a PS/2-style mouse is installed, the 0x04 bit is set in the equipment flags.
In some computers, the BIOS mistakenly sets this bit when a second hard disk is
installed and no PS/2-style mouse exists. When Setup issues an INT 11 (get
equipment flags) and sees that this bit is set, it determines that there is a
PS/2-style mouse attached to your computer.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- For an Inport card, remove the card from the computer before you run Setup.

- For a PS/2-style mouse port, contact your computer vendor about a possible
  BIOS upgrade.

- For either type of mouse, run Setup with the /ID switch and choose the proper
  mouse type when you are prompted.

- For either type of mouse, set the correct type in the "MouseType=" line in
  the MOUSE.INI file before you run Setup. Note that the mouse driver you are
  using must support the use of a MOUSE.INI file for this method to work. For
  additional information about the "MouseType=" setting, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
