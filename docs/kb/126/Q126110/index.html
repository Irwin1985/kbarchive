The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists fixes made in version 2.1 to bugs that appeared in Microsoft
Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.0. This information can also be found in
the What's New help file available from Books Online or from the initial Setup
dialog box.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Bugs Fixed in Visual C++ 2.1
----------------------------

Visual C++ version 2.1 fixes several Visual C++ version 2.0 bugs. These include
bugs for hosting on Windows 95 and for double-byte character set (DBCS) code.
Many developers will find the bug fixes listed in this article of particular
interest.

Fixed Integrated Development Environment Bugs
---------------------------------------------

- The thread priority is not displayed correctly. Visual C++ was using
  ANSI_FIXED_FONT; this has been changed to SYSTEM_FIXED_FONT.


- If you paste data from one window containing a document to another window
  containing the same document, the window into which you paste is refreshed
  incorrectly. This occurred in two cases: (a) when the second view of the
  document was created with the New Window command on the Window menu or (b)
  when the second view was in a splitter window.


- Splitter windows in the Visual C++ source code editor exhibit incorrect
  behavior. If you split a source code window and edited one of the panes, the
  other window was repainted incorrectly.


- Pasting a large bitmap from Microsoft Word version 6.0 (16 bit) into the
  Visual C++ version 2.0 bitmap editor results in a general protection (GP)
  fault. If you placed a bitmap on the clipboard from Word, opened the bitmap
  editor in Visual C++, and pasted the bitmap, a GP fault occurred in Visual
  C++. Visual C++ version 2.1 has been fixed to ignore the paste attempt, but
  even in that version, Word still cannot provide the bitmap.


Fixed MFC Bugs
--------------

- An assertion failure occurs when using RFX_Text with a column of type
  SQL_VARCHAR that is wider than 255 bytes. Some drivers implement columns of
  type SQL_VARCHAR that allow more than 255 bytes, so in those cases, the MFC
  assertion would not be valid. For more information, please see the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q120888 FIX: Assertion Fails When Use RFX_Text() w/ SQL_VARCHAR Column


- Calling MovePrev after you move past the end of a recordset or calling
  MoveNext after you move past the beginning of a recordset results in no
  action. You needed two MoveNext calls or two MovePrev calls to get to the
  first or last record of the recordset, respectively. Note that if your
  existing code calls either of these functions twice in a row to work around
  this problem, the code will now move an extra record.


- MFC had a problem with the way the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver
  for Microsoft Access version 2.0 represented its Yes/No (bit) fields. The
  Microsoft Access driver mapped its Yes/No fields to the SQL_BINARY data type
  rather than SQL_BIT. This meant that MFC database programmers could not use
  BOOL for these fields in recordsets. This behavior was incompatible with the
  previous Microsoft Access driver version. Updated ODBC drivers now eliminate
  this problem.


- In an application that does not use a CRecordView-derived class, MFC database
  code fails to update Null fields correctly. On a CRecordset::Edit call in an
  application not using a CRecordView, Edit failed to correctly update the
  status of fields marked Null to not Null and vice versa; it was necessary to
  explicitly set the status by calling the CRecordset member function
  SetFieldNull with the appropriate parameter. For more information, please see
  the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q123652 FIX: Update() Fails to Write Changed Text Field


- OLE servers lost their toolbars when the container window was resized. If you
  resized the container's frame window to reduce its height, the server's
  toolbar disappeared and was replaced by the container's toolbar. As the frame
  window was made larger, the container's toolbar disappeared, but the server's
  toolbar did not reappear.


- The pvarResult from COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper should be NULL when
  vtRet is VT_EMPTY. But a call to COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper caused the
  server to generate an error when the return type was VT_EMPTY. The nature of
  the error depended on the automation server. For example, the Microsoft
  WordBasic automation server caused the following error on some methods with a
  return type of void (_DEBUG build): "Assertion Failed Line 315,
  OLEDISP2.CPP." Using the debugger to examine the excepInfo structure showed
  that the btrDescription member contained this message: "Non Function called
  as function." For more information, please see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q121218 FIX: pvarResult Should Be NULL When vtRet==VT_EMPTY


- The CMainView::DoPasteNative member function in the OCLIENT sample
  application failed to handle an error, which caused a failure. The

     function returned without throwing an exception when the pFile variable

  was NULL. This has been corrected to throw a CFileException.


- A default OLE container application with OLE Automation enabled initialized
  the m_pSelection data member in the wrong function. AppWizard initialized the
  member to NULL in the view's nInitialUpdate member function rather than in
  the view constructor. This led to an assertion failure in
  COleClientItem::OnDraw when you attempted to create a container document with
  another application, as for example using Visual Basic's CreateObject
  function. The member is now correctly initialized in both places. (This bug
  applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions.)


- The ANSI mapping layer in MFCANS32.DLL handled standard OLE aggregation
  incorrectly. The DLL incorrectly called AddRef where it should not have under
  aggregation rules. There was also a problem with how MFC wrapped the "inner
  IUnknown." For more information, see Technical Note 49 under MFC in Books
  Online.


- COleDataSource::OnRenderData returned NOERROR instead of TRUE. Because the
  function return type is prototyped as BOOL, NOERROR is interpreted as FALSE.
  (This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions.)


- The EXCEPINFO structure is not correctly initialized for an OLE control.
  Information already available about an exception -- in particular, the
  control name and the name of the control's help file -- was overwritten. This
  has been corrected so that the EXCEPINFO structure is only filled if it is
  empty. (This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions.)


- When Microsoft Excel deactivated an in-place object whose frame window has a
  splitter that contained two or more views, the MFC application caused a
  general protection fault. The COleServerDoc::OnShowDocument function
  destroyed the frame window in this case, leading to the general protection
  fault. This applied only to SDI-based in-place servers.


- The wrong window was determined to be the active window when the HIERSVR
  sample application was embedded in Microsoft Excel. When you used Edit Insert
  in Excel to insert a HIERSVR object, selected the object, then chose any
  command that opened a dialog box, the dialog box had the wrong parent. The
  parent was in Excel, not HIERSVR. The m_pActiveWnd data member needed to be
  set back to NULL once an object left the UI-active state. This was true for
  both 16- and 32-bit Excel. (This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions
  of Visual C++.)


- Removing FWS_ADDTOTITLE caused an incorrect SaveModified call. Removing the
  FWS_ADDTOTITLE style from a CMDIChildWnd-derived class caused SaveModified to
  be called when each view attached to the document was closed. This caused a
  problem in closing the frame window. For more information, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q99182 How to Change an MFC-Based MDI Child Window's Frame Text


- The CMDIFrameWnd caption was not updated when a maximized child window
  closed. Under certain circumstances, closing a maximized child window did not
  properly update the caption of the main frame window in a multiple document
  interface (MDI) application. This caused the main frame window caption to
  show a document name even with no documents open. The bug appeared when the
  child window was maximized and the main frame window was narrower than its
  menu bar, so the menu wrapped to the next line.


- The command update handler for a menu item was not called if you added or
  removed the previous menu item during a command handler call. If you added or
  removed a menu item during a command handler call, the update handler was not
  called for the menu item immediately following the added or removed item. For
  example, menu items below the most-recently-used (MRU) list on the File menu
  could be affected by this problem.


- Problems occurred when you used width specifiers in CString::Format. In the
  CString::Format member function, using a negative width specifier in a %s
  metacharacter that was larger than the actual length of the string being
  substituted led to an assertion failure in file: STREX.CPP, Line 360. You
  might have a metacharacter like this if you wanted the string to be
  left-justified within the number of columns you specified as the width.


- CString::Format resulted in a general protection (GP) fault if variable width
  or precision specifiers were used. Format did not correctly handle variable
  width or precision parameters, such as %*d, which caused an Access
  Violation.


- The tab control didn't invalidate after adding a tab to a property sheet. If
  you added a CPropertyPage via CPropertySheet::AddPage while the
  CPropertySheet was displayed, the tab control did not update to reflect the
  change. The tab control needed to be invalidated. This is similar to the
  behavior of CTabControl::RemoveTab.


- When the last control on a property page had the WS_TABSTOP style, but was
  hidden, tabbing from the next-to-last control jumped to the first control on
  the page. The expected behavior would be to go to the first control on the
  associated property sheet (usually below the property pages). Note that the
  correction for this behavior does not affect existing code.


- An edit control in a property page did not get Return keys. A multiline edit
  control with the ES_WANTRETURN style set did not receive return-key messages
  (WM_KEYDOWN with VK_RETURN) when placed in a CPropertyPage object. If the
  parent CPropertySheet object contained a button with an ID that was IDOK, the
  dialog box was dismissed when the return key was pressed in the edit control.
  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q125645 FIX: Edit Control in Property Page Does Not Get Return Keys


- Problems occurred after destroying a dockable CControlBar object. When the
  CControlBar object was destroyed, its destructor did not remove the control
  bar from an array of control bar pointers kept by MFC in a CDockBar object.
  In some situations, this led to an exception caused by an Access Violation in
  the function CObject::IsKindOf. For more information, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q125728 FIX: Problems Occur After Destroying Dockable CControlBar


- In applications that called CFrameWnd::LoadBarState, restoring the docking
  state resulted in a disabled toolbar. If you added code that called
  LoadBarState and your dockable toolbar did not have the style CBRS_DOCKMULTI,
  LoadBarState caused the toolbar to be disabled the next time you ran the
  application -- if in the previous session, you hid the toolbar while it was
  floating and closed the application. AppWizard applications do not set this
  style and do not call LoadBarState, so they did not encounter this problem.


- While being loaded, an MFC _USRDLL could cause an assertion failure if the
  DLL filename had an extension of fewer than three characters. The assertion,
  which occurred in CWinApp::SetCurrentHandles, was incorrect. DLL filename
  extensions are not required to be three characters long, nor must they be
  "DLL" or any other specific string. However, some environments do require a
  specific extension, such as the "WLL" extension for Microsoft Word add-ins.
  This assertion was removed for MFC versions 3.1 and 2.52.


- The implementation for the class CMap template could compare keys
  incorrectly. The CMap implementation needed to use CompareElements to compare
  keys. This correction allows greater flexibility in implementing the
  comparison function.


- Memory could leak in a CMap object when the KEY parameter was of type
  CString. Removing all elements in the map resulted in deleting only the
  values stored in the map, not the keys used to look values up. The fix allows
  greater flexibility in implementing the comparison function.


Fixed Compiler Bugs
-------------------

- The compiler treated pointer types as the corresponding base type in template
  specializations. For example, given this template specialization:

        template&lt;class T&gt; T dFriendFunc(Derived&lt;&gt; *);

  char* was treated as char, and int* was treated as int. The compiler did not
  deduce the template arguments correctly. This caused an error because two
  functions appeared to differ only in their return types.


- Problems occurred when exceptions were thrown across DLL boundaries. Throwing
  an object that was exported resulted in an Access Violation. Visual C++
  version 2.1 allows you to catch object defined in a DLL outside the context
  of the defining DLL. For more information, please wee the following article
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q122303 BUG: __declspec(dllimport) Classes Are Not Caught Correctly


- The Compiler returned no warning on an attempt to return a temporary variable
  from a function. For example:

        int a = 5;
        return &amp;a;

  The compiler shipped with Visual C++ version 2.1 now issues a warning' for the
  return value.


Fixed Linker Bugs
-----------------

- LineNum information was incorrect when converting from 32-bit Object Module
  Format (OMF) to Common Object File Format (COFF). The linker incorrectly
  converted 32-bit OMF LINENUM records to COFF. This showed up in the debugger
  as incorrect line numbers; the conversion is now correct. For more
  information, please wee the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q117796 PRB: Incorrect Debug Information in 32-bit Object Module


- An error occurred in the incremental linker when processing large images but
  few relocations. This condition resulted in this message:

  ***** Linker INTERNAL ERROR during EmitRelocations *****

  The problem leading to this message has been corrected.


Fixed Run-Time Library Bugs
---------------------------

- The tolower and toupper functions were not locale sensitive on the Intel
  platform. The functions incorrectly used the "C" locale regardless of what
  the locale was.


- Using a pointer to a virtual base class object while catching an exception
  resulted in an Application Error when the derived class used multiple
  inheritance. This has been corrected.


- An incorrect heap region size was set under Win32s. Win32s initially did not
  support reserved but uncommitted virtual memory. A code check in Visual C++
  used to limit the maximum total size of the CRTL heap under Win32s. This
  check has been removed, so applications running under Win32s or Phar Lap TNT
  will be able to allocate approximately as much total memory as under Windows
  NT or Windows 95. The initial heap regions will be smaller under Win32s or
  Phar Lap TNT than under Windows NT or Windows 95.


- The _ecvt function returned the wrong number of digits in the overflow case.
  If you called _ecvt asking for n digits and the function overflowed, it
  returned n+1 digits. For example, _ecvt returned 1000 instead of 100. If your
  code expected three digits, it might use 000, the last three of the four
  digits returned, instead of 100.


- There was a memory leak in the client DLLs of MSVCRT20.DLL. Suppose
  EXAMPLE.DLL was a client of MSVCRT20.DLL and a client .EXE loaded and
  unloaded EXAMPLE.DLL a number of times. The failure in Visual C++ to
  deallocate a small block of memory in MSVCRT20.DLL could lead to a memory
  leak.


Fixed Resource Compiler Bugs
----------------------------

- The Resource Compiler required 16 megabytes of virtual memory on startup.
  This requirement forced you to close applications or increase the size of the
  Windows swap file to allow the resource compiler to load. A new version of
  the resource compiler reduces this requirement.
