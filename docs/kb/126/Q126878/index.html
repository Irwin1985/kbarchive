-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is part 2 of the BS95READ.TXT included with Microsoft Complete
Baseball for Windows, 1995 edition.

FONT DISPLAY PROBLEMS
---------------------

Complete Baseball uses two TrueType fonts for its display.  If you
receive a message stating that one of the fonts is unavailable, make
sure that TrueType fonts are enabled on your computer.

1.  From the Windows Control Panel, select Fonts and then click the
TrueType button.

2.  In the True Type dialog, make sure the Enable True Type Fonts
check box is selected (an X appears in the check box when it's
selected).

3.  If the Enable True Type Fonts check box is selected, in the Fonts
dialog, click Help for more information on adding fonts.

The fonts you need are installed with Windows and can be found in the
Windows system directory.  Make sure to add all the Arial and Times
New Roman fonts to your computer.

------------------
LARGE FONT DRIVERS
------------------

If you are using a Large Font driver, some statistical columns in the
Team Rosters section may appear clipped and some statistics in
Baseball Daily may appear clipped or overlapped.  Switching to the
Small Font version of the driver will fix this problem.  For more
information on installing or changing video drivers, consult your
Windows documentation.

------------------
ATI/MACH32 DRIVERS
------------------

If you are using an ATI video card and video driver, and you're
having display problems, make sure you reset the RLEFIX setting in
Complete Baseball's MSSPORTS.INI file as described above.

Also, for Complete Baseball to run on the ATI driver, the "256 color
palette" control in the "Advanced features" of the "ATI Control
Panel" needs to be set to ON.  See your video card documentation for
more information.

If you are using a mach32 video card and driver, image quality will
be lost if Crystal fonts are enabled. Make sure that Crystal fonts
are disabled.

1.  Open the mach32 Utilities program group.

2.  Open the Mach FlexDesk Control Panel.

3.  Click on the Crystal button to get to FlexDesk Crystal Tune.

4.  Choose "off" under the "Crystal" options and click on Ok to save
this setting.

Image quality will also be lost if you are using a Super VGA video
driver with a mach32 video card. Run Windows Setup (described above)
to check your video driver and switch to the mach32 driver for better
image quality.

If you continue to have problems, try contacting ATI Technologies to
see if they have a newer version of the driver you're using.

For information about ATI video cards, contact ATI Technical Support
at (416) 756-0711. The ATI cards and driver products referenced here
are manufactured by ATI Technologies, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.

--------------------
CIRRUS LOGIC DRIVERS
--------------------

The 64k-color Cirrus Logic video driver, v1.32, that shipped with the
Compaq ProLinea and Presario (and presumably other systems having
these drivers) is incompatible with the VfW 1.1 drivers shipped with
Complete Baseball, 1994. As a result, during Complete Baseball Setup,
your system may crash when profiling your video display. This problem
does not occur with the latest versions of the 64K-color Cirrus Logic
video driver, v1.41 and v1.43.

To upgrade your Cirrus Logic video drivers, contact Cirrus Logic
product support at:

   Cirrus Logic
   3100 W. Warren Ave.
   Freemont, CA  94538
   (510) 623-8300

The Cirrus Logic driver products referenced here are manufactured by
Cirrus Logic, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.

---------------
TOSHIBA DRIVERS
---------------

If you are using the Toshiba t44v480c.DRV video driver, Complete
Baseball video may appear pink.  To fix this problem, go into your
WIN.INI [drawdib] section and change 1,0,0,0 to 5,0,0,0.  The
[drawdib] section should appear similarly to the example shown below:

   [drawdib]
   t44v480c.drv 640x480x8(5)=5,0,0,0

Save your WIN.INI file and then try playing video in Complete Baseball
again.

--------------------
64,000 COLOR DRIVERS
--------------------

If your machine has a 16 bit video card, and you are using a 64,000
color driver, some images in Complete Baseball may not display. To
fix this problem, switch to a 256 color driver.  For more information
on installing video drivers, consult your Windows
manual.

=================================================================
5. AUDIO PROBLEMS
=================================================================

Although you can install and run Complete Baseball without a sound
card, to hear the sounds that come with the product, a sound card is
required.  If you're sure you have a sound card, read through the
troubleshooting information listed below, or consult the user manual
that came with your sound card for more information.

--------------------
GENERAL SOUND ISSUES
--------------------

Audio problems can have many causes. Other applications that play
sounds may interrupt sounds in Complete Baseball because your
computer cannot play two sounds simultaneously.  This is generally a
temporary clash that will resolve itself. However, a few applications
that play sounds, such as some screen savers, may remove audio
capability from all other Windows applications. If you suspect you
have such an application, turn it off or do not run it while running
Complete Baseball.

-------------------------
SOUNDS PLAY, BUT NOT WELL
-------------------------

Sound distortion is often caused by sending a higher volume or
amplitude of sound than the speakers are able to handle.  Also, if
the volume control on your audio card is set too high it may cause
distortion from the amplifier on the audio card.  Sometimes speakers
that are not of high quality will distort at a lower volume than
better speakers.

It is also possible that the software settings on your sound board
are causing distortion.  For example, if the sound card volume or
"WAVE file input" is set to near its maximum, it will produce
amplification distortion, just as it would on a stereo system.  To
find out how to change your sound board settings, check the
documentation that came with your sound board.  This is normally done
with either a volume dial on the back of your audio card (in the rear
of your computer where the speakers plug in) or with a program that
is often called a "mixer," which is usually installed in the Windows
Control Panel of the Main program group.  Some audio cards use both
types of controls, and they must both be adjusted.

Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum Cards
-------------------------------------

Audio clips may sound "scratchy" (that is, distorted) when played
from the Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum card. To correct this
problem, change the Media Vision driver DMA setting to 7.

To change the driver setting:

1. Choose the Drivers icon in the Windows Control Panel.

2. Select the Media Vision Wave/MIDI/Aux driver, and then choose Setup.

3. Under the DMA setting, set the selection to 7.

4. Choose OK, and then choose Restart Now.

Audio clips should now play correctly.

The Pro Audio Spectrum sound card and driver products referenced here
are manufactured by Media Vision, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.  For more information, call
Media Vision, Inc. Technical Support at (800) 638-2807 or (510)
770-9905. On CompuServe, Media Vision can be reached by typing GO
MEDIAVISION at any prompt.
