MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Installation Error Message: "CDR 101:  Error Reading Drive..."
--------------------------------------------------------------

The installation program produces the following error message when you try to run
it on some computers that are configured with a CD-ROM drive:

  CDR101: Error reading drive DOGRAM. Abort, Retry, or Fail?

Correction:

A new installation program is under development that will address this issue.

Comments:

This error is produced when the installation program encounters some types of
CD-ROM drive device drivers. It is the CD-ROM driver that produces the error.

To work around this problem, press F to fail the CD-ROM operation. The
installation will continue as normal, with no further problems. Because the
installation program cannot write files to a CD-ROM, this option will have no
adverse effects on the installation.

Practice Files Not Located in WINWORD Directory
-----------------------------------------------

Page 24 is the first location in this book where the reader opens a practice
file. However, if Word was installed as part of Microsoft Office and the default
installation path was not changed, the practice subdirectory may not be located
in your Word directory as shown in the book.

Correction:

A new installation program is under development by Microsoft Press that will
address this issue.

Comments:

The default installation path for the book's practice files is

  C:\WINWORD\PRACTICE.

To properly install the practice files on a computer that has Word installed as
part of Microsoft Office, you should type the following path when the
installation program requests a destination path:

  " &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;location&gt;\PRACTICE" (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive and &lt;location&gt; is the path to
your Word directory. For example, if your hard disk is drive C, and
\MSOFFICE\WINWORD is the path to your Word directory, you would type:

  " C:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD\PRACTICE" (without the quotation marks)


03LIST.DOC Contains Invalid Font Tms Rmny
-----------------------------------------

The file 03LIST.DOC uses a font named Tms Rmny (y has accent marks). This font
name is in the screen capture on pages 37-52 (all of lesson 3).

This font maps to Symbol (a Greek character font) on some systems.

Correction:

Change all Tms Rmny font references to Times New Roman in the file 03LIST.DOC.
Also change screen captures on pages 37-52 to replace the Tms Rmny font listing
with Times New Roman.

Comments:

To correct this problem, select each block of Tms Rmny text and change the font
to Times New Roman.

See the "Change the design and size of text" section on page 15 for steps to
change a font.

Remember to save your changes once you have corrected the file.

Page 10: Step 3 Unclear for Proper Copy Procedure
-------------------------------------------------

Step 3 on page 10 instructs the reader to drag a dotted insertion point and then
"Release the CTRL key and the mouse button." However, the CTRL key and the mouse
button must be released in the proper order to correctly complete this step.

Correction:

Step 3 should read:

Drag the dotted insertion point to the place immediately before the word
"version." Release the mouse button first, then the CTRL key.

Comments:

The mouse button must be released before the CTRL key is released. If the CTRL
key is released first, the text is moved, instead of copied, to the
destination.

Page 152: Office Installation Uses Graph 5.0 Instead of Graph 3.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Pages 151-153 describe how to use MS Graph from within Word 6.0 for Windows.
These pages assume the use of MS Graph 3.0 which is provided with Word 6.0.

Microsoft Office installs Graph 5.0, as do PowerPoint 4.0, and Microsoft Excel
5.0. Graph 5.0 has a different format from Graph 3.0, which is shipped with Word
6.0. This makes the steps and figures on pages 152 and 153 inaccurate.

Correction:

A paragraph or note should be presented to describe the difference between Graph
3.0 and Graph 5.0. Information on how to use the lesson with a different version
of MS Graph should also be included.

Here are some corrections under consideration:

On page 151, at bottom of page (after paragraph below step 2), add the following
text:

NOTE: If you have Microsoft Office or Microsoft Excel 5.0 installed, Graph
version 5.0 may be installed on your machine instead of Graph version 3.0, which
is included with Word 6.0. If you are running Graph 5.0, a ChartWizard will
appear. Press Finish to go directly to the embedded chart.

On page 153, in the left margin, add the following margin note:

For Graph 5.0 (provided by Microsoft Office), simply click outside the graph area
to return to Word.

Comments:

Graph 5.0 was developed after the initial release of this book and after the
release of Word 6.0. See the Correction section for alternate steps you can use
if you are running Graph 5.0.

Page 189: SHIFT+TAB Should Be ALT+TAB to Switch to Program Manager
------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1 at the bottom of page 189 says to press SHIFT+TAB to switch to Program
Manager. This information is incorrect. To switch to the Program Manager, press
ALT+TAB.

Correction:

On page 189, the second line from the last (Step 1 under "Copy a source object")
should read: "Press ALT+TAB to switch to Program Manager."

Page 190: First Step 3 Does Not Describe PRACTICE Location
----------------------------------------------------------

Step 3 at the top of page 190 states the following:

Open the file 12SPREAD.XLS in your PRACTICE directory.

However, the application used to open this file is Microsoft Excel, which will
not have the proper PRACTICE subdirectory immediately visible when you choose
the Open command.

Correction:

Step 3 should read:

Open the file 12SPREAD.XLS, which can be found in the WINWORD\PRACTICE directory,
and maximize the document window within Microsoft Excel. The PRACTICE directory
is a subdirectory of the WINWORD directory, so you must first change your File
Open directory from your EXCEL directory to your WINWORD directory.

Comments:

To locate the file 12SPREAD.XLS, as mentioned in step 3, follow the steps listed
below to switch from the EXCEL directory to the WINWORD directory.

If you installed Microsoft Excel and Word separately (not as part of Microsoft
Office), follow these steps:

1. Switch to Microsoft Excel, and choose Open from the File menu.

The Open dialog box appears.

1. In the Directories box, select the root directory (usually C).

2. In the Directories box, double-click the WINWORD directory.

You should now see the PRACTICE subdirectory.

1. Double-click the PRACTICE subdirectory.

-or-

2. If you installed Word and Microsoft Excel by running Microsoft Office Setup,
  follow these steps:

  1. Switch to Microsoft Excel, and choose Open from the File menu.

     The Open dialog box appears.

  2. In the Directories box, double-click the MSOFFICE directory (usually
     located on drive C).

     This will move you to the MSOFFICE directory, which contains both the EXCEL
     and WINWORD subdirectories.

  3. In the Directories box, double-click the WINWORD directory.

     You should now see the PRACTICE subdirectory.

  4. Double-click the PRACTICE subdirectory.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
