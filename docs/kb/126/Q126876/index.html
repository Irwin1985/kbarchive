This README file contains additional information about Complete
Baseball not included in the User's Guide.

To read this file on-screen, use the Page Down and Page Up keys.  You
can also print the file by opening this file in any Windows word
processing program and choosing the Print command from the File menu.

This file contains important information on the following topics:

1) COMPLETE BASEBALL PERFORMANCE

2) CD-ROM PROBLEMS

3) PRINTING AND COPYING

4) COMPLETE BASEBALL DISPLAY

5) AUDIO PROBLEMS

6) RUNNING UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT

=================================================================
1.  COMPLETE BASEBALL PERFORMANCE
=================================================================

Complete Baseball uses your computer's system memory to display
information quickly.  If you find that Complete Baseball runs slowly,
or if you encounter out-of-memory errors, Complete Baseball probably
doesn't have enough memory.  Consider doing the following to improve
your computer's performance:

* Close all applications that you aren't using.

* Set up a permanent Windows swap file.

  Windows works best when hard disk space has been allocated for
  swapping a file into or out of your computer's memory.  To set up
  a permanent Windows swap file on your hard disk, open Windows
  Control Panel (usually in the "Main" program group of Program
  Manager), and double-click the "386 Enhanced" icon. Then click the
  "Virtual Memory" button to see whether your current swap file is
  temporary or permanent, to check the size of the current swap file,
  and to make changes. Windows usually creates a temporary swap
  file by default, but if your disk is full or fragmented, this
  temporary file can become unavailable.  If you can, make the size
  of the permanent swap file at least 4096K.

  Look at the Help menu in the Windows Control Panel or in your
  Windows documentation for more information.

* Defragment or optimize your hard disk by running a defragmentation
program.

  For example, MS-DOS 6.0 includes a utility called Microsoft
  Defrag.  Some other popular utilities are PC Tools, Norton
  Utilities, and Mace Utilities.

* Add more RAM (memory) to your computer.

  You can determine how much memory is available by starting
  MS-DOS, typing "mem", and pressing ENTER.  This starts a program
  that will tell you how much memory you have.  You need at least
  4 megabytes (sometimes listed as 4096 kilobytes, or KB) of RAM,
  and at least 4 megabytes in your hard disk's Windows swap file to
  run Complete Baseball.

For complete details on improving performance, consult your Windows
documentation.

=================================================================
2.  CD-ROM PROBLEMS
=================================================================

NOTE - Do not remove the Complete Baseball compact disc from your
CD-ROM drive while running Complete Baseball.  If this occurs, in
most cases you will need to restart your computer and run Complete
Baseball again.

If the Complete Baseball program cannot find the data files that it
needs from the Complete Baseball compact disc, you'll see a message
that asks you to select the drive containing the files.  To find the
source of the problem, do the following:

* Make sure the Complete Baseball compact disc is correctly inserted
into the CD-ROM drive.

* Make sure the Complete Baseball program is looking for the compact
disc on the correct drive.

  Check to see if the drive letter for your CD-ROM drive has changed.
  You can use Windows File Manager to determine which drive letter is
  assigned to the CD-ROM drive.  The Select Drive command in the Disk
  menu will say "CD-ROM" next to the CD-ROM drive letter. In your
  Windows directory, open the MSSPORTS.INI file. The section called
  [BS95] should have an entry called "CD."  The path should be set to
  the drive on which your CD-ROM drive appears.  For example, if your
  CD-ROM drive is drive D:\, the entry would appear as follows:

  [BS95]
  cd=D:\ 

* If you have an external CD-ROM drive, make sure that the drive is
connected to your computer, plugged in, and turned on.

If you still see an error message after checking the points above,
check the manuals that came with your CD-ROM drive for information on
how a CD-ROM is to be set up, or contact the company that supplied
the drive.

=================================================================
3.  PRINTING AND COPYING
=================================================================

Printing and copying are available from most screens in Complete
Baseball for images, text, and statistics.  Depending on the type of
printer you have, printing an image may take several minutes.  Also,
screen resolution and printer resolution are often not the same, so
the resulting printout may not match the quality you see on the
screen.

Because the pictures can be quite large, you may have difficulty
copying or printing in low-memory conditions.  In this case, close
all other running applications and try again.

Pictures copied from Complete Baseball and pasted into a word
processing program may look different if the word processor is not
set up to display 256 colors. The picture should still print
correctly on a color printer; only the display in the word processing
program is affected.

=================================================================
4.  COMPLETE BASEBALL DISPLAY
=================================================================

REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------

Microsoft Complete Baseball requires a 256 color display to run.  If
your computer's display is less than 256 colors, you need to install
a 256 color driver, or obtain one from your video card's
manufacturer.

A set of generic 256 color drivers (which support most
non-accelerated Super VGA adapters) have been included on the
Microsoft Complete Baseball CD (see the README.TXT supplied with the
drivers for more information on supported video adapters). The file
(SVGA.EXE) is located in the D:\ZDRIVERS directory (assuming D:\ is
the drive letter of your CD-ROM).

Note: Video adapter based on the S3 chipset will not work with the
generic 256 color driver (SVGA.EXE). In this case you will find
specific S3 drivers (also located in the D:\ZDRIVERS directory) for
these video adapters. The driver you select depends on the specific
S3 chipset your video adapter uses. For more information on the
version of the S3 chipset your video card uses see the user manual
included with your video card. Once you have determined the version
of the S3 chipset your video card support use the following table
below to determine which file to copy to your hard disk.

   Chipset      Copy file
   -------    ---------
   801/805    S3-801.EXE
   924          S3-924.EXE
   928          S3-928.EXE

To install the driver you will first need to copy the appropriate
driver file from the D:\ZDRIVERS directory on the Microsoft Complete
Baseball CD to your hard disk (Note: do not copy this file to the
C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories). Once the file has been
copied to the hard disk you will need to "extract" the video driver
by either typing the name of the file followed by the Enter key from
the MS-DOS prompt i.e. SVGA &lt;Enter&gt; or by double clicking on the file
(SVGA.EXE) in the File Manager. Once the files are extracted open
the DISPLAY.TXT file located in the directory where the expanded
video driver resides and find the section entitled "Installing a
Display Driver" for the steps necessary to complete the installation
of the video driver.

Complete Baseball also requires a 640 X 480 or higher display.  If
your monitor displays at less than a 640 X 480 resolution, and
Complete Baseball does not run, check to make sure that you have a
640 x 480 or higher display driver installed.

To check which video driver is currently installed on your computer:

   1. Run the Windows Setup application (this is usually found in
your Main Program group).

   2. Locate the Display driver item in the application window.

For information on installing a different display driver, choose
Contents from the Help menu in the Windows Setup application or
consult your Windows documentation.

----------------
DISPLAY PROBLEMS
----------------

In some situations, Complete Baseball may encounter video display
problems when using high resolution video drivers from various video
card manufacturers. The problems include:

   - Images and illustrations appearing grainy or having "glitches"

   - Videos displaying garbled images or crashing Complete Baseball

Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video
card manufacturer.  Contact the manufacturer of your video card to
determine if there are newer versions available. Their phone number
should be in the manuals that came with your video card or personal
computer.  Another option for obtaining updated drivers is the
Microsoft Download service, an electronic bulletin board that can be
accessed via a modem
at (206) 936-MSDL (6735).

If you experience problems with the display of images and graphics in
Complete Baseball, such as multiple versions of a single button
or images drawn on the screen incorrectly, try the following:

1. In your Windows directory, open the BASEBALL.INI file
   using Notepad or any other word processing program.

2. In the [BASEBALL] section of  the BASEBALL.INI file, change the
   RLEFIX setting to 1, for example:

                RLEFIX=1

Although this should fix display problems, changing the
RLEFIX setting will cause images to display more slowly.
