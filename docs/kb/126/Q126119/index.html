-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Microsoft FoxPro for MS- DOS Step by
Step," version 2.5.

The following topics are covered:

- Page 209: Show Code Snippet Is Missing from LSNS09B.SCX

- Page 252 Incorrectly Describes Origin of ABOUTBOX.SPR

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Page 209: Show Code Snippet Is Missing from LSNS09B.SCX
-------------------------------------------------------

The Show code snippet is missing from the practice file LSNS09B.SCX. This
omission effectively disables the error-checking function described on page
209.

Correction:

Show snippet needs to be added to LSNS09B.SCX.

Definitions of m_top and m_bottom need to be added to bottom of Setup snippet.

Comments:

To provide the error-checking function described in the first paragraph on page
209, you must add the following FoxPro code snippet. This code snippet prevents
errors caused if you attempt to view a record previous to the top of the record
stack or if you attempt to view a record after the bottom of the record stack.

To add a code snippet to the Show action, do the following:

1. Open LSNS09B.SCX by following the instructions on page 208.

2. From the Screen menu, choose Screen Layout.

3. Under READ Clauses, select the Show check box.

  A text box will appear, allowing you to enter a code snippet associated with
  the Show command.

4. Enter the following code snippet. Then, click OK to exit the Code Snippet
  dialog box.

        if (recno() = m_top)
           show get m_prev disable
        else
             show get m_prev enable
        endif
        if (recno() = m_bottom)
           show get m_next disable
        else
           show get m_next enable
        endif

5. Click OK to exit the Screen Layout dialog box.

The following code must be added to the Setup code snippet to define the m_top
and m_bottom variables. To access the Setup code snippet, follow these steps:

1. From the Screen menu, choose Open All Snippets.

2. Minimize or close all code snippet windows until you find the LSNS09B- Setup
  snippet.

3. Replace the goto top line with the following information at the end of the
  Setup code snippet:

        go bottom
        store recno() to m_bottom
        go top
        store recno() to m_top

After you make both of these modifications, save LSNS09B.SCX, and overwrite the
original version. After you generate the screen program, these changes will
support the statements in the first paragraph of page 209.

Page 252 Incorrectly Describes Origin of ABOUTBOX.SPR
-----------------------------------------------------

The first paragraph on page 252 describes the origin of the ABOUTBOX.SPR file as
follows:

  The screen program for the About window is already provided on your exercise
  disk and was copied to the PRACTICE subdirectory.

However, ABOUTBOX.SPR is not present on the practice disk, nor is it in the
PRACTICE directory.

Correction:

The last sentence of the first paragraph on page 252 should read:

  FoxPro generates the screen program for the About window the first time you
  generate the project.

Comments:

Although the description of the ABOUTBOX.SPR file origin is incorrect, the steps
in the lesson are still valid. No changes are necessary to successfully complete
the lessons involving this file.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
