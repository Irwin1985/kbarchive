The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, the
workstation makes requests across the network to the Mail server. If after
making a request the Mail workstation fails to get a response, the workstation
displays the dialog box:

  Looking for Microsoft Mail Server. Give Up

Depending on the state of the Mail system, this dialog box may appear and
disappear or may be displayed constantly on the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The workstation makes requests from the server. If it does not get a reply after
two retries, it displays the Give Up dialog box and at the same time sends out a
network lookup request to see if it can find the server.

If the server is found, the Give Up dialog box is dismissed (canceled) and the
cycle starts again with the workstation sending the original request again.

If the server is not found, the Give Up dialog box is not dismissed and in
approximately five seconds, the workstation sends out another network lookup
request to see if it can find the server. The workstation continues looking for
the server in this manner until it finds the server or until the user dismisses
the Give Up dialog box.

Note that Microsoft Mail uses only two AppleTalk protocols: AppleTalk Transaction
Protocol and Name Binding Protocol.

There are many reasons why the Mail server may not respond to the workstation:

1. The network is not properly terminated. Mail 3.1 is more sensitive to this
  problem than previous versions of Mail.

2. The server is temporarily busy responding to other workstation requests. Mail
  3.1 has the capacity to respond to eight user requests at one time while
  earlier versions of Mail can only handle four user requests at a time.

3. The server is no longer up and running. Verify this by looking in the
  Chooser.

4. For multi-zone AppleTalk networks, a router or bridge may be down.

5. There is a problem on the network such that network packets are lost,
  delayed, or corrupted. When signing onto Mail servers that are physically a
  long distance away, Give Ups are more likely.

In general, it is best to use the most current version of Microsoft Mail. With
each new version of Mail, problems with earlier version(s) are fixed. Some of
these fixes correct problems that can cause Give Up problems.
