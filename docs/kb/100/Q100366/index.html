SUMMARY
=======

This article provides supplementary information to Section 18.2.2.1 "Comparing
and Sorting Strings" in the Windows version 3.1 Software Development Kit
"Programmer's Reference, Volume 1: Overview" manual and the Windows Help
International Overview section. Specifically, this article provides information
about the sort order used by the Windows lstrcmp and lstrcmpi functions, the
location of accented characters in the sort, and how primary and secondary
values, or weights, are important when sorting a string using these functions.
This includes the different behavior of these functions when a language driver
is installed compared to when Windows's internal sort routine (English/American)
is used.

List boxes that include the LBS_SORT style use lstrcmpi internally to perform the
sort. Consequently, the information in this article applies to these list boxes
also.

ALPHSORT is a sample that shows the results of these sort routines, and contains
a dialog box with two list boxes. One list box contains the characters 32-255
and the option to display the characters in ANSI or sorted order; the other list
box includes the LBS_SORT style and contains various strings. Changing the sort
routine in use through the International Control Panel application illustrates
the effects of the different language drivers and Windows's internal sort
routine. For more information on the international sort, see the following:

Standard for Character Sets of CSA Z243.4 Standard," Alain LaBont&lt;e
acute&gt;:

Results," Denis Garneau

The sort order used by lstrcmp and lstrcmpi is:

1. Nonalphanumeric characters (in ASCII/ANSI order)

2. Numeric characters

3. Alphabetic characters

For performance reasons, the internal sort routine treats accented characters as
nonalphanumeric. Therefore, when the internal routine is used, accented
characters appear towards the beginning of the sort between punctuation and
numbers. In contrast, when a language driver is used, accented characters appear
near their unaccented equivalents because the language drivers sort accented
characters as alphabetic characters.

The following illustrate the differences in character order ("..." signifies
omitted characters):

ANSI Order:

  !"#...0...9:;&lt;...ABC...XYZ[\]...abc...xyz{|}...accented characters

Internal (English/American) Sort Routine Order:

  !"#...:;&lt;...[\]...{|}... accented characters 0...9AaBbCc...XxYyZz

Language Driver Order:

  ...!"#...:;&lt;...[\]...{|}...0...9A accented characters aBbCc...XxYyZz...

Note that the accented characters are intermixed with their alphabetic
counterparts here.

Primary and secondary weights of characters also affect the sort order when a
language module is installed. In this case, sorting is done by primary weight
for the entire length of the string, then by length, and lastly by secondary
weight if the primary weights of all the characters and the lengths of the
strings are equal. The secondary (diacritic) weights are important only when
there is a tie in the entire string. The internal (English/American) sort
routine does not sort extended characters; as mentioned above, they are sorted
as punctuation rather than alphabetic characters. Therefore, the internal
routines produce completely different results than the language routines in some
cases.

Character weights are important with case-sensitive sorting also. For example,
using lstrcmp will produce: A &lt; a &lt; B &lt; b; it will also produce: Aaa
&lt; aaa &lt; Aab. These examples use proper dictionary sort order, but the
second example is not necessarily obvious because if A &lt; a, then it seems Aab
&lt; aaa should also be true. In that case, it is said that A and a "collide"
(that is, their primary weights are the same) and a delayed comparison must be
performed if the remainders of the strings are equal. The strings continue to be
compared character by character. Because a &lt; b, then aaa &lt; Aab and the
comparison is complete. If the strings were equal all the way through (such as
Aaa and aaa) then A and a would collide once again. The rest of the strings
would be equal, and then the secondary weights of A and a would be checked to
determine that Aaa &lt; aaa.

EXAMPLES WHEN A LANGUAGE DRIVER IS INSTALLED
--------------------------------------------

Note: Special notation is used below to represent accented characters due to
limitations in the distribution media for this article. For example &lt;u
umlaut&gt; is used to represent the letter "u", which has an umlaut over it.
Likewise, &lt;a tilde&gt; represents the letter "a" accented with a tilde.

Nonaccented Characters
----------------------

The sort works on a character-by-character comparison, checking primary weights
in a string. As soon as the primary (alphabetic) weights show one string greater
than the other, the comparison stops. Therefore, sorted lists resemble the
following:

  a
  aa
  abba
  ac
  add
  b
  ba
  baa

Accented Characters
-------------------

The secondary (diacritic) weights are important only when there is a tie in the
string. For example, in the following sorted list, the characters in the first
two strings have identical primary sort weights ("s", "a", "m", "e") and the
strings are the same length. Because of the tie in primary weights and string
lengths, the secondary weights are then compared. The first difference in
secondary weight ("a" versus &lt;a tilde&gt;) breaks the tie. Secondary weights
are also a factor when comparing strings 4 and 5 below:

1. same

2. s&lt;a tilde&gt;me

3. sandy

4. schon

5. sch&lt;o umlaut&gt;n

6. school

It is important to apply the primary weights to the whole string first, and only
use the secondary weights in a tie. The primary weights must also carry more
importance than the secondary weights as well. Otherwise, an incorrect sort
would result (such as schon less than school less than sch&lt;o umlaut&gt;n).
This type of weighting creates a sort that makes a distinction between "unique,"
hard-coded letters of a language and mere variants of a letter (which are only
distinguished by diacritics).

Here is a sorted list using the English (International) driver:

  a
  &lt;a grave&gt;
  apple
  &lt;a grave&gt;pple
  apples
  &lt;a grave&gt;pples
  lu
  l&lt;u umlaut&gt;
  l&lt;u umlaut&gt;b
  lum

Here is the same list, using the internal [English (American)] routine:

  &lt;a grave&gt;
  &lt;a grave&gt;pple
  &lt;a grave&gt;pples
  a
  apple
  apples
  l&lt;u umlaut&gt;
  l&lt;u umlaut&gt;b
  lu
  lum
