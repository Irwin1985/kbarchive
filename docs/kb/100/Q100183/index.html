-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application that uses the UngetCommChar() function in Microsoft Windows
version 3.1 loses characters or experiences general protection (GP) faults.

CAUSE
=====

The ReadComm() function does not correctly account for a character buffered by
UngetCommChar().

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two methods to avoid this problem:

- Modify the application to provide its own implementation of the
  UngetCommChar() function.

-or-

- Use version 3.0 of the Windows communications (comm) driver. This method
  should be used only if an existing application cannot be modified to work
  around this problem in Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Microsoft Windows version 3.1. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The UngetCommChar() function places a character into a single character- holding
variable. When ReadComm() is subsequently called, the character is copied from
the holding variable to the application's buffer before any new characters are
read from the comm driver.

If version 3.0 of the comm driver is installed, ReadComm() transfers the
remaining characters from the comm driver one character at a time by calling the
comm driver exported function RECCOM. During this process, the application
buffer pointer and character count variables are correctly incremented and
decremented, respectively.

However, if version 3.1 of the comm driver is installed, ReadComm() transfers the
remaining characters from the comm driver by a single call to the comm driver
exported function READCOMMSTRING. During this process, the application buffer
pointer is correctly incremented after copying the character from the
UngetCommChar() holding variable, but the character count is not correctly
decremented. This results in one extra character being copied from the comm
driver into the application's buffer. The extra character is "lost" because the
application is not aware that an extra character has been read. This can also
cause a GP fault if copying an extra character to the application's buffer
exceeds the buffer segment limit. This problem occurs only on the first ReadComm
call that follows an UngetCommChar() call. This problem never occurs if
UngetCommChar() is never called.
