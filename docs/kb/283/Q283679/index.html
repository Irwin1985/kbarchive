SUMMARY
=======

Internet Information Server (IIS) with File Transmission Protocol (FTP)
installed supports the following connection types:

- Active-mode FTP

- Passive-mode FTP

This article provides information about FTP connections with each of these modes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IIS-based FTP service (MSFTPSVC) supports both active and passive mode
connections, depending on the method that is specified by the client. IIS does
not support disabling either active or passive mode connections, due to the lack
of such a feature in RFC 959. Unlike HTTP and most other protocols used on the
Internet, the FTP protocol uses a minimum of two connections during a session: a
half-duplex connection for control, and a full-duplex connection for data
transfer. By default, TCP port 21 is used on the server for the control
connection, but the data connection is determined by the method that the client
uses to connect to the server.

Active-mode FTP Connections:

Active-mode FTP is sometimes referred to as "client-managed" because the client
sends a PORT command to the server (over the control connection) that requests
the server to establish a data connection from TCP Port 20 on the server, to the
client, using the TCP port that is specified by the PORT command.

The FTP client sends the PORT command to the FTP server in the following format:

  PORT 192,168,0,3,19,243

where the first four comma-seperated values correspond to the octets of the
client's IP address, and the fifth and sixth values are the high- and low-order
bits of the 16-bit port number. To convert the high- and low-order bits into a
(decimal) port number, multiply the fifth value by 256 and add the sixth value
to it. In the example above, the TCP port (in decimal) is (256 x 19) + 243 =
5107, so the client is instructing the server to open a data connection to
192.168.0.3:5107. By default, the FTP client chooses an ephemeral port for the
data connection port. An ephemeral port is a port that is randomly chosen from
the available ports between 1024 and 65535.

NOTE: In Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, the valid default ephemeral port range
is 1024-5000. Increasing the ephemeral range in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000
requires adding a value to the system registry. For additional information on
increasing the default ephemeral range, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

The following is a typical sequence for an active-mode FTP connection:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Instruction                   | Sent From         | Sent To           | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USER MyUserName               | 192.168.4.29:8190 | 10.0.0.10:21      | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PASS MyPassword               | 192.168.4.29:8190 | 10.0.0.10:21      | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 250 CWD command successful.   | 10.0.0.10:21      | 192.168.4.29:8190 | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| &lt;file listing is transferred&gt; | 10.0.0.10:20      | 192.168.4.29:8191 | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Passive-mode FTP Connections:

Passive-mode FTP is sometimes referred to as "server-managed", because after the
client issues a PASV command, the server responds to that PASV instruction with
one of its ephemeral ports that will be used as the server-side port of the data
connection. After a data connection command is issued by the client, the server
connects to the client using the port immediately above the client-side port of
the control connection. The following is a typical sequence for a passive-mode
FTP connection:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Instruction                                     | Sent From         | Sent To           | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USER MyUserName                                 | 192.168.4.29:7971 | 10.0.0.10:21      |

Common Problems Encountered With FTP:

The most common problem encountered when you use FTP over the Internet results
when you attempt transfers through a Network Boundary Securing Device (NBSD)
such as a proxy, firewall, or Network Address Translation (NAT) device. In most
cases the NBSD allows the control connection to be established over TCP 21 (that
is, the user can successfully log on to the FTP server), but when the user
attempts a data transfer such as DIR, LS, GET, or PUT, the FTP client appears to
stop responding because the NBSD is blocking the data connection port that is
specified by the client. If the NBSD supports logging, you can verify port
blocking by reviewing the deny/reject logs on the NBSD.

In addition to causing problems for NBSD administrators, FTP is commonly
misunderstood as a secure means for transferring data, because the FTP server
can be configured to require a valid username and password combination prior to
granting access. Users should be aware that neither the credentials specified at
logon nor the data itself is encrypted or encoded in any way. All FTP data can
be easily intercepted and analyzed by any station on any network between the FTP
client and FTP server.

FTP Clients Provided by Microsoft:

The following table lists the FTP clients provided by Microsoft, and the
connection mode that each client supports:

+----------------------------------------------------------+
| FTP Client                        | Transfer Mode        | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Command-line                      | Active (non-passive) | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Internet Explorer 5.1 and earlier | Passive              | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Internet Explorer 5.5 and later   | Both                 | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| FrontPage ver.1.1 to Windows XP   | Active               | 
+----------------------------------------------------------+

File Transfer Alternatives:

Because of the NBSD configuration issues and security concerns with FTP, several
alternatives to standard FTP are used. One common alternative to FTP is the use
of HTTP as a file transfer method, because most firewalls allow HTTP connections
over TCP 80 and HTTPS connections over TCP 443. Although Microsoft has supported
HTTP-based file transfers for several years in products such as the FrontPage
Server Extensions and the Posting Acceptor, the recognized standard for HTTP
file transfers is WebDAV, the HTTP extensions for distributed authoring and
versioning. Defined by RFC 2518, WebDAV is built into IIS 5.0, and allows the
user to use WebDAV shares (that is, folders that are published on a
WebDAV-enabled Web server) in much the same way that network shares are used,
provided that the connection is made by a client that is capable of
communicating with WebDAV (such as Internet Explorer 5.0 and later).

NOTE: For more information on RFC 2518, see the following Web site:

  RFC 2518
  http://rfc.net/rfc2518.html


Because the FTP service in IIS does not support FTP over Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), if secure communications are important, and FTP is the desired transfer
protocol (as opposed to using WebDAV over SSL), consider using FTP over an
encrypted channel such as a Virtual Private Network that is secured with
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol or IPSec. For more information on FTP over
SSL, see RFC 2228.
