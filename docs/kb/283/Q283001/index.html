SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability that
affects Windows NT 4.0-based servers that provide secure remote sessions. The
vulnerability may allow a malicious user to prevent an affected computer from
providing service.

The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) service has a security vulnerability
in the code that handles a certain type of data packet, which results in a leak
of kernel memory. If a sufficient number of packets that contain a specific
malformation are received by an affected server, kernel memory eventually
becomes exhausted. This can cause the server to stop responding (hang). When the
computer hangs, you must reboot the computer. Note that any PPTP sessions that
are running are lost when you reboot the computer. The malicious user does not
need to establish a valid PPTP session to exploit the vulnerability.

The vulnerability does not threaten the security of the data in PPTP sessions in
any way; it is strictly a denial-of-service vulnerability. Computers that are
running the PPTP service are the only computers that are affected by this
vulnerability (the service does not run by default). Windows 2000-based
computers, including Windows 2000-based computers that are running PPTP, are not
affected by this vulnerability.
