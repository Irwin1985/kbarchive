-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
- MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Unattended Setup and Computer Profile Setup (CPS) fail to install the SMC 9332
EtherPower 10/100 PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter.

Following the instructions on "Profiling systems with OEM netcards" in the
Cpsread.txt file in the Windows NT version 3.5 Resource Kit or the Cps.hlp file
in the Windows NT version 3.51 Resource Kit is not sufficient.

CAUSE
=====

The Oemsetup.inf file for the SMC 9332 EtherPower10/100 PCI Fast Ethernet
Adapter is not designed to work with Unattended Setup or Computer Profile Setup.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow the instructions for the kind of Setup you are
doing, either CPS or Unattended.

Computer Profile Setup
----------------------

1. Before you run Uplodprf.exe, modify Cps.ini as described in the following
  note, which is included in both the Cpsread.txt in the Windows NT 3.5
  Resource Kit and the Cps.hlp in the Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit:

     [Registry]
      FindInstalledServicesAt =
      SOFTWARE\Microsoft,SOFTWARE\StandardMicrosystemsCorporation

2. Run Uplodprf.exe.

3. After running Uplodprf.exe, on the Distribution System back up
  %Systemroot%\System32\Ntlanman.inf to Ntlanman.bak.

WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide problems
before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
modification of Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file modifications at your
own risk.

4. On the Distribution System modify %Systemroot%\System32\Ntlanman.inf:

  ; Original Line below with exclamation point
  ;            set AdapterSrcDir = $(OEMNetDrive)
  ; Corrected syntax with exclamation point
               set AdapterSrcDir = $(!OEMNetDrive)

5. On the Distribution system, modify %Systemroot%\System32\Defaults.inf:

     [NetworkAdapterData]
     !AutoNetOption = SMC9332
     !OEMNetOption = YES
     !OEMNetDrive = C:\SMC\ 
     !OEMNetInfFile = C:\SMC\oemsetup.inf

6. On Distribution System, disable the Read-Only attribute on
  %Systemroot%\System32\Oemnad0.inf.

7. On the Target system, create a directory called SMC on the partition where
  Windows NT will be installed.

8. Copy the OEM files to the SMC directory created in the previous step. These
  OEM files may be located on the Windows NT compact disc in the
  \DRVLIB\NETCARD directory or may be available from the network card
  manufacturer.

9. Modify \SMC\Oemsetup.inf to avoid dialog boxes, as shown below in steps a and
  b.

WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide problems
before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
modification of Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file modifications at your
own risk.

  a. First OEMSETUP.INF modification:

  installadapter = +
  ;; The below IF statement was added to avoid setup dialogs during
  CPS/Unattended Setup
  ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == "YES"

     goto installproduct

  endif
  ;; The above IF statement was added to avoid setup dialogs during
  CPS/Unattended Setup

  b. Second Oemsetup.inf modification:

   The code fragment below can be found at the end of the installproduct
   section.

     ;; Below lines added to retrieve netcard parameters from answer file during
     CPS/Unattended Setup
     ifstr(i) $(!STF_GUI_UNATTENDED) == "YES"

      Shell $(UtilityInf),AddDefaultNetCardParameters,$(HardParameterKey)

     endif
     ;; Above lines added to retrieve netcard parameters from answer file during
     CPS/Unattended Setup

        CloseRegKey $(HardNetCardKey)
        CloseRegKey $(HardNetRuleKey)
        CloseRegKey $(HardParameterKey)

   EndForListDo
   EndWait
   goto successful

     updateparameters =+

NOTE: Similar modifications should work for the SMC 8432 and 8434 Ethernet
adapters.

10. Run Winntp.exe

For more information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Q143134OEMSETUP.INF Modifications for Automated Windows NT Setup

Q139897Automating Intel EtherExpress Pro Setup

You can also refer to the "Programmer's Guide" included in the Windows NT Device
Driver Kit (DDK), or contact Microsoft Consulting Services or a Microsoft
Solution Provider. Microsoft Product Support Services, Corporate Network
Systems, does not support the modification of Oemsetup.inf files. It is
recommended that you perform a test run of Winntp.exe to verify whether your
Oemsetup.inf file supports Unattended or Computer Profile Setup.

Unattended Setup
----------------

1. Copy the \I386 directory from the Windows NT compact disc to your hard disk
  drive.

2. Expand I386\Ntlanman.in_ to Ntlanman.inf. The Expand.exe file is located in
  the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory.

3. Rename I386\Ntlanman.in_ to Ntlanman.bk_

WARNING: Modification of Setup files can cause serious, system-wide problems
before and after Setup and may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct
them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
modification of Setup files can be solved. Make Setup file modifications at your
own risk.

4. Modify I386\Ntlanman.inf as follows:

  ; Original Line below with exclamation point
  ;            set AdapterSrcDir = $(OEMNetDrive)
  ; Corrected syntax with exclamation point
               set AdapterSrcDir = $(!OEMNetDrive)

NOTE: It is not necessary to rename Ntlanman.inf to Ntlanman.in_. Windows NT
Setup does not require the file to be compressed or named with an .in_
extension.

5. Modify the [NetworkAdapterData] section in your "Answer File" as follows:

  [NetworkAdapterData]
  !AutoNetOption = SMC9332
  !OEMNetOption = YES
  !OEMNetDrive = C:\SMC\
  !OEMNetInfFile = C:\SMC\oemsetup.inf

6. Create a directory called SMC on the partition to which Windows NT will be
  installed.

7. Copy the OEM files to the SMC directory created in the previous step. These
  OEM files may be located on the Windows NT compact disc in the
  \DRVLIB\NETCARD directory or may be available from the network card
  manufacturer.

8. Modify \SMC\Oemsetup.inf to avoid dialog boxes as shown in Step 9 in the
  above Computer Profile Setup section.

9. Run Unattended Setup.
