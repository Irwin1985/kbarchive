Error 102: "Setup is unable to find a compressed library file..."
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You may receive the following error when you try to run the Setup program on a
Windows 3.x computer:

  Setup is unable to find a compressed library file required to proceed with
  the installation. Check to make sure all required files are located with the
  setup program. Error 102

Comments:

This CD-ROM requires the Microsoft Windows 95 or later operating system to run
properly. (See requirements on back of product box.) If you have Windows 3.11 or
earlier, please upgrade to Windows 95 before trying to install this CD-ROM.

Installation instructions don't appear after inserting CD-ROM
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following installation instructions appear on the CD-ROM case for "Microsoft
Windows 95 Starts Here:"

  Start the computer
  Insert the Starts Here CD into the CD drive
  Follow the instructions on the screen

However, not all computer systems will automatically run the setup program when
the CD is inserted.

Correction:

The following information should be added to the bottom of the Install section on
the CD-ROM jewel case back cover:

  NOTE: If instructions do not appear automatically, please select Run from the
  Start menu. Then type D:\SETUP and click OK to run the setup program.

Comments:

To install this CD-ROM on a Windows 95 computer that does not automatically run
the setup program:

  Select Run from the Start menu
  Type "D:\SETUP" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box provided, and
  then click OK.

  (Change the CD-ROM drive letter if necessary)

Please note that this CD-ROM will not run on Windows 3.x. (See requirements on
back of product box.) If you have Windows 3.x on your computer, you will need to
upgrade to Windows 95 before you can use this CD-ROM.

Audio or video missing or not operating
---------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Audio works fine for the initial videos, but does not work on the step by steps
and other parts of the program.

Install works fine, but initial video comes up as a blank, gray window with a
slider at the bottom. Clicking Play and other buttons does not start the video.
Moving the slider might display the following error:

  Video not available, cannot find 'vids.msvc' decompressor.

Correction:

"Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here" requires a full installation of Windows 95,
including the multimedia audio and video compression components.

Comments:

Missing sound indicates that audio compression for Windows 95 is not properly
installed. Missing video indicates that video compression is not properly
installed.

To install audio and video compression for Windows 95:

1. Click Settings on the Start menu, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click the Windows Setup tab, and then scroll down to the Multimedia
  component.

4. Click to select the Multimedia check box to install all Multimedia
  components, or click the Details button and click to select both the Audio
  Compression and Video Compression check boxes.

5. Click OK (then click OK again if in the Details window), and then follow any
  additional directions presented to add the newly selected components to
  Windows 95.

The missing audio and video will work properly once both compression components
for Windows 95 are properly installed.

Hourglass stops responding after initial Starts Here screen presented
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Symptom:

After inserting the CD-ROM, an initial splash screen appears for "Microsoft
Windows 95 Starts Here." However, the pointer becomes an hourglass, and no
further activity occurs.

Comments:

This symptom is typically caused if you use Windows 95 Shell enhancement
software, such as Norton Navigator or Packard Bell Navigator. "Microsoft Windows
95 Starts Here" is incompatible with software that replaces or enhances the
Windows 95 Start button or any other portion of the Windows 95 Shell.

To run "Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here," please disable or temporarily
uninstall any navigator or other Shell enhancement programs.

Computer stops responding after pressing button on the Contents screen
----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here" automatically installs and runs the
introduction video. After you click the New or Upgrade button, the Contents
window appears with several buttons.

Pressing the "What's in Windows Basics" (or many of the other buttons) may cause
your computer to stop responding or fail.

Comments:

Computers with an ATI Mach 64 video card installed will fail when trying to play
certain types of video clips. Disabling the graphics hardware acceleration will
avoid this problem.

To disable graphics hardware acceleration:

1. Using the right mouse button, click the My Computer icon, and then click
  Properties.

2. Click the Performance tab, and then click the Graphics button.

3. Drag the Hardware acceleration slider from Full to None. Below the slider,
  the text will state, "No accelerator functions: Use this setting only if your
  computer frequently stops responding or has other severe problems."

4. Click OK, and then click Close to accept this change. When asked to restart
  your computer, click Yes.

"Windows 95 Starts Here" will run properly once hardware acceleration is
disabled.

ATI has developed new Windows 95 video driver software that corrects this problem
without disabling hardware acceleration. To obtain the latest software driver
for this video card, please contact ATI.
