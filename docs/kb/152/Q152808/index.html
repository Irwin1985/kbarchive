IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the Microsoft Exchange Server service
account after the initial Exchange Server installation.

Microsoft does not recommend that you change the Exchange Server service account.
However, you can use the following procedure in a situation where there is a
single Exchange Server site and a single Exchange Server computer. In situations
where there is more than one Exchange Server computer or site, the only
workaround is a complete reinstallation of Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

You may find that your Microsoft Windows NT administrator account is the Exchange
Server service account some time after installation. To change the Exchange
Server service account without reinstalling Exchange Server:

1. Create a new Windows NT account that will be the new Exchange Server service
  account. Give this account Act as Part of the Operating System, Logon as a
  Service, and Restore Files and Directories rights. The password must be the
  same as the current Exchange Server service account password.

2. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r

3. Assign the new account Service Account administrator permissions on the
  Organization container, Site container, and Configuration container property
  pages.

4. Add the new account to the Schema object:

  a. View the raw directory. To do so, on the View menu, click Raw Directory.
     After you click Raw Directory, a check mark is displayed on the View menu
     in front of Raw Directory.

  b. A new object called the Schema object is displayed in the directory tree
     at the site level. Click the Schema object, and then click Raw Properties
     on the File menu.

  c. Under "List attributes of type", click to select All.

  d. Click to select "Object Attribute", scroll down to
     "NT-Security-Descriptor", and then click Editor.

  e. Under "Attribute Editor Selection", click to select "NT Security
     Descriptor", and then click OK.

  f. Add the new account.

  g. Click OK.

  h. Click OK, click Apply, and then click OK.

  i. Click Set, click Apply, click OK, click Yes, and then click OK.

  j. Close the Microsoft Exchange Administrator Console.

5. If the new account is not a member of the Local Administrators group, give
  the new account Full Control on the following registry keys and subkeys:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

  HKEY_USERS

  To do this, you need to edit the registry.

  Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), click to select each key, and then
  perform the following steps:

  a. Click Security, and then click Permissions.

  b. Click "Replace Permission on Existing Subkeys".

  c. Click Add.

  d. Click the new account in the "Add Users and Groups" list.

6. Stop the Exchange Server services.

7. In Control Panel, double-click Services and change the Log On account for
  each Exchange Server service. To do this, click each Exchange Server service,
  click Startup, and change the Log On As account. Enter the password for each
  service.

8. Restart all of the Exchange Server services. All of the services should start
  with the new Exchange Server service account.

If you want to change the password, you can change it by using the Exchange
Server Administrator program, in the Configuration property page. You must also
change the password in Windows NT by using the User Manager for Domains
utility.

Under the C:\Exchsrvr folder, there are five shared folders (the Add- ins,
Address, Connect, Res, and Tracking.log folders). For proper operation, the
default permissions on these folders are the following:

- Administrator: Full Control

- Everyone: Read

- &lt;service_account&gt;: Full Control

You need to change the permissions on these folders to reflect the new service
account that is in use.

NOTE: This procedure also works on a Windows 2000, Exchange 5.5 cluster server
implementation.
