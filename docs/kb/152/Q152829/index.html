SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Voice to create a custom voice command for a program that
is running but not active, the command may not function properly. When you
attempt to run the custom voice command, you may find that the command applies
to the program that was active when you created the command instead of the
program to which you want the command to apply. Note that this problem occurs
even though the custom voice command appears below the program to which you want
the command to apply in the "What Can I Say?" list.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you create a custom voice command by capturing a
series of actions that you perform, instead of creating a command by selecting
actions that you performed previously or creating a command that causes
specified text to be typed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, make sure the program to which you want the custom
voice command to apply is the active program before you create the command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Voice version 1.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a custom voice command in Microsoft Voice, click the Microsoft Voice
icon on the taskbar, point to Create Voice Command, and then click From
Selection, Select Previous Actions, or Capture Next Actions. When you create a
new custom voice command in this manner, you can specify that the command
applies to all programs, or to one particular program. To create a voice command
for a particular program, the program must be running when you create the
command.
