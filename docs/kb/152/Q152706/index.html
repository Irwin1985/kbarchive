SYMPTOMS
========

After you click the icon to start the checkers game, if you attempt to bypass
PJ's instructions by clicking the mouse or by pressing the ESC key, the program
may not advance. The instructions may not terminate, depending on which
instructions are being narrated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Depending on which portion of the narration you are watching, it may be possible
to click on PJ and stop the narration. The following section describes when and
if you can click on PJ to stop the instructions he is giving you when you are
starting the checkers game:

1. You can stop PJ's narration by clicking on PJ while PJ is balancing on the
  checker and talking or while he is saying, "Who do you want to play? Paul, or
  another Friend?"

2. If you click on PJ just before, or immediately as he starts to say, "To start
  the game choose Easy, Medium, or Hard" the narration will stop. Otherwise PJ
  will continue his narration, and clicking on him will not stop the narration.

3. After you have chosen the difficulty level for the game, PJ will say, "OK.
  Good luck. Black goes first. Pickup a black piece and move it to a nearby
  black square. And if you not sure how to play, click the booklet." You can't
  stop this narration by clicking on PJ, it will always play in its entirety.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are the game parameters you select before starting each game:

- Number of Players: You can choose to either play against a Friend (two-player
  mode) or against Paul (one-player mode).

- Level of Difficulty: You may select the level of difficulty (Easy, Medium, or
  Hard).
