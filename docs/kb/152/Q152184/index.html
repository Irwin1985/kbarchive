MORE INFORMATION
================

Q. What modem speed can I use when connecting to MSN?

A. MSN dial-up access supports modem speeds from 28.8 to 56k BPS.

In addition MSN has high speed access offerings. For more information go to
&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;&lt;A0&gt;http://essentials.msn.com/access/. In the future, MSN will be accessible by
satellite connection as well.

Q. How can I tell at what speed I'm connected?

A. After you connect, double-click the modem icon that is on the right side of
your taskbar. This brings up a window that contains the Connection speed. If you
are using OSR2, double click on the linked computer icon.

Q. What is a roaming fee?

A. During signup for MSN, you specified your home country. When you connect to
MSN or the Internet in your home country, you are charged a standard connection
fee based on your membership plan. If you travel outside of your home country
and use an MSN supplied phone number to connect to MSN or the Internet in
another country, you will be charged a roaming fee instead of the standard
connection fee.

Q. Why does my modem often drop its connection?

A. If your modem often drops its connection, check your Modem Settings, Port
Settings, and UART. For step-by-step instructions, please refer to the next
three questions and answers.

Q. How do I check my dial-up modem settings?

A. To check your dial-up modem settings, follow these steps:

  1. Double-click MY Computer icon on your desktop.
  2. Double-click Dial Up Networking Right, click MSN Connection and click
  Properties.
  3. Click Configure.
  4. Select the Connection tab.
  5. Click Advanced.
  6. Clear the Error Control check box.
  7. Set Flow Control to Hardware.
  8. Set Modulation Type should be set to Standard.

Q. How do I check my dial-up modem port settings?

A. To check your dial-up modem port settings, follow these steps:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
  2. Double-click the System icon.
  3. Select the Device Manager tab.
  4. Open Ports on the list.
  5. Double-click the Port your modem is on.
  6. The Bits per Second should be set to 38400 if you have a 28800 modem and
  115200 if you have a 56k modem.
  7. Flow Control should be set to Hardware.

Q. How do I check my UART?

A. To check your UART, follow these steps:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
  2. Double-click the Modems icon.
  3. Click the Diagnostics tab.
  4. Select the port your modem is on by clicking it.
  5. Click More Information.
  6. Here you will see the UART.

The preferred UART is a 16550, because it handles higher speeds. If your UART is
8250, make sure all modem settings are set to 9600, even if your modem is
faster.

Q. Can I force MSN to dial without stopping at the Sign In screen?

A. It is not possible to avoid the Sign In screen when connecting to MSN.

Q. How can I tell how long I have been connected?

A. Double-click the modem icon that is on the right side of your taskbar.
