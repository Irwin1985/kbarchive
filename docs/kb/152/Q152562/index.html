The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article is a general overview of how to connect two or more computers
running Windows 95 to form a network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can connect two or more computers running Windows 95 using the following
methods:

- Using a network adapter in each computer.

  NOTE: If you connect computers using network adapters and twisted-pair cable,
  please note that you need a 10Base-T hub to connect the computers. If you
  connect computers using network adapters and Thinnet (BNC/COAX) cable, you
  must connect the cable to each network adapter using a T-connector with a
  terminator at each end of the cable.

- Using your modem as a dial-up adapter to dial into a Dial-Up Networking
  Server (a component of Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95) or other remote
  server.

- Using Direct Cable Connection (DCC).

  NOTE: A maximum of 2 computers can be connected at a time using DCC.

Connecting with Network Adapters
--------------------------------

NOTE: This section assumes that each computer has a network adapter installed and
that your computers are connected together properly using network cable. For
information about how to configure your network adapters and physically connect
your computers, consult the documentation included with your network adapters or
contact the manufacturer(s) of your network adapters.

After the physical connections are made, use the Add New Hardware tool in Control
Panel to detect your network adapter. Once the network adapter is set up, follow
these steps to make sure the correct network components are installed:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, and then click
  Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Configuration tab, make sure that at least the following network
  components are installed:

   - Client: Client for Microsoft Networks (if you do not have a Novell
     NetWare server, you do not need to install the Client for NetWare
     networks).

   - Adapter: This should be the network adapter detected by the Add New
     Hardware Wizard.

   - Protocol: Choose at least one of the following:

      - NetBEUI                       Best for small networks
                                      where routing does not
                                      take place

      - IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol   Used by Novell NetWare
                                      networks; best for small
                                      to large networks where
                                      routing takes place

      - TCP/IP                        The default protocol used by
                                      the World Wide Web; best for
                                      any size network where routing
                                      takes place.

   - Service: File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks

3. Click File And Print Sharing, click the appropriate check boxes to select
  them, and then click OK.

4. On the Identification tab, enter a name for your computer and your workgroup,
  and then click OK.

  NOTE: The computer name must be unique for each computer on the network and
  should be no more than 15 characters in length. In small networks, the
  workgroup name should normally be the same for each computer so that all
  computers are visible in the same workgroup when browsing. Avoid using spaces
  and the following characters in computer and workgroup names:

     / \ * , . " @

5. Restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.

To share network resources, follow these steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the drive, folder, or printer you want to
  share with members of your network, and then click Sharing on the menu that
  appears.

3. On the Sharing tab, click Shared As, and then type a name for the share in
  the Share Name box.

4. Click the access type you want for this shared resource. For a description of
  an access type, use the right mouse button to click the access type, and then
  click What's This? on the menu that appears.

5. Type a password for the shared resource.

  NOTE: You do not have to assign a password to a shared resource. A password
  simply gives you additional security.

6. Click OK.

To connect to a shared resource, use one of the following methods:

- Double-click Network Neighborhood, double-click a listed computer to see the
  resources shared by that computer, and then double-click a shared resource to
  view its contents.

- Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood or My Computer,
  click Map Network Drive on the menu that appears, and then enter the
  following line in the Path dialog box:

     \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt;

  where &lt;ComputerName&gt; is the name of the computer you are connecting to,
  and &lt;ShareName&gt; is the name of the shared resource.

- Click Start, click Run, and then enter the following line in the Open box:

     \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt;

  where &lt;ComputerName&gt; is the name of the computer you are connecting to,
  and &lt;ShareName&gt; is the name of the shared resource.

- Click Start, point to Find, click Computer, and then type the name of the
  computer that you want to locate. When the computer is found, double-click
  the computer name to show the resources shared by that computer.

Connecting with Dial-Up Adapters
--------------------------------

Dial-Up Networking lets you use your modem to connect to a network through a
remote server.

For information about connecting to a remote server using Dial-Up Networking,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q145843 How to Connect to a Remote Server

Connecting with Direct Cable Connection
---------------------------------------

You can use Direct Cable Connection to establish a direct serial or parallel
cable connection between two computers. For information about using Direct Cable
Connection, see the "Direct Cable Connection, setting up a direct cable
connection" online Help topic in Windows 95.

Resource Materials
------------------

The Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit contains additional detailed information
about many networking topics. For information about the Windows 95 Resource Kit
and other helpful resources, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
