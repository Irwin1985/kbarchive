SUMMARY
=======

The MFC database classes found in Visual C++ versions 1.x, 2.x, 4.0, and 4.1
were not written to be used in a console application. However, with some
modification, you can use the 32-bit database classes in a console application.
The techniques presented here apply to both the MFC ODBC and MFC DAO classes.

Starting with Visual C++ 4.2, the MFC ODBC classes were rendered safe for use
within console applications. Many of the internal dependencies listed below are
no longer present in the 4.2 and later MFC ODBC class libraries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both the MFC ODBC and MFC DAO classes have dependencies upon non-Database MFC
classes, particularly with the existence of a global CWinApp-derived object. The
following list presents these dependencies along with suggestions for working
around them.

For either MFC ODBC or MFC DAO, it is very important to test your code not only
for successful execution, but for graceful recovery on unexpected conditions
(such as the database not being in an expected path). The majority of the
"dependencies" these classes have on MFC come from error recovery and reporting
code within the database classes.

It is also important to remember that the Visual C++ MFC database classes
released through version 4.1 were not intended or tested for use in a console
application.

Both MFC ODBC and MFC DAO Classes
---------------------------------

- Exception Handling

  Microsoft recommends that you wrap exception handling code around each of your
  calls to an MFC Database class method.

- Exception Handling and Resource Handles

  Internally, MFC ODBC uses AfxThrowDBException to throw exceptions, and MFC DAO
  uses AfxThrowDaoException() to throw exceptions. Both functions can result in
  a call to CString::LoadString(), which requires a resource handle for the
  application. In addition, the MFC DAO method
  CDaoException::GetErrorMessage(), used to get more information about a DAO
  error, also calls CString::LoadString().

  Within CString::LoadString() is a call to AfxLoadString(), which calls
  AfxGetResourceHandle(), which expects a valid resource handle to be defined
  for the EXE.

  To work around this, define a valid resource handle for your application as
  shown in this code:

        hMod = ::GetModuleHandle( "MyApp.Exe" );
        ASSERT( hMod );
        AfxSetResourceHandle( hMod );

MFC ODBC Classes
----------------

- Use of AfxGetApp() in the MFC ODBC Classes

  In synchronous mode when an error is encountered, CDatabase::Open() attempts
  to get a pointer to a global CWinApp-derived object and assert if it is not
  found. To avoid this, you can:

   - Invoke CDatabase::SetSynchronousMode( TRUE ) to disable asynchronous
     processing.

     -or-

   - Create a global instance of a CWinApp-derived class in your application
     similar to the one shown below. This will give you a global CWinApp object
     in your console application without actually invoking MFC in any way.

           class CMyApp : public CWinApp
           {
           public:
               virtual BOOL InitInstance( ) { return FALSE };
           };

           CMyApp theApp;

  This dependency was removed in Visual C++ 4.2. Use of Synchronous mode was
  also removed, as was the OnWaitForDataSource and InWaitForDataSource methods
  for both CDatabase and CRecordset.

- Avoiding the Need for a Valid Windows Handle

  The CDatabase::Open() method also attempts to acquire a valid Windows handle
  to pass to SQLDriverConnect. If the application using the classes can't
  provide one, the GetDesktopWindow method is called. This handle is used by
  the ODBC API call SQLDriverConnect as a parent handle to create a dialog if
  the database connection information provided is incomplete or inaccurate.

  It is possible to prevent this dialog from being displayed. For information on
  how to do it, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q150552 How to Avoid ODBC Login Dialog When Using MFC

MFC DAO Classes
---------------

The MFC DAO classes are relatively independent of the MFC library. However here
are some considerations to keep in mind when using them in a console
application:

- Use of AfxGetApp() in the MFC DAO Classes

  The initialization of a CDaoWorkspace object -- whether explicitly or
  implicitly by way of creation of a CDaoDatabase or CDaoRecordset object --
  forces a call to AfxDaoInit(). AfxDaoInit() attempts to ensure that DAO is
  properly terminated by setting the m_lpfnDaoTerm member of CWinApp to point
  to the AfxDaoTerm() function.

  If you do not have a global instance of a CWinApp-derived class, you need to
  call AfxDaoTerm() yourself to terminate DAO properly. For more information on
  the use of AfxDaoTerm(), please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:
