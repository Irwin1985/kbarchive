SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a description of Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of
Dinosaurs (MSB Dinosaurs).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Welcome to Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of
Dinosaurs. In this Magic School Bus adventure, you'll travel to seven different
locations in three different prehistoric time periods. Your objective is to help
the Friz replace three missing photographs from her photo album. You must find
the dinosaurs that were in the missing pictures and photograph them so that the
Friz will have them in her photo album again. You'll get clues that will help
lead you to the proper time and place so that you can photograph the missing
dinosaurs.

To find out which dinosaurs are missing from the photo album, go to the back of
the bus and click the photo album. Once you open the photo album, you can click
the page that is missing the photograph and get clues that will help you locate
the correct dinosaur. After you have traveled to the correct location and have
taken a picture of the dinosaur, the photograph will show up in the photo album.
You can turn the page and find clues as to the location of the next missing
dinosaur. You must find all three dinosaurs and take their pictures in order to
complete the game successfully.

Each different prehistoric location has games, activities, animations, and
interesting information about the different time periods. Don't forget to
explore the back of the bus to play games and gather information about the age
of dinosaurs.
