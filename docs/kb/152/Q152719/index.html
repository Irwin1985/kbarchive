SUMMARY
=======

This article describes a new feature that is included in Windows NT 3.51 Service
Pack 5. This feature is designed to allow you to reduce network traffic related
to Windows NT trust relationship polling over a wide area network (WAN) using
perhaps a leased line (for example, an ISDN or X.25 line) where the leased line
provider charges by the amount of network traffic. Trust relationship polling
occurs between domain controllers (DCs) to establish a secure channel.

In Windows NT 3.51 without this new feature, if the secure channel cannot be
established, it is retried every 15 minutes. With this new feature installed you
can control the intervals between which a DC sends discovery packets in search
of a DC of a trusted domain.

Microsoft has made a fix in Netlogon.dll so that you can increase the time
between retries and you can increase the time in which NETLOGON assumes a DC is
reachable (ScavengeInterval and ExpectedDialupDelay).


For additional information, , please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Q154355How to Tune Trusts for Dialup Routers in a WAN

When Windows NT Uses Polling Between Domain Controllers
-------------------------------------------------------

In Windows NT 3.51, once a secure channel to a trusted domain has been
established (that is, after the DC in domain_A found a DC in the trusted
domain_B), Windows NT does not continue to poll the secure channel to make sure
the secure channel is still available.

If, however, the DC is contacted for some other reason, for example, if a user
logs on and a pass-through authentication to the other domain is required, the
first DC needs to contact the second DC again and network polling of the secure
channel starts for this reason once again and stops after the the pass-through
authentication is completed.

Regular network traffic packets are not caused by trust relationship polling of
the secure channel, so if you frequently observe frames related to trust
relationship traffic on your WAN router, it is probably caused by an unreliable
WAN in which case this new feature helps you reduce this type of network
traffic.

NETLOGON Debug Output Samples
-----------------------------

The following sections numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 are about the NETLOGON debug
output that appears when trusts are involved:

1. The following NETLOGON debug-output is from a primary domain controller (PDC)
  of the trusting domain that cannot find a DC in the trusted domain (the
  network cable is disconnected):


  00:00:00 NlInitTrustList: MASTERDOM in LSA
  00:00:00 NlUpdateTrustListBySid: MASTERDOM: Added to local trust list
  00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Start Discovery
  00:00:05 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Discovery retry 1
  00:00:10 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Discovery retry 2
  00:15:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Start Discovery
  00:30:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Start Discovery

  The above frames show that the PDC tries to find the DC by calling
  NlDcDiscoveryMachine three times and waits five seconds between each retry.


  After these three retries the Scavenger Timer causes NETLOGON to look for the
  trusted domain again every 15 minutes. Here are some of the frames that
  appear (sent by the PDC of the trusting domain):

  *BROADCAST    NBT NS: Query req. for MASTERDOM &lt;1C&gt;: check to find a
                trusted domain DC

  Because the PDC cannot find a DC by broadcasting the PDC starts using WINS:

  *BROADCAST   ARP_RARP  ARP: Request, Target IP: 191.60.0.1:   find the
               router to get to WINS

2. The PDC of the trusting domain can find a DC in the trusted domain:

  NETLOGON debug output:

  00:00:00 NlInitTrustList: domainname in LSA
  00:00:00 NlUpdateTrustListBySid: domainname: Added to local trust list
  00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: domainname: Start Discovery
  00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: Found DC \\D-SPOCK on
     transport \Device\NetBT_Lance1

  00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: DC \\D-KIRK ignored. DC
     previously found.

  00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: DC \\NTD-UHURA ignored. DC
     previously found.

  00:00:00 NlDcDiscoveryMachine: MASTERDOM: DC \\D-MCKOY ignored. DC
     previously found.

  Here are some of the frames that appear (sent by the PDC of the trusting
  domain to the DC of the trusted domain):

  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       D-KIRK
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       D-SPOCK
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       D-MCKOY
  NETLOGON  SAM Response to SAM LOGON request  D-SPOCK         RESCTL1
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       191.60.19.243
  NETLOGON  SAM Response to SAM LOGON request  D-KIRK          RESCTL1
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       NTD-UHURA
  NETLOGON  SAM Response to SAM LOGON request  NTD-UHURA       RESCTL1
  NETLOGON  SAM Response to SAM LOGON request  D-MCKOY         RESCTL1

3. After the trust setup fails once because the cable is purposely disconnected,
  the following NETLOGON debug-output occurs with the cable reconnected. The
  PDC tries to log on to the trusted domain:

  00:00  NlSessionSetup: MASTERDOM Try Session setup
  00:00 NlStartApiClientSession: MASTERDOM: Bind to server \\D-SPOCK.
  00:00 NlSetStatusClientSession: MASTERDOM: Set connection status to 0
  00:00 NlSessionSetup: MASTERDOM Session setup Succeeded

  Here are some of the frames sent between trusting PDC and trusted DC:

  R_LOGON   RPC Client call logon:NetrServerReqChallenge(..)
  R_LOGON   RPC Server response logon:NetrServerReqChallenge(..)
  R_LOGON   RPC Client call logon:NetrServerAuthenticate2(..)
  R_LOGON   RPC Server response logon:NetrServerAuthenticate2(..)
  R_LOGON   RPC Client call logon:NetrLogonSamLogon(..)
  R_LOGON   RPC Server response logon:NetrLogonSamLogon(..)
  R_LOGON   RPC Client call logon:NetrLogonSamLogoff(..)
  R_LOGON   RPC Server response logon:NetrLogonSamLogoff(..)
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       D-MCKOY
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       D-KIRK
  NETLOGON  SAM LOGON request from client   RESCTL1       NTHANSJUS

4. After the trust is established, the connection to the trusted domain is timed
  out (internally in NETLOGON):

  00:00:00 NlTimeoutApiClientSession Called
  00:00:45 NlTimeoutApiClientSession Called
  00:01:30 NlTimeoutApiClientSession Called
  00:02:15 NlTimeoutApiClientSession Called
  00:02:15 NlTimeoutApiClientSession: MASTERDOM: Unbind from server \\D-
     SPOCK.

  00:03:00 NlTimeoutApiClientSession Called

  This causes only the following frames to appear on the network:

  SMB       C close file, FID = 0x805 RESCTL1       D-SPOCK         IP
  SMB       R close file  D-SPOCK         RESCTL1       IP
  RESCTL1      D-SPOCK        TCP       .A...., len:    0, seq:   7004192,
  ack:
  422155081, win: 7883, src RESCTL1       D-SPOCK         IP

  The DC calls NlTimeoutApiClientSession every 45 seconds.


  And finally the PDC drops the connection to the trusted DC by closing the
  named pipe.

  NOTE: The PDC does not drop the secure channel and therefore does not have to
  rediscover the DC in the trusted domain. This saves the PDC scavenger from
  having to look for the DC every 15 minutes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT
version 3.51.


This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
