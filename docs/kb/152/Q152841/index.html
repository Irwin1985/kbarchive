    SERVICE PACK 3

1.0  INTRODUCTION
-----------------
Service Pack 3 for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 is easy to install from
within Windows NT and changes only those files that were originally
set up on the Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server system.
Service Pack releases are cumulative: they contain all previous fixes
and any new fixes made to the system.

1.1  What's New in Service Pack 3
---------------------------------
RPC Transport

This service pack includes new versions of the remote procedure call
(RPC) run-time dynamic-link library (DLL) and the RPC subsystem
service (Rpcss.exe). These changes provide enhanced support for RPC
message queuing, which is a feature of the upcoming Microsoft Message
Queue Server (MSMQ). In order to use message queuing in an RPC
client/server application on Windows NT 4.0, you must have Service
Pack 3 installed on both the client machine and the server machine.
You also need Beta 2 or later of MSMQ installed on both the client
machine and the server machine.

If you are developing RPC applications that support MSMQ, you need
the new RPC run-time DLL, the new RPC subsystem service, and the new
RPC header files and Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL)
compiler (available in the Win32 Software Development Kit). Also,
RPC applications must support message queuing in order to use the
following new features:

The MIDL [message] attribute.

The ncadg_mq protocol sequence.

The RPC_C_MQ_* endpoint flags in the RPC_POLICY data structure.

The RpcBindingInqOption and RpcBindingSetOption functions.

For more information on using message queuing in your RPC
applications, see RPC Message Queuing in the Service Pack 3 SDK
Help file (see "Win32 APIs and SDK for Service Pack 3" later in
this file), or refer to the documentation in the upcoming MSMQ SDK.

CryptoAPI 2.0

The Microsoft Cryptography application programming interface
(CryptoAPI) provides developers with core cryptographic and
certificate functions. CryptoAPI 1.0 supports public-key and
symmetric-key operations, such as key generation, key management, key
exchange, encryption, decryption, hashing, digital signatures, and
verification of signatures. CryptoAPI 2.0 (the upgrade contained in
this service pack) includes this core cryptographic functionality as
well as certificate-based functionality. Developers can use
certificates with these public-key operations and perform the
necessary encapsulations and encoding to apply certificates within
their applications.

CryptoAPI 2.0 uses a service-provider model in which cryptography is
provided by Cryptographic Service Providers (CSPs). This model allows
developers to easily adapt their applications to evolving
cryptographic technologies and government export policies. Service
Pack 3 provides one CSP (the Microsoft RSA Base Provider), which
gives users and developers access to exportable cryptography.

CryptoAPI 2.0 supports existing standards, such as X.509 v.3
certificate formats, ASN.1 encoding, and both PKCS #7 and #10 for
encapsulation. This allows applications using CryptoAPI to
operate with other certificate-based systems that adhere to these
standards.

The release version of CryptoAPI 2.0 contains several updates to the
developer's release version of September 1996, including both
parameter changes and naming changes. These changes are reflected
in the Crypt32.dll and Wincrypt.h files. Please consult the
CryptoAPI 2.0 documentation for details.

DirectX 3.0

Service Pack 3 contains a complete software implementation of
DirectX 3.0 as well as ongoing hardware support for the DirectDraw
component of DirectX 3.0. This translates into the following major
feature changes since the release of DirectX 2.0 as supported in
Windows NT 4.0:

DirectDraw
Access to all 256 entries in the palette when in exclusive mode.

DirectSound
Software-based 3-D localization of audio (Direct3DSound APIs.)

DirectInput
COM interface supporting mouse and keyboard data with documentation
and sample programs.

DirectPlay
IDirectPlayLobby, an interface that allows an external application
to launch a DirectPlay 3.0 application and provide it with all
information necessary to connect to a session. Internet TCP/IP
service provider for multi-player applications over the Internet.

Direct3D
Software emulation for the Direct3D 3.0 API. (In Windows NT 4.0, we
provide a beta version of the software drivers for Direct3D 2.0.)

ODBC 3.0

Service Pack 3 includes the latest version of Microsoft Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) API. ODBC 3.0 provides an updated ODBC
Control Panel and an ODBC Administrator interface that uses tabbed
controls and provides more information about the ODBC components
installed and in use on your system. This updated version of ODBC
also introduces the concept of a file data source that can be shared
or placed on a central server. With the appropriate drivers
installed, ODBC 3.0 will let a user share a file data source or
place a file data source on a central server.

This new version of ODBC adheres to the standards of both the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International
Standards Organization (ISO). It is also backward compatible with
previous versions of the ODBC API. For more information on ODBC
3.0, refer to the documentation included with the ODBC 3.0 SDK.

SMB Signing

Service Pack 3 includes an updated version of the Server Message
Block (SMB) authentication protocol, also known as the Common Internet
File System (CIFS) file sharing protocol. The updated protocol has two
main improvements: it supports mutual authentication, which closes a
"man-in-the-middle" attack, and it supports message authentication,
which prevents active message attacks. SMB signing provides this
authentication by placing a digital security signature into each SMB,
which is then verified by both the client and the server.

In order to use SMB signing, you must either enable it or require it
on both the client and the server. If SMB signing is enabled on a
server, then clients that are also enabled for SMB signing will use
the new protocol during all subsequent sessions and clients that are
not enabled for SMB signing will use the older SMB protocol. If SMB
signing is required on a server, then a client will not be able to
establish a session unless it is enabled for SMB signing. SMB signing
is disabled by default on a server system when you install the Service
Pack; it is enabled by default on a workstation system when you apply
the Service Pack. For information on how to configure SMB signing, go
to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at http://www.microsoft.com/kb/ and
search for the following article: Q161372 -- How to Enable SMB
Signing in Service Pack 3.

Note: SMB signing will not work with the direct host IPX protocol.
This is because the direct host IPX protocol modifies SMBs in
a way that is incompatible with signature-enabled SMBs. This
incompatibility will be most obvious when you have direct host
IPX clients and you require SMB signing on the server. Requiring
SMB signatures on the server will cause the server to not bind
to the direct host IPX interface, which will then force all
connections to the server to be signed. If you disable the NWLink
binding on the server then you will be able to use SMB signing.

Also, SMB signing will impose a performance penalty on your
system. Although it doesn't consume any more network bandwidth,
it does use more CPU cycles on the client and server side.

For more information on SMB signing, see the Microsoft FTP site at
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/CIFS/sec.htm. For general
information on the CIFS protocol, see the Microsoft Web site at:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/networking/cifs/default.asp.

Password Filtering

This Service Pack includes a password filter (Passfilt.dll) that
allows system administrators to increase password strength. This
filter is copied to %system root%\SYSTEM32 when the Service Pack is
installed on the system. The password filter should be copied to
the primary domain controller for the domain, and to any backup
domain controllers in the event the server role in the domain
changes.

To use the password filter, the following registry entry must exist.
If it doesn't exist you must create it.

WARNING: Using the registry editor incorrectly can cause serious,
system-wide problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use
of the registry editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

Value: Notification Packages

Type: REG_MULTI_SZ

Data: Passfilt.dll

Notification Packages contains a list of DLLs to be loaded and
notified of password changes and password change requests. You can
audit the loading of Notification Packages by setting the audit policy
in User Manager. To do this, start User Manager and then click Audit
on the Policies menu. In the Audit Policy dialog box click Audit
These Events and then enable Restart, Shutdown, and System by
selecting the Success and/or Failure check boxes.

Passfilt.dll implements the following password policy:

1. Passwords must be at least 6 characters long.

2. Passwords must contain characters from at least 3 of the following
  4 classes:

   Class    Examples
   -----    --------

   English Upper Case Letters          A, B, C, ... Z
   English Lower Case Letters          a, b, c, ... z
   Westernized Arabic Numerals         0, 1, 2, ... 9
   Non-alphanumeric characters  .,;:*&amp;%!

3. Passwords may not contain your user name or any part of your full
  name.

Custom password filter DLLs can be written to implement different
password rules. For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base
article Q151082 Password Change Filtering &amp; Notification in Windows
NT. You can access the Knowledge Base at http://www.microsoft.com/kb/.

Restricting Anonymous User Access

Windows NT has a feature where anonymous logon users can list domain
user names and enumerate share names. Some customers who want enhanced
security have requested the ability to optionally restrict this
functionality. Service Pack 3 provides a mechanism for administrators
to restrict the ability for anonymous logon users (also known as NULL
session connections) to list account names and enumerate share names.

In addition, Service Pack 3 has a feature that restricts anonymous
logon users from connecting to the registry remotely. After
Service Pack 3 is installed, anonymous users cannot connect to the
registry and cannot read or write any registry data. Also, a new
built-in group known as Authenticated Users is created when you
install Service Pack 3. The Authenticated Users group is
similar to the Everyone group, except for one important difference:
anonymous logon users (or NULL session connections) are never members
of the Authenticated Users group.

For more information on these new features, including information
on configuring the registry to restrict anonymous user access to
list domain user names and enumerate share names, go to the Microsoft
Knowledge Base at http://www.microsoft.com/kb/ and search for the
following article: Q143474.

Using a System Key to Strongly Encrypt Password Information

Service Pack 3 provides the capability to use strong encryption
techniques to increase protection of account password information
stored in the registry by the Security Account Manager (SAM).
Windows NT stores user account information, including a derivative
of the user account password, in a secure portion of the registry
protected by access control and an obfuscation function. The
account information in the registry is only accessible to members
of the administrators group. Windows NT, like other operating
systems, allows privileged users who are administrators access to
all resources in the system. For users who require enhanced
security, strong encryption of account password derivative
information provides an additional level of security to prevent
administrators from intentionally or unintentionally accessing
password derivatives using registry programming interfaces.

The strong encryption capability in Service Pack 3 is an optional
feature. Strong encryption protects private account information by
encrypting the password data using a 128-bit cryptographically
random key, known as a password encryption key. Administrators may
choose to implement strong encryption by defining a system key for
Windows NT. To do this, administrators can run a utility called
Syskey.exe. For more information on using Syskey.exe to configure
a system key, go to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at
http://www.microsoft.com/kb/ and search for the following article:
Q143475.

Win32 APIs and SDK for Service Pack 3

Service Pack 3 includes several new APIs, including two Win32 APIs
pertaining to spin counts on critical sections
(InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount() and
SetCriticalSectionSpinCount()). To develop applications that take
advantage of these new APIs, a Service Pack 3 SDK will be available
on the Microsoft Web site at:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk

1.2 Support for PowerPC Platform
--------------------------------
Microsoft is in the process of phasing out all Windows NT-related
development for the PowerPC architecture. Because of this, there are
no PowerPC files included in Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0.
Microsoft plans to continue providing technical support for customers
who use Windows NT 4.0 on the PowerPC architecture.

1.3 Downloading and Extracting the Service Pack
-----------------------------------------------
If you have downloaded this Service Pack from an FTP site or a Web
site, you should read the release notes completely before you
extract and install the Service Pack.

After downloading the Service Pack, you will have a compressed
executable file (for example, nt4sp3_i.exe) on your hard drive. To
extract this file and begin the installation process, type
nt4sp3_i.exe at the Command Prompt or double-click the file from
NT Explorer. You can also extract the file into the current
directory without launching the installation program by using
the Command Prompt switch /x (for example, at the Command Prompt,
type nt4sp3_i /x).

2.0 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS NT 4.0 SERVICE PACK 3
---------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Before You Install the Service Pack
---------------------------------------
Close all active debugging sessions before installing this
Service Pack, otherwise the Update program will be unable to replace
system files that are in use. If a file is in use when you install
the Service Pack, a dialog box will appear in which you can choose to
cancel the installation or skip the file copy. We recommend you choose
to cancel the installation, and then run Update.exe again, being sure
to select the uninstall option. Close all active sessions on the
system, and then run Update.exe again to install the Service Pack.

Also, to maximize the ability to recover the system in the event of
installation failure, it is recommended that you do the following
before installing the Service Pack:

1. Update the system Emergency Repair disk using the Rdisk.exe
  command with the /s option.
2. Perform a full backup of the system, including the system registry
  files.
3. Disable any non-essential third-party drivers and/or services
  (that is, drivers and services that are not required to boot
  the system).
4. Contact the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that provided
  the driver or service for the updated versions of the file(s).

If you have installed a pre-release version of Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 prior to installing this Service Pack, you
must remove the pre-release version of Internet Explorer 4.0 from
your computer before you install the Service Pack. You may then
reinstall Internet Explorer after successfully completing the
Service Pack 3 installation. This will not be necessary with the
retail release of Internet Explorer 4.0. Upon retail release,
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 will be made available to
customers on the Microsoft Web site.

Users of NEC Versa 6050 or 6200 Series notebook computers that
shipped preinstalled with Windows NT version 4.0 should select
"Yes" when Service Pack 3 update.exe prompts you to replace the
hal.dll file.

If you are running SystemSoft's CardWizard for Windows NT (support
for PCMCIA) or PowerProfiler for Windows NT (support for Advanced
Power Management), you must complete critical pre-installation
procedures prior to installing this Service Pack.  Otherwise, your
computer may no longer boot after installation of Service Pack 3.
These procedures can be found in the product section at
http://www.systemsoft.com.

Advanced Power Management is not supported by Windows NT version 4.0.
As a result, Microsoft recommends that you remove Advanced Power
Management features before installing this Service Pack.

2.2 Installing the Service Pack
-------------------------------
To install the Service Pack from the compact disc:

1.  Insert the Service Pack compact disc into your CD-ROM drive.
2.  If a Web page opens in your browser after you insert the
   compact disc, click Windows NT Service Pack, and then
   click Install Service Pack.
3.  When you are asked whether you want to open the file
   Spsetup.bat or save it to disk, click Open and then follow
   the instructions that appear on the screen.

   Note: To use the uninstall feature of this Service Pack,
   you must create an Uninstall directory during the initial
   installation. Also, if you are reapplying the Service
   Pack after installing new software or hardware, you must
   choose to create a new uninstall directory. To indicate
   this, you must click "Yes, I want to create an Uninstall
   directory" when you are prompted. For further information,
   see Section 2.3 and 3.2.

4.  If a Web page doesn't automatically open when you insert
   the compact disc, open the Command Prompt window and change
   the directory to the drive letter associated with the
   CD-ROM drive.
5.  Change the directory to \i386 or \ALPHA (depending
   upon whether you have an Intel or ALPHA CPU), and type UPDATE.
6.  Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.

   Note: To use the uninstall feature of this Service Pack,
   you must create an Uninstall directory during the initial
   installation. Also, if you are reapplying the Service
   Pack after installing new software or hardware, you must
   choose to create a new uninstall directory. To indicate
   this, you must click "Yes, I want to create an Uninstall
   directory" when you are prompted. For further information,
   see Section 2.3 and 3.2.

To install the Service Pack from a network drive:

1.  At the Command Prompt, type the command to connect
   to the network drive which has the Service Pack
   files.
2.  Change the drive letter to that network drive.
3.  Change directory to \i386 or \ALPHA (depending
   upon whether you have an Intel or ALPHA CPU), and
   then type UPDATE.
4.  Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.

   Note: We recommend that you choose to create an Uninstall
   directory the first time you install the Service Pack. Also,
   if you are reinstalling the Service Pack after installing new
   software or hardware, you must choose to create a new
   Uninstall directory. To indicate this, click "Yes, I want
   to create an Uninstall directory" when you are prompted.
   For further information, see Section 2.3 and 3.2.

2.3  Service Pack Uninstall
---------------------------
This Service Pack contains an uninstall feature that you can use to
restore your system to its previous bootable state.

To enable the uninstall option, you must create an Uninstall
directory the first time you run Update.exe. To do this, when
prompted, click "Yes, I want to create an Uninstall directory." A
subdirectory in your Windows NT directory will be created. This
requires at least 60 MB of free space on the drive on which Windows
NT is installed.

To return your system to a previous bootable state, run Update.exe
and click "Uninstall a previously installed Service Pack." After
your system has restarted, the Update.exe program will replace the
files updated by the Service Pack with the files from the previous
installation and will return your registry settings to what they were
before Service Pack 3 was installed.

Note: If you install any applications that require Service Pack 3
or have bug fixes contained in Service Pack 3, performing an uninstall
could adversely affect those applications.

Note: If you plan to install an older service pack after uninstalling
Service Pack 3, take note of the following important precaution.
Service Pack 3 modifies the Security Account Manager (SAM) database
such that older versions of the SAMSRV.DLL and WINLOGON.EXE files no
longer recognize the database structure.  Therefore, the uninstall
process does not restore these files when uninstalling Service Pack 3.
If you install a prior service pack (e.g., Service Pack 2) after
uninstalling Service Pack 3, click "No" on the "Confirm File Replace"
dialog boxes that ask if you wish to overwrite SAMSRV.DLL and
WINLOGON.EXE.  If you overwrite the newer files with their older
versions, you will be unable to logon to the system.

3.0  USER NOTES
---------------

3.1 Emergency Repair Disk
-------------------------
If you use the Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk to repair your
Windows NT system at some time after you install the
Service Pack, you will need to reinstall the Service Pack after the
repair is completed. This is because the Emergency Repair Disk
repairs your system by restoring your original Windows NT 4.0 setup.
After the repair has completed, simply follow the Installation
Instructions (section 2.0) to reinstall the Service Pack. For more
information on using the Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk utility,
go to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at http://www.microsoft.com/kb/ 
and search for the following article: Q146887.

Note: To use the Emergency Repair Disk utility, you must have the
updated version of Setupdd.sys. The updated version is contained in
Service Pack 3. To update your version of Setupdd.sys, copy Setupdd.sys
from the Service Pack to your setup boot disk #2. This will
replace the older version of Setupdd.sys with the updated version.
For more information, go to the Microsoft Knowledge Base at
http://www.microsoft.com/kb/ and search for the following article:
Q158423.

3.2 Adding New Components to the System
---------------------------------------
If you change or add new software or hardware components to your
system after you have installed the Service Pack, you need to install
the Service Pack again. This is because the files taken from the
original Windows NT 4.0 disk set may not be the same as the files on
the Service Pack disk set. You cannot install new components directly
from the Service Pack media (such as a new keyboard or printer
driver). You must install new components from the original product
media and then reinstall the Service Pack.

For example, if you install the SNMP service after installing Service
Pack 3, you will need to reinstall the Service Pack. If you fail to do
so, you will receive the error "Entrypoint SnmpSvcGetEnterpriseOID
could not be located in snmpapi.dll." This is because some of the
files in the SNMP service have been updated in the Service Pack and
you have a version mismatch. Reinstalling the Service Pack fixes the
problem by copying the newer versions of the files to your system.

Note: If you are reinstalling the Service Pack after
installing new software or hardware, you must choose to create a
new uninstall directory. To indicate this, click "Yes,
I want to create an Uninstall directory" when you are prompted.

3.3 Installing Symbol Files from the Compact Disc
-------------------------------------------------
Each program file in Windows NT has a corresponding symbol file that
is used to find the cause of kernel STOP errors. To install the
symbol files corresponding to the new binaries in Service Pack 3, do
the following (assuming your CD-ROM drive is D:, your symbol files
are located in the C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS directory, and you are installing
the files for an x86 machine):

XCOPY /S /U /D D:\SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386\SYMBOLS
C:\WINNT\SYMBOLS

This will copy the Service Pack 3 .dbg files over the existing
versions of these files. The XCOPY command shown will copy only those
.dbg files that are already installed (/U switch), and only those
with a more recent time-date stamp (/D switch).

For more information about debugging on Windows NT, see Chapter 39,
"Windows NT Debugger," in the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
Resource Kit.

3.4 Remote Access Service PPP CHAP MD5 Authenticator Support
------------------------------------------------------------
Service Pack 3 provides limited PPP MD5-CHAP authenticator support to
the Remote Access Server, which may be useful for small user-count
environments using non-Microsoft PPP dial-in clients. The support is
local to a given RAS server. The MD5 account information is stored in
the RAS server registry and is not integrated or synchronized with
the User Manager account database. Integrated support will appear in
a later release, at which time this limited support may be removed.

The local MD5-CHAP authenticator is enabled by creating the MD5 key
below and adding "account" subkeys of the form [&lt;domain&gt;:]&lt;user&gt;,
with subvalue "Pw" containing the account password. The ":" notation
is used instead of "\" due to the syntax rules of registry keys. The
'domain:' is optional and typically omitted. MD5-CHAP will not be
negotiated (old behavior) when the MD5 key does not exist (default).

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\CHAP\MD5
[&lt;domain&gt;:]&lt;user&gt;(REG_SZ)Pw

3.5  Microsoft DHCP Server
--------------------------
This version of the Microsoft DHCP Server modifies the format of the
DHCP database. You should back up the contents of your
%windir%\system32\dhcp directory prior to upgrading.

The address conflict detection feature can limit the throughput of
Microsoft DHCP Server. For improved performance, reduce the number of
ping retries in the Server Properties dialog box. This feature is
disabled by default.

Address conflicts are indicated by the replacement of the machine
name with "BAD_ADDRESS."  If a Unique Identifier is specified for
the address in the Client Properties dialog box, then the address was
declined by the client. If the Unique Identifier is not specified,
then the address conflict was detected by the DHCP Server.

Microsoft DHCP Server can be configured to set a client's default
gateway equal to its IP address. This causes the client to use the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for all IP addresses on the local
subnet and is useful for routerless networks. To enable this feature
for all clients in a scope, add the following value to the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DHCPServer
\Subnets\a.b.c.d\SwitchedNetworkFlag=1 (REG_DWORD)

This version of Microsoft DHCP Server supports BOOTP clients. BOOTP
addresses currently must be reserved in advance by creating an IP
address reservation. Future versions of Microsoft DHCP Server will
be capable of leasing dynamic addresses to BOOTP clients.

BOOTP clients that do not specify the parameter request list option
( 55 ) can still retrieve the following options from this release of
Microsoft DHCP Server:

1 Subnet Mask
3 Router
5 Name Server
12 Host Name
15 Domain Name
44 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server
45 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Datagram Distribution Server
46 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node Type
47 NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope
48 X Window System Font Server
49 X Window System Display Manager
69 SMTP Server
70 POP3 Server
9 LPR Server
17 Root Path
42 NTP Servers
4 Time Server

In order to obtain other options, the client must specify option 55
in the BOOTP request. DHCP Server will return the options in the
order listed above. DHCP Server will return as many options as will
fit in response packet.

The activity log feature creates a text log file of all DHCP Server
activity. The file is located at:

%windir%\system32\dhcp\dhcpsrv.log

When the activity log feature is enabled this file will be kept open
by DHCP Server while the Server is running. To delete the activity
log file you must first stop DHCP Server, using the command:

NET STOP DHCPSERVER

If available disk space becomes low, the activity log will pause
until sufficient disk space becomes available.

You must also stop and restart the DHCP Service after enabling or
disabling Logging, Superscope, or DHCP Decline support.

3.6 Unencrypted Passwords No Longer Sent by Default
---------------------------------------------------
Connecting to SMB servers (such as Samba and LAN Manager for UNIX)
with an unencrypted (plain text) password fails after upgrading to
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. This is because the SMB redirector
in Service Pack 3 handles unencrypted passwords differently than
previous versions of Windows NT. Beginning with Service Pack 3, the
SMB redirector will not send an unencrypted password unless you add
a registry entry to enable unencrypted passwords. For information
on how to modify the registry, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base
at http://www.microsoft.com/kb/ for the following article: Q166730.
This article also contains information on how to change the
Service Pack setup process so that unencrypted passwords are
enabled after the Service Pack is installed.

3.7 Hardware Compatibility with Windows NT 4.0
----------------------------------------------
For a current list of computers and other hardware peripherals
supported by Windows NT 4.0, please see the Windows NT Hardware
Compatibility List at http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest.

4.0  LIST OF BUGS FIXED IN WINDOWS NT 4.0 SERVICE PACK 3
