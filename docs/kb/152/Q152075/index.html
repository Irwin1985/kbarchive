-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the ActiveX control container support built into MFC, controls should
only be created and used in the primary thread. The primary thread is the thread
created automatically for you during startup of the MFC program. Starting other
threads and trying to use MFC's built-in control container support will cause
unpredictable and erratic behavior of the primary thread and any other threads
that attempt to display ActiveX controls. This problem will occur whether you
use a UI thread or a worker thread.

CAUSE
=====

This situation appears to occur because the afxOccManager is stored as a process
local variable.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no reliable workaround for this issue at this time. If your program
uses ActiveX controls, make sure they are displayed in the primary thread only.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 32- bit Edition
version 4.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation can be reproduced by creating an Appwizard generated app that
supports ActiveX control containment. Create a dialog in the first thread that
displays an ActiveX control. Add a class to your project derived from CWinThread
that will create a secondary thread. Also, add another dialog to the project
that contains an ActiveX control that will be created as a modeless dialog by
the secondary thread when the secondary thread starts up. This can be done in
the CWinThread's InitInstance method. Build the app. When the app is run, if you
show the dialog that contains the ActiveX control in the first thread, the
second thread will no longer be able to create ActiveX controls. Conversely, if
the second thread shows its dialog first, the primary thread will not be able to
create ActiveX controls. If you attempt to create ocx controls in more than one
thread, you will also get an access violation in OLE32.dll when the program
terminates.
