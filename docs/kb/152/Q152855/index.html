SUMMARY
=======

The Anonymous Posting service will allow you to have users post anonymous
submissions to a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder (PF). This article describes
the steps necessary to set up the Anonymous Posting service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps are required to set up the Anonymous Posting service:

1. Create a Windows NT service account. Make sure that you grant this account
  the Logon as a Service privilege. In addition, make sure that this account is
  a member of the ADMIN group. If this account does not have administrative
  privileges, you will receive the following error:

  Could not start the Anonymous Posting Service on \\&lt;Computer_Name&gt;.
  Error 1069: The Service did not start due to a Logon Failure.

2. Create a mailbox named Anonymous. Set the Primary Windows NT Account for the
  mailbox to the user account created in step 1. At this point, make sure to
  note the following settings of the Mailbox:

O

  rganization Name
  Home site
  Directory Name (Advanced Tab for the Mailbox)

3. Create the anonymous PF:

  a. Create the PF from a Microsoft Exchange client.

  b. Open the folder properties and select Permissions.

  c. Add the Anonymous mailbox to the permissions list with the Editor Role.

  d. Select to the Administration tab and select the folder assistant.

  e. Add a rule, select FROM, choose the anonymous mailbox, and click OK.

  f. Choose FORWARD TO, select the anonymous mailbox, and choose OK.

  g. In the folder assistant dialog box, click Edit Rule, and then click
     Delete.

  h. Click the advanced button, check the box labeled Only Items That Do not
     Match These Conditions, and Click OK.

  i. Close all remaining open dialog boxes.

4. Copy the Anonymous Posting service files from the Microsoft Exchange Server
  CD to a directory on your hard drive where you want to run the service from.
  These files are located in the following location:

  \Setup\&lt;platform&gt;\sampapps\server\anon

5. Install the files necessary for the Anonymous Posting service. Do this by
  running the Instanon.exe program that you copied in step 4. You will need to
  enter the information that you wrote down when you created the Anonymous
  mailbox. Choose OK to install the service.

6. Make sure that the Anonymous Posting account has the following rights in the
  Microsoft Exchange permissions context:

   - In the site object, the Anonymous Posting account needs at least the
     Administrator role.

   - In the Organization object the Anonymous Posting account also needs at
     least the Administrator role.

7. To test the Anonymous folder, start a Microsoft Exchange client, go to the
  Anonymous public folder, and compose a new post in this forum. Type in a
  message and post the message.

8. If the Anonymous Posting service is not running, you will be able to post a
  message with no errors, but the message will not appear in the PF until the
  service is restarted.

For additional information about the Anonymous Posting service, please refer to
the Anon.wri file in the Setup\&lt;platform&gt;\sampapps\server\anon directory
on the Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 CD. For additional information on sending
mail from one user to another and displaying an anonymous sender name, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

For additional information, also see the Exchange Server 5.0 Readme.wri file on
the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 CD.
