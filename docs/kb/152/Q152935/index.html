-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Exchange Server is participating as a requestor in the
Microsoft Mail directory synchronization (dir-sync), entire Microsoft Mail
postoffice lists may be removed from the Global Address List (GAL).

CAUSE
=====

When a Microsoft Exchange Server is participating as a requestor in the
Microsoft Mail dir-sync, inappropriately adding and removing recipient
containers into and out of the dir-sync stream can generate large numbers of
dir-sync transactions and potentially result in the accidental removal of entire
Microsoft Mail postoffice lists from the Global Address List (GAL).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This article details how to avoid generating these excess dir-sync transactions
in three situations: when exporting Microsoft Exchange users into the dir-sync
stream, with Microsoft Mail, and with a link monitor.

Generally, Exchange Server participates as a requestor to the Microsoft Mail
dir-sync for the purpose of exporting:

- Exchange users into the dir-sync stream.

- Custom recipients (non-Microsoft Mail) into the shared file system (SFS)
  dir-sync stream.

For administrative and organizational purposes, various recipients may be grouped
into specific recipient containers. For instance, all Exchange users within a
site may be grouped into one or more recipient containers. Likewise, custom
recipients can be logically grouped into recipient containers--for instance, all
external SMTP recipient addresses may be grouped into one or more recipient
containers.

These recipient containers are added to, or removed from, the Microsoft Mail
directory synchronization (dir-sync) stream as follows:

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, and expand the Site,
  Configuration, and Connections containers.

2. Double-click the dir-sync-requestor object, click the Export Containers tab,
  and modify the Export these Recipients field.

The act of adding these recipient containers to, or removing them from, the
Microsoft Mail dir-sync stream results in a large number of dir-sync
transactions. Dir-sync messages containing Add, Modify, Delete, or Replace
transactions are sent to the dir-sync server (DSS). These messages contain the
standard dir-sync transactions, but the transactions can combine in ways that
are unexpected.

Exchange Recipient Containers:

By default, new Exchange mailboxes are created in the site's recipients
container. However, an alternate container can specified on the Advanced
property page.

Microsoft Mail Custom Recipients Containers:

When a Microsoft Exchange Server system is functioning as a requestor to SFS
dir-sync, do not allow custom recipients for users on Microsoft Mail postoffices
to be exported from Exchange to the SFS DSS. Only SFS postoffices hosting these
users should be sending updates or modifications about their users to the DSS.

If you create custom recipients for Microsoft Mail postoffice users within
Microsoft Exchange Server, create these recipients in containers that are not
exported (for dir-sync). Additionally, the custom recipients may be hidden or
the trust level raised to 100 to prevent them from exporting.

Exporting these custom recipients and/or removing their container(s) from the
list of exported recipients can result in Replace transactions for the SFS
users' postoffices added to the list of pending dir-sync transactions. This can
result in unnecessary dir-sync processing and in the temporary loss of PCMail
address information from Global Address Lists (GALS). Subsequent recovery can
require large numbers of dir-sync transactions.

Exchange Link Monitor:

When configuring a link monitor to a Microsoft Mail postoffice, the administrator
must configure a bogus custom recipient so that the postoffice will be
monitored. The link monitor then sends messages to this bogus custom recipient.
When the Microsoft Mail message transfer agent (MTA) determines that the user
does not exist, a non-delivery report (NDR) is sent back to the link monitor.
Reception of the NDR by the link monitor confirms that the link is up and
working properly. If no NDR is received within the configured time frame, the
link monitor signals that the link is down.

Adding or removing this custom recipient to or from the dir-sync stream can
result in a Replace for this user's postoffice being added to the list of
pending dir-sync transactions. During the next T2 cycle, the DSS will process
this transaction, effectively instructing all other postoffices participating in
dir-sync to remove this postoffice's entire list from their GALs. This can be
resolved by doing a full export from the postoffice that is not currently in the
GAL and completing the manual dir-sync process. After performing a full export
from the missing postoffice(s), the normal dir-sync cycle should restore the
missing addresses.

To avoid this problem, create link monitor recipients in their own container and
do not export them into the dir-sync process. Another suggestion is to set the
trust level of the custom recipient container to 100 to prevent the recipients
from exporting to Microsoft Mail. For more information on link monitors, review
Chapter 16 of the Exchange Administrator's Guide. For more information on
directory synchronization with other systems (such as Microsoft Mail), review
Chapter 14 of the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide.
