MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. Why does Internet Mail open instead of Exchange when I try to open
  e-mail?

  A. If you're having problems using mail, your system may be set to use a mail
  service that isn't compatible with MSN, such as Internet Mail. You can reset
  your system to use an MSN compatible mail service (Windows
  Messaging/Exchange) as your default mail service. To select Windows
  Messaging/Exchange as your mail service, follow these steps:
  1. Open the Internet Explorer browser.

  2. On the View menu, click Options.

  3. Select the Programs tab.

  4. In the Mail dialog box, select Windows Messaging.

  5. Click OK.

2. Q. What is my e-mail server?

  A. Currently, we do not have SMTP (POP3 mail) on MSN. You can only retrieve
  mail using Microsoft Exchange.

3. Q. Why doesn't MSN have a PPP client for e-mail?

  A. Our plans are to transition to POP3/SMTP client later this year; this is
  one of our top priorities.

4. Q. How do I receive mail?

  A. To receive a message via MSN, follow these steps:
  1. While connected to MSN, double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop.

  2. On the Tools menu, click Deliver Now or Deliver Now Using.

  3. If you clicked Deliver Now Using, click The Microsoft Network.

  Any new mail that you have received appears in the Inbox.

5. Q. Can I use a mail program other than Microsoft Exchange to receive MSN
  mail?

  A. Currently, you can retrieve mail only by using Microsoft Exchange or
  Microsoft Outlook. We expect to have an e-mail system based on SMTP/POP3
  protocols (which are very common on the Internet) in 1997.

6. Q. When I click the Inbox I'm asked for post office, mailbox, and password.
  What are these?

  A. To use e-mail, you must have a mail profile. The error message you get when
  you try to open e-mail indicates that you do not have a profile yet.

7. Q. What is a profile?

  A. A profile contains configuration information, such as the location of
  incoming messages and the information services that are available to you. An
  information service controls how your messaging programs address, send,
  receive, and store messages and files. Another type of information service is
  a personal information store, which is similar to a database where you can
  organize and save folders, messages, and files.

  A profile for The Microsoft Network must contain your personal address book,
  personal information store, and The Microsoft Network online service.

8. Q. How do I set up a profile?

  A. To set up a mail profile for MSN, follow these steps:
  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click Mail And Fax.

  3. Click Show Profiles.

  4. Click the Add button to add a mail profile.

  5. Click The Microsoft Network Online Service as your information service,
     and then click Next.

  6. Type a name to use for the profile, and then click Next.

  7. Follow the instructions on the screen, until you click Finish.

  8. Make sure the new profile is shown in the "When Starting Microsoft
     Exchange, use this profile:" box.

  9. Click Close.

9. Q. Can I use Microsoft Exchange to automatically sign on to MSN, download
  mail, and sign off?

  A. You can use Microsoft Exchange to automatically sign on to MSN, download
  mail, and sign off. To do so, use the following steps:
  1. Double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop to start Microsoft Exchange.

  2. On the Tools menu, click Deliver Now or Deliver Now Using.

  3. If you clicked Deliver Now Using, click The Microsoft Network.

  4. When the MSN Sign In screen appears, click Connect.

  After your new e-mail messages are downloaded, you are automatically signed
  off from MSN.

10. Q. What is my e-mail address?

  A. Your MSN e-mail address is your Member ID. When you give your e-mail
  address to people not using MSN, it will be your MemberID@msn.com.

  For example, if your name is John Smith and you sign-up for MSN, you could
  pick a Member ID like JSMITH. If you do, here is your complete e-mail
  address: JSMITH@msn.com (it is not case sensitive).
