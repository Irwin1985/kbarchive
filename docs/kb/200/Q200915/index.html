IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a Word file by double-clicking it in Windows Explorer or by using
a desktop shortcut, you may receive the following error message:

  Do you want to revert to the saved version of &lt;file name&gt;.doc?

The error message does not appear if you open the file in Word by using the Open
command on the File menu or the Open button on the Standard toolbar.


CAUSE
=====

The Windows registry information for the Microsoft Word Document registered file
type is incorrect.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Re-register the Word Program by Running Setup /Y /R
-------------------------------------------------------------

To run Setup with the /y /r switch, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Word or Office CD into the CD-ROM drive. If you installed Word or
  Office from disks, insert the Setup Disk 1 in your computer's disk drive.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\setup /y /r" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the drive that contains the CD or Setup
  Disk 1.

4. Click OK.

5. Click Reinstall.

This re-registers Word (and all Office programs, if you run Office Setup).

Base:

Method 2: Install the Latest Update
-----------------------------------

Although the latest Word 97 (Office 97) update does not contain a fix for this
problem, the Setup program will correct the problem with the registered file
types. For additional information about the latest update for Word 97, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q265374 WD97: Post Service Release Fixes for Word 97

Method 3: Use the /Unregserver and /Regserver Startup Switches
--------------------------------------------------------------

To correct this problem, unregister the Microsoft Word Document file type and
then re-register it.

Unregister the Microsoft Word Document:

To unregister the Microsoft Word Document file type, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Run dialog box, click Browse.

3. In the Browse dialog box, locate and select the Winword.exe file, and then
  click Open.

  NOTE: By default, the Winword.exe file is located in the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office

4. In the Run dialog box, the Open box should now contain the path to the
  Winword.exe file. Click in the Open box, and move the insertion point to the
  end of the path statement. After the closing quotation mark, type a space,
  type "/unregserver" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  The path statement in the Open box should now look similar to the following:

  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Winword.exe" /unregserver

  The Microsoft Word Document registered file type will be removed from the
  Microsoft Windows Registry and the "Registered file types" list (in Windows
  Explorer, click Folder Options on the Tools menu, and then click the File
  Types tab). No message is displayed during or at the end of this process.

Re-register the Microsoft Word Document:

To re-register the Microsoft Word Document file type, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Run dialog box, click Browse.

3. In the Browse dialog box, locate and select the Winword.exe file, and then
  click Open.

  NOTE: By default, the Winword.exe file is located in the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office

4. In the Run dialog box, the Open box should now contain the path to the
  Winword.exe file. Click in the Open box, and move the insertion point to the
  end of the path statement. After the closing quotation mark, type a space,
  type "/regserver" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  The path statement in the Open box should now look similar to the following:

  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Winword.exe" /regserver

  The Microsoft Word Document registered file type will be added back to the
  Microsoft Windows Registry and the Registered file types list (in Windows
  Explorer, click Folder Options on the Tools menu, and then click the File
  Types tab). No message is displayed during or at the end of this process.

  you should change the string to look like this:

  "D:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT OFFICE\OFFICE\Winword.exe" /n

  To change the (Default) data string, follow these steps:

  a. Click to select (Default).

  b. On the Edit menu, click Modify.
