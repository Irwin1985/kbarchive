SUMMARY
=======

It is not possible to limit Exchange Server administrative permissions for
mailbox management on a per-server basis.

Administrative permissions flow down the Exchange Server directory tree, and
servers and users, despite appearances, are located in different sections of the
directory tree.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Exchange Server system uniquely identifies every object, which includes every
user, in the Exchange Server directory with a Distinguished Name (DN). The DN is
in the following format:

  /o=organization name/ou=&lt;site name&gt;/cn=&lt;recipients
  container&gt;/cn=&lt;object directory name&gt;

The DN identifies a unique path in the Exchange Server directory tree to locate a
user. Administrative permissions also flow down the structure of the DN, which
reflects the structure of the directory tree.

Notice that a user's DN includes the user's organization, site, and Recipients
containers, but not the user's home server.

The home server is merely an attribute of a user, in the way that a user's
department or phone number is an attribute of that user. You can no more assign
administrative access based on different home servers than you can based on
different phone numbers.

It is very easy to move users from one server to another server in a site because
the home server is treated as an attribute of the user.

NOTE: The Server Recipients object that is displayed in the Exchange Server
Administrator program under each server is not an actual container, but a
"virtual container" that is displayed for administrative convenience. Because it
is not an actual directory object, it has no directory properties or associated
permissions.

To approximate management of users on a server-by-server basis, use one of the
following two methods, but be aware that both methods greatly limit your
flexibility if you need to move users:

- Create custom recipients containers for each server in the site, and create
  all of the users on a given server in the appropriate container. Grant each
  administrator View Only Administrator permissions for the Site object and
  Administrator permissions only for the appropriate Recipients container.

  This method restricts your freedom to move users between servers and
  containers without breaking the container-based administrative model. You can
  still move a mailbox to another server, but if you do, you disconnect the
  mailbox from the appropriate administrative permissions, unless you change
  the container at the same time.

  To move a user to a different container, you must actually delete and
  re-create the user. You can preserve user data in a personal folder file
  (.pst) during this process, but replies from the user to outstanding messages
  from other Exchange Server users are non-deliverable, because the user's DN
  changes. Replies to messages from foreign mail systems remain deliverable in
  most cases, because foreign e-mail proxy addresses need not change.

-or-

- Isolate each server or administrative group in its own site. In most cases,
  this results in an organization that is composed of many sites that each
  contain a single server.

  The Exchange Server administrative model defines the fundamental unit of
  administration as the site, not the server. This method of managing users on
  a server-by-server basis conforms with the design and intent of Exchange
  Server administration, and this makes it more secure and simpler to implement
  than the first method. It is also less likely that security will be
  inadvertently breached because permissions were mistakenly granted. The
  following are the major drawbacks of this method:

   - You cannot move users unless you delete and re-create accounts. The
     current version of Exchange Server (Exchange Server 5.5) does not support
     the movement of users between sites, because when users move between sites
     the user's Distinguished Name must be changed.

   - You must manually configure messaging connectivity and directory
     replication between each site. In a site, these functions are automatic.
