SYMPTOMS
========

When you use either the Format or DatePart function to determine the week number
for dates using the following syntax:

  Format(AnyDate, "ww", vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays)

  DatePart("ww", AnyDate, vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays)

the last Monday in some calendar years is returned as week 53 when it should be
week 1.

CAUSE
=====

When determining the week number of a date according to the ISO 8601 standard,
the underlying function call to the Oleaut32.dll file mistakenly returns week 53
instead of week 1 for the last Monday in certain years.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a user-defined function to return the Week number based on the rules for the
ISO 8601 standard. An example is included in this article.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Oleaut32.dll file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ISO 8601 standard is used extensively in Europe and includes the following:

 ISO 8601 "Data elements and interchange formats - Information interchange   - Representation of dates and times"
 ISO 8601 : 1988 (E) paragraph 3.17:
 "week, calendar: A seven day period within a calendar year, starting
 on a Monday and identified by its ordinal number within the year;
 the first calendar week of the year is the one that includes the
 first Thursday of that year. In the Gregorian calendar, this is
 equivalent to the week which includes 4 January."

This can be implemented by applying these rules for Calendar weeks:

- A year is divided into either 52 or 53 calendar weeks.
- A calendar week has 7 days. Monday is day 1, Sunday is day 7.
- The first calendar week of a year is the one containing at least 4 days.
- If a year is not concluded on a Sunday, either its 1-3 last days belong to
  next year's first calendar week or the first 1-3 days of next year belong to
  the present year's last calendar week.
- Only a year starting or concluding on a Thursday has 53 calendar weeks.

In Visual Basic and Visual Basic for Applications, all date functionality, except
for the DateSerial function, comes from calls to the Oleaut32.dll file. Because
both the Format() and DatePart() functions can return the calendar week number
for a given date, both are affected by this bug. To avoid this problem, you must
use the alternative code that this article provides.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two CommandButtons to Form1.

3. Paste the following code into the code window of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
  ' This code tests a "problem" date and the days around it
  Dim DateValue As Date
  Dim i As Integer

  Debug.Print "   Format function:"
  DateValue = #12/27/2003#
  For i = 1 To 4   ' examine the last 4 days of the year
      DateValue = DateAdd("d", 1, DateValue)
      Debug.Print "Date: " &amp; DateValue &amp; "   Day: " &amp; _
        Format(DateValue, "ddd") &amp; "   Week: " &amp; _
        Format(DateValue, "ww", vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays)
  Next i
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
  ' This code lists all "Problem" dates within a specified range
    Dim MyDate As Date
    Dim Years As Long
    Dim days As Long
    Dim woy1 As Long
    Dim woy2 As Long
    Dim ToPrint As String

    For Years = 1850 To 2050
      For days = 0 To 3
        MyDate = DateSerial(Years, 12, 28 + days)
        woy1 = Format(MyDate, "ww", vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays)
        woy2 = Format(MyDate, "ww", vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays)
        If woy2 &gt; 52 Then
          If Format(MyDate + 7, "ww", vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays) = 2 Then _
            woy2 = 1
        End If
        If woy1 &lt;&gt; woy2 Then
          ToPrint = MyDate &amp; String(13 - Len(CStr(MyDate)), " ")
          ToPrint = ToPrint &amp; Format(MyDate, "dddd") &amp; _
            String(10 - Len(Format(MyDate, "dddd")), " ")
          ToPrint = ToPrint &amp; woy1 &amp; String(5 - Len(CStr(woy1)), " ")
          ToPrint = ToPrint &amp; woy2
          Debug.Print ToPrint
        End If
      Next days
    Next Years
  End Sub

4. Hold down the CTRL key and press the G key to open the Immediate window.

5. Run the project, click on Command1, and note the following results in the
  Immediate window:

  Format function:
  Date: 12/28/03   Day: Sun   Week: 52
  Date: 12/29/03   Day: Mon   Week: 53
  Date: 12/30/03   Day: Tue   Week: 1
  Date: 12/31/03   Day: Wed   Week: 1

  Note that with this format, all weeks start with Monday, so that 12/29/2003
  should be considered the start of Week 1 and not part of Week 53.

6. Click on Command2 to see a list of dates in the specified range that
  experience this problem. The list includes the date, Week day (always
  Monday), the Week # returned by Format (53), and the Week number it should
  return (1.) For example:

12/29/1851   Monday    53   1
12/31/1855   Monday    53   1
12/30/1867   Monday    53   1
12/29/1879   Monday    53   1
12/31/1883   Monday    53   1
12/30/1895   Monday    53   1
...

Workarounds
-----------

If you use the Format or DatePart functions, you need to check the return value
and, when it is 53, run another check and force a return of 1, if necessary.
This code sample demonstrates one way to do this:

  Function WOY (MyDate As Date) As Integer   ' Week Of Year
    WOY = Format(MyDate, "ww", vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays)
    If WOY &gt; 52 Then
      If Format(MyDate + 7, "ww", vbMonday, vbFirstFourDays) = 2 Then WOY = 1
    End If
  End Function

You can avoid using these functions to determine Week number by writing code that
implements the ISO 8601 rules described above. The following example
demonstrates a replacement function to return the Week number.

Step by Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, add a new Module, and then paste in the following
  code:

  Option Explicit

  Function WeekNumber(InDate As Date) As Integer
    Dim DayNo As Integer
    Dim StartDays As Integer
    Dim StopDays As Integer
    Dim StartDay As Integer
    Dim StopDay As Integer
    Dim VNumber As Integer
    Dim ThurFlag As Boolean

    DayNo = Days(InDate)
    StartDay = Weekday(DateSerial(Year(InDate), 1, 1)) - 1
    StopDay = Weekday(DateSerial(Year(InDate), 12, 31)) - 1
    ' Number of days belonging to first calendar week
    StartDays = 7 - (StartDay - 1)
    ' Number of days belonging to last calendar week
    StopDays = 7 - (StopDay - 1)
    ' Test to see if the year will have 53 weeks or not
    If StartDay = 4 Or StopDay = 4 Then ThurFlag = True Else ThurFlag = False
    VNumber = (DayNo - StartDays - 4) / 7
    ' If first week has 4 or more days, it will be calendar week 1
    ' If first week has less than 4 days, it will belong to last year's
    ' last calendar week
    If StartDays &gt;= 4 Then 
       WeekNumber = Fix(VNumber) + 2 
    Else 
       WeekNumber = Fix(VNumber) + 1
    End If
    ' Handle years whose last days will belong to coming year's first 
    ' calendar week
    If WeekNumber &gt; 52 And ThurFlag = False Then WeekNumber = 1
    ' Handle years whose first days will belong to the last year's 
    ' last calendar week
    If WeekNumber = 0 Then
       WeekNumber = WeekNumber(DateSerial(Year(InDate) - 1, 12, 31))
    End If
  End Function

  Function Days(DayNo As Date) As Integer
    Days = DayNo - DateSerial(Year(DayNo), 1, 0)
  End Function

3. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into the code window of Form1:

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     Dim DateValue As Date, i As Integer
     
     Debug.Print "   WeekNumber function:"
     DateValue = #12/27/2003#
     For i = 1 To 4   ' examine the last 4 days of the year
         DateValue = DateAdd("d", 1, DateValue)
         Debug.Print "Date: " &amp; DateValue &amp; "   Day: " &amp; _
            Format(DateValue, "ddd") &amp; "   Week: " &amp; WeekNumber(DateValue)
     Next i
  End Sub

5. Hold down the CTRL key and press the G key to open the Immediate window.

6. Run the project and click on Command1 to see the following results in the
  Immediate window:

  WeekNumber function:
Date: 12/28/03   Day: Sun   Week: 52
Date: 12/29/03   Day: Mon   Week: 1
Date: 12/30/03   Day: Tue   Week: 1
Date: 12/31/03   Day: Wed   Week: 1

Note that Monday is considered to be Week 1 as it should be.
