-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4, an updated version
of the Smsls.bat file is placed in the Netlogon share. This new version of the
Systems Management Server logon script makes a call to Check20.exe, and may
cause a client computer running Windows NT not to report inventory.

CAUSE
=====

CHECK20 /i returns an errorlevel 1 if %windir% is not on the client's path. In
this case, the logon script assumes that the client is a Systems Management
Server 2.0 client, so the logon script and does NOT continue to the RUN_NT_2
section to perform a normal Systems Management Server 1.2 client inventory.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date     Time    Size     File name   Platform
  ----------------------------------------------

  10/06/98 03:50   44,252   Check20.exe (x86)

NOTE: You should apply this hotfix to the Systems Management Server 1.2 site
server.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Correct the path of the Windows NT client computer to contain the path of the
  Windows NT system files, as in the following example:

     path=c:\winnt\system32;C:\WINNT

  -or-

- NOTE: The following workaround may cause problems with Systems Management
  Server 2.0 clients.

  On the Systems Management Server 1.2 site server, modify the following script
  files:

   - x:\Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Smsls.bat

   - x:\Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\Runsms.bat

  Verify that these files are the Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4
  versions by ensuring that the RUN_NT_2 section exists. If they are not the
  Service Pack 4 versions, replace them with the Service Pack 4 versions from
  the Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4 CD. Then modify the
  following line:

     if "%OS%" == "Windows_NT" goto RUN_NT

  To:

     if "%OS%" == "Windows_NT" goto RUN_NT_2

  Confirm that the files are properly replicated to the logon servers and
  Netlogon shares.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Upon applying Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4 to a functioning
Systems Management Server 1.2 site and fully updating all logon servers and
Netlogon shares with the modified Smsls.bat and Runsms.bat files, some Windows
NT clients may stop reporting inventory if the client's Windows NT installation
directory is not in the PATH environment variable.

This change in the Systems Management Server logon scripts was made to keep
Systems Management Server 1.2 from overwriting client files installed by a
Systems Management Server 2.0 site.

Description Details
-------------------

When Windows NT clients run Smsls.bat from a Netlogon share or Runsms.bat from a
SMS_SHR share, there is a section called RUN_NT that calls %0\..\check20 /i.
Normally, this checks for a Smscfg.ini file on the client in the %WINDIR%
directory. If this file exists, the following section is scanned:

  [SMS MultiBoot Configuration]
  Number of Opal Installations = 0

At this point, if the "Number of Opal Installations" value is 0, an errorlevel 2
is returned. The script continues and performs a Systems Management Server 1.2
inventory. If the "Number of Opal Installations" value is greater than 0, it is
assumed that this is a Systems Management Server 2.0 client, and the client
setup and inventory portions of the logon script are skipped.

If the Smscfg.ini file does not exist, Check20.exe will create it in the %windir%
directory. This operation may fail if the value of %windir% is not in the PATH
variable. This then causes the check for errorlevel2 to fail and not go on to
the RUN_NT_2 section of the script. Neither Cli_nt.exe nor Invwin32.exe are
executed to perform client setup and collect inventory.

Possible errorlevels returned by CHECK20
----------------------------------------

The following are Possible errorlevels returned by Check20.exe:

  iCHECKED_ASSIGNED     =  0;
  iNOT_CHECKED_UNKNOWN  =  1;
  iCHECKED_NOT_ASSIGNED =  2;
  iUNSUPPORTED_OS       =  3;

0 = This client is assigned to one or more SMS 2.0 sites.

1 = Systems Management Server 2.0 has not yet reached this resource with an
installation method to determine if it should be assigned to one or more Systems
Management Server 2.0 sites.

2 = Systems Management Server 2.0 has already evaluated this resource at least
once and determined this resource was NOT assigned to any Systems Management
Server 2.0 site participating in that installation method (that is, using that
domain for logon installation) at the time of the determination.

3 = Unresolved Error occurred

The Systems Management Server 1.2 "Opal Interop" script (which assumes that the
Systems Management Server 2.0 script is also running during this logon) will
skip processing the Systems Management Server 1.2 script if Check20.exe returns
a 0 or a 1, giving the Systems Management Server 2.0 script a chance to set the
value to 0 or 2.

The Systems Management Server 1.2 "Opal Aware" script (which assumes that the
Systems Management Server 2.0 script is not also running during the logon,
although Systems Management Server 2.0 clients may be encountered in the
enterprise) will skip processing the Systems Management Server 1.2 script only
if Check20.exe returns a value of 0.
