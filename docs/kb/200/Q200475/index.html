The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the FTP utility to connect to an FTP site, the following error
occurs:

  530 User &lt;username&gt; cannot log in.
  Login failed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by one of the following:

- The "Allow only anonymous connections security" setting has been turned on in
  the MMC.

- The username does not have the "Log on locally" permission in User Manager.

- The username does not have the "Access this computer from the network"
  permission in User Manager.

- The Domain Name was not specified along with the username (in the form of
  "DOMAIN\USERNAME" (without the quotation marks)).

RESOLUTION
==========

Resolution 1
------------

To clear the "Allow only anonymous connections security" check box, perform the
following steps:

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
  Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Right-click the default FTP site folder, and then click Properties.

3. On the Security Accounts tab, clear the "Allow only anonymous connections
  security" check box.

4. Click OK.

Resolution 2
------------

To give the username the "Log On Locally" permission, perform the following
steps:

Windows NT 4.0 Servers

1. In the Administrative Tools group, select "User Manager for Domains", click
  the Policies tab, and select User Rights.

  NOTE: If the username is not a member of the default domain opened by User
  Manager, click the User menu, and then select Domain to specify the correct
  domain. If the username is a member of the local computer's user list, type
  "\\&lt;computer_name&gt;" (without the quotation marks) in the Domain text
  box.

2. From the Policies menu, click User Rights.

3. On the Rights drop-down list, select Log on Locally.

4. Click Add, and add the appropriate username (or user group).

5. Click OK twice.

Windows 2000 Servers To configure the "Log on locally" right on a stand-alone
server, follow these steps:

1. In the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), open the Local Computer Policy
  snap-in. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, type "MMC" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  b. Click Console, click Add/Remove Snap-in, and then click Add.

  c. Select Group Policy, and then click Add.

  d. Ensure that the Group Policy object says Local Computer, and then click
     Finish.

  e. Click Close, and then click OK.

2. Grant users or groups the "Log on locally" right. To do this, follow these
  steps:

  a. Expand the following path in the MMC:

  Local Computer Policy\Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security
  Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment

  b. Double-click Log on Locally.

  c. Add any users or groups that will use Basic/Clear Text authentication.

NOTE: It is not recommended that you install an IIS Web server on a Windows 2000
domain controller. The following steps describe how to configure "Log on
locally" right by using Group Policy if it is necessary that you install an IIS
Web server on a Windows 2000 domain controller.

To configure the "Log on locally" right on a domain controller, follow these
steps:

1. In MMC, open the Default Domain Controllers Policy snap-in. To do this,
  follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, type "MMC" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  b. Click Console, click Add/Remove Snap-in, and then click Add.

  c. Select Group Policy, and then click Add.

  d. Click Browse.

  e. Double-click the domain controller for the domain.

  f. Double-click "Default Domain Controllers Policy", and then click Finish.

  g. Click Close, and then click OK.

2. Grant users or groups the "Log on locally" right. To do this, follow these
  steps:

  a. Expand the following path in the MMC:

  Default Domain Controllers Policy\Computer Configuration\Windows
  Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment

  b. Double-click Log on Locally.

  c. Add any users or groups that will use Basic/Clear Text authentication.

3. Open a command prompt, type "secedit/refreshpolicy machine_policy" (without
  the quotation marks), and then close the command prompt to refresh the
  policy.

Resolution 3
------------

To give the username the "Access this computer from the network" permission,
perform the same steps outlined in Resolution 2 above, but select the "Access
this computer from the network" advanced user right.

Resolution 4
------------

Try using the command line FTP utility and specifying the FTP username in the
form of "DOMAIN\USERNAME" when you log into the FTP Site. If this works, then
you can either instruct all users to log on using DOMAIN\USERNAME or you can
specify the default authentication domain that the FTP Service should use when
authenticating accounts that do not exist locally and that were not entered in
"DOMAIN\USERNAME" form. To do this you will need to make changes to the
Metabase.

To specify a default logon domain so users do not have to type "DOMAIN\USERNAME"
(without the quotation marks) when logging on to the FTP Server, you can either
use the Windows Script Host (if it was installed during the Windows NT Option
Pack setup) or the NTOP utility Mdutil.exe.

Both methods are described below.

To use the Windows Script Host method, do one of the following (depending on the
version of IIS that you are running):

IIS 5.0:

1. Change to the %Systemroot%\Inetpub\Adminscripts directory.

2. Type the following:

  Adsutil Set MSFTPSVC/DefaultLogonDomain "Domain Name"

  Make sure when you type in the Domain Name that it is enclosed in quotation
  marks.

3. Stop and restart the FTP Service.

IIS 4.0:

1. Change to the %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv\adminsamples directory.

2. Type the following:

  cscript //h:cscript

  This sets Cscript as the default WSH interpreter.

3. Type the following:

  Adsutil Set MSFTPSVC/DefaultLogonDomain "Domain Name"

  Make sure when you type in the Domain Name that it is enclosed in quotation
  marks.

4. Stop and restart the FTP Service.

If the Windows Script Host was not installed during the NTOP setup, use
Mdutil.exe. as follows:

1. Copy Mdutil.exe. from the Windows NT Option Pack compact disc to the
  %WINDIR%\System32\ directory.

  Make sure to copy Mdutil.exe. from the appropriate platform directory on the
  compact disc.

2. Open a command prompt, and change to the %WINDIR%\System32 directory.

3. Execute the command below replacing &lt;DomainName&gt; with the name of the
  accounts domain you want to authenticate your user against by default:

  mdutil set msftpsvc/DefaultLogonDomain -utype UT_Server -dtype String -value &lt;DomainName&gt;

  Make sure that &lt;DomainName&gt; is typed without quotes.

4. When the command completes successfully, stop and restart the FTP Service.
