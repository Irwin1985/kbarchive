The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice that mail flow over several X.400 Connectors that are installed
on the same Exchange Server computer is slow or even stops. Event ID 9156 may
also by logged in the application log of an Exchange Server 5.5 computer with
more than two X.400 Connectors installed.

CAUSE
=====

The number of control blocks available for the message transfer agent (MTA) to
transfer mail over multiple X.400 Connectors may be insufficient. This behavior
is particularly noticeable during heavy mail traffic or when a backlog of mail
exists on X.400 Connectors installed on the same Exchange Server 5.5 computers.

WORKAROUND
==========

MTA associations are managed by control blocks. With Exchange Server 5.5, one
control block manages each association to a remote MTA over an X.400 Connector.

The registry setting that affects X.400 Connector traffic over the TCP protocol
stack is set by default to 20 (decimal), and is found in the following registry
key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\TCP/IP
  Control blocks

The control block allocation TP4 protocol stack is found at:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\TP4
  Control blocks

If there are more than two X.400 Connectors on the same Exchange Server 5.5
computer, you should increase this registry value to

  (10 * number of X.400 connectors) + 10

for the appropriate protocol stack. For example, if there are five X.400
Connectors installed on an Exchange Server computer, set this registry string to
a value of 60 (decimal). This setting allows 10 control blocks for each X.400
Connector, which is the maximum number of allowable associations for each X.400
Connector.

If you adjust the Control Block registry parameter as noted above, and the Event
ID 9156 is still logged, then try this second possible resolution.

On each X.400 Connector's property page, on the Override tab, increase the
"Association Parameters, Disconnect (sec)" setting to a value between 300-600
seconds (the default is 120).

When an MTA needs to open an association, an open request is passed down the Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) stack, each layer in the stack maintains a timer.
The problem occurs when an open association to another MTA fails due to a
network problem. The disconnect timer at the session layer expires before the
transport layer has abandoned its attempt to open a transport connection. The
transport layer timers are not configurable, but the session layer disconnect
time can be adjusted (on the Disconnect (sec) value on the Override tab of the
X.400 Connector).

This discrepancy in disconnect time leads to a dropped control block, which is
not recovered by the MTA, and thus a shortage of control blocks. The 9156 errors
that you see in the event log require the MTA to be restarted for mail flow to
be resumed. Increasing this value to 300-600 seconds will allow the session
layer to keep the association open longer, and thus reduce the chance that the
session layer disconnect timer will expire before the network layer closes the
network connection.

If the above procedures have been implemented (registry setting for TCP/IP
control blocks and Disconnect time increased), see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
