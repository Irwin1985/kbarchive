SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article explains the algorithm used by remote access
service (RAS) when you select "use another port if busy" under Dialup
Networking, and how this can cause connectivity problems with multiport serial
adapters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using a multiport serial adapter to provide connectivity for numerous
modems, the modems must be homogeneous if you want "use another port if busy" to
work. The reason for this is that the list of ports is maintained in the order
that TAPI enumerates them to RAS. The order is arbitrary, and Unimodem is not
capable of assigning a particular order. TAPI is a neutral layer between the TSP
(Unimodem) and the application (RAS), and enforces no rules about ordering on
either side.

Applications should, therefore, not make assumptions that there is an order to
the selection of COM ports. RAS merely assumes that the TAPI list is the list it
should use when failing over. If the list is out of order, the COM ports will be
tried out of order. Note that adding and removing devices will have the same
affect on device order.

For example, you have a multiport serial adapter with 24 ports. COM 1 through 12
have analog modems installed. COM 13 through 24 have ISDN modems installed.

You will find that rollover to available ports will result in random instability
and dropped connections when analog strings are sent to ISDN modems, and vice
versa. This is also true for other types of modems that cannot communicate with
each other for one reason or another. Currently, there is no way to configure
which ports should be used for failover for particular devices. Because of this,
applications must assume responsibility for choosing which ports they will dial
when one is determined to be busy.

The current workaround to this problem involves disabling the RAS/RRAS servers
attempt to use another port.

For RAS
-------

To disable the automatic dialing of another port if the current port is busy, go
to the Basic tab of the phonebook entry and click to clear "Use another port if
busy". This will prevent the RAS server from attempting to use another port if
the device it is configured to use is busy.

For RRAS
--------

To disable the automatic dialing of another port if the current port is busy on a
RRAS router, you need to edit %Windir%\System32\Router.pbk:

 MEDIA=rastapi
 Port=nameofinterface
 OtherPortOk=1
 Device=rasinterface

Router.pbk is arranged as an .ini file with the name of demand dial interfaces as
sections. Go to the section corresponding to the demand dial interface for which
you want to change this behavior. Change the OtherPortOk field in this section
to 0, instead of 1.
