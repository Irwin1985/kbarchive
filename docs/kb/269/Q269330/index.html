SUMMARY
=======

This article describes various steps you can take to troubleshoot some of the
most common errors you encounter when you try to instantiate a remote server
object by using Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). In Visual Basic, the
most common error messages are:

  Run-time error 70: Permission Denied.

  Run-time error 429: ActiveX component can't create object.

  Run-time error 462: The remote server computer does not exist or is
  unavailable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Where to Start Troubleshooting
------------------------------

Most of the problems that occur when you try to instantiate a COM object on a
remote computer by using DCOM are related to incorrect settings in Dcomcnfg or a
networking problem. Very seldom is the problem related to the code.

The first thing to do is to write down the information related to your
environment and the application itself, such as:

1. About the server computer:

  The server computer is the computer where the server application is going to
  run. Collect the following data:

   - Operating system and installed service pack.

   - Is somebody logged on to the computer?

   - If somebody is logged on, what are their rights? Are they part of the
     Administrators group? Are they logged on as a Domain User?

2. About the client computer:

  The client computer is the computer where the client application is going to
  run. Collect the following data:

   - Operating system and installed service pack.

   - Who is logged on to this computer? Did they logged on as a Domain User or
     as a Local User? If they logged on as a Domain User what are their rights
     on the server computer? Are they part of the Administrators group on the
     server computer?

3. About the server application:

   - With which language, version, and service pack was the server developed?

   - Does it call back to the client?

   - Does it raise events?

   - Does it have a user interface?

   - Is it marked as Unattended Execution?

   - Is it setting security parameters programmatically through the call of
     functions such as CoInitializeSecurity or CoSetProxyBlanket?

4. About the client application:

   - With which language, version, and service pack was the application
     developed?

   - Is it setting security parameters programmatically through the call of
     functions such as CoInitializeSecurity or CoSetProxyBlanket?

5. About the network:

   - Are the client and the server computers on the same Local Area Network
     (LAN)?

   - Are the client and the server computers connected through the Internet,
     without firewalls and proxies between them?

   - Are the client and the server computers connected through the Internet,
     with firewalls and proxies between them?

Basic Troubleshooting
---------------------

1. Check that all of the settings in Dcomcnfg are appropriate, based on the data
  you collected earlier.

  Q268550 HOWTO: Use Dcomcnfg for a Visual Basic DCOM Client/Server Application

2. If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 on the client or server computer,
  ensure that you have installed DCOM95 on it. You can download DCOM95 from the
  following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom95/download.asp

3. If you are using Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition
  (Me) on the server computer, you need to have the server component running
  before you try to use the client. As a check, verify that the server is
  running and that it is waiting for the client to connect.

  Q165101 HOWTO: Use Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me as a DCOM Server

4. If your client and server computers are connected through the Internet with
  firewalls and proxies between them, DCOM does not work if there is any type
  of Address Translation (NAT) in between them. If there is no address
  translation, you need to configure these proxies and firewalls to enable DCOM
  to communicate. You can find several white papers related to this subject on
  the Microsoft Developers Network (MSDN) or at the following Microsoft Web
  site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/dcom.asp

  This subject is not covered in this article.

Additional Troubleshooting
--------------------------

If you still have problems after setting Dcomcnfg to the right settings based on
your environment and application features, here are several additional steps you
can take to solve your problem:

1. Use Task Manager to verify that the server is not running while you make
  changes in the settings using Dcomcnfg. All settings are assigned to a
  process when it starts so, if the server is running while you change the
  settings, the new settings only take effect the next time the server is
  launched.

2. Verify that the server and client run correctly on the same computer. You
  should always test that your client and server run correctly locally; that
  is, on the same computer, before running remotely.

3. Check if the problem you are facing is really a DCOM issue, which is usually
  not related to the code itself, or if it's a coding issue specific to your
  application. Do this by creating a very simple client/server application with
  just one or two very simple methods. Follow the normal procedures of
  packaging and installation. If your server raises events, then your small
  sample should also raise events. For additional information, click the
  article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q266717 HOWTO: Create a DCOM Client/Server Application by Using Visual Basic

  Q267836 HOWTO: Create a DCOM Client/Server with Events by Using Visual Basic

  Ideally, you should use the preceding articles as a guideline because they
  take you step-by-step from scratch through to the final packaging and
  deployment. Use the same settings as you are using for your application and
  see if this works. If your problem is related to DCOM, you face the same
  problems on the small sample as you do in your application. Keep
  troubleshooting the problem with the small sample until you find the problem.
  If the small application works fine but your own application doesn't work
  with the same settings, then you can be facing two problems:

   - Something in your code is creating the problem. For example, if you access
     a database in your code and the identity of your server doesn't have
     rights to do so. The same problem can happen if you are trying to access
     files or instantiate other objects.

   - Your code is fine, but you have some problems in the Registry, such as
     multiple entries to your server.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q180525 PRB: Dcomcnfg Reports Multiple Copies of DCOM Server

   - You are pointing the client computer to the wrong server computer. Check
     the location tab in Dcomcnfg on the client computer.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q268550 HOWTO: Use Dcomcnfg for a Visual Basic DCOM Client/Server Application

4. Verify that you have packaged and installed the client and the server
  correctly. Creating the distribution packages correctly is fundamental to a
  successful installation.

For additional information about a step-by-step sample on how to create a DCOM
client/server application using Visual Basic, click the article numbers below to
view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q266717 HOWTO: Create a DCOM Client/Server Application by Using Visual Basic

  Q267836 HOWTO: Create a DCOM Client/Server with Events by Using Visual Basic

5. Verify that your network is working correctly by pinging the client from the
  server computer and the server from the client computer. On the server
  computer, open a command prompt window, and execute the following command
  where the preceding ClientcomputerName should be the name of your client
  computer:

  Ping ClientcomputerName

  If everything is working correctly, you should see three or four replies and
  the time each one took. If you see timeouts or other errors, you have
  problems in your network setup and you need to fix these before you can
  continue. Repeat the same steps on the client computer using the server's
  computer name.

6. In Dcomcnfg on the client computer, change the server's location by replacing
  the server's name with the server's IP address. If it works with the IP
  address and not with the server's computer name, then more than likely you
  have problems with your networking settings.

7. Try to restart the server and client. Sometimes some settings are cached in
  memory and restarting after making changes in Dcomcnfg solves the problem.

8. On Windows 95 or Windows 98, use the TCP/IP protocol. To do this, remove all
  other protocols in the default protocols list in Dcomcnfg.

9. Usually, if you have a DCOM problem, you get an error when you try to
  instantiate the remote object by calling the CreateObject function or when
  you set the object variable with the New keyword. It's important to be able
  to distinguish if you are getting an error message due to the creation of the
  object itself, or due to what you are doing in the Initialize event of the
  object. If the Initialize event of the object you are trying to instantiate
  doesn't have any code, then there is no doubt that the error you are getting
  is related to the instantiating of your object. If, however, you have code in
  the Initialize event, such as connecting to a database or instantiating other
  objects, you should include error trapping inside the Initialize event and
  raise a custom user error. If you don't trap your errors inside the
  Initialize event and an error is raised, it bubbles out to the client and may
  confuse you. You may think that the problem is the object creation when the
  problem is actually the code in the Initialize event.

10. If the server is running on Microsoft Windows NT 4 or Microsoft Windows
  2000, you can use the Event Viewer to find out additional auditing
  information on why the DCOM connection failed. However, logging these type
  of events is usually not enabled by default. You need to set the auditing
  options to enable it.

  In Windows NT 4, enable these options as follows:

   - On the Start menu, select Programs, select Administrative Tools, and then
     select User Manager.
   - If you are running NT 4 server, you must select a domain; in this case, on
     the User menu, select the Domain option, and then select your local
     computer.
   - On the Policies menu, select the Audit option. Enable auditing for both
     success and failure for the first three entries: Logon/Logoff, File and
     Object Access, Use of User Rights. Click OK and close User Manager.

  In Windows 2000, enable these options as follows:

   - On the Start menu, select Programs, select Administrative Tools, and then
     select Local Security Policy.
   - On the left-hand pane, you see a tree view. Click the plus (+) sign at the
     left of the Local Policies, and you see the Audit Policy entry. Select the
     Audit Policy entry, and note that the right pane contains all audit
     options, which one is enabled and which one is not. Right-clicking at any
     of these options allows you to enable or disable them.
   - Enable auditing for success and failure for the following options: Audit
     logon events, Audit object access, Audit privilege use.
   - Close the Local Security Policy window.

  Once you have activated these logging options, test your client again. After
  you get the error message, use Event Viewer to see if there are any DCOM
  events. The event may tell you why access was denied. Also, it can tell you
  who is logged on to the client computer and if this is a domain user or a
  local user. It can tell you that the protocol requested by the client is not
  available on the server, and so forth. COM logs are usually added to the
  system log.

11. If your server has more than one class, and some of these classes work and
  others don't, check each class entry in Dcomcnfg on the client computer. By
  default, each class has its own AppID and, consequently, its own settings,
  so it's possible that some of your classes are set correctly and others are
  not.

Knowledge Base:

  Q268550 HOWTO: Use Dcomcnfg for a Visual Basic DCOM Client/Server Application

Run-Time Error 70: Permission Denied
------------------------------------

This error is usually related to security settings. This error is a good
indication that the call reached the target computer, so networking is probably
not a problem here. Here are a few things to check:

- If you set the authentication level to Connect, verify that the user logged
  in to the client computer is logged in as a domain user and not a local user.

- If you set the authentication level to Connect, verify that the server
  computer actually belongs to the domain. If it's a standalone computer, it
  cannot authenticate the users unless you have a matching user name/password
  on both the client and server computer.

- If you set the authentication level to None, check if you've set this option
  to none on both client and server computers.

- If you set the authentication level to None and you have verified that both
  computers have this setting correct, be sure that neither the client nor the
  server application is setting authentication programmatically using functions
  such as CoInitializeSecurity or CoSetProxyBlanket. Setting authentication
  programmatically overrides the registry entries from Dcomcnfg.

- If you set the authentication level to None, and you have non-domain users,
  check if you have included "Everyone" (or "The World" for Windows 95 and
  Windows 98) in the access and launch permissions.

- Check the access and launching permissions in Dcomcnfg and verify that the
  user logged on to the client computer is explicitly included in these lists,
  or belongs to one of the groups included.

  Q216051 FIX: Dcomcnfg NT 4.0 SP4 Does Not Write .Exe File Name Under
  HKCR\APPID

Run-Time Error 429: ActiveX Component Can't Create Object
---------------------------------------------------------

Following are a few things that could cause this error:

- The server is not correctly installed on the server computer. Run Dcomcnfg on
  the server computer, select the server application on the list of
  applications, and then click Properties. In the Location tab, verify that the
  only option checked is Run application on this computer.

- You recompiled the server without binary compatibility, and didn't recompile
  the client. The client may be looking for old class IDs. Even if you
  recompiled the client, you may have multiple entries in the registry, old
  ones and new ones.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q180525 PRB: Dcomcnfg Reports Multiple Copies of DCOM Server

- You may be using the wrong server name in the location tab. For example, you
  installed the server on computer ServerA, and for some reason you defined the
  location in Dcomcnfg as being ServerB. Run Dcomcnfg on the client computer,
  locate the server on the list of applications, and then click Properties.
  Select the Location tab, and then verify that the server computer name is
  correct. If you are unable to locate your server in the list of applications,
  look for "Locating your server in the client's applications list" in the

  Q193143 BUG: DCOM Client Hangs and Then Gives Error Message 429

Error 462: The Remote Server Computer Does Not Exist or Is Unavailable
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Following are some causes for this error message:

- You may be using the wrong server name in the location tab. For example, you
  installed the server on computer ServerA, and for some reason you defined the
  location in Dcomcnfg as being ServerB, and ServerB is not a valid computer.
  Run Dcomcnfg on the client computer, locate the server on the list of
  applications, and then click the Properties button. Select the Location tab,
  and then verify that the server computer name is correct. If you are unable
  to locate your server in the list of applications, see "Locating your server
  in the client's applications list" in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
  article:

  Q268550 HOWTO: Use Dcomcnfg for a Visual Basic DCOM Client/Server Application

- Ping the server from the client and verify that it is reachable. Also ping
  the client from the server to see if it is reachable. Ping by name and IP
  address. See item 5 in the "Additional Troubleshooting" section of this
  article.

- Your server is running on a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me computer,
  and the server is not running waiting for clients to connect, or RPCSS.EXE is
  not running.

- The server computer is not running or is still in its reboot state.

The Server Hangs
----------------

If your server does not have a user interface, verify that you checked the
Unattended Execution option. If you don't check this option, it's possible that
a message box is being displayed by your server due to an untrapped error, for
example. If your server is not running with the identity Interactive User,
nobody can see this message box and the server is just waiting for somebody to
dismiss the box, which never happens. By using the Unattended Execution option,
message boxes are redirected to a log file.

Client Crashes After Installation

  Q221173 PRB: Installing VB6 Does Not Update Clireg32.exe

Known Issues to Check:

Following is a list of known problems that could be affecting your installation.
They are documented in other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. Their article
IDs are provided here. If you are still having problems with your DCOM
application after reviewing the troubleshooting steps in this article and the
list of known issues, be sure to search the Knowledge Base for additional
articles that may not be included in this article.

1. The following error message affects server applications created with Visual
  Basic 6.0 Initial Release, before Service Pack 1.

  Q193143 DCOM Client Hangs and Then Gives Error Message 429

2. The following problem was introduced in the Dcomcnfg that shipped with
  Service Pack 4 for NT 4.0 and fixed in Service Pack 6 for NT 4.0. However,
  even if you already have the fixed version shipped with SP6 but your server
  was installed before you installed SP6, you may still be experiencing this
  problem. The problem is that Dcomcnfg did not include one needed registry key
  under Hkey_Classes_Root\AppID. The HKCR\AppID is the key that maps the
  executable of a server to its AppID. For example, if your server's executable
  is MyServer.exe, there must be a key under HKCR\AppID with this name. One of
  the values under this key should be AppID that contains the AppID GUID of
  your server. See instructions in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
  article on how to add the missing entry manually.

  Q216051 Dcomcnfg NT 4.0 SP4 Does Not Write .Exe Name Under HKCR\APPID

  The consequence of this error is that the system ignores all custom entries
  that you defined in Dcomcnfg for this server. For example, if you defined a
  list of users that has rights to access and launch your server, and this list
  includes User1, but you still get error 70 "Access Denied" when User1 tries
  to connect to your server, chances are you have this problem. Another
  problem, for example, is if you defined the Identity of your server to be
  Interactive User, but the server continues to behave as if it has Identity
  Launching User - which is the default.

3. There was a bug in Clireg32.exe that shipped with Visual Basic 5.0. The
  consequence was that the client crashed after installation. The version of
  Clireg32 shipping with Visual Basic 6.0 has this bug fixed, but if you had
  the old version on the computer when you installed Visual Basic 6.0, the
  installation procedure does not update the file, so you may have the old
  version.

  Clireg32.exe is a utility that registers the VBR and TLB files in the client
  computer. When you create a distribution package for a client and add a VBR
  file, the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) automatically adds Clireg32.exe
  to your distribution package. If you have the bad version of clireg32.exe on
  your development computer, you may be distributing the bad version with your
  application. If the target computer doesn't already have a newer version,
  this bad version is the one that is being used. The version with problems
  that shipped with Visual Basic 5.0 is 5.00.3716, dated 1/16/1997 12:00.

  Q185193 Clireg32 Fails to Register the Type Library of DCOM server

  Q221173 Installing VB6 Doesn't Update Clireg32.exe

4. The following bug can cause problems when you are using DCOM on a computer
  with more than one network card. One possible error message is:

  462 Remote server computer is unavailable.

To avoid this problem, keep only TCP/IP on the list of protocols on this
computer. This issue is fixed in NT4 SP4.

  Q183930 IP Is Mangled When Using UDP on Multihomed Computers

5. When a COM client on a Windows NT computer runs under an identity that cannot
  be authenticated on the remote computer, a COM server started by the client
  shuts down in approximately six minutes.
