The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 and the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2,
each of which are implemented as an IBM Distributed Relational Database
Architecture (DRDA) Application Requester, use packages to issue dynamic SQL
statements after connecting to DB2 running on supported platforms.

This article describes the minimum permissions a user must have to create these
packages in an OS/390 (MVS) and AS/400 environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These packages are not required for connecting to the backend, but they are
necessary before any query will work. There are two ways to create these
packages:

- Explicitly: By using the CrtpKgw.exe utility that ships with SNA 4.0
  (SP2/SP3) Server/Client, or with its command line version, Crtpkg.exe.

- Implicitly: If the user does not explicitly create these packages, the driver
  or provider tries to create them dynamically when a query is run, but the
  connected user needs to have the required priviliges in order for this to
  succeed.

All of these packages will be created inside the Collection that is specified in
the Package Collection property in the datalink file, or in the connection
string.

If the user does not have the appropriate authority to create packages in the
specified Collection, or if the specified Collection does not exist, the
provider or driver might report the following error:

In the case of DB2 (on OS/390 or MVS):

  A SQL error has occurred. Please consult the documentation for your specific
  DB2 version for a description of the associated Native Error and SQL State.
  SQLSTATE: 51002, SQLCODE: -567.

In the case of DB2/400:

  A SQL error has occurred. Please consult the documentation for your specific
  DB2 version for a description of the associated Native Error and SQL State.
  SQLSTATE: 51002, SQLCODE: -805.

There are two authorities required to create the packages in the case of DB2 (on
OS/390 or MVS):

- GRANT BINDADD TO "Authorization ID"

- GRANT CREATE IN COLLECTION "Collection ID" TO "Authorization ID"

The "Authorization ID" is the user who needs the permission to create the
packages. Once an administrator executes the above statements on behalf of a
non-privileged user, that user can then run the Create Package Utility, which
would create five sets of packages (one for each of the five isolation levels
supported on DB2/MVS) for use by "all" (in other words, PUBLIC) users.

The "Collection ID" is the name of the Collection, which the user specifies in
the datalink file for the Package Collection property. This Collection should be
a valid Collection within the DB2.

In the case of DB2/400, the user ID must have:

- *CHANGE authority on the DB2 collection

  -or-

- *ALL authority on the DB2 collection

If the user merely has *USE authority, or if the user has *EXCLUDE authority, the
Create Package process will fail.
