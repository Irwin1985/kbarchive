-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Visual Basic project that has a form with control array. You unload
the form inside of control array's event handler and when the form unloads, you
set the form to be Nothing. The project works fine with Visual Studio 6.0
Service Pack 3 installed. However, if Visual Studio 6. 0 Service Pack 4 is
installed on the computer, the application stops responding when the control
array's event to unload the form is fired.

RESOLUTION
==========

- To work around the problem for scenarios 1 and 2 (as described in the "More
  Information" section of this article), don't set the form to nothing when the
  form is unloaded.

- To work around the problem for scenario 3, make a form-level reference to the
  form that will not lose scope while the form is active. To do so, add the
  following to the General Declarations section:

  Private f as Form
         

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are at least three scenarios in which this bug appears.

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

Scenario #1

1. Create a Standard EXE Visual Basic Project under Visual Basic 6.0 with Visual
  Studio 6 Service Pack 4 installed. Form1 is created automatically.

2. Press CTRL+T, and the add any non-intrinsic control into the components
  dialog box. For example, add "Sheridan 3D Controls" or "Microsoft Windows
  Common Controls 6.0 (SP4)".

3. Add an instance of SSCommand to Form1. Use the default name, which is
  SSCommand1.

4. Create a control array by giving the control an index of 0.

5. Add the following code to Form1:

  Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
      'The following line causes a fault under SP4, when 'Unload Me' 
      'is called from an event in a control array.
      'Comment this out to work around the bug.
      Set Form1 = Nothing
  End Sub

  Private Sub SSCommand1_Click(Index As Integer)
      Unload Me
  End Sub

6. Save the project, and press F5 to run it.

7. Click the command button. Visual Basic stops responding and displays the
  following error message:

  The instruction at "0x004051ba" referenced memory at "0x0000007a". The Memory
  could not be "written".

8. Open the project in the Visual Basic integrated development environment
  again.

9. Comment out the following line:

  Set Form1 = Nothing

10. Save the project, and then press F5 to run it. Click the command button. The
  form closes without a problem.

Scenario #2

1. Create a new UserControl.

2. Add the following code:

  Public Event Click()
           
  Private Sub UserControl_MouseUp(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single)
      RaiseEvent Click
  End Sub

3. From the File menu, select Add Project, and then select Standard EXE.

4. Press CTRL+R to display the Project Explorer.

5. Right-click Project1, and select Set as Start Up.

6. Double-click Form1 to open the Form Designer, and then drop an instance of
  the newly created User Control on it. Use the default name of UserControl11.

7. Create a control array by giving the control an index of 0.

8. Add the following code:

  Private Sub UserControl11_Click(Index As Integer)
      Unload Me
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
      Set Form1 = Nothing
  End Sub

9. Save the project and press F5 to run it.

10. Click the UserControl. Visual Basic fails and displays the following error
  message:

  The instruction at "0x004051ba" referenced memory at "0x0000007a". The Memory
  could not be "written".

11. Open the project in Visual Basic again.

12. Comment out the line:

  Set Form1 = Nothing

13. Save the project, and then press F5 to run it.

14. Click the UserControl. The form closes without a problem.

Scenario #3

1. Create a new Standard EXE.

2. Add a command button to Form1. Use the default name, which is Command1.

3. Add the following code:

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim f As New Form2
      f.Show
  End Sub
        

4. Add Form2 to the project.

5. Press CTRL+T, and then add any non-intrinsic control into the components
  dialog box, such as "Sheridan 3D Controls" or "Microsoft Windows Common
  Controls 6.0 SP4)".

6. Add an instance of SSCommand to Form2. Use the default name, which is
  SSCommand1.

7. Create a control array by giving the control an index of 0.

8. Add the following code to Form2:

  Private Sub SSCommand1_Click(Index As Integer)
      Unload Me
  End Sub
        

9. Save the project, and then press F5 to run it.

10. Click Command1. Form2 appears.

11. Click SSCommand1. Visual Basic stops responding and displays the following
  with error message:

  The instruction at "0x004051ba" referenced memory at "0x0000007a". The Memory
  could not be "written".

12. Open the project in Visual Basic again.

13. Change the line

  Dim f as New Form2
        

  in Form1 to:

  Set f = New Form2
        

  Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Private f as Form2
        

14. Save the project, and then press F5 to run it.

15. Click Command1. Form2 appears.

16. Click SSCommand1. The form closes without a problem.
