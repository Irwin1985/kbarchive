The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the mouse to select text, you may not be able to control the
selection when the mouse pointer reaches the bottom of the screen. As a result,
unwanted text may be selected.


CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design in Microsoft Word and depends upon your
processor speed and video refresh rate. Currently, there is no customization
available to control the speed of text selection when you use the mouse.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use one or more of the following methods appropriate
for your situation.

Method 1: Use the Mouse and the SHIFT Key
-----------------------------------------

Click at the beginning of the text that you want to select, use the vertical
scroll bar to scroll to the end of the text that you want, and then hold down
SHIFT and click.

For more information about how to select a large block of text, click "Contents
and Index" on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Microsoft Word Help, type
the following text

  selecting text and graphics

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Select text and graphics by
using the mouse" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask
the Office Assistant.

Method 2: Use the Mouse and the F8 Key
--------------------------------------

Click at the beginning of the text that you want to select, press F8 to activate
the Extend Selection mode (EXT appears on the status bar), use the vertical
scroll bar to scroll to the end of the text that you want, and then click at the
end of the text that you want to select.

You also can adjust the selection. If too much text is selected, click at the end
of the text that you want to include within the selection. Word automatically
adjusts the selection. If too little text is selected, click at the end of the
additional text. Word automatically adjusts the selection.

To turn off the Extend Selection mode, but to keep the text selected, press ESC.

For more information about how to select by using shortcut keys, click "Contents
and Index" on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Microsoft Word Help, type
the following text

  selecting text and graphics

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Select text and graphics by
using shortcut keys" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need,
ask the Office Assistant.

Method 3: Use the Keyboard
--------------------------

Position the insertion point at the beginning of the text that you want to
select. Hold down the SHIFT key, and use the directional arrow keys to select
the text that you want.

Method 4: Use a Microsoft IntelliMouse Wheel Mouse
--------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This is not a complete solution to the problem and may require the use of
two hands when you select text.

Move the mouse pointer into the left margin, next to the text that you want to
select. The mouse pointer should be an arrow pointing northeast. Hold the left
mouse button, and rotate the mouse wheel until the text that you want is
selected.
