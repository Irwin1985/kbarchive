- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you map a home folder or virtual folder to a share that is located on
another computer, a red stop sign icon may be displayed in the Internet Service
Manager (ISM) next to the resource that is mapped to the universal naming
convention (UNC) path.

CAUSE
=====

When you map content to a UNC, Internet Information Server (IIS) requires
connect as credentials that are used to impersonate all users that connect to
the UNC resource from the Web or FTP site. Although the connect as credentials
are used to establish a connection to the UNC path, IIS uses the credentials of
the logged on user to enumerate, or list, the files in a given folder. When you
reference resources that are not located on the IIS server, permissions problems
can occur because the security resources (that is, groups and accounts) on the
IIS server may not have a security context on the remote (UNC) server.

WORKAROUND
==========

Although Microsoft does not recommended using UNC-mapped content on
high-capacity Web sites, the following workarounds are available:

- Specify a domain account for the impersonation, or connect as, credentials.

- Create an account on the UNC server that has the same username and password
  as the user account that is being used to access Web pages on the IIS server.
  Both the connect as user and the authenticated user (the user that is
  connecting from the Web browser) need to have the appropriate new technology
  file system (NTFS) permissions on the UNC share to access the content.

view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q187506 List of NTFS Permissions Required for IIS Site to Work

Note that the files on the UNC server should be treated as content.

NOTE: If you are using anonymous authentication, by default this is the
IUSR_ServerName on the IIS server. However, if you are using Basic
authentication, any user account that browses UNC-mapped content must have a
security context on the remote computer (that is, either a domain account or
each corresponding username and password must be created on the UNC server).



- Promote both the IIS and UNC servers to be domain controllers in the same
  Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 2000 domains. This works
  because domain controllers share the same security accounts database.

NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend installing IIS on a domain controller, due to
the performance degradation that is caused by authentication and other domain
functionality that is provided by a domain controller.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to decreasing performance of Web applications by pulling content
from the network rather than from a local disk, using UNC-mapped content makes
managing security more difficult. Windows NT and Windows 2000 treat each server
as its own security entity. Based on this implementation, each computer manages
its own resources and controls access to the files for which it is responsible.
Because each server is responsible for managing resources on itself, it is not
possible to manage and control access to resources on another computer; the
remote computer is responsible for these resources.

NOTE: One exception to this implementation is domain controllers that are in the
same domain, which all share the same security database and can manage resources
on other domain controllers that are in the same domain.
