-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Drag method to implement the drag-and-drop feature for a ListView
control, the application works as expected when you use the Visual Basic 5.0
version of the ListView control. However, when you use the Visual Basic 6.0
version of the ListView control, you can only drag one item, even if you select
multiple items.

CAUSE
=====

When the Drag method is called, the ListView control updates the selection state
so that only the item that is clicked most recently is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, store the selection information before the Drag
method is called, and restore the selection state after the Drag method is
issued. You need to restore the selection state after the function that calls
the Drag method exits. For sample code that demonstrates this workaround, see
the "More Information" section.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 6.0. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Press CTRL+T. In the Components dialog box, select the "Microsoft Windows
  Common Controls 6.0" check box, and then click OK.

3. Add a ListView control (ListView1) and a Label control (Label1) to Form1.
  Enlarge both controls.

4. Add the following code to Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private m_bBegDrag   As Boolean

  Private Sub ListView1_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, x As Single, y As Single)
      If m_bBegDrag = True Then
          ListView1.Drag vbBeginDrag
          m_bBegDrag = False
      End If
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
      Dim ItmX As ListItem
      Dim i As Integer
      
      Label1.BorderStyle = vbFixedSingle
   
      ListView1.View = lvwList
      ListView1.MultiSelect = True
      
      For i = 1 To 12
          Set ItmX = ListView1.ListItems.Add(, , "Item " &amp; CStr(i))
      Next
  End Sub

  Private Sub Label1_DragDrop(Source As Control, x As Single, y As Single)
      Dim nCount As Integer
      Dim ItmX As ListItem
      
      If Not TypeOf Source Is ListView Then Exit Sub
      
      For Each ItmX In Source.ListItems
          If ItmX.Selected = True Then
              nCount = nCount + 1
          End If
      Next
      MsgBox nCount &amp; " Items dropped"
  End Sub

  Private Sub ListView1_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, x As Single, y As Single)
      If Not ListView1.HitTest(x, y) Is Nothing Then
          m_bBegDrag = True
      End If
  End Sub

  Private Sub ListView1_MouseUp(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, x As Single, y As Single)
      m_bBegDrag = False
  End Sub

5. Press F5 to run the application. Select several items in the ListView
  control, and drag them to the Label control. Notice that only one item is
  dropped to the Label control.

Workaround
----------

Continuing from the previous steps, follow these steps to work around this
problem:

1. From the Project menu, click Add Module. In the Add Module dialog box, click
  Open. Module1 is added to your project.

2. Add the following code to Module1:

  Option Explicit

  Public Sub GetSelectedItems(lvwCtl As ListView, colItems As Collection, &amp; _
  x As Single, y As Single)
      Dim i   As Integer
      Dim ItmX    As ListItem
      
      ' Clear the collection
      Set colItems = New Collection
      
      ' If you click a non-selected node, you only drag this node.
      If lvwCtl.HitTest(x, y).Selected = False Then
          colItems.Add (lvwCtl.HitTest(x, y).Index)
          Exit Sub
      End If
      
      ' Otherwise, drag the currently selected nodes.
      For Each ItmX In lvwCtl.ListItems
          If ItmX.Selected = True Then
             colItems.Add (ItmX.Index)
          End If
      Next
  End Sub

  Public Sub SetSelectedItems(lvwCtl As ListView, colItems As Collection)
      Dim i As Integer
      Dim ItmX As ListItem
      
      If colItems Is Nothing Then Exit Sub
      If colItems.Count = 0 Then Exit Sub
      
      ' Select the items that should be selected.
      For i = 1 To colItems.Count
          lvwCtl.ListItems(colItems(i)).Selected = True
      Next
  End Sub

3. Replace this code in Form1

  Private Sub ListView1_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, x As Single, y As Single)
      If m_bBegDrag = True Then
          ListView1.Drag vbBeginDrag
          m_bBegDrag = False
      End If
  End Sub

  with the following code:

  Private m_bSetSelectedItems As Boolean
  Private m_colItems As Collection

  Private Sub ListView1_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, x As Single, y As Single)
      If m_bBegDrag = True Then
          GetSelectedItems ListView1, m_colItems, x, y
          ListView1.Drag vbBeginDrag
          m_bBegDrag = False
          m_bSetSelectedItems = True
      End If
  End Sub
  Private Sub ListView1_DragOver(Source As Control, x As Single, y As Single, State As Integer)
      If m_bSetSelectedItems Then
          SetSelectedItems ListView1, m_colItems
          m_bSetSelectedItems = False
      End If
  End Sub

4. Press F5 to run the application. Select several items in the ListView
  control, and drag them to the Label control. Note that all of the selected
  items are dropped as expected.
