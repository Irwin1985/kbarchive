MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 19: Text Correction
------------------------

Correction for page 19, paragraph 2.

Change:
"Inheriting from a pure abstract base class is called interface inheritance..."

To:
"Inheriting publicly from a pure abstract base class is called interface
inheritance..."


Page 21: Sidebar Update
-----------------------

Replace sidebar text as follows:

[Start replacement]

The __stdcall or Pascal Calling Convention

You might have noticed the word __stdcall above. __stdcall is a
Microsoft-specific extension to the compiler. (You knew there had to be one.)
Any compiler that supports the development of Win32 applications will have this
or an equivalent option. Compilers from Borland, Symantec, and Watcom have this
option. A function marked with __stdcall uses the standard calling convention.
Functions using the standard calling convention remove the parameters from the
stack before they return to the caller. Pascal functions handle stack clean up
the same way. In the normal C/C++ calling convention, the caller cleans up the
stack instead of the function. Most other languages, such as Visual Basic, use
the standard calling convention by default. The standard calling convention is
so named because all Win32 API functions, except the few that take variable
arguments, use it. Variable argument functions continue to use the C calling
convention, or __cdecl. Windows adopted the standard calling convention because
it reduces the size of code and because the original versions of Windows had to
run on 640-KB systems.

Virtually all functions offered by COM interfaces on Microsoft platforms use the
standard calling convention. Functions with variable numbers of arguments use
the C calling convention. People will expect you to use those conventions.
However, using them is not an absolute requirement of COM. You may use another
calling convention, but you should definitely document that fact, and you should
be aware that clients written in some other languages might not be able to use
your interfaces.

If you prefer a word that is easier to remember than __stdcall, use pascal. It is
defined in WINDEF.H as

    #define pascal __stdcall

Or if you think putting the word pascal in your code makes you a wimp, you can
use the following definition from OBJBASE.H:

    #define STDMETHODCALLTYPE __stdcall

[End text replacement]

Note that the footnote remains the same in both the original and updated versions
of this sidebar.


Pages 30-33: vtbl Pointers &amp; Instance Data Corrections
------------------------------------------------------

The following corrections are needed to improve the clarity and accuracy of the
section describing vtbl pointers and instance data:

Page 30, code fragment changes:

  To:
  "{cout &lt;&lt; m_data1 &lt;&lt; end1 ;}"

  To: "{cout &lt;&lt; m_data3 &lt;&lt; end1 ;}"

  - Line 13, change:
  ": m_Fx2(d*d), m_Fx3(d*d*d), m_Fx4(d*d*d*d)"

  "double m_data3 ;"

Page 31, figure 2-5:

  - Remove the bottom three arrows between the vtbl pointer box to the Virtual
  Function Table box. (Be sure to leave the top pointer from vtbl pointer to
  &amp;Fx1)
  - In the vtbl pointer box:
  Change "&amp;m_Fx2" to "m_data1"
  Change "&amp;m_Fx3" to "m_data2"
  Change "&amp;m_Fx4" to "m_data3"

Page 32, figure 2-6:

  Change:
  "I drew the instance data as a dotted box since, "
  To:
  "I didn't draw the instance data since, "

  - Remove the bottom three arrows between the top vtbl pointer box to the
  Virtual Function Table box. (Be sure to leave the top pointer from vtbl
  pointer to &amp;Fx1)

  Virtual Function Table box. (Be sure to leave the top pointer from vtbl
  pointer to &amp;Fx1)
