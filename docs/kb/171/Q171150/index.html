SUMMARY
=======

If you are not connected to a Microsoft Exchange server, the steps on page xxvi
of Microsoft Outlook 97 Step by Step for creating a practice profile, personal
address book, and personal folder file are unclear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have already installed a practice profile for the fictitious "Shawn
Davis," but have experienced difficulties using the profile, you should delete
the practice profile and reinstall it according to the instructions in the
"Resolution" section.

RESOLUTION
==========

To delete the practice profile, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Mail icon.

3. Make sure the Services tab is selected, and then click Show Profiles.

4. Make sure the General tab is selected, and then click the Shawn Davis profile
  (or any other profile you want to delete) in the Profiles box.

5. Click Remove, and then click OK.

To correctly install the practice profile if you are not using Microsoft Exchange
Server, follow these steps. Make sure that you have already completed the steps
in the "Modify Outlook startup settings" section on page xxv.

NOTE: These steps are adapted from those listed on pages xxvi-xxvii under "Create
a practice profile" and "Create a practice personal address box and personal
folder file." These steps are designed for readers who are not using Microsoft
Exchange Server.

1. Double-click the Microsoft Outlook shortcut icon on the Desktop. Note that
  the Choose Profile dialog box appears.

2. Click New. The Inbox Setup Wizard starts.

3. In the Inbox Setup Wizard dialog box, verify that the Use The Following
  Information Services option button is selected, and then verify that only the
  Microsoft Mail check box is selected. Make sure the Microsoft Exchange Server
  check box is not checked. Click Next.

4. In the Profile Name box, type Shawn Davis, and then click Next.

5. In the Microsoft Mail dialog box that states that "You must provide a patch
  to the location of the postoffice," click Browse. The Browse For Postoffice
  dialog box appears.

6. Double-click your hard disk, then double-click the Outlook SBS folder, and
  then highlight the Wgpo0000 folder by clicking on it once only. Click OK, and
  then click Next.

7. Select the name Shawn Davis from the list of names, and then click Next.

8. Type "password" (without the quotation marks) in the Password box, and then
  click Next.

9. In the path box, select the text "C:\Exchange\mailbox.pab", type "shawnd.paB"
  (without the quotation marks), and then click Next.

10. In the post office box, select the text "C:\Exchange\mailbox.pst", type
  "shawnd.pst" (without the quotation marks), and then click Next.

11. Verify that the Do Not Add Inbox to StartUp Group option button is selected,
  and then click Next.

12. Click Finish. Click Cancel to close the Choose Profile dialog box.

The Shawn Davis profile will now be set up correctly. You can now continue
following the original book beginning with Lesson 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft Press has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Outlook 97 Step
by Step." This problem will be corrected in future reprints and editions of the
book.
