SUMMARY
=======

If a failover condition occurs within Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS), resources
within the failing group will transition to another node within the cluster. The
time required to bring resources online may vary based on resource types and
other factors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Cluster Server allows for resources to be members of a group of like
resources. Resources may run on only one node at a time. Groups are the basic
failover units within a cluster and may be owned by only one system at a time.
If a resource failure occurs within a group, the resource manager may try to
bring the resource online or failover the entire group to another node in the
cluster. During failover, clients using cluster resources may experience little
or no change in activity, or else may need to reconnect. Client impact depends
greatly on the type of resources they use and other resource factors.

The time required to bring a resource online may depend on the following
factors:

- Type of resource

- Resource properties

- Group properties

- Dependent resources

Some resources may reach an online state very quickly whereas others take several
seconds to go online. The amount of time required depends on the type of
resource. For example, an IP address may go online very quickly, but a database
server service may take several seconds. The database may check integrity of
data files while an IP address does not require the same initialization
procedures. A network name may take time to be registered on the network and to
check for duplicate network names.

Resources may be configured to stay offline after a specified number of failures.
They may also be restricted from running on specific nodes within the cluster.
Use Cluster Administrator to modify these properties.

Groups may have a preferred owner and may be configured to failback automatically
if the preferred owner node is available. Groups may be configured not to
failback to another node or to failback only during a specific time window.

Resources may also be dependent on other resources within their group. As a
result, the dependent resources will not come online until the resources they
depend upon are online.

Additionally, if a node fails, surviving cluster nodes must arbitrate for access
to the quorum disk resource. Quorum disk arbitration may occur within seconds.
However, the performance of hardware and attached devices on the shared SCSI bus
may influence the speed of this process.

All of these factors and many others may influence resource startup or failover
time requirements. Hardware and network performance may also impact cluster
resources.
