IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running Windows NT Server, if Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW)
is installed, a SAP Type 640 broadcasts every 60 seconds by the remote procedure
call (RPC) service. This SAP broadcast continues even if the user disables the
GSNW and the SAP Agent Service.

On a computer running Windows NT Workstation, the RPC service does the SAP
broadcast if the Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) and the SAP Agent service
are installed. This SAP broadcast continues even if the user disables the SAP
agent.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the RPC service checks for the presence of Gateway Services for
NetWare and the SAP Agent service on the computer running Windows NT Server.

On the computer running Windows NT Workstation with CSNW, the RPC service checks
for the SAP Agent service. If the services are present, RPC starts its own
thread that does the SAP broadcast Type 640 every minute.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the

STATUS
======

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0. This problem was
first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5.


MORE INFORMATION
================

After applying this fix, perform the steps below to create a new registry
value.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\RPC

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

     Value Name: AdvertiseRpcService
     Data Type:  REG_SZ
     String:     No

  Using No for the string turns RPC sapping off.
  Using Yes for the string turns RPC sapping on.

4. Restart the computer for the registry change to take effect.

If the SAP broadcasts continue after following these steps, you may want to
disable SAP broadcasts as a troubleshooting step. To disable SAP broadcasts,
delete the Ncacn_spx string value in following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Rpc\ServerProtocols\ 

NOTE: This should be used only as a troubleshooting step. Deleting this string
value completely disables SAP broadcasts which some programs may need in order
to function properly.
