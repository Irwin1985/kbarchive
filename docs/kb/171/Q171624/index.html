SUMMARY
=======

A 16-bit Windows application which uses the APPC, CPIC, or LUA interfaces may
hang when running over the SNA Server Windows 3.x client TCP/IP sockets
interface. This problem can occur on either WFW/Windows 3.x or Windows 95. This
problem may only occur when the client is configured for TCP/IP sockets. The
application may work correctly when the SNA Server Windows 3.x client is
configured to use named pipes or Netware ipx/spx.

There are two main scenarios where this has been observed:

1. If the 16-bit application isn't "peeking" on messages to all windows handles.

2. If the Windows SNA startup call is made from a different windows process than
  the SNA API calls are made from.

These scenarios are described in more detail below.

NOTE: When running on Windows NT, a 16-bit Windows application that uses the
APPC, CPIC, or LUA interfaces can run over the SNA Server Windows NT client
software, through the 16-to-32-bit SNA "thunking" DLL's. By using these thunking
DLL's on the SNA Server Windows NT client software, the problems described in
this article do not occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, a 16-bit Windows application which uses the SNA Server Windows 3.x SNA
API's should function properly regardless of the LAN interface used by the
underlying SNA Windows 3.x client software. However, the application may
encounter problems when running over the SNA client when configured for TCP/IP
sockets because the underlying architecture of the socket interface has special
requirements for the 16-bit Windows calling application.

If a 16-bit Windows application fails to work on top of the SNA Windows client
TCP/IP sockets interface, here are the possible causes.

1. If the 16-bit application isn't "peeking" on messages to all Window handles.

  Unlike named pipes and Netware IPX/SPX, the Windows 3.x TCP/IP socket
  interface runs within the non-preemptive Windows architecture, underneath the
  calling application. When the SNA Windows 3.x client makes calls to named
  pipes or Netware IPX/SPX, which run outside of Windows, the network i/o is
  accomplished with no requirements of the 16-bit Windows application.

  However, when the SNA Windows 3.x client is configured for TCP/IP sockets, the
  16-bit Windows application must "peek" on messages intended for any Windows
  handle, in order for the underlying SNA client software to receive data from
  the TCP/IP sockets interface.

  So, in order for the Windows application to work over TCP/IP sockets, the
  application's Windows message loop should be architected as follows:

        /*  get the next message if any */ 
        if ( PeekMessage ( &amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE) ) {
           if ( msg.message = WM_QUIT )
              return FALSE;   // let app process WM_QUIT
           PeekMessage ( &amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE) ;
           TranslateMessage (&amp;msg) ;
           DispatchMessage (&amp;msg) ;
       }

  The second parameter passed to PeekMessage(), the Window handle (hWnd), must
  be NULL in order for the underlying TCP/IP sockets interface to receive
  messages on behalf of the application.


  NOTE: If an API communication layer is being developed (for example, an
  ODBC/DRDA driver), the developer may not have control over the architecture
  of the calling application. If this is occurring, then the following strategy
  can be used to function over TCP/IP sockets:

   - When SNA client is running over Winsock it makes a hidden window with
     class name "SNA Winsock". For the other transports, it's "SNA Server".

   - During initialization of the API communication layer, call EnumWindows and
     find one whose class starts with "SNA ".

   - Establish an SNA blocking hook which dispatches messages only for this
     window.

   - Call OpenFile (IF_EXIST) on WINSOCK.DLL. If it exists, call

     If not, do not call LoadLibrary since this will put a dialog on the screen
     if it can't find the DLL.

   - Call GetProcAddress for WSAStartup and WSASetBlockingHook, and set a
     Winsock blocking hook that doesn't dispatch any messages.


2. If the Windows SNA startup call is made from a different windows process than
  the SNA API calls are made from.

  If a Windows application calls the APPC, CPIC or LUA interface, the
  application should first call WinAPPCStartup, WinCPICStartup, or
  WinRUIStartup/WinSLIStartup respectively. This startup call should be
  performed when the Windows process first initializes, before initiating a
  session over the SNA interface.

  A hang has been observed if a Windows 3.x application calls WinAPPCStartup
  from one Windows process, and then calls the APPC interface from another
  Windows process. Later versions of the SNA Windows 3.x client software (3.0
  and later) now allow a Windows 3.x application to invoke an APPC conversation
  without first calling WinAPPCStartup. However, the application should still
  call WinAPPCStartup. If an application calls WinAPPCStartup from one process,
  and then calls APPC functions from another process, the application may hang
  if TCP/IP sockets is being used.

  To correct this problem, the WinAPPCStartup call should be moved to the
  process which is actually using the APPC interface, or the WinAPPCStartup and
  WinAPPCCleanup calls should be removed from the Windows application.
