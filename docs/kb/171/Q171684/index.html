SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the differences between the Microsoft Word 6.0/95 (RTF)
and the Microsoft Word 6.0/95 (binary) export converters, how to obtain the
converters, and when to use them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HISTORY OF THE CONVERTERS
-------------------------

Word 97 RTF Export Converter (non-Service Release 1):

  File Name: Wrd6ex32.cnv
  Date: 12/9/96
  Size: 19 KB
  Name: Word 6.0/95 Export (via RTF)

NOTE: This is the converter that comes with the original version of Microsoft
Word 97, not with Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1).

To use this converter, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. In the "Save as type" box, click "Word 6.0/95 (*.doc)".

3. Type a file name, and then click OK.

This saves the document in a format that earlier versions of Microsoft Word can
open. This converter saves the document in Rich Text Format (RTF), while giving
it a .doc file extension.

Compressed RTF Export Converter (no longer available):

  File Name: Wd6ex32.exe, Wrd6ex32.cnv

NOTE: This is the same name that was used for the original RTF export converter.

  Date: 5/5/97 (dates may vary)
  Size: 19 KB
  Name: Word 6/95 compressed RTF export

In an attempt to reduce the file size of the RTF document that was created when
using the original Word 6.0/95 export converter, a modified version of the
export converter was created and was made available for download on the
Microsoft Web site for a short period of time.

This export converter also created an RTF file with a .doc file extension. This
converter significantly reduced the size of the RTF file that was generated by
compressing graphics into a binary format instead of using the traditional ANSI
format. The RTF file that was created by this converter is not compatible with
other applications that read RTF format.

NOTE: This converter is no longer available.

This converter, when installed, could be used by following these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. In the "Save as type" list, click Word 6.0/95.

3. Give the file a name and then click OK.

Word 6.0/95 Binary Export Converter:

  File Name: Wd6ex32.exe, Wrd6ex32.cnv
  Date: 6/4/97
  Size: 1024 KB
  Name: Word 6/95 binary export

NOTE: This is the same name that was used for the original RTF export converter.

To make a conversion from Microsoft Word 97 to Word 6.x or 7.x easier, a Word
6.0/95 (*.doc) binary export converter was created. This converter saves from
Word 97 into a true binary format that Word 6.x or 7.x can understand, as
opposed to the modified RTF format used in the earlier converters. This
converter significantly reduced the size of the exported file, making it smaller
than what was created by the earlier versions of the export converters, listed
earlier.

If you are running the original version of Microsoft Word 97, you can obtain the
Word 6.0/95 (binary) export converter by obtaining Microsoft Word 97 Service
Release 2(SR-2). For additional information about SR-2, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q151261 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-2

If you are running Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1), you already have
the Word 6.0/95 (via RTF) and the Word 6.0/95 (binary) export converters. Word
97 SR-1 shipped with:

File Name      Date     Size      Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Wrd6ex32.cnv   7/2/97   1024 KB   Word 6.0/95 Binary Export Converter
Wrd6er32.cnv   7/2/97   19 KB     Word 6.0/95 RTF Export Converter

NOTE: The Binary Export Converter is the same file that is available on the
Microsoft Web site.

To use the binary export converter, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. In the "Save as type" box, click Word 6.0/95.

3. Give the file a name and click OK.

In Microsoft Word 97 SR-1, the Word 6.0/95 export (via RTF) converter that
shipped with the original release of Microsoft Word 97 was renamed from
Wrd6ex32.cnv to Wrd6er32.cnv. In the list of Save as type formats, it will be
displayed as "Word 97 and 6.0/95 - RTF (*.doc)".

To use the Word 6.0/95 (via RTF) export converter, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. In the "Save as type" list, click Word 97 &amp; 6.0/95 - RTF.

3. Give the file a name and click OK.

HOW TO DETERMINE WHICH CONVERTER TO USE
---------------------------------------

Advantages Using the Binary Export Converter:

The binary export converter creates an exported file that is significantly
smaller than what is created when you use the RTF-based export converter. Note
that Microsoft Word 97 uses a great deal of graphics compression that did not
exist in earlier versions of Word. Therefore, files containing graphics,
especially bitmaps, will be significantly smaller in native Word 97 format than
they will be in native Word 6.x or 7.x format.

The binary export converter is less confusing to use than the RTF-based converter
because the file is a true Word document and not an RTF file with a .doc file
extension.

Advantages Using RTF-Based Export Converter:

The RTF-based export converter offers Better retention of formatting if you open
a document in an earlier version of Word but do not save it in the earlier
version.

To retain as much formatting as possible, do the following:

1. Create a document in Microsoft Word 97.

2. Save the document in Word 6.0/95 format using the RTF based converter.

3. Open the document in Word 6.x or 7.x.

  NOTE: some of the formatting and features from Microsoft Word 97 that are not
  supported in the earlier versions of Word will be gone.

4. Close the document in Word 6.x or 7.x without saving the changes.

  NOTE: Do not save the changes. If you re-open the document in Microsoft Word
  97, all of the Word 97 features and formatting will be in the document, even
  though they did not appear in the earlier versions of Word. All of the
  Microsoft Word 97 formatting and features are retained when you re-open the
  document in Microsoft Word 97 without saving the document in the earlier
  version.

  If you saved the document in an earlier version, all of the Microsoft Word 97
  specific formatting and features will be lost. They will not re-appear when
  you re-open the document in Microsoft Word 97.
