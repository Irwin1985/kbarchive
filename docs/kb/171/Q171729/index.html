SUMMARY
=======

The new AddressOF operator allows you to pass the Address of a Visual Basic
procedure to a DLL for the purposes of providing a Callback function. However,
Visual Basic does not let you make the callback directly from within BASIC code.
This article provides a helper DLL that makes generic callback functionality
available to BASIC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The usual way to use the callback mechanism is to write separate DLL functions
for each BASIC function prototype. This article details two Visual C++ functions
that provide a generic callback mechanism for any BASIC function prototype. The
functions work by manipulating the stack, thus passing the parameters directly
to the called function.

express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of

Visual C++ Code
---------------

The following code was compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 but should work
with other compilers. This is in a standard DLL project with multi- threaded DLL
libraries. The calling convention has no prolog code. If you're unsure, have the
compiler generate an .ASM file, examine the output, and choose a different
calling convention. You can ignore epilog code because it will never get
executed.

NOTE: This code is specific to the INTEL platform only.

Callback.DEF
------------

     LIBRARY   VB5Callback

     EXPORTS
        Callback
        Callback2

Callback.CPP
------------

     __declspec(naked) void Callback()
     {

     /* For procedures with return values of 8 bytes or less */ 
     /* Get address to be called and fix-up return address */ 

        _asm  pop   eax;        // save return address
        _asm  pop   ecx;        // get address to JMP to
        _asm  push  eax;        // restore return address
        _asm  jmp   ecx;        // Jump to callback function....
     }

     __declspec(naked) void Callback2()
     {

     /* For procedures with return values of more than 8 bytes */ 
     /* Get address to be called and fix-up return address */ 

        _asm  pop   eax;        // save return address
        _asm  pop   edx;        // save parameter 0
        _asm  pop   ecx;        // get address to JMP to
        _asm  push  edx;        // restore parameter 0
        _asm  push  eax;        // restore return address
        _asm  jmp   ecx;        // Jump to callback function....
     }

Visual Basic Code
-----------------

The function prototypes in BASIC are achieved by using the DECLARE statement
because the BASIC compiler does no type checking on the DLL functions. The first
argument needs to be a LONG with which to pass the address of the function to be
called. Subsequent arguments and the function return type should match the
callback function exactly.

Sample Callback Function Declarations:
--------------------------------------

The callback functions must reside in a standard .BAS module. They cannot reside
in a Form or Class module:

     Sub Message()
     Function Calc(ByVal X As Long, Y As Long) As Long
     Function StrPrt(ByVal S As String) As String
     Function RetVariant() As Variant

Sample Declare Statements
-------------------------

The declare statements can be anywhere. If in a Form or Class module, they need
to be declared using Private Declare ...:

     Declare Sub CallMessage Lib "Callback.dll" Alias "Callback" _
         (ByVal Addr As Long)
     Declare Function CallCalc Lib "Callback.dll" Alias "Callback" _
         (ByVal Addr As Long, ByVal X As Long, Y As Long) As Long
     Declare Function CallStrPrt Lib "Callback.dll" Alias "Callback" _
         (ByVal Addr As Long, ByVal S As String) As String
     Declare Function CallRetVariant Lib "Callback.dll" Alias "Callback2" _
         (ByVal Addr As Long) As Variant

The use of "Callback" or "Callback2" depends on the function return type as
explained in the Return Type table (below).

Sample Usage
------------

The callback functions can be called from anywhere in scope of the prototype
Declare statement:

     CallMessage AddressOf Message
     iResult = CallCalc(AddressOf Calc, 6, iNum)
     S$ = CallStrPrt(AddressOf StrPrt, "The moon is rising over Toledo")
     Debug.Print CallRetVariant(AddressOf RetVariant)

Return-type Table
-----------------

The following table indicates which return types should use Callback and which
should use Callback2 in their Declare statements.

Two versions of the function are required. The first is for Sub routines and all
Function prototypes whose return type occupies 8 bytes or less, including all
object types and String. The second is for Function prototypes whose return
argument is greater than 8 bytes, namely all Variants and those User-Defined
Types whose length is greater than 8 bytes.

The reason for this dichotomy is that Visual Basic can't return these large data
types in a register. It passes the address of a pre-allocated structure as an
implicit parameter on the stack, which the second callback function takes into
account.

  Return Type                            DLL Function
  ----------------------------           --------------------
  All Sub routines                       Callback
  Byte                                   Callback
  Integer                                Callback
  Boolean                                Callback
  Long                                   Callback
  Single                                 Callback
  Double                                 Callback
  Currency                               Callback
  Date                                   Callback
  String                                 Callback
  Variant                                           Callback2
  Any object type                        Callback
  User-defined type (8-bytes or less)    Callback
  User-defined Type (more than 8 bytes)             Callback2

If you're unsure about which function to use with your user-defined type, you may
have to try both functions and see which one works. The example below
illustrates Types requiring both Callback and Callback2:

     Type Size8          ' functions returning this type require Callback
       A As Long         ' 4 bytes
       B As String       ' 4-byte pointer - note String discussion below
     End Type

     Type Size12         ' functions returning this type require Callback2
       A As Long         ' 4 bytes
       B As Double       ' 8 bytes
     End Type

A Note About Strings
--------------------

Because BASIC is calling a DLL, it will convert string parameters from UNICODE to
ANSI when calling, and back to UNICODE when returning. If the function returns a
String, it undergoes the ANSI to UNICODE conversion process also. The callback
function receives the converted (ANSI) string, which can present problems. This
also applies to Strings in User-Defined types. There are several ways to deal
with this problem:

1. Use the StrConv() function in the callback function to do the appropriate
  conversions upon entry and exit.

2. Use Byte arrays. These don't undergo conversion.

3. Use Variant. These don't undergo conversion and can be used as function
  return, whereas Byte arrays cannot.

It is recommended that you use a Variant to pass strings as the most simple and
flexible option.

NOTE: You don't have to use the Callback2 function unless you return a Variant or
large User-Defined Type as the function result. Using Variants and User-defined
types as function arguments has no bearing on which DLL function to use in your
Declare statement.

Other Notes
-----------

In many cases, you can get similar functionality completely in BASIC by using a
SELECT CASE statement to call multiple implementations of the same prototype, or
by using callback objects. The main area where the all-BASIC solution won't
apply is using components that require calling back into your code and that need
to call a function rather than an object.
