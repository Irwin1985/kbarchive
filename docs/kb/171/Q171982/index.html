-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Page numbers in the table of contents may wrap to the next line if the text that
has been designated to be included in the table of contents contains tabs.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the TOC style used to create table of contents entries contains two
tab stops: one at .5-inch and another at the right margin. If the text that the
TOC entry is being created from contains more than .5-inches of text before it
reaches the tab, then the first tab in the text will cause the text after the
tab to appear at the right margin in the table of contents, and the page number
will wrap to the next line.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, in the table of contents entry, drag the .5-inch tab
marker to the desired location. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Position the insertion point on the line in the table of contents that is
  incorrectly formatted.

2. On the ruler, click on the .5-inch tab marker and drag it to the right until
  it is slightly beyond the text that is on the left side of the table of
  contents entry.

For example, if the document text that was tagged for a table of contents entry
is "INTRODUCTION &lt;tab&gt; DAY 1," drag the .5-inch tab to just beyond the
word INTRODUCTION (about 1.25 inches on the ruler). This should correct the
table of contents entry so that it resembles the following:

             tab                                                 tab
              |                                                   |
              |                                                   |
             \ /                                                 \ / 
              V                                                   V
0----------1----------2----------3----------4----------5----------6
INTRODUCTION-&gt;DAY 1...............................................1

Because the TOC styles of the table of contents entries are defined by default to
have "Automatically Update" enabled, changing one occurrence of the TOC style
will automatically change all occurrences of this style.

STATUS
======

This functionality is by design of Microsoft Word 97 and is different from
functionality in Microsoft Word 6.x and 7.x. In Microsoft Word 6.x and 7.x, tabs
in table of contents entries are replaced with a single space.

Microsoft Word 97 will retain the space in the table of contents entry, but it
may cause formatting problems in certain situations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example illustrates how this may happen.

Correct Formatting
------------------

If you enter the following text and format it with a style that you will base a
table of contents on (for example, Heading 1)

  INTRO &lt;tab&gt; DAY 1

and you then create a table of contents based on that (Heading 1 in this
example), the following may occur:

The TOC style of the table of contents will be formatted with a tab stop at
.5-inch and one at the right margin. If you formatted your document on
8.5-by-11-inch paper with 1.25-inch left and right margins, the ruler settings
will resemble the following example.

     tab                                                         tab
      |                                                           |
      |                                                           |
     \ /                                                         \ / 
      V                                                           V
0----------1----------2----------3----------4----------5----------6
INTRO-&gt;Day 1......................................................1

Incorrect Formatting
--------------------

If you enter the following text and format it with a style that you will base a
table of contents on (for example, Heading 1)

  INTRODUCTION &lt;tab&gt; DAY 1

and you then create a table of contents based on the style you used for the text,
the following may occur:

The TOC style of the table of contents will be formatted with a tab stop at
.5-inch and one at the right margin. If you format your document as 8.5-by-11
inches with 1.25 inch left and right margins, the ruler settings will look like
this:

     tab                                                         tab
      |                                                           |
      |                                                           |
     \ /                                                         \ / 
      V                                                           V
0----------1----------2----------3----------4----------5----------6
INTRODUCTION           --&gt;                                    DAY 1
......1

NOTE: Because the word "INTRODUCTION" is longer than .5-inch, the tab between
INTRODUCTION and DAY is moved to the next tab stop (at 6.0 inches), and the page
number wraps to the next line.
