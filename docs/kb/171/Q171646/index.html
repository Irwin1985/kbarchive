Page 29: Typographical error
----------------------------

Page 29, step 1:

Change:
"The record for the Winter Collection..."

To:
The record for the All Seasons Collection..."


Page 44-45: Screen shot will not match your computer screen
-----------------------------------------------------------

Page 44-45:

Screen shots printed in the book do not match end user screen due to
modifications that were made to the database in the previous lesson, Lesson 2,
on page 38. In Lesson 2 the Department Name "Acquisitions" was replaced with the
Department Name "Marketing". The screen shots in Lesson 3, on page 44-45 do not
reflect this change.


Page 58: Step 2, #4. Go to Order ID 406 results in error
--------------------------------------------------------

Page 58 - Step 2: Enter and Edit Data in Forms, Item #4

Instructions to "Go to Order ID 406", result in an error message when 406 is
entered into the Order ID.

Change:
"Go to Order ID 406."

To:
Go to Record 406


Page 59: Incorrect Filter Criteria
----------------------------------

Page 59, Step 4, item number 2:

Change:

  =&gt;#1/1/96#

To:

  Design." Creating a database is also discussed in Appendix A."

To:

  These factors are discussed in Appendix B, "Designing a Database." Creating a
  database is also discussed in Appendix B."


Pages 77 &amp; 84: Lookup Wizard Not Cited In Chapter
-------------------------------------------------

Pages 77 and 84 both make reference to a section in the same chapter regarding
the Lookup Wizard. However, the Lookup Wizard is not cited until pages 103-104.


Page 82: Incorrect Property Field Name
--------------------------------------

Page 82, change step 4 as follows:

From "...click in the Property field..."

To "...click in the Required property field..." (without the quotation marks)

Note the change in the capitalization of the word "property"

Page 82, change step 5 as follows:

From "Click the Property field down arrow, and then..."

To "Click the down arrow that appears, and then..." (without the quotation
marks)


Page 83: Carrier field is not in the order table
------------------------------------------------

On page 83, under step 3, the screenshot will not match your computer as the
Carrier column is displayed in spite of the fact that it is not in the Orders
table.


Page 99: Step 7 Specifies Date That Will Not Work In Exercise
-------------------------------------------------------------

Page 99, Step 7:

If you enter 11/30/98 in the Expiration Date field, you will not be able to save
the form and you will receive an error regarding the credit card being expired.

Replace the Expiration Date Value with the current date.


Page 113: Minor Text Correction
-------------------------------

Page 113, paragraph 1, sentence 1:

Change:
"You decide you would the like"

To:
"You decide you would like"


Page 130: Move last sentence in the second paragraph
----------------------------------------------------

On page 130, in the second paragraph, the last sentence implies that calulating
total values using a query, and using a query to answer a "what if" question,
will be addressed in Lesson 7.

This sentence needs to be moved as these topics are not addressed until Lesson
8.

Move this sentence to the end of the first paragraph on page 146 in Lesson 8:

  "You'll also calculate total values using a query, and you'll use a query to
  answer a "what if" question."


Page 157: Microsoft Chart should be Microsoft Graph
---------------------------------------------------

The "Important" note at the top of page 157 states that you must have Microsoft
Chart installed to complete the exercise. However, you need Microsoft Graph
installed to complete the exercise.

Correction:
-----------

Page 157, "Important" note:

Change text to read as follows:

  "To complete this exercise, you must have Microsoft Graph installed.
  Microsoft Graph is not included in the default installation. You can run the
  Microsoft Access Setup program or the Microsoft Office Professional setup
  program again and specify that you want to install the Microsoft Graph
  feature."" (without the quotation marks)


Page 161: The first sentence should say Database window
-------------------------------------------------------

On Page 161, the instructions in the first sentence, under "Do this", should
refer to the Database window, not the Design window.

Change:

  "In the Design window, click the Query tab, and click New."

To:

  " "In the Database window, click the Query tab, and click New." (without the
  quotation marks)


Page 169: Lesson Errors In Step 6
---------------------------------

On page 169 Step 6 is incorrect.

Change:
"Select the Text Option, click in the Blank field, and then type New Order"

To:
"Select the Text Option, and click Next. The Command Button Wizard opens the
final screen, which allows you to specify a name for the new command button"

Step 7 can be deleted and Step 8 should be re-numbered to be Step 7.

In performing this part of the exercise, the Command Button Wizard will accept
the text "View Order", but the wizard does not use this text to name the button.
The button continues to show the text: "Run Macro".


Page 174: Screen Shot May Not Match Your Computer Screen
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 174 the screen shot does not have the correct numerical statements.

They should be:

  Sales Total: 307.5
  Sales Average: 12.3
  Record 1 of 25
  Total Sales: $307.50
  Average Sales: $12.3

The Order Dates, Qty, Box Price, and Ext Price are the same as listed in the
screen capture.


Page 188: First paragraph should refer to Payroll form
------------------------------------------------------

On page 188, in the first paragraph there is a reference to the Presenting
Bonbons form, which should be changed to reference the Payroll form.

Change:

  You'll add an image control to the header to the Presenting Bonbons form,
  and...

To:

  "You'll add an image control to the header to the Payroll form, and..."
  (without the quotation marks)


Page 193: Step 6 is not necessary. Already in Design View
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 193, step 6 is not necessary as you should already be in Design View.


Page 198: Marginal note may not apply
-------------------------------------

On page 198, the marginal note at the top of the page may not apply. The Ask
About form and the macros Yes Button and No Button may be visible.

Change:

  "The Ask About form and the macros Yes Button and No Button are hidden
  objects in the database. To see them, click Options on the Tools menu and
  select the option to view the hidden objects."

To:

  " "The Ask About form and the macros Yes Button and No Button may not be
  visible in the database. To make them visible, click Options on the Tools
  menu and select the option to view the hidden objects." (without the
  quotation marks)


Page 219: Typographical error
-----------------------------

Page 219, Step 3, under "Create a new report based on a query" contains a
misspelled word.

Change Step 3:

  Click the Chose The Table Or Query Where The Object's Data Comes From down
  arrow, select...

To:

  Click the Choose The Table Or Query Where The Object's Data Comes From down
  arrow, select...


Minor text corrections
----------------------

Page 51, last sentence before step 1:

Change:
"...December 15, 1996..."

To:
"...November 15, 1996..."

Page 93, graphic:

Toolbox, click the Control Wizards tool to select it." (without the quotation
marks)

Page 93, In margin notes:

Add button image for Control Wizards tool (Wand with sparkles)

Page 100, bullet 3, sentence 2:

Change:"...if there are shipments assigned to that employee..."

To: "...if there are shipments assigned to that carrier..."

Page 148, step 3:

Change: "In the Customers table, drag the Country field..."

To: "In the Customers field list, drag the Country field..."

Page 160, column "Do This", paragraph 2:

Change: "...and drag the field from the table list to the Field row..."

To: "...and drag the field from the field list to the Field row..."

Page 171 steps 5 and 6:

Delete: "The Choose Builder dialog box appears."

Delete: "6 Click OK."

The corrected step 5 should be:

  " 5 Click the Build button to open the Expression Builder.

  The Expression Builder window includes an Expression box..." (without the
  quotation marks)

Page 172, step 9:

Change:

  Double-click on the Loaded Forms subfolder, and then double-click the Box
  Sales Subform subfolder.

To:

  Double-click on the Loaded Forms subfolder, then double-click the Box Sales
  subfolder, and then double-click the Box Sales Subform subfolder.

Page 172-173:

Renumber steps 7-12 to 6-11.

Page 173, step 1:

To: "Click the Label control..."


CD-ROM: Suppliers Table not included in Sweet Lil's database
------------------------------------------------------------

Several steps in this book ask you to manipulate and use the Suppliers table in
the Sweet Lil's database. However, the Suppliers table is not included in the
copy of the Sweet Lil's database that is distributed with this book.

This behavior is by design.

On page 65 in lesson 4, the text gives you steps for creating the Suppliers
Table, which you will use in future lessons. You must follow the steps on page
65 in order for future lessons involving the Suppliers Table to work correctly.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
