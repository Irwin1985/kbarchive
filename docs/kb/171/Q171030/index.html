The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when starting the Microsoft Exchange
or Microsoft Outlook client:

  Upload of offline changes could not be completed. You do not have
  sufficient permission to perform this operation on this object. See the
  folder contact or your system administrator.

In addition, you may receive the following error message while attempting to
synchronize offline folders:

  Synchronization with the offline folder file could not be completed. You
  do not have sufficient permission to perform this operation on this
  object.

In some cases, the All Folders and This Folder menu options may appear to be
disabled under Synchronize on the Tools menu.

CAUSE
=====

There are two possible causes of this behavior, both of which relate to older
versions of dynamic-link library (DLL) files on the system:

1. A Typical or Custom installation of Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Outlook
  97 was performed over a previous installation of the Microsoft Exchange 4.0
  client. In a Typical installation, the Microsoft Exchange Server Support
  component, which includes updated files, is not installed. It is also
  possible that this component may not be installed during a Custom
  installation, depending on whether the user selected that component.


2. Setup failed to update the appropriate files because the file dates were
  later than those being installed by the Setup program. This can occur in
  situations where the files were manually copied to the hard disk drive. This
  causes their creation date to be the date they were copied. Image installs
  are another possible reason for incorrect file dates.

WORKAROUND
==========

In either of these situations, you must update the appropriate version of the
DLL files in order to correct this behavior. The preferred method of updating
these files is to add the Microsoft Exchange Server Support component via the
Office 97 or Microsoft Outlook Setup program. This can be done with the
following steps.

NOTE: It may be necessary to rename the following files before continuing, so
that the Setup program is able to copy the newer versions to the Windows\System
folder:

- Emsabp32.dll

- Emsmdb32.dll

- Emsui32.dll

1. Run the Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Outlook 97 Setup program.

2. Choose the Add/Remove option.

3. If you are using the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, select the Microsoft
  Outlook component, and then click the Change Option button.

4. Enable the Microsoft Exchange Server Support component.

  NOTE: If it is already enabled, disable it, complete the Setup program, run
  Setup again, and add it back.

5. Complete the Microsoft Office or Microsoft Outlook Setup.

If the problem still occurs, you may need to remove and reinstall your Exchange
or Outlook client. Note that if Windows Messaging is currently installed on your
computer, you should remove it before reinstalling the Exchange or Outlook
client. To determine if Windows Messaging is installed, in Control Panel,
double-click Add/Remove Programs, and then view the list of installed programs.
