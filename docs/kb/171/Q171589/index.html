-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SMSRUN16 may appear to stop responding during Systems Management Server logon
server selection when underlying networking problems exist. There is no way to
stop SMSRUN16's server selection process.

CAUSE
=====

SMSRUN16 attempts to verify that at least one Systems Management Server logon
server is accessible to the current logged-on user. In Systems Management Server
1.2, SMSRUN16 attempts to connect to the server listed as the CurrentLogonServer
in the Sms.ini file. If this connection is unsuccessful, SMSRUN16 will try each
listed server in the [Servers] section of the Sms.ini file until it successfully
connects to a server or exhausts the list.

If networking problems exist or some of the logon servers are unavailable during
SMSRUN16's server selection process, the connection timeout, in conjunction with
the number of servers in the [Servers] section, may give the appearance that the
computer has stopped responding. However, control will be returned to the user
after SMSRUN16 has completed its server selection process.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the hotfix installed, if SMSRUN16's attempt to connect to the
CurrentLogonServer is not successful, a "Logon server not found" message box
appears. This message box asks:

  Continue looking for logon servers?

The user can click Yes to continue looking for logon servers or No to stop the
SMSRUN16 server selection process.

Additional query words: prodsms hang hung machine crash crashed
