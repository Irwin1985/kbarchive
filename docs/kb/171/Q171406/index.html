The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word 97 SR-1 allows you to use drive letter mappings and disable
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) by using the DontUseUNC registry switch.

There are many situations in which a network administrator may prefer to have
Word use a mapped drive letter rather than the UNC file location. For example,
Word returns a UNC file location similar to the following:

  \\ServerName\ShareName\FileName

However, when you use the DontUseUNC registry switch, Word returns a drive
mapping similar to the following:

  E:\ShareName\FileName

NOTE: The DontUseUNC switch does not work with earlier versions of Word. It only
works with Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 or later. The switch also does
not affect the Link field, the path to an attached Template, or the Visual Basic
Editor, which is a separate program. In the Visual Basic Editor, if a reference
is made to a template on a mapped network drive through the References command
on the Tools menu, it stores the path with the UNC information rather than with
a mapped drive letter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By design, when you save a document or change a setting to a location specified
with a drive letter, Microsoft Word converts the setting from a location
containing a logical drive letter to a UNC location. When you use the DontUseUNC
registry switch, the following new created/attached paths contain the logical
drive letter instead of using the UNC path:

- The FileName field when the \p switch is used.

- The IncludePicture field.

To add the DontUseUNC registry switch, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Change the Registry
-----------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

IMPORTANT: Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail, before you follow
these steps.

To change the DontUseUNC registry setting, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Options

4. Double-click the Options key.

  If an entry exists in the right pane named DontUseUNC, skip to step 7.

  NOTE: Use steps 5 through 6 only when you are adding the DontUseUNC option to
  the registry.

5. With the Options key selected, point to New on the Edit menu, and then click
  DWORD Value. This inserts a new option named New Value #1.

6. In the right pane of the Registry Editor window, do either of the following:

   - If New Value #1 is selected:

     a. Press DELETE on the keyboard to delete the option name New Value #1.

     b. Type "DontUseUNC" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

        This renames the new option to the correct DontUseUNC name.

-or-

   - If New Value #1 is not selected:

     a. Click to select New Value #1.

     b. On the Edit menu, click Rename.

     c. Type "DontUseUNC" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.
        This renames the new option to the correct DontUseUNC name.

7. With DontUseUNC selected, click Modify on the Edit menu.

8. In the Value Data box, type "1" (without the quotation marks).

  This setting disables the use of UNC and forces Word to use a logical drive
  letter.

  NOTE: Setting Value Data to 0 or deleting the DontUseUNC key resets Word to
  the default and allows it to resolve file locations using UNC.

Method 2: Use the RegOptions Macro
----------------------------------

The RegOptions macro is part of the Support8.dot template that ships with Word 97
SR-1 Enterprise Update. If you used the SR-1 Patch to update Word, you must
obtain the Support8.dot template separately.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q172527 How to Obtain Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1.

  Q172492 WD: Templates and Wizards Not Included with SR-1 Patch

To use the RegOptions macro, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Templates And Add-ins.

2. Click Add. Select the following folder:

  Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Macros

3. Select the Support8 template (Support8.dot). Click OK twice.

4. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

5. Click to select the RegOptions macro, and then click Run.

6. Click the Word 8.0 Options tab. Click to select DontUseUNC. In the Setting
  box, type "1" (without the quotation marks). Click OK.

7. Quit and restart Word.

When you reset Word to use UNC by changing the DontUseUNC value from 1 to 0, quit
all programs, restart Microsoft Windows, and then restart Word.
