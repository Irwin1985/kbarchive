The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A twinaxial connection goes to an Active state in SNA Server Manager after the
connection is started, but users are unable to get active APPC sessions on an
AS/400 through the twinaxial connection.

The System Operator Log (QSYSOPR) on the AS/400 may contain a message similar to
the following after the twinaxial connection on the SNA Server is activated:

  Message ID: CPI6002
  Message: Error detected during TDLC automatic configuration.
  Cause: Your session has ended because of an error found during the
  automatic configuration by twinaxial data link control (TDLC) for device
  &lt;device name&gt;. The device has been varied off.

NOTE: The System Operator Log on the AS/400 can be accessed by entering the
following command on an AS/400 command prompt:

  "DSPMSG QSYSOPR" (without the quotation marks)

The following event may also be logged in the Windows NT Application Event Log on
the SNA Server computer:

  Event ID: 96
  Description: Local APPC TP start failed:

  Primary_rc = F004
  Secondary_rc = 010000F0
  TP name = &lt;name of TP&gt;

This problem does not occur when you upgrade SNA Server 2.11 to SNA Server 3.0.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by the way SNA Server 3.0 saves the twinaxial connection
properties in the SNA Server configuration. The twinaxial connection is saved as
a Peer connection, as are all other connections to AS/400s. The problem is that
twinaxial connections are not saved with all of the connection properties that
other Peer connections include, such as Peer DLC Role and XID Type.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- Install SNA Server 2.11 and then upgrade to SNA Server 3.0 after getting the
  twinaxial connection to work under SNA Server 2.11.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


After you apply the updated binary file, do the following so the twinaxial
connection will successfully connect to the AS/400:

1. Stop and restart the SnaBase service.

2. Save the SNA Server configuration. If the Save option is greyed out in

SNA Server Manager, some kind of change will need to be made in the configuration
before the configuration can be saved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is that twinaxial connections are not saved with all of the
connection properties that other Peer connections include, such as Peer DLC Role
and XID Type. This results in an incorrect sequence when activating a twinaxial
connection, as shown below:

  SNA Server                Twinax Link Service
  ----------                -------------------
  Open Link Request   --&gt;
                     &lt;--    Open Link RSP OK
  Open Stat Request   --&gt;
                     &lt;--    Open Stat RSP OK
                     &lt;--    DLCST STCD
                     &lt;--    DLCST RQOS
  DLCST SXID          --&gt;
                     &lt;--    DLCST RQOS

In this sequence, the XID negotiation, shown as SXID and RQOS messages, is done
after the Station Contacted (DLCST STCD) message.

The correct sequence when activating a Peer connection is shown below:

  SNA Server                Twinax Link Service
  ----------                -------------------
  Open Link Request   --&gt;
                     &lt;--    Open Link RSP OK
                     &lt;--    DLCST RQOS
  DLCST SXID          --&gt;
                     &lt;--    DLCST RQOS
  DLCST SXID          --&gt;
                     &lt;--    DLCST RQOS
 Open Stat Request    --&gt;
                     &lt;--    Open Stat RSP OK
                     &lt;--    DLCST STCD

In the correct sequence, the XID negotiation occurs before the Open Station (Open
Stat) and Station Contacted messages.

SNA Server has been updated to correctly save the twinaxial connection with all
of the Peer connection properties and to do the XID negotiation before it does
the Open Station sequence.

In addition, the Twinaxial connection properties page will be updated to include
a System Identification page. This page will include configuration options for
the Local Node Name, Remote Node Name, XID Type, and Peer DLC Role.
