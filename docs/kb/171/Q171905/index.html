SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive the
following error message:

  Cannot establish modem connection.

CAUSE
=====

You can receive this error message for various possible reasons:

- your local telephone connection to MSN may be very busy

- possible problem with your local telephone service, such as line noise

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you may try connecting to MSN using a different primary
access number. To change your access number, follow these steps:

1. Close MSN. (Note: You cannot change your access number while you are still
  connected to MSN.)

2. Right-click the MSN icon on your computer desktop, and then click Connection
  Settings.

3. Select an access number by clicking the Phone Book button next to the Phone
  Number box.

4. In the Service Type box, select your service type, and then in the Country
  box, select your country.

5. In the State or Region box, select your state or region, and then in the
  Access Numbers box, select the number located nearest you.

6. Click OK, and then repeat steps 2-6 for your backup number.

7. Click OK until you return to your computer's desktop.

These changes will take effect the next time you log on to MSN. If the problem
persists after following these steps, contact your local telephone company and
request that they test your telephone line for line noise.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To find an access number that may work for you, go to the following link and
follow the directions: https://rac.msn.com/popcheck/
(https://rac.msn.com/popcheck/)

Please be aware of the following regarding MSN access numbers:

In some cases, MSN may not have a local MSN Internet access phone number that
serves your area. Before choosing your primary and backup numbers, you must
check with your local telephone company to find out which, if any, MSN Internet
access numbers provide local dialing and what applicable toll charges may be.

MSN accepts no responsibility for, nor has any control over, area code changes or
other changes made by the telecommunications companies, nor for any long
distance telephone charges incurred while connecting to MSN. When you are
notified that a new area code is being introduced in your area, it is your
responsibility to make the necessary changes in your MSN Settings to ensure that
you are dialing a local phone number when connecting to MSN (where available).
MSN maintains an updated phone directory of MSN access numbers, but will not
necessarily notify you of area code changes or other telephone company changes
that may affect you.
