Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00
and 7.10 provide sample User Interface (UI) Toolbox code written
mostly in BASIC, with a few sections written in assembler. The code is
written specifically for MS-DOS and does not support OS/2 unless the
code is modified.

The UI Toolbox uses three assembler routines to provide direct video
access to get a window (GetCopyBox), put a window (PutCopyBox), and
change the attributes of a window (AttrBox). These routines are
located in the UIASM.ASM source file. These three routines do not work
under OS/2 unless you modify them for OS/2 IOPL (Input Output
Privileges) support, or rewrite them in BASIC using OS/2 Video I/O
(VIO) API calls.

The following code example provides one way to replace these three
assembler routines with BASIC code utilizing the OS/2 VIO API Calls.

Since this code is written in BASIC, you will need to compile these
routines with the same options you use on the modules that call them.
These compiler options include near/far strings, protected mode, and
alternate/emulation math.

GetCopyBox, PutCopyBox, AttrBox are currently written in assembly
language (in UIASM.ASM on the 7.00 and 7.10 release disk) for greater
speed. The UIASM.BAS program below contains the equivalent BASIC
routines using OS/2 VIO API calls. Since the code is written in BASIC,
the speed may be notably slower compared to straight assembler code.
Also, the multitasking nature of OS/2 adds overhead compared to
running the same program under MS-DOS.

GetCopyBOX and PutCopyBox uses the MID$() statement and function to
modify the Screen Buffer variable to store and restore the screen
contents. An "Illegal Function Call" error may occur at run time if
the size of the window is zero (0) bytes.
