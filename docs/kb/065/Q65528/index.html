Under certain conditions, when invoking real-mode CodeView (CV) in
dual-monitor mode with /2, the mouse cursor appears on the wrong
monitor. When this occurs, a "sprite" mouse cursor appears on the
monitor that the application is to run on, while the secondary monitor
where CodeView is running does not have a mouse cursor. Several
workarounds to this problem are given below.

The sprite mouse cursor is a "graphic" arrow cursor similar to that in
Windows 3.00 or OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM), as opposed to the
traditional "text" block cursor that usually appears when running
CodeView or the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB).

The problem of the mouse appearing on the wrong monitor occurs only on
computers that have "extended register" video boards, such as some of
the Video 7 VGA cards. Certain mouse drivers enable the sprite cursor
when they detect these extended video registers. Because a monochrome
monitor cannot support this extended mode mouse cursor, the cursor
fails to switch to the secondary monitor when focus is switched to
that monitor after CodeView is invoked with the /2 switch.

The following are three possible workarounds to this problem:

1. Upgrade to mouse driver version 7.04 or later. This version
   provides a new switch, /Y, which can be used with either the
   MOUSE.COM program or the MOUSE.SYS device driver. The /Y switch
   tells the mouse driver to disable the sprite cursor. The mouse
   driver update can be obtained free of charge by contacting
   Microsoft Product Support Services at (206) 637-7096.

2. If a mouse driver earlier than version 7.04 is used, the problem
   may be worked around by creating a batch file or adding the
   following commands to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      mode mono
      mouse
      mode co80

   These commands will switch focus to the monochrome monitor while
   the mouse is being invoked and then will switch the focus back to
   the color monitor. This method will prevent the mouse driver from
   detecting the extended registers and using the sprite cursor.

3. Disable the extended video registers. Check the video card
   documentation to see if this method is possible with your
   particular card.
