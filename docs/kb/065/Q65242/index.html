Real-mode CodeView (CV) version 3.00 (shipped with Microsoft C 6.00)
may encounter problems on certain computers when extended memory is
utilized for debugging programs. These problems involve the processing
of interrupts while CodeView 3.00's internal DOS extender is being
used to run CodeView in protected mode in conjunction with HIMEM.SYS,
the extended memory (XMS) driver.

The problems manifest themselves in various ways, due to both the
varied interrupt handling speeds of different machines and the varied
interactions of CodeView itself running in protected mode while the
DOS program being debugged is still being run in real mode. The most
common error is a protection violation, which shows up in CodeView as
either a CV1319 error (internal error - unrecoverable fault) or as a
system hang. The errors usually occur when you are paging through the
code or manipulating the mouse.

Registered Microsoft C 6.00 owners who are experiencing any of these
problems with CodeView version 3.00 are encouraged to call Microsoft
Technical Support at (206) 637-7096 to obtain information concerning a
possible correction for these errors. However, there may be some cases
where the only solution is to obtain a newer computer BIOS or to use
CodeView without extended memory.
Most reported problems have involved IBM PS/2 computers, but a number
of these problems have also been reported on computers with an AMI
BIOS. Note that CodeView version 3.10 includes modifications that are
expected to eliminate most of these interrupt problems, but in some
instances (especially with older AMI BIOS machines), an update of the
BIOS may be the only solution.

The easiest workaround to these protected-mode errors is to start
CodeView without the use of extended memory. This can be done by
removing the line in CONFIG.SYS that loads the HIMEM.SYS driver (and
then rebooting the computer). Another option, if HIMEM is already
loaded, is to start CodeView with the /D command-line option to
specify explicitly that CodeView should use disk overlays, rather than
extended or expanded memory. (Otherwise, if extended memory is
available, CodeView will use the /X option by default.)

Because these problems can occur only when CodeView is running in
protected mode in extended memory, and because CodeView 3.00 requires
HIMEM.SYS in order to run in protected mode, the problems are often
mistakenly attributed to HIMEM.SYS. In reality, HIMEM.SYS is not
responsible for the errors because it is just the memory manager that
CodeView utilizes to get at extended memory. The errors are the result
of an interrupt handling incompatibility between certain hardware
configurations and the DOS extender built into CodeView.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView version 3.00.
This problem has been corrected in version 3.10.
