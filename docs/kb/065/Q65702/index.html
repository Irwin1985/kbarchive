Fatal error c1002 is produced when pass 2 of the compiler (C2.EXE) can
find no more memory available to store information that is needed to
continue compiling. This information typically consists of defined
variables, function names, and temporary information used when
evaluating complex expressions. Information used for optimizing may
even use dynamic memory, which can cause this error to occur.

One of the following may be a solution:

1. Divide the source file into smaller source files. This provides
   many advantages, including the following:

   a. It reduces compiling time for small changes in a program.

   b. It allows the functions to be separated from the program so they
      may be used by other programs.

   c. The .OBJs may be placed into a library.

   d. Placing code in separate files may aid in readability because
      the developer does not need to search through large files.

2. Break complex expressions into smaller subexpressions. Using
   temporary variables for intermediate assignments is an example.
   This can also help with program readability.

3. If using OS/2, recompile using the /B2 C2L.EXE option. This invokes
   the high-capacity compiler (C2L.EXE) on the second pass of the
   compiler. C2L.EXE may cause a longer compiling time and should not
   be used if not needed.

4. If running any TSRs (terminate-and-stay-resident programs) or
   device drivers, try removing these to free more memory. The
   compiler does not take advantage of extended or expanded memory, so
   try to free as much of the 640K conventional memory as possible.

5. If using NMAKE, MAKE, or other program building utilities, try
   compiling without them. These programs reside in memory when your
   compiler is invoked. If using DOS, try running NMK.COM rather than
   NMAKE.EXE. (Refer to the online help for differences between
   NMK.COM and NMAKE.EXE.)

6. Observe the compiling options. Change these to see if these have
   any affect. For example, disable optimizations with /Od if
   optimizing is currently enabled.
