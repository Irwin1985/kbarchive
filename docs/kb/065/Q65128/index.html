  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

This document provides a brief overview of the DOS Protected Mode Interface
(DPMI) version 0.9 and information on how to obtain a copy of the specification.
It also provides information on Microsoft Windows version 3.0 support for the
following:

- Applications that use DPMI functions whether or not the application is based
  on Windows

- MS-DOS interrupts and function requests under Windows in protected mode, and
  the degree to which they are supported

- NetBIOS in protected mode

DPMI enables MS-DOS-based applications to access the extended memory of PC
architecture computers while maintaining system protection. It also defines a
new interface, via software interrupt 31H, that protected-mode applications use
to do such things as allocate memory, modify descriptors, and call real-mode
software.

Throughout this document and the DPMI specification, the term "real-mode
software" is used to refer to code that runs in the low 1-megabyte address space
and uses segment:offset addressing. Under Windows version 3.0 in protected mode,
so-called real-mode software is actually executed in virtual 8086 mode. However,
since virtual 8086 mode is a very close approximation of real mode, both are
referred to as "real mode" in this document.

For further information on, or to request a copy of, the DPMI specification, call
Intel at (800) 548-4725.

=======================================================================
              APPLICATIONS THAT USE DPMI FUNCTIONS
=======================================================================

Windows version 3.0 running in 386 enhanced mode supports DPMI version
0.9. Windows version 3.0 running in standard mode supports a subset of
DPMI that enables applications to call Terminate-and-Stay-Resident
(TSR) programs and device drivers running in real (or virtual 8086)
mode. All code that calls DPMI directly should reside in a
Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) to ease the porting of the application to
other operating environments.

Windows-based applications should only call the following AX values for
DPMI version 0.9 functions:

  AX value       Description
  --------       -----------

  0200H          Get real mode interrupt vector
  0201H          Set real mode interrupt vector
  0300H          Simulate real mode interrupt
  0301H          Call real mode procedure with far return frame
  0302H          Call real mode procedure with Iret frame
  0303H          Allocate real mode call-back address
  0304H          Free real mode call-back address

NOTE: The table listed above differs from that in the printed copy of
the "Windows 3.00 Developer's Notes" and reflects corrections.

Windows-based applications should NOT use DPMI's MS-DOS memory management
functions. The Windows version 3.0 Kernel has two functions,
GlobalDOSAlloc() and GlobalDOSFree(), that should be used by Windows
applications and DLLs for allocating and freeing MS-DOS addressable
memory.

Other than those listed above, no DPMI functions are required for
Windows-based applications because the Kernel provides functions for
allocating memory, manipulating descriptors, and locking memory.
Applications not based on Windows that are running in 386 enhanced mode can
use all the DPMI version 0.9 functions, since they are not restricted by
the Kernel.

=======================================================================
           OTHER APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (APIs)
=======================================================================

In general, any software interrupt API that passes parameters in the
EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, and EBP registers will work as long as
none of the registers contains a selector value. In other words, if a
software interrupt API is completely register-based without any
pointers, segment registers, or stack parameters, that API should work
under Windows in protected mode.

More complex software interrupt APIs require the calling function to
use the DPMI translation functions.

=======================================================================
    SUPPORT FOR MS-DOS INTERRUPTS UNDER WINDOWS IN PROTECTED MODE
=======================================================================

This section discusses support for MS-DOS interrupts and function
requests made under Windows in protected mode. This discussion assumes
MS-DOS version 3.x or later is being used.

All the MS-DOS interrupts and function requests that are not mentioned
in this section should work exactly as documented in "The MS-DOS
Encyclopedia."

UNSUPPORTED MS-DOS INTERRUPTS AND FUNCTION REQUESTS
===================================================

The following MS-DOS interrupts are not supported in protected mode
and will fail if called.

  INT         Description
  ---         -----------

  20H         Terminate program
  25H         Absolute disk read
  26H         Absolute disk write
  27H         Terminate and stay resident

The following MS-DOS INT 21H function requests are also not supported
in protected mode.

  Function    Description
  --------    -----------

  00H         Terminate process
  0FH         Open file with FCB
  10H         Close file with FCB
  14H         Sequential read
  15H         Sequential write
  16H         Create file with FCB
  21H         Random read
  22H         Random write
  23H         Get file size
  24H         Set relative record
  27H         Random block read
  28H         Random block write
  67H         SetHandleCount

PARTIALLY SUPPORTED MS-DOS INT 21H FUNCTION REQUESTS
====================================================

The following MS-DOS INT 21H function requests behave differently in
protected mode than they do in real mode. To use these function
requests, the application might require additional code.

Functions 25H and 35H, Set/Get Interrupt Vector
-----------------------------------------------

These functions set and get the protected-mode interrupt vector. They
can be used to hook hardware interrupts, such as the timer or keyboard
interrupt, as well as to hook software interrupts. Except for INT 23H,
INT 24H, and INT 1CH, software interrupts that are issued in real mode
are not reflected to protected-mode interrupt handlers. However, all
hardware interrupts are reflected to protected-mode interrupt handlers
before being reflected to real mode.

Function 38H, Get Country Data
------------------------------

This function returns a 34-byte buffer containing a double word
(DWORD) call address at offset 12H that is used for case mapping. The
DWORD contains a real-mode address. In order to call the case mapping
function, the DPMI translation function to simulate a real-mode FAR
call must be used. See the DPMI specification for more details.

Function 44H, Subfunctions 02H, 03H, 04H, and 05H
-------------------------------------------------

These I/O control (IOCTL) subfunctions are used to receive data from a
device or send data to a device. Since it is not possible to break the
transfers automatically into small pieces, the caller should assume
that a transfer of greater than 4K will fail unless the address of the
buffer is in the low 1 megabyte range.

Function 44H, Subfunction 0CH
-----------------------------

Only the minor function codes 45H (Get Iteration Count) and 65H (Set
Iteration Count) are supported from protected mode. The extensions of
this IOCTL subfunction that are used for code-page switching (minor
function codes 4AH, 4CH, 4DH, 6AH, and 6BH) are not supported for
protected-mode programs. The DPMI translation functions must be used
if it is necessary to use this IOCTL subfunction to switch code pages.

Function 65H, Get Extended Country Information
----------------------------------------------

This function is supported for protected-mode programs. However, all
the DWORD parameters returned will contain real-mode addresses. This
means that the case-conversion procedure address and all the pointers
to tables will contain real-mode segment:offset addresses. The DPMI
translation functions must be used to call the case-conversion
procedure in real mode.

=======================================================================
                         NETBIOS SUPPORT
=======================================================================

Windows supports standard NetBIOS calls in protected mode. All the
network control blocks and buffers must reside in fixed memory that is
page locked. All code that calls NetBIOS directly should reside in a
DLL to ease the porting of the application to other operating
environments.

Additional information on NetBIOS and DPMI support in Windows network
drivers is available in Chapter 6, "Network Support," in the
"Microsoft Windows Device Driver Adaptation Guide," which is part of
the Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK). Additional
information can be found in the Windows developer's note titled
"Developing Network Applications for Windows 3.00," available as
article Q65125.
