The graphics GET and PUT statements cannot be used to store or draw
text screens in SCREEN mode 0 (zero). Therefore, it is necessary to go
directly to video memory, using the BSAVE and BLOAD statements, in
order to store and draw text mode (SCREEN 0) screens. This article
gives an explanation and an example of BSAVEing and BLOADing all eight
of the text mode SCREEN pages available on 256K EGA and VGA graphics
adapters. The code can be easily adapted for the number of video pages
supported by any adapter.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 2.00, 2.01,
3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS; to Microsoft BASIC Compiler
versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS; and to Microsoft BASIC
Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for
MS-DOS.

In text mode, the video pages, sometimes called video buffers, are
stored starting at address B800:0000 hex, where the portion before the
colon is the segment and the portion after is the offset. Each video
page buffer starts on a 4K boundary (or every &amp;H1000 bytes = 1000 hex
= 4096 decimal). Therefore, saving video pages is a straightforward
process of changing to segment &amp;HB800, starting at an offset of n*4096
(&amp;H1000) bytes for each nth page, and BSAVEing 4K of memory to a file.
Note that you count pages from 0. Therefore, page 0 is at offset 0 *
4096, or offset 0, from segment B800 hex, so you start saving at
address B800:0000. To change the segment pointer used by the BSAVE
statement in BASIC, use the DEF SEG statement. Because the BSAVE
statement has an "offset" parameter, it is simple to save multiple
pages by changing the offset parameter in the BSAVE statement with the
formula PageN%*4096, where PageN% is the current page (counting from
zero) being saved.

For more information about graphics programming and video page
buffers, see Chapter 3 of "Programmer's Guide to PC and PS/2 Video
Systems" by Richard Wilton (Microsoft Press, 1987).

Documentation Error
-------------------

Wilton's book (mentioned above) contains a documentation error on Page
75 when discussing video pages. It incorrectly states the following:

   ...each page starts on a 1 KB (1024-byte) boundary

This should be corrected to say:

   ...each page starts on a 4 KB (4096-byte) boundary.

Note that Wilton's book uses "KB" as an abbreviation for kilobyte
(1024 bytes), whereas this Knowledge Base uses "K".

The next sentence in Wilton's book correctly states the following:

   The four 80-by-25 pages thus start at B800:0000, B800:1000,
   B800:2000, and B800:3000.

Code Example
------------

The SLEEP statement in the following program should be replaced with
the statement INPUT X$ in order to run in QuickBASIC 2.00, 2.01, 3.00,
or 4.00. (The SLEEP statement was first introduced in QuickBASIC 4.00b
and BASIC compiler 6.00.)

FOR i% = 0 TO 7 ' If your EGA only supports 4 pages, use 3, not 7.
  SCREEN 0, 0, i%, i% ' Initialize each screen page.
  CLS
NEXT

FOR i% = 0 TO 7 ' If your EGA only supports 4 pages, use 3, not 7.
   SCREEN 0, , i%, i% ' Cycle through the pages and write chars.
   FOR j% = 1 TO 2000
     PRINT CHR$(i% + 127); ' Print some colorful characters.
     COLOR j% MOD 16
   NEXT j%
   filename$ = "page" + CHR$(i% + &amp;H31) + ".pic"
   DEF SEG = &amp;HB800 ' Change segment to video memory.
   BSAVE filename$, i% * &amp;H1000, &amp;H1000 ' Save the i%-th page.
   DEF SEG ' Important: Move back to the default data segment!
   LOCATE 10, 10: COLOR 23: PRINT "Hit any key for next page"
   SLEEP
NEXT

WHILE INKEY$ &lt;&gt; "": WEND

FOR i% = 0 TO 7 ' If your EGA only supports 4 pages, use 3, not 7.
   SCREEN 0, 0, i%, i%
   CLS
   COLOR 7
   PRINT "hit any key to restore page "; i%;
   SLEEP: WHILE INKEY$ &lt;&gt; "": WEND
   filename$ = "page" + CHR$(i% + &amp;H31) + ".pic"
   DEF SEG = &amp;HB800
   BLOAD filename$, i% * &amp;H1000
   DEF SEG
   SLEEP
NEXT i%

SCREEN 0, 0, 0, 0 ' Clean up before ending
KILL "page?.pic"  ' and kill the picture files.
END
