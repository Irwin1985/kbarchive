SUMMARY
=======

Many options exist to control access to resources in the NetWare environment.
The part of NetWare security used most often is trustee rights. A trustee
assignment is created by giving certain rights to a user in a file server
directory. It is through these trustee assignments that users are granted access
to programs and data on the file server.

Trustee rights consist of both rights assigned to individuals at the user level
and rights assigned to groups as a whole. For instance, Read, Open, and Search
rights may be assigned at the group level for a certain directory. However, it
may be appropriate to grant only one individual in the group Write privileges,
which can be assigned at the user level. The only rights that need to be
assigned at the user level are any that are in addition to those rights assigned
at the group level.

NOTE: Once a trustee assignment is granted, it includes all subdirectories
beneath the subject directory. For instance, if the Read privilege is granted in
the SYS:PUBLIC directory, that Read privilege is automatically granted in the
SYS:PUBLIC\UTILS directory.

Various combinations of the basic NetWare/286 (and earlier) rights -- Read,
Write, Open, Create, Delete, Parental, Search, and Modify, which are shown as
[RWOCDPSM] -- provide a flexible means of defining the security of a LAN.

Windows requires certain rights for setup to complete Setup /N.

For more information about these requirements and explanation of symptoms, query

MORE INFORMATION
================

Assignment of rights can take two approaches, as follows:

The Trustee Approach
--------------------

With the trustee approach, rights are granted to users at the user or group
level, using the SYSCON utility (or MAKEUSER).

The Directory Approach
----------------------

With the directory approach, trustees are assigned on a directory-by-directory
basis, using the FILER utility.

The trustee privileges are stored in a hidden system file called DIRSTAMP.SYS.
