When viewing memory in byte format in a memory window in CodeView
version 3.00 or 3.10, you cannot change the value of a byte in memory
to the hexadecimal value 2E. The hex value 2E has an ASCII character
equivalent of the period ("."). In CodeView, a period is used to
display any nondisplayable character (for example, null, a carriage
return, control characters, etc.), which means the period character
can sometimes have special meaning to CodeView when it appears in a
memory window.

Because of the special usage of the period character in a memory
window, CodeView does not allow periods to be typed directly into
memory. In CodeView 3.00, attempts to change a byte value to 2E
results in either the 2 or the E being entered and the other digit
being ignored, depending on which value you enter first. In CodeView
3.10, both the 2 and the E are returned to their original values once
they have both been entered. If you move to the right side of the
memory window where the ASCII equivalents are shown and you try to
type in a period there, CodeView will also ignore that input.

If you switch the memory window so that you are viewing memory in
ASCII mode, actual periods can be typed in to any memory location.
However, there is a problem with this because ALL other periods on the
same line, which really represent various nondisplayable ASCII
characters, are all converted to 2Es.

If you use are viewing memory in a format other than bytes or ASCII,
CodeView will allow a 2E to be entered. The workaround, then, if a
period needs to be entered into memory, is to choose a different
viewing mode other than ASCII or byte-mode, and then enter the period
in the desired location as the value 2E. You can cycle through the
available memory viewing modes by repeatedly pressing SHIFT+F3, or you
can select the desired mode from the Memory Window option on the
Options menu.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CodeView versions 3.00
and 3.10. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.
