-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Win32 CPIC application is supporting multiple conversations using
non-blocking mode, the application may stop unexpectedly while issuing a new
CMINIT (Initialize_Conversation).

CAUSE
=====

Under certain circumstances, the Win32 CPIC and APPC libraries can get into a
deadlock condition. Note that the CPIC library (Wcpic32.dll) communicates
through the APPC library (Wappc32.dll). The deadlock can occur under the
following circumstances:

- When CMINIT issues a TP_STARTED while holding an internal CPIC critical
  section. If another APPC verb completes asynchronously while the TP_STARTED
  is running, the CPIC application may deadlock.


- When the CPIC library calls into WinAPPCCancelConversation() while holding
  the internal CPIC critical section. The thread that makes this call
  immediately blocks while trying to obtain the APPC critical section, which is
  held by the APPC callback thread, which is waiting for CPIC lock.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
