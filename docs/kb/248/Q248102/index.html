SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or later to your computer running
Windows NT 4.0 Server, Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, Windows NT 4.0 Server
Enterprise Edition, or Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, you may not be
able to uninstall the service pack.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the service pack has been applied more than once.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you apply Service Pack 4 to a Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3-based computer,
all of the files to be overwritten by Service Pack 4 are copied to an uninstall
folder. At this point, the uninstall folder contains the files needed to
uninstall Service Pack 4, and restore the computer to the state it was in before
the application of the service pack. This uninstall folder includes Service Pack
3 files and any hotfixes that are replaced by Service Pack 4.

If Service Pack 4 is applied to the computer a second time, and the uninstall
option is selected, the uninstall folder is overwritten with Service Pack 4
files. Because the computer already has Service Pack 4 applied, the files copied
to the uninstall folder are Service Pack 4 files, and the ability to restore the
computer to Service Pack 3 is lost.

To avoid this situation:

- Make a full system backup before you apply any service pack.

- If you must re-apply a service pack, do not create an uninstall folder.

- Always read any Readme.txt files associated with the service pack, and make
  sure you understand the information completely before you apply the service
  pack to your computer.

A computer experiencing this issue has the option to uninstall the service pack
in the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel, and the uninstallation process
will appear to work. However, the uninstallation process is restoring the same
files that are currently installed on the computer. Even though the
uninstallation appears to work, the blue operating system Loader screen that is
displayed at system startup will indicate which service pack has been applied to
your computer. In this case, the applied service pack number will not decrement
after the uninstallation is performed.

Attempting to "manually" uninstall a service pack by manually copying files from
a prior service pack to your computer is not recommended and is not supported by
Microsoft. Attempting to manually uninstall a service pack can cause
unpredictable system behavior, including the inability to start the computer. If
a backup is not available and the files in the uninstall folder have been
overwritten, it is not possible to revert to a previous service pack.
