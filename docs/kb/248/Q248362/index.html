-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A client that is running Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 may seem
to stop responding (hang) for up to two minutes. This behavior occurs only on
some portable computers on which the floppy disk drive is not connected to the
computer during hardware inventory.

CAUSE
=====

During Systems Management Server (SMS) hardware inventory, the Win32_Logicaldisk
WMI class is enumerated to return logical disk information for removable disk
drives, CD-ROM drives, hard disks, and connected network drives. On some types
of portable computers, you can remove the floppy disk drive, but the computer's
BIOS still registers (or "spoofs") its existence. In Windows 95/Windows 98, the
floppy disk drive icon still appears in My Computer when no device is actually
attached. Opening the disk drive icon also causes the symptom described in this
article to occur until the device times out.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, disable the enumeration of the Win32_LogicalDisk
class in the Sms_def.mof file for the site. For information about how to do
this, see chapter 10 of the Microsoft Systems Management Server Administrator's
Guide.

NOTE: If you have applied the hotfix that is described in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article, the Win32_LogicalDisk class has been replaced by
SMS_LogicalDisk:

  Q232653 SMSCliToknAcct Locked Out When Hardware Inventory Is Enabled

Follow the same steps as described in chapter 10 of the Administrator's Guide to
disabled enumeration of the SMS_LogicalDisk class.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue can occur on certain portable computer models that contain removable
floppy disk drives. Portable computers that are known to exhibit this behavior
include:

- Hewlett-Packard OmniBook 3000
- Toshiba 700 Series

Any portable computer that "spoofs" the existence of a removed floppy disk drive
is liable to exhibit the same behavior.

NOTE: This hotfix is dependent on the installation of either of the SMS 2.0
hotfixes described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:

  Q232653 SMSCliToknAcct Locked Out When Hardware Inventory Is Enabled

  Q246527 Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1 Client Hotfix

Hotfix Installation
-------------------

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the Systems Management
Server site server.

Using the SMS Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel platform site servers

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network (for example, the
  Q248362.exe file is located in a root folder with I386 and Alpha subfolders).
  Q248362.exe is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files
  on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

3. Run Q248362.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

Manual Installation:

1. Stop all SMS services.

2. Copy the updated Inhinv32.exe file to the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Hinv\&lt;Platform&gt; folder to replace the existing
  file for that platform.

3. Copy Compver1098.ini file from the platform folder to the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Hinv folder, renaming it to Compver.ini. This
  replaces the existing Compver.ini file.

4. Restart all SMS services.
