SYMPTOMS
========

On a shared computer, it may be possible for a user to create a folder in the
%SystemRoot\Recycler folder that is then assigned to another user based on the
Security Identifier (SID) number. If you do this, a malicious user may assign
themselves extended rights to the newly created Recycle Bin folder before it is
assigned to another user.

This allows someone the ability to insert files into a user's Recycle Bin or
permanently delete a user's files located in that specific Recycle Bin.

This vulnerability does not allow the malicious user to read the files in the
Recycle Bin folder.

NOTE: This patch does not apply to computer's that use FAT partitions because
disk security features cannot be enabled on these computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the individual package referenced below or obtain
the Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup Package. For additional information on the
SRP, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

NOTE: This patch only applies to Internet Explorer 4.0 without Active Desktop
enabled. If you apply this patch to a computer running IE 4.0 with Active
Desktop enabled, it will appear that the patch installed correctly; however,

  Package

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of
security vulnerability in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Recycle Bin for a user maps to a folder in %SystemRoot%\Recycler.
The name of the folder is based on the owner's SID. The folder is created the
first time the user deletes a file, and the owner is given the only permissions
to it. However, if a malicious user can create the folder before the real one is
created, that user could assign permissions that give them the ability to delete
files from it or add files to it.

There are several significant limitations that make it extremely difficult to
exploit this vulnerability. The malicious user would need to share a machine
with the other user, and would need to create the bogus Recycle Bin before the
user's bona fide folder were created. This vulnerability only enables the
malicious user to take action against the Recycle Bin on the particular machine
that is attacked. The vulnerability does not allow the malicious user to read
any files in the other user's Recycle Bin, nor would it give him or her a means
of inducing the other user to retrieve a bogus file from it.
