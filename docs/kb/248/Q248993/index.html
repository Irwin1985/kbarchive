  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Performance Monitor tool (or System Monitor Microsoft Management
Console [MMC] snap-in) a performance object may unexpectedly fail to appear in
the Performance Object drop-down list box in the Add To Chart dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

The problem may occur because the extensible performance DLL is marked as
"disabled".

RESOLUTION
==========

The object may be reenabled by setting the "Disable Performance Counters"
registry value in the Performance subkey of the supported service for the
extension.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In versions of Windows NT prior to Windows 2000, one bad or defective
performance DLL is able to render the performance monitoring features of the
operating system inoperative. To maintain the integrity of the performance data
and to improve reliability, the performance library of Windows 2000 disables any
performance DLL that returns data in the incorrect format, causes an unhandled
program fault, or takes too long to return the performance data (this is usually
the cause of a library being disabled).

When a performance extension DLL is disabled, the performance counters provided
by that DLL are not available through Performance Monitor or the Performance
Data Helper API. Disabled DLLs are not reloaded when the system is restarted.

If a performance extension DLL becomes disabled unexpectedly, check the
application event log for event 1017 or 1018 (the "disable" events) posted by
the Perflib source. Then look for other events posted by Perflib that will give
the reasons why the system disabled the extension. These events should be noted
if you need to call technical support.

You can try reenabling the extension DLL. If the problem persists (that is, the
system disables it again) you should contact the vendor of the extension. If the
object is a Windows 2000 system object (such as the Process object) contact
Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS).

To reenable an extension DLL, Microsoft recommends that you use the ExCtrlList
utility from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit. Alternatively, you can use the
Registry editor tool (Regedit.exe) that ships with Windows 2000.

Reenabling an Extension by Using ExCtrlLst:

1. Start Exctrlst.exe. This is a tool from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.

2. Select the first item in the Extensible Performance Counters list box.

3. Inspect the Performance Counters Enabled checkbox that appears just below the
  list box. If the checkbox is selected, the counter is enabled. If it is
  cleared, then select the checkbox to reenable it.

4. Select the next item in the Extensible Performance Counters list box and
  repeat the previous two steps until all items have the Performance Counters
  Enabled checkbox selected.

Reenabling an Extension by Using Regedit.exe:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Regedit.exe. (You cannot use Regedt32.exe because it does not allow
  searching for registry values.)

2. Click to select the following key

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

3. Select Find from the Edit menu.

4. In the Find What field, type "Disable Performance Counters" (without the
  quotation marks).

5. Click Find Next. This will locate a Performance key that may have this
  Registry value set to 1.

6. If the Registry value is set to 1, set the value to 0 or delete the Registry
  value.

7. Press F3 to find the next occurrence of this Registry value.

8. Repeat the previous two steps until there are no Performance keys that have
  the Disable Performance Counters value set to 1.

NOTE: Often the "Disable Performance Counters" value does not appear in the
registry. The value can be created and given a DWORD value of 1 to disable
counters.
