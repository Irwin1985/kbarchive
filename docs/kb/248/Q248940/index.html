-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the content of the Microsoft Year 2000 Resource CD-ROM, the
Setup.exe file may not be available in the root of the file list.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because of a documentation error on the Microsoft Year 2000
Resource CD-ROM cover. The following text is the incorrect message on the
cover:

  For Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, or Windows NT
  Workstation 3.51:

- Insert the Year 2000 Resource CD into the CD-ROM drive and start Windows File
  Manager.
- In File Manager, select the CD-ROM drive, double-click SETUP.EXE, and follow
  the instructions that appear on your screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, obtain the November 1999 version of the Year 2000
Resource CD-ROM by calling 1-888-MSFT-Y2K. If you are using the November CD-ROM
on a 16-bit operating system from Microsoft (Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.11) you will be able to take advantage of:

- You can obtain access to a static version of the Microsoft Year 2000 Web site
  content available at the time this CD-ROM was produced.

- Year 2000 Updates for File Manager (Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups
  3.11). For additional information about this topic, click the article number
  below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q85557 File Manager Shows Garbled Date for Year 2000 or Later

  . To install this update, view the following "Installing Windows 3.1 and
  Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Updates from the November CD-ROM" section.

- A "minimum" version of the 16-bit Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser
  program. This browser is made available to you in case you don't already have
  a browser on your system. A browser is necessary to view the CD version of
  the Microsoft Year 2000 Web Site.

To work around this problem if you have access to the Internet, view the
following Microsoft Web site to obtain year 2000 information, updates, and
downloads for the products listed at the beginning of this article:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k

IMPORTANT: Versions of the Year 2000 Resource CD-ROM prior to November did not
include the File Manager updates for Windows 3.1x or Windows for Workgroups
3.1x, and versions of the CD-ROM prior to August did not include a minimum
version of the 16-bit Internet Explorer browser. Also, note that the 16bit.txt
file in the root folder of the November CD-ROM refers to a "Microsoft Outlook
Express 5.0 Year 2000 Update" for 16-bit (q237823.exe). This update is not
included on the November CD-ROM. To work around this problem if you have access
to the Internet, refer to the following Microsoft Web site to obtain year 2000
information, updates, and downloads for 16-bit versions of Outlook Express 5:

  computer.

  drive C. For example, c:\Y2K.

  c:\Y2K.

3. In File Manager, double-click the W31filup.exe file in the c:\Y2K folder to
  expand the Winfile.exe file.
