-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a cluster host with a single network adapter, the transmission of Internet
Protocol (IP) packets for outbound connections (for example, to a back end
database) may appear to be paced at 16-millisecond intervals. This may affect
the performance of a Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS) cluster, and the
problem may be especially noticeable under low loads.

If you disable WLBS the time delay is not improved. If you uninstall WLBS, the
problem is resolved.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of an interaction failure between WLBS and Network
Driver Interface Specification (NDIS).

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:
