-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you review the Event Viewer application log for Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 Service Pack 1, you notice that the message transfer agent (MTA) is logging
Event ID 9318 at random intervals. The entry is similar to the following
example, though the index and Microsoft Windows NT error code numbers vary:

  Event ID: 9318
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Warning
  Category: Interface
  Description: An RPC communications error occurred. Unable to bind over RPC.
  The locality table (LTAB) index is 76. Windows NT error code: XXXX. [BASE IL
  MAIN BASE 1 500] (12)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you have more than one server in a site, but the
servers are connected across a wide area network (WAN) rather than a local area
network (LAN). Event Viewer logs this event when WAN traffic is heavy or when
network connectivity is unstable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open the MTA Site Configuration Properties dialog box, and then click the
  Messaging Defaults tab.

2. Type "15" (without the quotation marks) in the Checkpoint Size (K) box.

3. Type "90" (without the quotation marks) in the Recovery Timeout (sec) box.

4. Type "3" (without the quotation marks) in the Window Size box.

NOTE: If most of the WAN is regularly experiencing heavy traffic, this workaround
may not completely alleviate the problem. It may be necessary to redesign the
Exchange Server organization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Checkpoints are markers for data transmission. The checkpoint size is the amount
of data that is to be transferred before a checkpoint. If a transmission error
occurs and the message must be transferred again, the transfer can resume from
the most recent checkpoint. The default checkpoint amount is 30 kilobytes.

The recovery timeout setting is used for specifying the amount of time after a
transmission error occurs that the MTA waits for a connection before deleting
all checkpoints and restarting the transfer from the beginning. The default time
is 60 seconds.

The window size indicates the number of checkpoints that can go unacknowledged
before data transfer is suspended. The window size determines the amount of
resources that are set aside for the receiving station. It is only useful to set
a window size when the checkpoint size is set to something greater than zero.
The default window size is 5.
