SUMMARY
=======

To fully optimize your queries, it is necessary to add index tags matching the
WHERE and JOIN clauses. In addition, if you have SET DELETED ON, you must have
an index on DELETED() to fully optimize your query. However, creating the
indexes required for a SELECT to be fully optimized might not improve query
performance, and might actually hinder it in some cases.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a query to be optimized, the SELECT statement must have a WHERE clause. The
expression on the left of the equal sign must match an index expression exactly.
For example, if the clause is WHERE UPPER(cName) = &lt;some value&gt;, you must
have an index with an expression of UPPER(cName) for Rushmore to optimize the
query.

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, Microsoft introduced the SYS(3054) function to report the
Rushmore optimization level of SELECT statements. If the SELECT statement's
WHERE clause is performing a join (... WHERE tableA.keyValue = tableB.keyValue),
or the SELECT uses the JOIN syntax, this displays differently than a filtering
WHERE clause. If the join is optimized, it says, "Joining tableA and tableB
using index tag &lt;tag&gt;." Otherwise, it says, "...using temp index."

NOTE: Optimization does not always mean faster performance than non-optimization.
You must test on a query-by-query basis.

The following sample code demonstrates this. It uses the testdata database in the
Samples directory.

  SET DELETED OFF
  CLEAR
  *!* VFP 3.0 and 5.0
  *!* CD HOME() + 'samples\data'
  *!* VFP 6.0
  CD HOME(2) + 'data'  &amp;&amp; Tools:Options:File Locations:Samples directory must
                       &amp;&amp; be set for HOME(2) to work.

  = SYS(3054, 11)  &amp;&amp; Display optimization information for joins in VFP 5     
                   &amp;&amp; and later. In VFP 3.0, this function will be ignored.

  ? "Query 1:"
  lnStart = SECONDS()
  SELECT orders.* ;
      FROM orders, customer ;
      WHERE orders.cust_id = customer.cust_id ;
      INTO CURSOR crsrTemp
  *!* Under VFP 5.0 and above, the preceding statement could be written as:
  *!* SELECT * ;
  *!*    FROM orders JOIN customer ;
  *!*        ON orders.cust_id = customer.cust_id ;
  *!*    INTO CURSOR crsrTemp

  ? SECONDS() - lnStart, _TALLY
  ?

  ? "Query 2:"
  lnStart = SECONDS()
  SELECT orders.* ;
      FROM orders, customer ;
      WHERE orders.cust_id = customer.cust_id ;
        AND customer.cust_id = "BONAP" ;
      INTO CURSOR crsrTemp

  ? SECONDS() - lnStart, _TALLY
  ?

  ? "Query 3:"
  lnStart = SECONDS()
  SELECT orders.* ;
      FROM orders, customer ;
      WHERE orders.cust_id = customer.cust_id ;
        AND customer.cust_id = "BONAP" ;
        AND orders.order_id &gt; ' 10000' ;
      INTO CURSOR crsrTemp

  ? SECONDS() - lnStart, _TALLY

The first query returns all of the records from orders. Execution time is ~.017
seconds on a particular test computer. Neither table reports as optimized, since
the WHERE clause does not filter either table. The join is optimized.

The second query returns 19 records from orders. Execution time is ~.005 seconds
on the same computer. The customer table reports as optimized, because the WHERE
clause has a filter that matches an index expression in the table. The order
table is not optimized, but the join is, as in the first query.

The third query returns 19 records from orders. Execution time is also ~.005
seconds on the same computer. Both the orders and customer tables report as
optimized, as well as the join. Note that although this query is fully
optimized, the execution time is the same as in the second query.

If you run the above code example with SET DELETED ON, each query that was fully
optimized is now partially optimized. However, the execution times are the
same.

It is usually better for performance not to create a DELETED() tag, even though
it causes the query to be only partially optimized if SET DELETED is ON. The
reason for this behavior is that if you are operating over a network and few
records are deleted, bringing the DELETED() tag over the wire can take a
non-negligible amount of time for very little gain when compared to just testing
the deleted status of the fewer records in the result set.

When writing queries, you should:

- Avoid unnecessary joins.
- Make sure your joins are optimized.
- Add index tags for frequently-used non-join WHERE condition expressions. You
  won't usually get any performance gain from indexes on 1-byte or logical
  fields, or DELETED(), even though this may change the optimization level from
  partial to full.
- Test, test, and test to make sure you have what you need for indexes. If you
  get equal performance with and without an index tag, and you don't need the
  tag for SEEKs or ordering, don't create it.

A technique you can use in Visual FoxPro 5.0 or later to isolate performance
bottlenecks is to create a coverage log with SET COVERAGE. Visual FoxPro 6.0
adds the Coverage Profiler, which assists in analyzing the coverage results. You
should focus on all slow code sections, not just SELECTs, to improve their
performance.
