-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), you may not be able to open some
public folders, and the following error message may be displayed:

  collaboration data objects error " 000043ed" the client operation failed.
  [microsoft exchange server information store - [E_FAIL (80004005) ]]

Using the Interorg Replication utility created all of the public folders, and you
can open all of the public folders by using a MAPI client. If you try to move
these folders or copy them to a .pst file, the following error message is
displayed:

  The operation failed.

The Isinteg utility reports a large number of warnings. The Isinteg utility
cannot fix these warnings.

CAUSE
=====

The warnings from the Isinteg utility are specific to certain folders. Start the
Mdbvu32.exe program and check the MAPI properties of one of them. These public
folders retain all of their properties, but the properties list is not
retrievable, so the MAPI properties are not available (a blank property page is
displayed).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q244976 XADM: Event ID 1197 and 1005 When Starting the Information Store

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a tool to automatically move all of the public folders to a .pst file.
Delete the folders from the public folders, and then move the folders back to
the public folders from the .pst file. You can restore permissions and replicas
with the PFInfo and PFAdmin tools.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the fix is applied, if you run the isinteg -pub -fix -detailed -verbose -l
fix.log -test fldprops command, it fixes all of the necessary folders by
deleting the invalid MAPI properties.

The fldprops switch is a new test that has been added to the Isinteg.exe tool,
and it is only available with the -pub switch.

After you run this command, you can see all of the public folder contents when
you use OWA. This fix includes a Store.exe file that prevents the setting of
these properties and an Isinteg utility that can fix the issue.

The NULL properties are removed from customer databases if you use the new
Isinteg tool. It works with either the fldprops, allfoldertests, or alltests
switch.
