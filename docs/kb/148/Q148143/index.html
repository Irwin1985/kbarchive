SUMMARY
=======

The following article contains a copy of the Microsoft Wine Guide ReadMe file
located on the Wine Guide for the Macintosh compact disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

7. TROUBLESHOOTING
  - How to solve problems with certain system configurations.

-------------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING MICROSOFT WINE GUIDE
-------------------------------------------------------

To run Microsoft Wine Guide you need:

- Any Macintosh computer that supports a 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch)
  or higher resolution monitor
- System 7.0 or later
- 5 MB of random-access memory (RAM)
- At least 1 MB of available hard disk space
- A single-speed (150 KB/sec) CD-ROM drive or better

The Installer on the CD will add any necessary files to your System
Folder. It will also copy the Wine Guide program to a folder titled
"Microsoft Wine Guide" on your hard disk; this makes the program load
a little faster when you start it. The sounds and images remain on the
CD, so you will still need to insert the CD to run Wine Guide.

You can run Microsoft Wine Guide directly from the CD. However, to
play the movies and hear the sounds, QuickTime 1.6 or later must be
installed in your System Folder. If Wine Guide can't find these
critical files, it will prompt you to run the Installer. You can also
install QuickTime manually by dragging the files from the System Files
folder on the CD onto your System Folder icon.

-------------
2. MEMORY USE
-------------

Microsoft Wine Guide should run on any Macintosh with 5 MB of RAM.
However, if 3,200K of memory is not free when you launch the Microsoft
Wine Guide, a warning message may be displayed indicating there is
insufficient memory available.

Most users with 5 MB of RAM will not experience problems, but if your
system software takes up more than about 2 MB you may need to adjust
memory usage to make Microsoft Wine Guide run properly. Some general
suggestions follow:

- Run only one application at a time. If other applications are
  running, close them before re-launching Microsoft Wine Guide.

- Check the amount of memory being used by your system software. To
  do this, return to the Finder and select About This Macintosh...
  from the Apple menu at the top left corner of your screen. The
  Largest Unused Block needs to be greater than 3,200K to run
  Microsoft Wine Guide. If the only item listed in the About This
  Macintosh dialog is System Software, and the Largest Unused Block
  is less than 3,200K, you need to reduce the amount of memory
  consumed by your system software. Refer to your Macintosh
  documentation to do this, but some general suggestions follow:

     a. Open the Memory Control Panel and check the Disk Cache
     setting. For best performance with Microsoft Wine Guide, set the
     cache to 32K.

     b. Large numbers of fonts and sounds consume system memory.
     Removing those that you aren't using will make more memory
     available.

     c. Third party system extensions such as screen savers, fax
     software, desktop pictures, menu-modifying utilities and other
     system enhancements increase the amount of memory consumed by
     your system. Removing some or all of these extensions will
     increase the amount of memory available to applications. Be
     sure that you save anything you remove from your System folder
     and place it in a separate folder on your disk so that you can
     replace it later.

- Wine Guide is pre-set to a suggested memory size of 3,200K. You can
  change the amount of memory the program uses by clicking on the
  Microsoft Wine Guide icon, choosing Get Info from the File menu,
  and then changing the memory allocation. If you don't have enough
  memory to launch Wine Guide, you can set Wine Guide to use less
  memory.

Note: Be warned that a low memory setting may cause the program to
perform poorly. For example, Wine Guide may not play sounds or display
pop-up windows if it runs out of memory. If you allocate less than
2,800K, these problems are likely to result.

--------------
3. PERFORMANCE
--------------

If Microsoft Wine Guide seems to be running slowly or its sounds seem
to be interrupted, there are a number of things which may help:

- If you are running on a Macintosh with low memory you may have
problems. Check the previous section, MEMORY USE.

- If you are using Virtual Memory, you may find that movies and other
  sounds are choppy or interrupted. For best performance, turn off
  Virtual Memory by opening the Memory Control Panel, turning off
  Virtual Memory, and restarting your computer.

- For best performance, turn off File Sharing in the Sharing Setup
  Control Panel. Although File Sharing itself should not cause a
  problem, any network activity may cause Microsoft Wine Guide (as
  well as other applications) to run more slowly.

- Microsoft Wine Guide is designed to work properly on a CD-ROM drive
  with a 150K/sec or faster transfer rate. A double-speed CD-ROM
  drive or one with a faster transfer rate will provide even better
  performance in some sections of the product. If your CD-ROM drive
  has a sustained transfer rate of less than 150K/sec it may be not
  be able to supply audio and video information to the Macintosh at
  the speed required. Contact your CD-ROM vendor for information on
  improving the performance of slower CD-ROM drives.

--------------------------------------
4. SCREEN SIZE AND COLOR CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------

On startup, Wine Guide checks your monitor and displays the images as
best it can on your Macintosh. If your monitor settings can be
adjusted to make Wine Guide run better, the program will prompt you to
do so.

Wine Guide will run on any 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch) or higher
resolution Macintosh compatible monitor, although the movies look and
perform best in "Thousands of colors."

Wine Guide is not designed to run in black and white, in 16 colors, or
on monitors displaying less than 640x480 pixels (e.g., Color Classics
or 12" monitors).

-----------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
-----------------

If you are using Virtual Memory, you may find that sounds are choppy
or interrupted. For best performance, turn off Virtual Memory by
opening the Memory Control Panel, turning off Virtual Memory, and
restarting your computer.

Sounds may be inaudible if the sound level is turned down. To set the
sound level, open the Sound control panel, and experiment with the
speaker volume setting until you find a comfortable sound level. If
you set the sound level to maximum, you may get some sound distortion
just as you might on a stereo system. With external speakers, be sure
they are connected properly and turned on; you will generally be able
to adjust sound level with the external speaker volume knob as well as
with the Sound control panel.

-----------------------
6. PRINTING AND COPYING
-----------------------

When you print a window from Wine Guide, it is printed as a bitmap. If
you have only a black-and-white printer, Wine Guide will not print
very well. Wine Guide can print better grayscale images--if you have a
laser printer, choose the Color/Grayscale option for better quality.
You can also print in color if you have a color printer. Depending on
the type of printer you have, printing a picture may take several
minutes. Because the pictures can be quite large, you may have
difficulty copying or printing in low-memory conditions. In this case,
quit all other applications and then try again.

The Print and Copy commands affect only the topmost window.

------------------
7. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------

The speech recognition software on Macintosh AV models may conflict
with the screen display of Microsoft Wine Guide. The speech agent
window will keep trying to come to the very front, obscuring portions
of the Microsoft Wine Guide screens. If you have the speech software
installed in your computer, you may wish to turn it off before running
Microsoft Wine Guide, particularly if the Microsoft Wine Guide display
occupies your entire screen. Speech recognition may be deactivated in
the Speech Setup Control Panel.
