SUMMARY
=======

This article contains some of the frequently asked questions for the Microsoft
Exchange Internet Mail Connector.

Q. I want to have a different SMTP address. For inside my organization, I want to
use "user@host", and for outside my organization, I want to use
"user@company.com". How can I set this up?

A. You can change this in the Configuration object, Site Addressing object, Site
Addressing tab. Note that the Exchange recipient has to have an additional
SMTP-style address created in their e-mail addresses tab. If every Exchange
recipient wants two different SMTP addresses, use DIRECTORY IMPORT, with the
attribute Secondary -Proxy-Addresses.

Q. When I send mail to the Internet, sometimes the recipient has garbage at the
end of the file, and it says it is the Winmail.dat file at the beginning. How
can I get rid of this?

A. The Winmail.dat file is created and used by Exchange and MS Mail to hold RTF,
attachments, and positioning information of text in the message. If the
recipient's mail host does not know what to do with the Winmail.dat file, you
can prevent it from being sent out the Internet Mail Connector (IMC) in three
different ways:

1. Configure the IMC using the Internet Mail tab, Interoperability Button, and
  set "Send Microsoft Exchange rich text formatting" to Never. This will
  disable it for all IMC Messages.

2. If the recipient is a custom recipient in Exchange, make sure he does not
  have "Allow rich text in messages" checked on the Advanced tab.

3. If the recipient is in a personal address book (PAB), ensure that the "Always
  send to this recipient in Microsoft Exchange rich-text format" option is not
  checked. This option is on the SMTP-General tab.

Q. Can I use DHCP to configure the IMC host?

A. This is not recommended. The IP address of the IMC host needs to be entered in
a DNS or host table in order for other SMTP hosts to send mail to the IMC. If
the IP address changes periodically, these records will have to be changed also.
It is best to have a static IP address for the IMC. If DHCP must be used, you
should set up a permanent lease for the IMC host.

Q. How do I get the IMC to dial-up my Internet provider using async and retrieve
mail?

A. The IMC itself cannot dial up and send or receive mail. The IMC expects to
have the ability to connect to other SMTP hosts already available. However,
there is a way to accomplish the same thing using the AT command in Microsoft
Windows NT Server. The administrator will make arrangements with the Internet
Provider to hold mail delivery until certain predefined times.

At these predefined times, the IMC service can be started with the AT command.
Because the IMC can accept multiple simultaneous connections, it can send and
receive mail from the Internet Provider at the same time.

Q. I want to use the IMC and Exchange to handle mail between my &lt;your favorite
SMTP&gt; mail users and &lt;other next favorite SMTP&gt; mail users. How do I do
this?

A. Exchange and the IMC must know in the Directory for whom it is delivering
mail. For this to work, all users on each SMTP system MUST be added as custom
recipients into Exchange.

Q. I keep getting an error when I send mail that says: "No route to intended
recipient." What does this mean?

A. It means that the Address Space for the IMC is not set up correctly. If you
want all SMTP mail to go to this IMC, use a type of "SMTP", address of "*" and
cost of 1.

Q. The IMC is using DNS and I have a Hosts File In the Event of the DNS Being
Down. When the DNS server is down all the mail stays in the queue. The Hosts
File is never used.

A. This is by design. The IMC does not use the Hosts File if the DNS is down;
this will protect against outdated addresses in the Hosts File being used to
deliver the mail to a wrong adress. To fix the problem configure the IMC to send
to a specific host address until the DNS is up, then change it back to DNS.
