4. BUG: The CString += operator may break with null strings.
5. BUG: OnWndMsg case for WM_xSCROLL messages breaks when scroll bars are
  scrolled programmatically.
6. BUG: OnInitMenuPopup now deletes the menu temp map before returning.
7. Documented CRuntimeClass::m_pfnConstructObject is now m_pfnCreateObject.
8. BUG: Default dialog-based application doesn't work in Win32s.

  arguments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

General Issues
--------------

1. Window classes are no longer pre-registered by MFC:

Previous to version 4.0, MFC pre-registered four window (WNDCLASS) classes, as
documented in MFC Technical Note number 1. These window classes were AfxWnd,
AfxFrameOrView, AfxMDIFrame, and AfxControlBar. Most code (such as the ONETIME
sample) that prevented more than one instance of an application relied on these
classes.

Now, as of version 4.0, these four classes are not registered until a window of
that type is created. Windows based on a custom WNDCLASS that fill in
information from the MFC window classes will likely just fail to show, sending
the message that window creation failed. GetLastError returns the value 0x57F
(ERROR_WNDCLASS_DOES_NOT_EXIST) to the debug output window if MFC tracing is
turned on.

From version 4.0 on, you need to provide all of the necessary information when
registering custom window classes with RegisterClass or AfxRegisterClass. Do not
rely on ::GetClassInfo to retrieve class values for MFC window classes.

For additional information, please see MFC Technical Note 1 and the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140596 MFC 4.0 No Longer Pre-Registers Window Classes

  Q141752 SAMPLE: Limiting 32-bit Applications to a Single Instance

2. BUG: The first control on CFormView gets OnSetFocus before OnInitialUpdate
executes:


This causes problems if there is code in OnSetFocus that refers to CWnd objects
that won't be subclassed until the call to the base class OnInitDialog. This
problem may also occur in any other handler called as a result of the control
getting the focus. For example, radio buttons will generate a BN_CLICKED when
they get the focus.

For additional information and a workaround, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q142274 FIX: Assertion Failure When Handling xN_SETFOCUS in CFormView

3. CWinApp::m_templateList no longer exists:

The m_templateList member variable of CWinApp was undocumented in MFC versions
prior to 4.0 but was used frequently enough to be called a porting issue.
Microsoft recommends that you use the GetFirstDocTemplatePosition() and
GetNextDocTemplate() member functions of CWinApp to gain access to the templates
for an application.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q106455 How to Acquire a List of All CDocument Objects

4. BUG: The CString += operator may break with null strings:


The particular sequence of events that result in this bug is complex. There is a
bug in the MFC source code that incorrectly handles the case when a null string
is used with the += operator.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q142385 FIX: Using CString::operator+= May Cause an Access Violation

5. BUG: OnWndMsg case for WM_xSCROLL messages breaks when scroll bars are
scrolled programmatically:


Code was added in MFC 4.0 to pass the full 32 bits of position (when available)
on to the OnxScroll handlers because the WM_xSCROLL messages can only pack 16
bits of position information. Unfortunately the code that was added breaks
whenever an application programmatically scrolls a scroll bar by sending a
WM_xSCROLL message to itself by way of SendMessage.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q147684 FIX: Sending WM_xSCROLL Message Causes Invalid ASSERT

6. BUG: OnInitMenuPopup now deletes the menu temp map before returning:


In MFC version 4.0, calls to AfxLockTempMaps and AfxUnlockTempMaps were added to
CWnd::OnInitMenuPopup. When AfxUnlockTempMaps is called, MFC's temporary object
map reference count will go to zero causing all temporary MFC objects to be
deleted. When the call to OnInitMenuPopup returns, the CMenu pointer passed in
to OnInitMenuPopup (which is a temporary pointer) will be invalid.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q141532 FIX: OnInitMenuPopup Deletes Temporary Objects

7. Documented CRuntimeClass::m_pfnConstructObject is now m_pfnCreateObject:


m_pfnConstructObject was a documented member variable of CRuntimeClass in MFC
versions prior to 4.0, but the name was changed to reflect the change in
parameters and return value. The documentation included with Visual C++ 4.0 was
not updated to reflect this change and incorrectly references the old function
name. 8. BUG: Default dialog-based application doesn't work in Win32s:


When AppWizard generates a dialog-based application, it uses a DIALOGEX resource
for the main dialog. Win32s, however, does not support DIALOGEX resources. As a
result, the dialog box looks incorrect in Win32s. This can be fixed by removing
the WS_EX_APPWINDOW style from within the dialog editor and by changing the
DIALOGEX statement to a DIALOG statement in the .rc file.

For additional information, please see the Visual C++ Readme file and the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q138971 BUG: Default Dialog-Based Application Doesn't Work in Win32s

CPropertySheet
--------------

Much of the MFC implementation of CPropertySheet has changed to now wrap the
Windows Property Sheet common control. There have been some formatting and
sizing changes, but more importantly, if code made use of any of the private MFC
implementations of CPropertySheet, the code will likely break as most of the
undocumented members of that class are no longer there.

9. CPropertySheet always changes its font to the default font:

Even if the font of the property pages is changed in the Resource Editor,
property pages will be displayed at run time with the system font. If it is
necessary to change the font, call SetFont() in OnInitDialog; then use an
appropriate MoveWindow() to resize the sheet and move and resize all the
controls on the page. Also, the property sheet is set back to its original size
whenever a page is activated, so it will be necessary to resize the page in
response to a click on the tab control.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q142170 SAMPLE: PRPFONT - How to Set CPropertySheet Fonts

10. Property sheet modifications should be done in OnInitDialog after call to
base class:

During CPropertySheet::OnInitDialog, the property sheet is resized and the four
standard buttons (OK, Cancel, Apply, and Help) are hidden at the bottom of
modeless property sheets. The proper place to modify the size of the sheet or to
customize the four property sheet buttons is in OnInitDialog after the call to
the base class. In previous versions of MFC, it was common practice to hide some
of the buttons shown with a modal property sheet in OnCreate. These buttons can
now be easily removed by modifying styles in the PROPSHEETHEADER structure
CPropertySheet::m_psh.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q140585 PRB: Resizing CPropertySheet in OnInitDialog Does Not Work

  Q141039 How to Hide the Apply Button in CPropertySheet

11. CPropertySheet::DoModal() causes first chance exception on Windows 95:

A first chance exception occurs on Windows 95 because the property page sets
required styles in the dialog resource. The operating system needs to handle
this, so the message can be ignored. If you surround the DoModal() call with a
try/catch(...) block in an effort to handle the exception yourself, you will get
a stack fault.


12. Property Sheets now have a minimum width:

The minimum width of a CPropertySheet window is the size of the four buttons (OK,
Cancel, Apply, and Help) that would show up along the bottom of a modal property
sheet. This width applies even to modeless property sheets, which do not show
the four buttons along the bottom.

DLLs
----

13. MFC threads cannot be created during DLL startup:

Although not a good idea, it was possible to create a thread during the startup
of an MFC DLL in previous versions of MFC. This includes calling AfxBeginThread
or CWinThread::CreateThread in DllMain, RawDllMain, InitInstance in the DLL, or
in any functions called by these. Due to synchronization of MFC thread startup
code and blocking at DllMain during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH and DLL_THREAD_ATTACH,
this is no longer permitted. MFC 4.0 DLLs that attempt to do this will hang when
loaded by an application.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q142243 PRB: Cannot Create an MFC Thread During DLL Startup

14. Regular DLLs using MFC in the Shared Library require AFX_MODULE_STATE in
exported functions:

Previously, the USRDLL model required that MFC be statically linked to the DLL.
It is now possible to link dynamically to the Mfc40.dll from a Regular DLL (the
new term for _USRDLLs). The caveat is that to convert a _USRDLL to be a "Regular
DLL using MFC in a Shared Library," you need to make sure that you manage your
module state information correctly. The single line:

     AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());

should be added to the beginning of any function exported from the DLL that
operates on MFC objects.

The following problems are likely to occur if the module state is not switched
appropriately:

- Dialogs and windows fail at creation in a DLL because of missing resources.
- Functions for the wrong application object are called and cause stack
  overflow or unpredictable results.
- Unrecognized run-time class information.
- Bad window-to-MFC object handle map linkage.

For additional information, please see MFC Technical Note 58 (TN058) and the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q140850 How to Convert DLLTRACE to Use MFC in Shared Library

15. BUG: DoModal may fail in MFC extension DLLs:


When MFC 4.0 creates a dialog box, it passes the current instance handle to the
::CreateDialogIndirect Windows API - which creates the dialog instead of the
resource handle for the DLL. The template for the dialog was already loaded by
MFC from the correct extension DLL. However, Windows will look in the .exe file
specified by the instance handle for any extra resources indicated on the
template. Windows will not find them if they are in the DLL, and the dialog
creation will fail. To work around this problem, the current instance handle
should be temporarily switched before any calls to DoModal. Extra resources
include such things as the dialog's menu, custom controls, or an icon on the
dialog.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q147384 FIX: Icons, Bitmaps, &amp; Menus Not Displayed in an AFXDLL Dialog

CStatusBar and CToolBar
-----------------------

Like CPropertySheet, these MFC classes now wrap the functionality of the Win32
common controls. Any code that relied on or modified the private, undocumented
implementation of these classes will likely break when compiled for MFC 4.0.
These two common controls support a greater range of common customizations than
did the previous default MFC implementation, and they do not require significant
overrides of the MFC source for such tasks as constructing palette bars or
making resizable toolbars. If needed, the old implementation of these two
classes is still present as the COldToolBar and COldStatusBar classes. These
implementations can be found in the OLDBARS sample project. 16.
CToolbar::SetSizes and button sizing:

Toolbars now require that the width of the button size be at least 7 pixels
greater than the image size. The documentation that ships with Visual C++ 4.0
was not updated to reflect this change and is incorrect. An ASSERT that MFC
version 4.0 uses to verify correct parameters in SetSizes also incorrectly
checks for the old value of 6. There are other limits on the sizes of the
toolbar, buttons, and images, but these are correctly covered by ASSERT
statements in the MFC source and have not changed since MFC 3.x.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q141444 DOC: Incorrect Documentation for CToolBar::SetSizes()

CFileDialog
-----------

17. No need to replace the MFC-supplied CFileDialog hook procedure:

MFC always specifies its own hook procedure (_AfxCommDlgProc) for the Open File
Dialog during the construction of the CFileDialog object so that it can properly
route notifications for the dialog to the proper handlers. As of MFC 4.x, this
hook procedure is used to subclass the CFileDialog object to the Open File
Dialog window. If the hook procedure is replaced, this subclass procedure won't
occur, so any attempt to use the CFileDialog or an embedded control variable on
it (as if it were a window) will fail.

18. CFileDialog is always a child of the Explorer dialog window:

When you use the Explorer-style CFileDialog (which in Windows 95 you are doing by
default), MFC 4.0 assumes the Explorer model of customization. This implies that
custom improvements to the File dialog are included on a separate template that
is added around the standard Explorer dialog. In MFC 4.0, the actual CFileDialog
window is a child dialog of the main File Common Dialog, even if you are not
providing a template to customize the dialog. Therefore, if you have a need to
alter the standard Explorer interface by moving or hiding controls, prefix all
GetDlgItem() calls to Explorer controls with GetParent(). For example, this
expression:

     GetParent()-&gt;GetDlgItem(IDOK)

will return a pointer to the Open/Save button on the Explorer dialog. However,
this is not recommended because code that relies on the details of the standard
Explorer dialog controls will break if the Explorer layout is changed in the
future.

This default can be changed by removing the OFN_EXPLORER style. For more
information, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q131225 PRB: CFileDialog::DoModal() Does Not Display FileOpen Dialog

19. CFileDialog member functions GetFileName and GetFileTitle reversed:

In MFC 4.0, for the file C:\Article.txt:

- CFileDialog::GetFileName returns Article.txt.
- CFileDialog::GetFileTitle returns Article.

Previous versions of MFC returned exactly the opposite. These functions have been
changed to work in a manner similar to the Win32 API functions of the same
names. However, the documentation included with Visual C++ 4.0 was not updated
to reflect these changes and is incorrect.

For additional information, please see the Visual C++ Readme file and the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q142203 DOCERR: GetFileTitle() &amp; GetFileName() Docs Are Switched

MFC ODBC
--------

20. BUG: Dynasets with CLongBinary fields throw exception:


An MFC ODBC application that uses dynaset recordsets with CLongBinary-bound
fields worked in Visual C++ 2.x, but it now throws an exception in Visual C++
4.0 when the recordset is opened. The exception is thrown from
CRecordset::InitRecord.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q141303 FIX: Dynasets w/ CLongBinary Fields Throws Incorrect Exception

MFC OLE
-------

21. No more Mfcans32.dll, so OLE functions in MFC applications require Unicode
arguments:

In MFC 3.x, a special DLL was used (Mfcans32.dll) to convert automatically
between Unicode and MBCS when OLE interfaces were called. MFC 4.0 does not use
this DLL; instead, it talks directly to the Unicode OLE interfaces. To handle
this change, MFC applications now must pass the correct type of parameters -
whether Unicode or MBCS - to OLE functions. MFC 4.0 has provided a number of
macros that make this task easier.

For more information please see MFC Technical Note 59.
