SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Visual C++ 4.x in either Windows 95 or Windows NT, it is
possible for setup to fail while copying certain shared DLLs. The DLLs that
don't copy successfully will most likely be one of these:

  MSVCRT20.DLL   MSVCRT40.DLL
  ODBCCP32.DLL   ODBC32.DLL    ODBCINT.DLL

When setup fails, it displays a dialog box that looks similar to this:

  

  Setup cannot open the destination file
  'C:\Windows\System\Msvcrt20.dll'. The file may be in use by
  another application, or marked read-only. Close the application
  or change the file's read-only attribute and try again.

-or-

  

  Cannot install file C:\Windows\System\Odbc32.dll. It might be
  in use. Try closing all applications and choosing Retry.

Both dialog boxes offer a chance to Abort, Retry, or Ignore.

CAUSE
=====

Many applications use shared DLLs. If the setup program tries to copy a DLL over
another DLL that has the same name while that DLL is in use by another program,
the setup program will fail.

For example, the Windows 95 Explorer uses Msvcrt20.dll, so if the Explorer is not
closed before running Visual C++ 4.x setup, you could see the problem. You may
also see the problem when running The Internet Information Server as it also
uses some of these DLLs.

RESOLUTION
==========


Here are several possible resolutions:

1. The best resolution is to make sure no other applications are running when
  you install Visual C++ 4.x. To do this, close all applications, and check the
  task list to make sure nothing is running. Under Windows 95, you can make
  sure other processes are not running by restarting your computer; hold down
  the SHIFT key as Windows 95 restarts to bypass the startup group.

2. An additional workaround is to start Visual C++ Setup in the following
  manner:

   - Under Windows 95:

     Close all applications including Explorer. Run setup from an MS-DOS window.
     If you are installing from the network, map to that drive.

   - Under Windows NT 3.51:

     Close all applications. Run setup from File Manager or a DOS window.

3. If all applications are closed, but the error still occurs, make sure that
  you close the Master Setup window; it uses Msvcrt20.dll.

4. If the problem persists, it is generally safe to click Ignore, and continue
  with the installation. However, remember to manually copy the files from the
  Visual C++ CD-ROM that failed to copy during the setup.

5. Another slightly riskier way to work around the problem is to rename the
  offending DLL from the system directory. Once the installation completes,
  restart your computer to cause the new version to be loaded.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
