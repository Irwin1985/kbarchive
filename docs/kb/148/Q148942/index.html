SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to provide you with the information needed to
capture network traffic from a local area network using Microsoft's Network
Monitor. The text of this article comes directly from the Network Monitor's Help
file and should be referenced for more detailed instructions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network Monitor is a network diagnostic tool that monitors local area networks
and provides a graphical display of network statistics. Network administrators
can use these statistics to perform routine trouble- shooting tasks, such as
locating a server that is down, or that is receiving a disproportionate number
of work requests. While collecting information from the network's data stream,
Network Monitor displays the following types of information:

- The source address of the computer that sent a frame onto the network. (This
  address is a unique hexadecimal (or base-16) number that identifies that
  computer on the network.)

- The destination address of the computer that received the frame.

- The protocols used to send the frame.

- The data, or a portion of the message being sent.

The process by which Network Monitor collects this information is called
capturing. By default, Network Monitor gathers statistics on all the frames it
detects on the network into a capture buffer, which is a reserved storage area
in memory. To capture statistics on only a specific subset of frames, you can
single out these frames by designing a capture filter. When you have finished
capturing information, you can design a display filter to specify how much of
the information that you have captured will be displayed in Network Monitor's
Frame Viewer window.

To use Network Monitor, your computer must have a network card that supports
promiscuous mode. If you are using Network Monitor on a remote machine, the
local workstation does not need a network adapter card that supports promiscuous
mode, but the remote computer does.

To capture across networks, or to preserve local resources, use the Network
Monitor Agent to capture information using a remote Windows NT computer. When
you capture remotely, the Network Monitor Agent gathers statistics from a remote
computer, and then sends these statistics to your local computer, where they are
displayed in a local Network Monitor window.

Once data has been captured either locally or remotely, the data can be saved to
a text or a capture file, and can be opened and examined at a later time.

NOTE: The core functionality of Network Monitor, described in Help, is supported
by Microsoft Product Support Services. Network-dependent tasks, such as
interpreting data that you capture from your network, are not supported. The
Network Monitor Agent is supported for Windows NT, but is unsupported on Windows
3.1 and Windows for Workgroups workstations.

Creating an Address List
------------------------

To use address pairs in a Capture filter, you should first build an address
database. Once this database is built, you can use the addresses listed in the
database to specify address pairs in a capture filter.

To create an address list, follow these steps:

1. From the Capture menu, select Start. Optionally, open a .cap file in the
  Frame Viewer window.

2. When you have finished capturing, select Stop and View from the Capture menu
  to display the Frame Viewer window.

3. From the Display menu, select Find All Names. Network Monitor processes the
  frames, then adds them to the address database.

4. Close the Frame Viewer window, and display the Capture window.

5. From the Capture menu, select Filter to display the Capture filter dialog
  box.

6. In the Capture Filter dialog box, double-click on the Address Pairs line. Or,
  choose Address in the Add groupbox.

Network Monitor displays the address database you have created. You can use the
names in this database to specify address pairs in the Capture filter.

Capturing Data Between Two Computers
------------------------------------

To monitor traffic between two computers, follow these steps:

1. From the Capture menu, choose Filter to display the Capture Filter dialog
  box.

2. Double-click on the ANY&lt;-&gt;ANY line to display the Address Expression
  dialog box.

3. In the left window of the Address Expression dialog box, select the address
  of a computer.

4. In the right window of the Address Expression dialog box, select the address
  of a computer.

When you have done this, choose the Next button at the top of this window for
more instructions.

1. In the Direction window, of the dialog box, choose one of the symbols:

   - Choose the &lt;--&gt; symbol to monitor the traffic that passes in either
     direction between the addresses that you have selected.

   - Choose the --&gt; symbol to monitor only the traffic that passes from the
     address selected in the left window to the address selected in the right
     window.

2. Choose OK.

3. In the Capture Filter dialog box, choose OK.

4. From the Capture menu, choose Start.

Saving Captured Data
--------------------

Use the Save As command to save capture statistics to a capture file or to save
changes to capture files that you have modified. Later, to view frames saved to
file, you can open this file and display the statistics in Network Monitor's
Frame Viewer window.

To save the captured frames to a capture file or text file:

1. Do one of the following:

   - On the Toolbar, click the File Save button.

  -or-

   - From the File menu, choose Save As.

2. Do one the following:

   - To save the file to the current drive and directory, in the File Name box,
     specify a file name and an extension. If you are saving a file that you
     have modified, you cannot save it under its original name in the same
     directory.

   - To save the file to a network share to which you are not connected, choose
     the Network button, and then use the Connect Network Drive dialog box to
     establish the connection.

   - To save the file to a different drive or directory, do the following:

     a. In the Drives box, select a new drive.

     b. In the Directories box, select a new directory.

     c. Type the file name.

3. To save only those frame statistics that meet the specifications of the
  current display filter, choose Filtered.

  This option is available only if you are saving data from the Frame Viewer
  window.

4. To save a particular range of frames, type the beginning and ending frame
  numbers in the From and To boxes.

5. Choose OK.

NOTE: When a range of frames is saved to a capture file, the numbers associated
with the frames are changed; in a capture file, frame numbers always begin with
1, regardless of the number associated with the original frame. Similarly, if
you apply a display filter, and then save the filtered frames, the frame numbers
in the capture file begin with 1. If, however, you use the Print to File option
in the Print dialog box, the original frame numbers associated with the frames
are preserved.


Tracing in a WAN Environment
----------------------------

Sometimes, you may be asked to make a capture of network traffic between two
specific computers that are separated by one or more routers. In these cases,
the support professional may want to analyze all network traffic between the
first computer and its nearest router, and all network traffic between the
second computer and its nearest router. Most of the time, this is done to check
whether or not network packets are being lost or corrupted somewhere between the
routers. To make these traces consistent and to be able to read these traces
simultaneously, the system clocks must be synchronized between the two computers
prior to making the trace. Use the following steps to synchronize time between
two computers:

1. Choose the computer against which to synchronize the time.

2. From the other computer, type the command

  "net time \\&lt;ComputerName&gt; /set /yes" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;ComputerName&gt; is the name of the computer from step 1.

3. Verify the computers have the same time by typing "TIME" (without the
  quotation marks) at each one.

4. Proceed with the trace.

Finding Media Access Control Addresses
--------------------------------------

If the computer to be monitored is running:

- An MS-DOS-based network client, run MSD at that computer.

- Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (running TCP/IP), type "IPCONFIG /ALL" (without
  the quotation marks) from the command line.

- Windows 95, run WINIPCFG from the command line at the local workstation.

- MacOS, Open Appletalk Control Panel. Select User Mode from Edit Menu, change
  mode to Advanced. Appletalk Control Panel now reveals Info button. Click this
  button to obtain the MAC address

- Windows NT, at the local console, use one of these options:

   - NET CONFIG SERVER from the command line

   - IPCONFIG /ALL from the command line

   - IPXROUTE config from the command line

   - arp -a from the command line

   - Getmac.exe from the Windows NT Resource Kit

   - WinMSD

- Windows NT, remotely, run Getmac.exe from the Windows NT Resource Kit
