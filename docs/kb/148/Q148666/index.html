The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to manually remove all traces of version 3.2
Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks or the Access component
from a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice (PO).

Occasionally a Microsoft Mail gateway installation or removal will crash leaving
the gateway in a state where the Setup program will no longer install or remove
the gateway. When this occurs, the following procedure can be used to manually
remove the gateway from the postoffice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Connection 3.2 Gateway is different from other Microsoft Gateways in that
two records are used in the Gateway POs NETWORK.GLB file. In addition, two
address lists can exist: a Native Format address list and a PROXYNET/PROXYPO
type list.

To manually delete the Connection 3.2 Gateway from the Mail for PC Networks
postoffice, you may need to manually modify the MASTER.GLB and NETWORK.GLB
files. In addition, you may need to delete various files.

To remove the Connection 3.2 gateway components at the byte level
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make two copies each of the MASTER.GLB and NETWORK.GLB files with *.BAK and
  *.TMP extensions.

2. You may need to modify the MASTER.TMP file with debug as described below.
  Here is a sample debug sequence of the process.

         M:\MAILDATA &gt;debug glb\master.tmp
         -d193,193
         15BB:0190          71                                        q
         -e193
         15BB:0193  71.61
         -w
         Writing 000B0 bytes
         -q

  After you type d193,193 to display only offset 193 as shown above, you will
  get a HEX value at 193; in this case, it is 71. If the first digit (7 in this
  case) is odd (1,3,5,7,9,B,D,F), you need to subtract HEX 10 from the full
  number (71 in this case) to get a replacement value (in this case HEX 61).
  The calculator that comes with Microsoft Windows will help if you switch it
  to the scientific view and then select Hex. Then you need to replace the HEX
  value at 193 with the calculated value using the -e (edit) command as shown
  above.

  The -w (write) command following the -e (edit) command updates the MASTER.TMP
  file with the change. Another -d (display) command can be used to verify the
  correct change. The -q (quit) command is used to quit debug.

3. Divide the size of the NETWORK.GLB file by 122 to determine how many records
  the NETWORK.GLB file contains. For example, a 5,490 byte NETWORK.GLB file
  contains 45 records.

4. Use debug on the NETWORK.TMP file to look for both MSMAIL and the MAC Proxy
  Network name in the column displayed on the right of the debug screen.

  Use d (display) along with the record addresses in the Delete Bit column in
  the table below at each debug prompt (-) until you find a record containing
  either MSMAIL or the MAC Proxy Network name (for example, -d100, -d17A,
  -d1F4, -d26E, ..., etc.). The name you are looking for will begin in the
  third position displayed in the right section of the debug screen display.

  A sample debug screen is given in step 5 below.

   122 bytes      00=Deleted
   per record     01=Active

   Record #       Delete Bit   Type   Name     XTN     MBG

  If you find the Proxy name first, write down the record number for use in step
  7, and continue until you find the MSMAIL record.

5. Once you find MSMAIL, look for 01 10 4D 53 4D 41 49 4C in the middle section
  of the display. If the first displayed byte is 01 and the second is 10, you
  have one of the two records you are looking for. 01 indicates an active
  record, and 10 indicates an MSMAIL Connection type record. If the first byte
  is 00, then you are looking at a previously deleted record. This could
  indicate that the record was cleanly removed already or that there is still
  an active MSMAIL Connection type record you have not yet found.

   NETWORK.GLB

           01 10 .......                           ..MSMAIL
   Active /     \ MSMAIL Type Record

            00 10 .......                          ..MSMAIL
   Deleted /     \ MSMAIL Type Record

  If the record is Active (01), it needs to be changed to Deleted (00). To
  change the 01 to 00. You will need to use a -e### (e for Edit) command with
  the same address you just used with the -d### command.

  Below is an example with record 12 of a sample NETWORK.TMP file:

  -d63e
  15B7:0630                                           01 10               ..

  Writing 005B8 bytes

  The -w (write) command following the -e (edit) command updates the NETWORK.TMP
  file with the change. Another -d (display) command can be used to verify the
  correct change (notice the first byte is now 00). Use the -q (quit) command
  to quit debug.

  -q

6. Notice the eight digit hex ID following the MSMAIL name (in this case
  0000002E). This corresponds with a 0000002E.KEY and 0000002E.MBG file used as
  the outgoing queue for any mail sent from the PO using the Native Address
  format for the Macintosh servers. The KEY and MBG with matching file names
  need to be deleted.

7. The NETWORK.TMP file needs any active PROXYNET records marked as deleted.
  Once you find the PROXYNET Name look for 01 64 in the middle section of the
  display. 01 indicates an active record, and 64 indicates a FFAPI Gateway type
  record.

   NETWORK.GLB

           01 64 .......                           ..PROXYNET
   Active /     \ FFAPI Type Record

            00 64 .......                          ..PROXYNET
   Deleted /     \ MSMAIL Type Record

  If the record is Active (01), it needs changed to Deleted (00).

8. Notice the eight digit hex ID following the PROXYNET name. This corresponds
  with a &lt;hex_id&gt;.XTN file that will need deleted if it exists.

  BEFORE deleting the XTN, run Debug on it, and enter a -d10C command. The first
  eight characters on the right will correspond with a new hex ID that matches
  a KEY and MBG file used as the outgoing queue for mail sent to the Macintosh
  server using a ProxyNet/ProxyPO/UserID type address. The matching KEY and MBG
  files need to be deleted.

  In addition, there may also be USR and TPL of INF files with the same hex ID
  as the KEY and MBG files. If they exist, they should be deleted.

9. If \MAILDATA\NME\MSMAIL.NME and \MAILDATAD\GLB\MSMAIL.GLB files exist, delete
  them. They make up the a Native format address list.

10. If a MACGATE directory exists, remove it and all files in it.

11. Make sure every user is signed out of Mail and that no Mail processes are
  running.

12. Copy the two modified *.TMP files over the *.GLB ones.

The Connection 3.2 Gateway is now fully removed. Make sure everything else works.
If not, immediately replace the two files from the *.BAK copies.
