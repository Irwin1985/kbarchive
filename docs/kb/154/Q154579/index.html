- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 clients using the TCP/IP protocol may experience a considerable delay
resuming data transfer to client applications that take a long time to clear the
receive window.

Observing a Protocol Analyzer trace of the slow performance shows the following
behavior:

1. The server sends a large data transfer.

2. The client runs out of receive window space and indicates a zero-byte window.

3. The server enters exponential backoff until it hits the maximum limit of 240
  seconds between window probe packets. Because the time between probes is
  longer than the 120-second arp cache life, each new window probe requires
  that the server arp for the client's Media Access Control (MAC) address.

4. The client clears its receive window and advertises additional window space.

5. The server begins transmitting data with an incorrect sequence number.

6. The client acknowledges a previous data send.

7. The server takes up to four minutes to send the correct sequence number.

CAUSE
=====

The server falls out of sequence because its window probes are 240 seconds
apart. Therefore, the server has to arp for the client's MAC address when the
client advertises its new window space.

The reason this causes the server to fall out of sequence is that the server
begins sending data immediately after discovering that the client has additional
window space. Because the arp table entry for the client is in the resolving
state when the server starts indicating data, TCP/IP cannot send the data to the
client. Per RFC, the arp cache only buffers one packet when the destination IP
address is in the resolving state. Windows 95 buffers the last packet only, so
all sends, except for the last, are dropped until the arp entry has been
resolved. When the arp entry for the client is resolved, TCP/IP sends the last
packet that was cached to the client, which is out of sequence because the prior
sends were dropped while the arp entry was resolving.

The delay that occurs is caused by the server taking 240 seconds to send the
correct sequence number.

The reason the server takes 240 seconds to send the correct sequence number is
that a retransmit timer started running. The retransmit timer takes 240 seconds
to finish before the packet with the correct sequence number can be sent.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
