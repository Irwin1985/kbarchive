SUMMARY
=======

You may want to digitally sign an Eform for groupware and tracking purposes. You
cannot digitally sign an Eform using Visual Basic 4.0, but you can have a
RichEntry field on the Eform to which you can attach an already digitally signed
or encrypted message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Make sure that you have enhanced security installed and running on your
  Exchange Server.

2. Have the user that wants to send a secure Eform create a message and
  digitally sign or encrypt the message and send it to their mailbox.

3. From the client Inbox folder select the encrypted message that was just
  received. On the File menu, select Save As and select Save File As Type.
  Select message format. This will save the message as an .MSG file.

4. Start the EForms designer and create your form. Make sure that there is a
  RichEntry field on the form. The RichEntry field should also have a reference
  name of MAPI_BODY_CUSTOM; this will allow you to add file attachments to this
  field.

5. Generate and install the form into the forms registry.

6. Launch the form from the client. Click the RichEntry field to highlight it.

7. Select Insert/File and select the .msg file that you saved earlier. The
  message should show up in the RichEntry field as an envelope icon.

You can send this Eform and the attached messages will be sent along with it. You
can also open and make changes to the attached messages and then send the
changed message on to another recipient.

The steps above allow for the full functionality of an encrypted or digitally
signed message, as long as the enhanced security is installed.
