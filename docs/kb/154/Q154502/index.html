SUMMARY
=======

You may experience an increase in replication occurrences as a result of
ANNOUNCE_IMMEDIATE events.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Security account manager (SAM) and local security authority (LSA) replication
can fall into a number of categories, including immediate (or urgent)
replication. Most replication handled by the Net Logon service occurs at set
intervals, but certain types of account or policy changes are considered urgent
and must be handled immediately, causing an ANNOUNCE_IMMEDIATE event to be
generated and acted upon by the primary domain controller (PDC). The following
replications are considered urgent:

- Changing the account lockout policy.

- Changing the domain password policy.

- Changing the password on a machine account.

- Replicating a newly locked-out account.

- Changing an LSA secret (essentially the "trusting" side of changing the
  machine account password).

These changes are immediate by necessity. For example, if a workstation were to
change its machine account password and then lose its connection to its domain
controller, it would not be able to connect to any other domain controller until
the replication occurred.

As a part of Windows NT security, machine account passwords are changed every
seven days. As a side effect of this automatic machine account password change,
a domain with a large number of computers and domain controllers may cause
replication to occur on a frequent basis.

Some administrators may want to disable these automatic machine account password
changes. For information about how to disable automatic machine account password
changes, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
