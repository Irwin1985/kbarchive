SUMMARY
=======

This article lists fixes in Visual C++ version 4.2 to bugs that appeared in the
Microsoft 32-bit Edition of Visual C++ version 4.0 and 4.1.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual C++ version 4.2 fixes several Visual C++ version 4.0 and 4.1 bugs. These
bugs include Developer Studio debugger problems with breakpoints and long
directory structure names, and MFC database classes problems with certain ODBC
drivers producing "Out of memory" errors. Many developers will find the bug
fixes listed in this article to be of particular interest.

1. In an MFC application that uses the Microsoft database classes, when using
  certain ODBC drivers, you may get "Out of memory" errors. These errors can
  occur when mapping a CString to a SQL_LONGVARCHAR, SQL_VARCHAR, or other SQL
  data type fields if a driver returns a large precision value from
  SQLDescribeCol() for the column.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q148787 FIX: Run Out of Memory or Assertion in GetBufferSetLength()


2. In the Microsoft Developer Studio, you may not be stopping at breakpoints you
  have set if your project was built from a directory structure that contained
  long names. This problem did not exist in Visual C++ 4.0.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q150936 FIX: VC41 Debugger Fails to Stop on Breakpoints w/ Long Names


3. _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC does not work as documented. When an object is allocated
  through use of the new operator and dumped through use of the debugging
  routines in the C Run-Time Library, the allocation is reported as occurring
  in the Crtdbg.h file, line 512.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q140858 FIX: _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC Does Not Work as Documented


4. Attempting to add a function or variable to a class by using ClassView fails
  and returns the error message:

  One or more of the files for &lt;class name&gt; are read-only.

  &lt;class name&gt; corresponds to the class that is selected.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q140270 FIX: ClassView Add Function/Variable Fails If Header File Moved


5. When using the CCheckListBox class in MFC and specifying a style of
  LBS_MULTICOLUMN, the user will be unable to check or uncheck items that are
  not displayed in the first column.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q142960 FIX: CCheckListBox Fails with Style LBS_MULTICOLUMN


6. If the #include preprocessor directive is used in a template class
  definition, the compiler generates a C1001 internal compiler error in
  compiler file msc1.cpp, line 899.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q146000 FIX: C1001 Including Header File in Template Class Definition


7. On Windows NT, when running in debug mode using a dynamically-loaded DLL such
  as an OLE control with a long file name or an .exe file with a long file
  name, the debugger may not break at set breakpoints. You may be able to set
  breakpoints both before starting and while it is running, but the debugger
  will not break on them.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q146447 FIX: Breakpoints Not Hit for Long File Name DLL/EXE


8. It is possible to use AppWizard to create an OLE Custom Control (.ocx file)
  that subclasses a standard Windows control. If you choose to subclass an edit
  control, the control will not exhibit the same behavior as a standard edit
  control.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q146617 FIX: SetWindowText(NULL) Doesn't Clear .OCX Edit Control


9. Under circumstances similar to the following, ClassWizard may cause an access
  violation:

  1. Derive a class CRecordSet1 from CRecordSet using ClassWizard.

  2. Derive a class CRecordSet2 from CRecordSet using ClassWizard.

  3. Replace all occurrences of CRecordSet in the .cpp and .h files for
     CRecordSet2 with CRecordSet1. When ClassWizard is invoked to view
     CRecordSet2, an access violation may occur. This may also happen with
     CDaoRecordset class.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q147735 FIX: ClassWizard Quits If Class Twice Derived from CRecordSet


10. Running an application that uses the MFC DAO classes to retrieve CLongBinary
  data from a database may result in one or more of the following behaviors
  when performing a recordset move or requery:

  Access violations or "Out of memory" exceptions.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q147948 FIX: Errors Occurs Using DAO CLongBinary Data from Database


11. COleDateTimeSpan returns an incorrect number of days when using dates
  earlier than midnight December 30, 1899. Also, adding or subtracting
  COleDateTimeSpan objects from COleDateTime objects will produce incorrect
  results if the resulting date is before midnight December 30, 1899.


12. When installing ODBC drivers from the Visual C++ 4.1 CD-ROM, you may see the
  following error message:

  Setup could not open the file: "...\MSDEV\REDIST\ORACLE.HLP"

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q148916 FIX: Setup Could Not Open \Msdev\Redist\Oracle.hlp File


13. Running an application built using the MFC ODBC classes to retrieve
  CLongBinary date from a database may result in data truncation. If Visual
  C++ 4.1 is used, the truncation is only evident in release builds; debug
  builds work as expected.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q149137 FIX: ODBC Long Binary Functions Use SQL_NO_TOTAL Incorrectly


14. Using /O1 (minimize size) or /O2 (maximize speed) causes a C1001 internal
  compiler error in a try block. The error is in compiler file
  \school.tp2\test\c10\src\p2\main.c, line 413. Additionally, C++ exception
  handling must be enabled (/GX). If the warning level is set to 4 (/W4),
  C4702 (unreachable code) warnings are issued before C1001.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q150884 FIX: C1001 Fatal Error in File Main.c, Line 413 for /O1 or /O2


15. If the MFC CMultiLock class is used to synchronize on more than eight
  synchronization objects, a memory leak occurs when using CEvent, CSemaphore,
  or CMutex as the synchronization objects. The size of the leak equals the
  number of synchronization objects used multiplied by the memory needed for a
  BOOL variable.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q151033 FIX: Using CMultiLock Class Can Cause a Memory Leak


16. Using Visual C++ 4.0 or 4.1 C Run-time to asynchronously spawn a child
  process that is inheriting a pipe handle, the parent process hangs before
  returning from the spawn call.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q151071 FIX: Spawn Hangs When Inheriting Pipe Handle


17. When using MFC 4.0 or 4.1, an assert can occur in bardock.cpp, line 682 when
  CFrameWnd::LoadBarState() is called. This behavior occurs if SaveBarState()
  was previously called and more than one CToolBar was docked at the bottom of
  the window.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q151382 FIX: LoadBarState() Causes Assert In Bardock.cpp, Line 682


18. With MFC 4.0 or 4.1, the internal state of the ControlBars is corrupted when
  ControlBars are docked and undocked. The size of the registry key or the
  .INI file grows when SaveBarState is a result of this corruption.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q151446 FIX: Internal State of ControlBars Corrupted


19. When using the MFC ODBC classes with the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver
  version 2.65.0201 that ships with Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, CDBExceptions
  can be thrown that contain no information about what led to the exception.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q151683 FIX: MFC ODBC Exceptions Using the SQL Server 6.5 Driver


20. When installing ODBC drivers from the Visual C++ 4.1 CD-ROM by running setup
  from \msdev\redist, you may see the following error message:

  Setup could not open the file: "...\MSDEV\REDIST\QFEUPD.EXE".

  When this happens, you have to quit the setup program.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q152317 FIX: Setup Could Not Open \MSDEV\REDIST\QFEUPD.EXE


21. When using MFC ISAPI classes to send a POST HTTP request to an MFC ISAPI
  DLL, an access violation may occur in the debugger, or a message about a
  failed request from the Web browser may be generated.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q152365 FIX: Sending a POST HTTP Request May Cause an Access Violation


22. Using the ClassWizard to associate a short with a control on a dialog may
  result in an access violation when UpdateData(TRUE) is called, or in other
  member variables of the dialog being corrupted after the call
  toUpdateData(TRUE).

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q152384 FIX: DDX for Short Causes Stack Corruption


23. Generating an ISAPI filter using the MFC ISAPI Extension Wizard and
  selecting the option "Client Authentication Requests," will generate an
  ISAPI filter DLL with an OnAuthentication() member function that will never
  be called.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q152493 FIX: ISAPI Extension Wizard Generates Bad OnAuthentication


24. When the POST method is used to send information from an HTML form to an MFC
  ISAPI DLL, the last parameter in the function handling command may have
  extra characters that are not part of the actual input. This will happen if
  the last parameter is a string.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q152968 FIX: Extra Invalid Characters in String Arguments
