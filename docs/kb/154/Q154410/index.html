IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Some new registry entries are available for Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The registry path for these entries is the following:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ 
  SYSTEM\ 
  CurrentControlSet\ 
  Services\ 
  Wins\ 
  Parameters

     BurstHandling
     Type = REG_DWORD
     Value: 0 or 1
     Default = 0

This parameter is used to temporarily achieve a steady state in the WINS server
when the WINS server is either started with a clean database or many WINS
clients come online for the first time. Either situation causes a large amount
of name registration and name refresh traffic to occur. The WINS server
currently stores a maximum of 25,000 name registration and refresh queries in
its queue before dropping queries. By using this parameter, the WINS server can
be configured to send success responses to the clients whose requests are
dropped. These response will have time-to- live (TTL) values that will slow down
the refresh rate of those WINS clients and regulate the burst of WINS client
traffic. This will result in a steady state being reached much more quickly.

To turn on this parameter, change the value to 1.


The ConsistencyCheck Subkey
---------------------------

This is an optional subkey that should be created if you want WINS to
periodically perform database consistency checks. To create this subkey, start
Regedt32.exe and go to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wins\Parameters

Create a new value named ConsistencyCheck. Once this key has been created, you
can add the following values:

  MaxRecsAtATime
  Type = REG_DWORD
  Range = 1000 to total number of records (decimal)
  Default = 30000

Specifies the maximum number of records that will be replicated in one
consistency check cycle. WINS does consistency checks on the records of each
owner WINS server (the WINS server from which the record was replicated). After
checking an owner WINS server, the local WINS server continues to the next owner
WINS server, or stops. This is determined by the MaxRecsAtATime value.

  UseRplPnrs
  Type = REG_DWORD or nonzero value
  Range = 0 or nonzero
  Default = 0

If set to zero, WINS will contact the owner WINS server. If set to a nonzero
value, WINS sill contact only its pull partners to perform consistency checks.
If set to nonzero, WINS randomly picks a WINS from its list of pull partners
unless the owner WINS server also happens to be a pull partner. In that case,
the owner WINS is contacted.

  TimeInterval
  Type = REG_DWORD
  Range = 21600 (6 hours) - entered in seconds (decimal)
  Default = 86400 (24 hours) - entered in seconds (decimal)

Specifies the time interval between WINS server database consistency checks.

  SpTime
  Type = REG_SZ
  Default = 2:00:00 (2 A.M.)

Specifies the specific time at which the first WINS server database consistency
check will occur. The time is specified in hh:mm:ss format. Thereafter, the WINS
database is periodically checked for consistency by using the time interval
specified in the TimeInterval parameter.
