-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When some IDE hard disks are configured to spin down during idle time to
conserve power, you may experience the following symptoms when you access the
hard disk after it has spun down:

- Incorrect data is read from or written to the drive.

- You receive general protection (GP) fault error messages.

CAUSE
=====

These symptoms can occur if the hard disk requires more than 7.5 seconds to spin
up. When this occurs, an error in the Windows 95 driver results in incorrect
data being read from the drive, which can result in GP faults.
