-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Custom Recipients created in Microsoft Exchange Server through cc:Mail connector
directory synchronization have an e-mail address format of "First Last at
ccpostoffice;" however, an administrator may prefer they be addressed as "Last,
First at ccpostoffice."

This article discusses changing the e-mail address for cc:Mail custom recipients;
it does not discuss changing the display name or alias. To change the default
behavior for those fields, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q183058 XFOR: Modifying the Display Name and Alias for cc:Mail Migration

CAUSE
=====

When directory synchronization is configured between Exchange Server and
cc:Mail, custom recipients matched to cc:Mail users are created in the Exchange
address list. The default e-mail address for a cc:Mail recipient created in
Exchange Server through directory synchronization will be in the following
format:

  First Last at ccpostoffice

However, it is common practice among cc:Mail administrators to define users in
the following format:

  Last, First at ccpostoffice

Even though the e-mail address in Exchange is "First Last at ccpostoffice," mail
will still be delivered correctly to cc:Mail recipients defined as "Last, First
at ccpostoffice."

However, the "First Last" naming style in Exchange may cause other problems if
there is more than one cc:Mail connector in the Exchange Server organization or
if synchronization-generated cc:Mail custom recipients are replicated out of
Exchange Server back to cc:Mail.

In these cases, the Exchange-style name formatting may overwrite the cc:Mail
formatting as seen in the cc:Mail Administrator program. This can be annoying to
cc:Mail administrators who are used to searching for users and sorting lists by
Last names.

If you are backboning cc:Mail through Exchange Server, and using the Exchange
Server Administrator program rather than cc:Mail Administrator to create cc:Mail
recipients, the First Last style may pose similar problems.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you may enable a registry value that causes the
generation of cc:Mail custom recipient addresses in the format "Last, First at
ccpostoffice." This registry setting will also create a secondary proxy address
in the form "First Last at ccpostoffice." Thus, each cc:Mail custom recipient
will be associated with both addressing forms.

Note that this registry change will cause this effect only for imported cc:Mail
recipients whose names are in "Last, First" format. If a cc:Mail entry
synchronized with Exchange is not a BBS or ML entry, or is not in "Last, First"
format, then this registry change will have no effect for that entry

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To enable the fix, after installing the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 U.S.
Service Pack, start the Microsoft Windows NT Registry Editor and locate the
following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \MSExchangeCCMC\Parameters\Generate secondary proxy

Set this key to 0x1 (hexadecimal 1) for "Last, First" name format address
generation. (By default, the key is set to 0x0.)

If this key does not exist, create it as a DWORD and set it to 0x1 for the new
behavior or 0x00 for the old behavior. If this key does not exist, it is
possible you have not installed the correct service pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 5.0
Server U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query
