The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

The ATAPI IDE driver in Windows 95 (Esdi_506.pdr) does not include functionality
for the following features:

- SMART support (the ability for certain programs to predict whether a hard
  disk failure may occur)

- DMA support for ATAPI devices

- ATAPI tape drive support

CAUSE
=====

The functionality for these features is not built into the Windows 95 IDE
driver. However, Microsoft has released an updated Esdi_506.pdr file that
supports these features as follows:

- SMART provides support for SMART programs, which will be able to predict some
  hard disk failures. The updated driver itself does not provide this
  functionality, but provides the support for SMART programs to implement this
  functionality.

- DMA (also called bus mastering) reduces CPU overhead by providing a mechanism
  for data transfers that do not have to be monitored by the CPU. Transfer rate
  for a particular transfer will not noticeably increase, but the CPU overhead
  should be significantly reduced in DMA mode. (For example, a 10 percent CPU
  overhead may be observed for DMA transfers versus a 30 percent CPU overhead
  for PIO transfers, in typical ATAPI CD-ROM transfers.)

- ATAPI tape drive support is included in the IDE driver, which will allow a
  backup program that supports ATAPI tape to be used.
