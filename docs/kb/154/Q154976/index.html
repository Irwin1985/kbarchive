The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running a program that causes a large number of writes to occur
very rapidly to an IDE drive, you may receive the following error message on a
blue screen:

  Disk Write Error
  Unable to write to disk in drive &lt;x&gt;:
  Data or files may be lost

You may be able to recover from this error by pressing a key to remove the error
message and retry the write. The operation typically continues, although
additional errors may occur until the operation is finished.

CAUSE
=====

If a program generates a large number of disk writes very quickly, a timing
problem involving the IDE disk driver and the cache may occur, resulting in the
error message.

This symptom has been reported to occur with a hard disk stress test using the
Microsoft Jet database engine that is included with the current versions of
Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Access.
