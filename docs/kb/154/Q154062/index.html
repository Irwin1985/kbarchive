SUMMARY
=======

This article documents how to connect to a Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
(PPTP) enabled server across the Internet, while connecting to a non-PPTP
enabled Internet service provider (ISP).

PPTP enables implementation of secure, multiprotocol Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs) through public data networks such as the Internet. Through PPTP, it is
possible for remote users to access their corporate networks and applications by
dialing into the local ISP's Point of Presence (POP), instead of dialing
directly into the company network. PPTP connects directly to the target server
by creating a virtual network for each remote client, one that the Windows NT
Server 4.0 administrator can monitor and manage like any other remote access
port.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you make a connection, in order to use PPTP to connect to a server
securely across the Internet, the PPTP protocol must be loaded. To load the PPTP
protocol, do the following:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Network.

2. On the Protocols tab, add PPTP.

3. After the protocol is loaded, Remote Access Service (RAS) is invoked. You
  must add at least one VPN port as a port in the RAS setup interface.

4. At this time, specify which protocols you want to run for that VPN port. You
  can install up to 256 VPN ports. Each VPN can be connected to a network.

5. Make sure that at least one VPN is configured for dial-out. One other
  consideration is that you must know what protocol is used on the receiving
  PPTP server, and select that protocol and configure it for the VPN port.

6. Re-apply the last applied service pack.

To make the connection, do the following:

1. Assuming that you have a phone book entry for your ISP, create a phone book
  entry for the PPTP server. The actual phone number is the name of the host or
  an IP address. Using the IP address of the PPTP RAS server is ideal. There
  may be name resolution considerations otherwise. Make sure that the Dial
  Using dialog has a RASPPTPM VPN port assigned to it.

2. Dial the ISP using the standard phone book entry created for the ISP. When
  you have established a connection, dial the IP address or host name of the
  computer.
