SUMMARY
=======

When you are have problems installing 3com Etherdisk drivers for Etherlink and
the Etherlink III (R) Bus Master Adapters, the troubleshooting guide below will
help you with a smooth installation.

If the adapter diagnostic tests fail, the adapter might not be defective. Check
the following:

- Make sure the adapter is completely seated in its slot. Review the
  installation instructions in the appropriate adapter guide.

- If you are running the Group 2 test, make sure the adapter is securely
  connected to a loopback plug or to a properly cabled network.

- If you are running the Group 3 test, make sure the adapter is securely
  connected to a properly cabled network and an echo server is set up on the
  network.

- Make sure the configuration setting for the transceiver type is correct.

- Running Group 2 tests while connected to an active network can cause
  intermittent failures. These failures can be avoided by using a loopback plug
  or by connecting to an inactive network on which only the computer being
  tested is operating.

- If you installed a twisted-pair adapter, check the LED on the back plate of
  the adapter. The LED should be checked only during or after the diagnostic
  tests have been run. The LED will be on when there is a correct connection
  between the adapter and the hub. The LED will flash if the polarity of the
  connection is swapped.

- Install the adapter in another slot and run the tests again. The slot in the
  computer may be defective.

- Install the adapter in a known, functioning computer and run the tests again.
  The computer in which the adapter is installed might be defective.

- Try a different loopback plug. The loopback plug you are using might be
  defective.

- Replace the failed adapter with a known working adapter with the same
  configuration. If the second adapter fails, something is probably wrong with
  the test environment, not with the adapter.
