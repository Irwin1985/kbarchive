-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to connect your computer to an opponent's computer
using a modem. This allows you to play Close Combat against each other.

To connect to another computer via a modem in Close Combat, your computer must be
configured properly. Specific information will need to be shared between the
players before a multiplayer game is started. For example, you must determine
who will be the HOST of the game session.

The HOST is in charge of the game. The HOST must configure his/her computer to
receive the modem call from the joining player. The joining player is called the
CLIENT. The CLIENT computer calls the HOST and connects to his/her computer. In
the following article, the HOST is referred to as Player 1 and the CLIENT is
referred to as Player 2.

Player 1 and Player 2 have certain responsibilities. Player 1 must configure
his/her computer as a server. As part of this action, an address and a password
are created, and these must be relayed to Player 2 prior to beginning a game
session. This address and password are required to connect and play Close Combat
modem-to-modem.

The instructions below guide Player 1 and Player 2 through the required steps to
set up each machine for modem-to-modem play.

**                          - WARNING -                        **
**     Making these changes may cause loss of connection       **
**       to a network or to the Internet. Please review        **
**      this article carefully so you understand the changes   **
**    necessary to restore Internet or Network connectivity.   **

SETTING UP THE CONNECTION
-------------------------

To ensure proper configuration, follow the steps below in the order specified.

1. To use Close Combat over a modem-to-modem connection, Dial-Up Networking must
  be installed on both computers.

  To verify installation of or to install Dial-Up Networking:

  a. Click the Start button, point to Settings and click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

  c. Click the Windows Setup tab, then click the Communications component to
     highlight it.

  d. Click the Details button and make sure the Dial-Up Networking check box
     contains a check mark. If the Dial-Up Networking check box is selected,
     Dial-Up Networking is installed. If the check box is empty, install
     Dial-Up Networking as follows:

  i. Click the Dial-Up Networking check box.

  ii. Click OK and follow the prompts on the screen.

  e. Click OK.

2. Verify that TCP/IP is installed on both computers. Use the following steps to
  verify this:

  a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click the Network icon.

  c. Click the Configuration tab in the Network dialog box.

  d. Verify that a TCP/IP protocol is listed as an installed network component.

  If a TCP/IP protocol is not listed as a network component, use the following
  steps to install one:

  a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click the Network icon.

  c. Click the Configuration tab in the Network dialog box, and then click the
     Add button.

  d. Click Protocol in the Select Network Component Type dialog box and click
     the Add button.

  e. Under Manufacturers in the Select Network Protocol dialog box, click
     Microsoft.

  f. In the Network Protocols in the Select Network Protocol dialog box, click
     TCP/IP.

  g. Click OK.

3. Configure the Network properties on the computer that is going be the HOST of
  the game. This allows other players to access your computer.

  NOTE: Use these steps only if you are going to be the HOST of a game. If you
  are going to be the CLIENT, you can skip to Step 4.

  To allow users to connect to your computer do the following:

  a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click the Network icon.

  c. On the Configuration tab, click the File And Print Sharing button.

     Make sure the following check boxes are selected:

      - I want to be able to give others access to my files.
      - I want to be able to allow others to print to my printer(s).

  d. Click OK.

4. Both machines need to specify an Internet Protocol (IP) Address for their
  computers. Use the following steps to do this:

  a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click the Network icon.

  c. On the Configuration tab, click the TCP/IP component (or TCP/IP Dialup
     Adapter if available) in the list of installed network protocols.

  d. Click the Properties button.

  e. On the IP Address tab, click Specify An IP Address.

     WARNING: This may cause temporary loss of connection to a network or to the
     Internet. If this occurs, click Obtain An IP Address Automatically to
     restore connectivity when you are finished playing the game.

  f. The IP address is four sets of three-digit numbers used to uniquely
     identify your computer. Choose a number (for example 123.123.123.123) in
     the IP address line. Do not use all 0's, 1's, or 255 because these numbers
     are reserved. IP addresses are like license plates on a car -- all
     addresses must be different. Therefore the IP address on the other
     computer must be different from yours (for example,123.123.123.124).

     NOTE: The HOST (Player 1) computer will provide its IP address to the
     CLIENT (Player 2) computer prior to game play.

  g. The Subnet mask is always 255.255.255.0 . You need to type this number in
     the space provided below the IP Address.

  h. On the host computer, click the Bindings tab and make sure the Client For
     Microsoft Networks check box and File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft
     Networks check box are selected.

  i. Click OK.

5. Ensure that the security level on the HOST computer is Share Level, as
  follows:

  NOTE: Use these steps only if you are going to be the HOST of a game. If you
  are going to be the CLIENT, you can skip to Step 7.

  a. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click the Network icon.

  c. Click the Access Control tab in Network Properties.

  d. Verify that Share-level access control is selected.

  e. Click OK. If you changed the access control, you will receive an
     information message explaining the changes you made. Click Yes to
     continue.

  f. When prompted, click Yes to restart your computer.

6. To play Close Combat using a modem-to-modem connection, Dial-Up Networking
  Server must be installed on the HOST (Player 1) computer. The player who has
  the Dial-Up Networking Server installed will act as the server and host the
  game, while the other player will act as the client and dial in to the
  server.

  To verify that Dial-Up Networking Server is installed:

  a. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.

  b. Double-click the Dial-Up Networking folder. You may get a Welcome dialog
     box if a Dial-Up Networking connection has not been set up. This will be
     set up later. For now, click the Cancel button.

  c. Click Connections on the Dial-Up Networking window, verify that Dial-Up
     Server is a menu item.

  If Dial-Up Server is not listed as a menu item, install it using the following
  steps:

  a. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and click Windows Explorer.

  b. From the View menu, click Options.

  c. On the View tab, click Show All Files.

  d. Click OK.

  e. Insert the Close Combat compact disc into your CD-ROM drive. You can hold
     down the SHIFT key to disable the Autorun feature when you insert the
     compact disc, or you can Exit the game when it starts.

  f. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.

  g. Use your right mouse button to click your CD-ROM drive (this should be the
     drive with the Close Combat icon) and click Explore.

  h. Double-click the Goodies folder located in the Close Combat folder.

  i. Use your right mouse button to click Rnaserv.dll and click Copy.

  j. In the left pane of Explorer, double-click the drive C icon (or the drive
     on your computer that contains your Windows folder), and double-click the
     Windows folder.

  k. Use your right mouse button to click the System folder and click Paste.
     This places a copy of Rnaserv.dll from the compact disc into your
     Windows\System folder on your hard drive.

  To set up your computer to be the server for Dial-Up Networking:

  a. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.

  b. Double-click the Dial-Up Networking folder.

  c. From the Connections menu, click Dial-Up Server.

  d. Click Allow Caller Access.

     NOTE: Be sure to change this back to No Caller Access after you're finished
     playing, or you will be unable to dial out later (for example, to an MSN
     account or bulletin board service).

  e. Click Change Password.

  f. Leave the space next to the old password blank if you have not used a
     password for Dial-Up Server before.

  g. Type a password in the space provided next to New password.

  h. Type the password again in the space provided to Confirm New Password and
     click OK.

     NOTE: You will have to provide this password to any player connecting to
     the HOST computer before playing.

  i. Click Server Type.

  j. Click the down arrow at the end of Type Of Dial-Up Server to activate the
     drop-down menu.

  k. Select PPP:Windows 95, Windows NT 3.5, Internet.

  l. Click OK twice.

7. Connect the CLIENT (Player 2) to the HOST (Player 1) computer.

  WARNING: Before continuing with the following steps, be sure Player 2 has the
  host computers' modem number, IP address, and password.

  The CLIENT computer (Player 2) needs to connect to the server or HOST computer
  (Player 1) before a Close Combat multiplayer game can begin. Use the
  following steps to do this:

  NOTE: Use these steps only if you are the CLIENT in a game. If you are going
  to be the HOST, you can skip to Step 8.

  a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and click Dial-Up
     Networking.

  b. Double-click the Make New Connection icon.

     NOTE: If you have never created a connection, the Make New Connection
     Wizard will start automatically. If the Install New Modem Wizard appears,
     you have not installed a modem in Windows 95. You must install a modem
     before continuing. Refer to your Windows Online Help for instructions on
     how to install a modem.

  c. In the "Type a name for the computer you are dialing" box, type a name for
     the connection and verify that the correct modem is selected.

  d. Click Next.

  e. Type the area code and telephone number and select the appropriate country
     code for the modem you are dialing.

  f. Click Finish. This will add an icon for this connection to the Dial-up
     Networking folder.

  g. Double-click the newly created icon. This will initiate the connection.

  h. In the Connect To dialog box, type the name you want to use on the User
     Name line.

  i. On the Password line, enter the password of the HOST computer from Step 6
     g-h of the "To set your computer up to be the server for Dial-Up
     Networking" section above. You should have obtained this password from
     Player 1.

  j. Click the Connect button. Once you're connected, a Connected dialog box
     will appear on the screen. Click Cancel if you are prompted for another
     password.

8. Once the connection is established you may start the Close Combat multiplayer
  game by doing the following:

  a. Player 1 and Player 2 start Close Combat.

  b. Player 1 presses the 2-Player button (button with two people).

  c. Player 1 clicks Wait For Connection and clicks OK.

  d. Player 2 (player using the CLIENT) clicks the 2-Player button and clicks
     Initiate Connection.

  e. Player 2 enters the IP Address (created in Step 4) for the HOST computer
     (Player 1) and clicks OK.

When both players hear the announcement for "Connection Established," you can
press the Begin button to start the game.
