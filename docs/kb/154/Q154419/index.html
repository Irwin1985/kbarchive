Standard C++ Libraries Frequently Asked Questions
-------------------------------------------------

Q1: What does the Standard C++ library contain?

A1: The Standard C++ library provides an extensible framework and contains
components for language support, diagnostics, general utilities, strings,
locales, standard template library (containers, iterators, algorithms, and
numerics), and input/output.

The Standard C++ library can be divided into the following categories:

1. Standard Template Library (STL) components provide a C++ program with access
  to a subset of the most widely-used algorithms and data structures. STL
  headers can be grouped into three major organizing concepts:

   - Containers: template classes that support common ways to organize data,
     such as &lt;vector&gt;, &lt;list&gt;, &lt;deque&gt;, &lt;stack&gt;,
     &lt;queue&gt;, &lt;set&gt;, and &lt;map&gt;.

   - Algorithms: template functions for performing common operations on
     sequences of objects, such as &lt;functional&gt;, &lt;algorithm&gt;, and
     &lt;numeric&gt;.

   - Iterators: the glue that pastes algorithms and containers together, such
     as &lt;utility&gt;, &lt;iterator&gt;, and &lt;memory&gt;.

2. Input/Output includes components for forward declarations of iostreams
  (&lt;iosfwd&gt;), predefined iostreams objects (&lt;iostream&gt;), base
  iostreams classes (&lt;ios&gt;), stream buffering (&lt;streambuf&gt;), stream
  formatting and manipulators (&lt;iosmanip&gt;, &lt;istream&gt;,
  &lt;ostream&gt;), string streams (&lt;sstream&gt;), and file streams
  (&lt;fstream&gt;).

3. Other Standard C++ headers include:

   - Language Support: components for common type definitions used throughout
     the library (&lt;cstddef&gt;), characteristics of the predefined types
     (&lt;limits&gt;, &lt;cfloat&gt;, &lt;climits&gt;), functions supporting
     start and termination of a C++ program (&lt;cstdlib&gt;), support for
     dynamic memory management (&lt;new&gt;), support for dynamic type
     identification (&lt;typeinfo&gt;), support for exception processing
     (&lt;exception&gt;), and other runtime support (&lt;cstdarg&gt;,
     &lt;ctime&gt;, &lt;csetlmp&gt;, &lt;csignal&gt;).

   - Diagnostics: components for reporting several kinds of exceptional
     conditions (&lt;stdexcept&gt;),documenting program assertions
     (&lt;cassert&gt;), and a global variable for error number codes
     (&lt;cerrno&gt;).

   - Strings: components for string classes (&lt;string&gt;) and
     null-terminated sequence utilities (&lt;cctype&gt;, &lt;cwctype&gt;,
     &lt;cwchar&gt;).

   - Localization: components that C++ programs may use to encapsulate cultural
     differences. The locale facility includes internationalization support for
     character classification and string collation, numeric, monetary, and
     date/time formatting and parsing, and message retrieval (&lt;locale&gt;,
     &lt;clocale&gt;).

Q2: What is the difference between C-Runtime library and Standard C++ library?
What libraries will the Runtime library compiler options such as /ML, /MT, /MD,
/MLd, /MTd, and /MDd include?

A2: Visual C++ 5.0 and later include the following Libraries in addition to the
Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) libraries:

- Basic C-Runtime library.

- Standard C++ library.

- Old iostream library.

* NOTE: MSVCPRT.lib and MSVCPRTD.lib are static libraries and do not have any
dynamic link libraries (DLLs) directly related to them. These libraries are also
dependent on MSVCRT.dll and MSVCRTD.dll, respectively. If you have any
applications that use MSVCPRT.lib or MSVCPRTD.lib and you use the "Ignore
Default Library" (/NOD or NODEFAULTLIB) option, be sure to link MSVCPRT.lib (or
MSVCPRTD.lib) and MSVCRT.lib (or MSVCRTD.lib) with your application. Otherwise,
you will get linker errors (LNK2001: unresolved externals in MSVCPRT.lib or
MSVCPRTD.lib) when linking your application.)

     |------------------------------------------------------------|

In Visual C++ 5.0 and later, there are certain default libraries that your
program will link with. When you build a release version of your project, one of
the basic C-Runtime Libraries (LIBC.lib, LIBCMT.lib, or MSVCRT.lib) is linked by
default, depending on the compiler option you choose (single-threaded
&lt;ML[d]&gt;, multithreaded &lt;MT[d]&gt;, or DLL&lt;ML[d]&gt;). Depending on
the headers you use in your code, a library from the Standard C++ library or one
from the old iostream library may also be linked.

For example, if you specify the /ML (single-thread version) compiler option and
include &lt;iostream&gt;, a Standard C++ library header, the libraries LIBC.lib
and LIBCP.lib are linked with your application by default. If you specify the
/ML (single-thread version) compiler option and include &lt;iostream.h&gt;, an
old iostream header, the libraries LIBC.lib and LIBCI.lib are linked with your
application by default.

Headers determine whether the Standard C++ Libraries and old iostream Libraries
will be linked. Compiler options (/ML[d], /MT[d], /MD[d]) determine which
version of the libraries (single-threaded, multithreaded, or DLL) is to be
linked by default.

NOTE: It may seem that headers without the ".h" extension are Standard C++
headers and ones with the ".h" extension are C-Runtime headers or old iostream
headers. This is not true. As explained below, the files &lt;useoldio.h&gt; and
&lt;use_ansi.h&gt; determine the libraries with which your application will
link.

Actually, there are two header files, &lt;useoldio.h&gt; and &lt;use_ansi.h&gt;,
that contain #pragmas. The #pragmas force either the old iostream library or the
Standard C++ library to be linked in by default.

The header file &lt;useoldio.h&gt; contains #pragma statements that force the old
iostream library to be linked in. All old iostream headers include
&lt;useoldio.h&gt;: If you include any old iostream header in your application,
the old iostream library will be linked by default.

     |-------------------------|
     |  Old iostream headers   |
     |-------------------------|
     |                         |
     | FSTREAM.H  | IOMANIP.H  |
     | IOS.H      | IOSTREAM.H |
     | ISTREAM.H  | OSTREAM.H  |
     | STDIOSTR.H | STREAMB.H  |
     | STRSTREA.H |            |
     |-------------------------|

The header file &lt;use_ansi.h&gt; contains #pragma statements that force the
Standard C++ library to be linked in. All Standard C++ headers include
&lt;use_ansi.h&gt;: if you include any Standard C++ header in your application,
the Standard C++ library will be linked by default.

You cannot mix calls to the old iostream library and the new Standard C++
library.

Q3: How do I retain the old iostream functionality if I port my project from an
earlier version of Visual C++?

A3: If you want to retain the old iostream library, include one or more of the
old iostream header files in your code. Do not use the new Standard C++ headers.
You cannot mix calls to the old iostream library and the new Standard C++
library.

Q4: How do I make the Standard C++ Libraries the default libraries for my
application?

A4: If you want to make the Standard C++ Libraries the default, include one or
more of the new Standard C++ headers. Remember, you cannot mix calls to the old
iostream and the new Standard C++ library. Existing libraries (static or dynamic
link) that use old iostream functions will have to be modified to use Standard
C++ library iostream functions.

Q5: I want to use Standard C++ Libraries in a Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
application. Will this cause any conflicts with the C-Runtime Libraries?

A5: No. MFC does not use any C-Runtime functions that will conflict with the
Standard C++ Libraries.

Q6: Why do I get error "error C2065: 'cout' : undeclared identifier" even though
I have included &lt;iostream&gt;?

A6: Standard C++ library is implemented in its own namespace "std". Make sure to
add the statement

  using namespace std;

in the beginning of your program or to qualify each Standard C++ library
identifier with namespace std, for example, std::cout.

Q7: Why am I getting "compiler error C2371: 'identifier' redefinition; different
basic types"?

A7: Mixing Standard C++ headers and old iostream headers will cause this error,
even if they are included in different source files. The following are the
different headers:

     |-------------------------|
     |  Old iostream Headers   |
     |-------------------------|
     | FSTREAM.H  | IOMANIP.H  |
     | IOS.H      | IOSTREAM.H |
     | ISTREAM.H  | OSTREAM.H  |
     | STDIOSTR.H | STREAMB.H  |
     | STRSTREA.H |            |
     |-------------------------|

	  
     |-------------------------------------------------|
     |             Standard C++ Headers                |
     |-------------------------------------------------|
     | ALGORITHM | BITSET    | COMPLEX    | DEQUE      |
     | EXCEPTION | FSTREAM   | FUNCTIONAL | IOMANIP    |
     | IOS       | IOSFWD    | IOSTREAM   | ISTREAM    |
     | ITERATOR  | LIMITS    | LIST       | LOCALE     |
     | MAP       | MEMORY    | NUMERIC    | OSTREAM    |
     | QUEUE     | SET       | SSTREAM    | STACK      |
     | STDEXCEPT | STREAMBUF | STRING     | STRSTREAM  |
     | TYPEINFO  | UTILITY   | VALARRAY   | VECTOR     |
     |-------------------------------------------------|

Q8: I have a project that was built with the "Ignore Default Libraries" option
(/NOD or /NODEFAULTLIB). With Visual C++ 5.0 or later, I am getting linker error
"LNK2001: unresolved external symbol 'symbol' ;" on all iostream function calls.
What has changed?

A8: The iostream functions have been removed from the C-Runtime library.

If you are using the old iostream functions, you must add an additional library
as follows: LIBCI.lib (single-threaded &lt;ML&gt;), LIBCIMT.lib (multithreaded
&lt;MT&gt;), or MSVCIRT.lib (multithreaded dll &lt;MD&gt;).

If you are using the new iostream functions included with the Standard C++
library, you must add an additional library as follows: LIBCP.lib
(single-threaded &lt;ML&gt;), LIBCPMT.lib (multithreaded &lt;MT&gt;), or
MSVCPRT.lib (multithreaded dll &lt;MD&gt;).

Do not mix different versions of the libraries. For example, if you are using the
single-threaded version of the C-Runtime library, you must also use the
single-threaded version of the old iostream library or Standard C++ library.

You cannot mix calls to the old iostream library functions and the new Standard
C++ library iostream functions.

Q9: I am getting compiler warnings C4786 and/or C4788. None of the symbols in my
program is anywhere near 255 characters in length. What is causing this?

A9: C4786/C4788 is issued when a symbol's name exceeds 255 characters in length.
This often happens with template class, and STL uses template class
extensively.

Ignoring this warning is usually safe. Use a #pragma warning (disable: 4786,4788)
to suppress the messages.

Q10: I am getting compiler warning "C4530: C++ exception handler used, but unwind
semantics are not enabled. Specify -GX." What does this mean?

A10: Programs that use the Standard C++ library must be compiled with C++
exception handling enabled. C++ exception handling can be enabled by:

- Selecting the Enable exception handling option in the C++ Language Category
  of the C/C++ tab in the Project Settings dialog box.

-or-

- Using the /GX compiler switch.

Q11: I am getting compiler error C2146, followed by C2065, and finally C2143, all
pointing to the same line in my source. What does this mean?

A11: This sequence of errors can be caused by the following type of construct:

  vector&lt;int, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;iV;

The problem is caused by the consecutive "&gt;&gt;" at the end of the
declaration. The solution is to put a space between two characters, so the
construct becomes:

  vector&lt;int, allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; iV;

This is consistent with the proposed ANSII specification.
