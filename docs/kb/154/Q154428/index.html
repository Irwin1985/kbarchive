The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), version 1.0

SUMMARY
=======

The file Vc41b.exe contains a patch to the Visual C++ versions 4.1 or 4.1a MFC
DLL and run-time library to solve a number of Win32s problems. Below is the
information from the Readme.txt which is included with the patch. See the
instructions below for more information about how to download and apply the
patch.

Contents of Readme.txt file
---------------------------

Summary
-------

This patch updates MFC version 4.1 to correct several problems that occur
when running on Win32s. If you have built an MFC application with Visual
C++ 4.1 and are supporting Win32s you may have noticed one or more of the
following problems, all of which are fixed in this patch:

1. Problem with caching pointers to DLL entry points after final
  FreeLibrary.

2. AfxWinInit/SetCurrentHandles benign asserts.

3. We load OLEPRO32.DLL, but store the instance handle in a global, not
  process local variable. This is what is causing a failure during
  IPersistMemory::Load after creating the control.

4. On process detach of an OCX, we are not cleaning up all the module
  process state. This causes problems if multiple instances of an OCX
  are loaded in the same or separate processes.

5. If you create a DLL that calls the AfxGetThread function and is being
  used by multiple applications you can run into problems caused by data
  being global and not process local.

6. Problems running multiple OCX containers as described in the following
  Microsoft Knowledge Base article have been fixed.  These problems were
  caused by a combination of the problems described in items 4 and 5
  above.

     ARTICLE-ID: Q152792
     TITLE: FIX: Multiple ActiveX Control Containers Under Win32s Problems

This patch includes the fixes issued in the 4.1a patch to Microsoft Visual
C++. The relevant pieces from the 4.1a Readme.txt file are appended at the
bottom of this file for your information.

How To Run the Patch, and What Gets Updated
-------------------------------------------

The following is included in the self-extracting file, Vc41b.exe:

- Readme.txt  : This file.
- Patch.exe   : The executable file which runs the patch script.
- Msdev41b.rtp: The patch file for the \msdev tree.
- Mfc41b.rtp  : The patch file for the MFC DLLs in the \windows\system
                directory.

Use the following steps to patch the MFC DLLs in your \windows\system
directory:

1. Close all applications using MFC, including Microsoft Developer
  Studio.

2. Copy Patch.exe and Mfc41b.rtp into your \windows\system directory on
  Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows versions 3.x running Win32s,
  or into \windows\system32 directory on Microsoft Windows NT.

3. Run the following command at a command prompt in the directory
  you copied Patch.exe into:

     patch mfc41b

4. Mfc41b.rtp attempts to patch all the MFC files installed in the
  Windows system directory. See below for list of files:

Caveats
-------

Several of the MFC files that can get patched are optionally installed.
You may get a message in the patch log stating that a particular
file was not found, and that is OK. For example, if you did not install
the Unicode MFC libraries, the Patch program will not find them.

Potential Problems and Workarounds
----------------------------------

- During any of the steps above, the Patch program may tell you that you
  already have a copy of the newer files on disk. If it tells you this
  information, it will not patch the files in your \windows\system
  directory. To remedy this situation, make sure that you do not have
  any other copies of the files listed above in your PATH.

  If the above solution does not work, run the Patch commands above
  using the /NOP switch. For example, use "Patch /NOP mfc41b." This
  switch tells the Patch program not to search your PATH for newer
  files.

  If your files still are not being patched, copy the files listed above
  into a temporary directory and run the Patch command with the /NOP and
  /NOS command-line options. For example, use "Patch /NOS /NOP mfc41b."

- You may get the error ept0038, indicating that a particular file
  could not be deleted. This error can occur because the DLL is still
  locked in memory. Be sure you have closed all applications before
  running the patch. If this solution does not work, restart Windows and
  run the patch before starting any other applications.

-  If you run this patch on Windows NT or Windows 95, an error message
  (see below) stating that the old version of the file could not be
  found but one with the same name exists is displayed. No update will
  be done.

    wpt0036:old File not found: The C run-time DLL which is being
    patched, MSVCRT40.DLL, is a Win32s specific version.

Readme from Visual C++ 4.1a Patch
---------------------------------

I. Summary

This patch updates MFC to fix a problem you may be seeing in an application
that uses the Microsoft database classes. Using certain ODBC drivers you
may get an "Out of memory" error. See below for a list of files updated and
a more complete description of the problem.

This patch also updates the debugger in the Microsoft Developer Studio to
fix a problem where you may not be stopping at breakpoints you have set in
a project that was built from a directory structure that contained long
names. This problem did not exist in Visual C++ 4.0. See below for a list
of files updated.

II. Description of MFC Bug

An error can occur when mapping a CString to a SQL_LONGVARCHAR,
SQL_VARCHAR, or other SQL data type field if a driver returns a large
precision value from SQLDescribeCol() for the column.

A bug in the MFC ODBC Database classes results in MFC trying to allocate a
large chunk of memory to store data that might have this large precision.

In some cases, such as using a memo field with the FoxPro Desktop ODBC
driver, a memory allocation of 1 gigabyte may be attempted. Or, as is the
case with the Visual FoxPro driver, the MFC Database Classes will try to
allocate a negative number of bytes because the return value of the driver
is 2 gigabytes and then MFC adds 1, which causes the signed variable to
wrap into a negative value. In this case, an assertion occurs in
GetBufferSetLength() on line 447 of Strcore.cpp:

   ASSERT(nNewLength &gt;= 0);

Mapping a CString to a SQL Server text field produces the same result.

The problem occurs only when mapping CString variables to
variable-length fields using the RFX_Text() function.
