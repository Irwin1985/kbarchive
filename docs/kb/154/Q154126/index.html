SYMPTOMS
========

When using an Extension DLL from a Regular DLL, you may run into one or more of
a set of related problems. Note that because the MFC Database, OLE, and Sockets
support DLLs are implemented as Extension DLLs, you might see similar problems
if you are using these MFC features, even if you're not explicitly using any of
your own Extension DLLs. Some symptoms are:

- When attempting to de-serialize an object of a type of class defined in the
  Extension DLL, the message appears in the TRACE debug window and the object
  fails to serialize:

  Warning: Cannot load CYourClass from archive. Class not defined.

  An exception indicating 'bad class' may be thrown.

- Resources stored in the Extension DLL fail to load because
  AfxFindResourceHandle returns NULL or an incorrect resource handle.

- DllGetClassObject, DllCanUnloadNow, and the UpdateRegistry, Revoke,
  RevokeAll, and RegisterAll member functions of COleObjectFactory fail to
  locate a class factory defined in the Extension DLL.

- AfxDoForAllClasses doesn't do for any classes in the Extension DLL.

- Standard MFC database, sockets, or OLE resources fail to load. For example,
  AfxLoadString(AFX_IDP_SQL_CONNECT_FAIL) returns an empty string, even when
  the Regular DLL is properly using the MFC Database classes.

CAUSE
=====

The Extension DLL is not wired into the CDynLinkLibrary object chain of the
Regular DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create and export an initialization function in the Extension DLL that creates a
CDynLinkLibrary object. Call this initialization function exactly once from each
Regular DLL that uses the Extension DLL. For an example of this, see the Sample
Code section below.

If you are using any MFC OLE, MFC Database (or DAO), or MFC Sockets support in
your Regular DLL, you need to call a predefined initialization function for each
MFCO4xD.DLL, MFCD4xD.DLL, and MFCN4xD.DLL you are using. These are the DLLs that
are linked to automatically when using MFC OLE, MFC Database, or MFC Sockets
support, respectively. For example, if you are using MFC OLE in an application
or DLL, that app or DLL uses the MFCO4xD.DLL. See the References section below
for more information.

For database support, add a call to AfxDbInitModule() to your Regular DLL's
CWinApp::InitInstance function. Make sure this call occurs before any base-
class call or any added code that accesses the MFCD4xD.DLL. This function takes
no parameters and returns void.

For OLE support, add a call to AfxOleInitModule() to your Regular DLL's
CWinApp::InitInstance. Note that the COleControlModule InitInstance() function
calls AfxOleInitModule() already, so if you are building an OLE control and are
using COleControlModule, you should not add this call to AfxOleInitModule().

For Sockets support, add a call to AfxNetInitModule() to your Regular DLL's
CWinApp::InitInstance.

Note that release builds of MFC DLLs and applications do not use separate DLLs
for database, sockets, or OLE support. It is safe to call these initialization
functions in release mode, however.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During each of the operations mentioned in the Symptoms section above, MFC needs
to search for a desired value or object. For example, during de- serialization,
MFC needs to search through all of the currently available Runtime Classes to
match objects in the archive with their proper Runtime Class.

As a part of these searches, MFC scans through all of the Extension DLLs in use
by walking a chain of CDynLinkLibrary objects. CDynLinkLibrary objects attach
automatically to a chain during their constructor and are created by each
Extension DLL in turn during initialization. In addition, every module (EXE or
Regular DLL) has its own chain of CDynLinkLibrary objects. In other words, the
chain of Extension DLLs used by an Application is different from the chain of
Extension DLLs used by one Regular DLL which is different from the chain of
Extension DLLs used by another Regular DLL.

This last point is one of the most common causes of the aforementioned problems
mentioned in the Symptoms section. In order for an Extension DLL to get wired
into a CDynLinkLibrary chain, it must create a CDynLinkLibrary object in the
context of every module that will be using the Extension DLL. For example, if an
Extension DLL is going to be used from Regular DLLs, it must provide an exported
initialization function that creates a CDynLinkLibrary object. Every Regular DLL
that uses the Extension DLL must call the exported initialization function.

If an Extension DLL is only going to be used from an MFC application (EXE) and
never from a Regular DLL, then it is sufficient to create the CDynLinkLibrary
object in the Extension DLL's DllMain. This is what the AppWizard Extension DLL
code does. When loading an Extension DLL implicitly, DllMain loads and executes
before the application ever starts. Any CDynLinkLibrary creations are wired into
a default chain that the MFC DLL reserves for an MFC application. This prevents
any need to call the initialization function from an application. Nevertheless,
it is safer and more recommended that all applications use the initialization
function and that the Extension DLL not create a CDynLinkLibrary object in
DllMain. Note that it is not a good idea to have multiple CDynLinkLibrary
objects from one Extension DLL in any one chain, especially if the Extension DLL
will be dynamically unloaded from memory. Don't call the initialization function
more than once from any one module.

The implementations of the AfxDbInitModule, AfxOleInitModule, and
AfxNetInitModule functions can be found in the DLLDB.CPP, DLLOLE.CPP, and
DLLNET.CPP files in the \MsDev\Mfc\Src directory, respectively.


Sample Code
-----------

     static AFX_EXTENSION_MODULE extensionDLL = { NULL, NULL };
     
     extern "C" int APIENTRY
     DllMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)
     {
        // Remove this if you use lpReserved
        UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(lpReserved);
     
        if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
        {
           TRACE0("YOUREXT.DLL Initializing!\n");
     
           // Extension DLL one-time initialization
           if (!AfxInitExtensionModule(extensionDLL, hInstance))
              return 0;
     
           // Insert this DLL into the resource chain.
           // NOTE: If this Extension DLL is being implicitly linked to by
           // an MFC Regular DLL (such as an ActiveX Control)
           // instead of an MFC application, then you will want to
           // remove this line from DllMain and put it in a separate
           // function exported from this Extension DLL. The Regular DLL
           // that uses this Extension DLL should then explicitly call that
           // function to initialize this Extension DLL. Otherwise,
           // the CDynLinkLibrary object will not be attached to the
           // Regular DLL's resource chain, and serious problems will
           // result.
     
           new CDynLinkLibrary(extensionDLL);
        }
        else if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)
        {
           TRACE0("YOUREXT.DLL Terminating!\n");
           // Terminate the library before destructors are called
           AfxTermExtensionModule(extensionDLL);
        }
        return 1;   // ok
     }

The sample code below shows how the initialization function is written and
assumes that the Regular DLL is implicitly linking to the Extension DLL. This is
accomplished by linking to the Import Library (.LIB) of the Extension DLL when
building the Regular DLL.

These lines should be in the source of the Extension DLL:

     ///////////////////// 
     // YourExtDLL.cpp:

     #include "afxdllx.h"    // standard MFC Extension DLL routines

     static AFX_EXTENSION_MODULE NEAR extensionDLL = { NULL, NULL };

     extern "C" int APIENTRY
     DllMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)
     {
         if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
         {
             // Extension DLL one-time initialization.
             if (!AfxInitExtensionModule(extensionDLL, hInstance))
                return 0;
         }
         return 1;   // ok
     }

     // Exported DLL initialization is run in context of application
     // or Regular DLL.
     extern "C" void WINAPI InitYourExtDLL()
     {
         // Create a new CDynLinkLibrary for this app.
         new CDynLinkLibrary(extensionDLL);

         // Add other initialization here.
     }

Be sure to export the InitYourExtDLL function. This could be done using
_declspec(dllexport), or in your DLL's .DEF file as follows:

     ///////////////////// 
     // YourExtDLL.Def:

     LIBRARY      YOUREXTDLL

     CODE         PRELOAD MOVEABLE DISCARDABLE
     DATA         PRELOAD SINGLE

     EXPORTS
         InitYourExtDLL

Add a call to the InitInstance member of the CWinApp-derived object in each
Regular DLL using the Extension DLL:

     ///////////////////////// 
     // YourRegularDLL.cpp:

     class CYourRegularDLL : public CWinApp
     {
     public:
         virtual BOOL InitInstance(); // Initialization
         virtual int ExitInstance();  // Termination

         // Nothing special for the constructor.
         CYourRegularDLL(LPCTSTR pszAppName) : CWinApp(pszAppName) { }
     };

     BOOL CYourRegularDLL::InitInstance()
     {
         // Any DLL initialization goes here.
         TRACE0("YOUR Regular DLL initializing\n");

         // Wire any extension DLLs into CDynLinkLibrary chain.
         InitYourExtDLL();

         return TRUE;
     }
