-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Dead Letter functionality is not included with Exchange server 4.0. This existed
on the release candidate builds but it was removed from the final product. A
server that has been upgraded through the release builds can exhibit some
problems when sending mail to invalid addresses. For example, when sending a
message to an invalid MS Mail address chosen from the personal address book, the
message may be sent to the Administrator's Mailbox defined in the MS Mail
Connector Properties. The sender does not receive a Non-Delivery Report
indicating address unknown. The recipient does not receive the message.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if the Exchange Server has been upgraded from Release Candidate 1 to
Release Candidate 2 to Exchange 4.0. In Release Candidate 1, an Object Attribute
called DOMAIN-DEF-ALT-RECIP was used to define a Dead Letter recipient. This
attribute was deleted from Release Candidate 2; however, the upgrading process
may not have deleted this attribute.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Launch the Exchange Administrator in raw mode by adding a forward slash and
  an r (/r) to the end of the command line.

2. Highlight the Configuration Object and select MTA Site Configuration.

3. On the File menu, select Raw Properties.

4. Locate the attribute DOMAIN-DEF-ALT-RECIP and delete the entry in the Edit
  Value field.

5. Press the Set button and click OK to exit the Raw Properties.

6. Using the Services tool in Control Panel, stop and restart the Microsoft
  Exchange Message Transfer Agent service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dead Letter recipient functionality provided a recipient for messages that
could not be delivered to the intended recipient. This functionality was deleted
in the Release Candidate 2.
