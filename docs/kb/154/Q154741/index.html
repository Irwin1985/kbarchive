The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates some techniques using the Visual FoxPro 3.0
Communications (MSComm) control for receiving and transmitting binary data over
RS-232 cable (without having modems).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Communications control, MSCOMM32.OCX, provides serial communications for
your application by allowing the transmission and reception of data through a
serial port where only a string of characters to the transmit buffer is
permitted. This feature limits you to transmitting only text- based files.

This article demonstrates how to use the MSComm control to transmit and receive
binary data using RS-232 cable. (The techniques in this article will also work
with modems.) The binary data must be converted one byte at a time to a
character and then transmitted. When received, the data must be converted from a
character back into binary data one byte at a time.

On DBCS-enabled operating systems (running operating system software that uses
one of the double-byte character sets), binary data will be corrupted if one of
the binary values matches a DBCS lead character. The MSComm control will
interpret this byte and the following byte as one double-byte character and
return only one byte for the equivalent ASCII character. To resolve this
problem, you need to convert one byte into ASCII size of three characters to
preserve the lead character.

Sample Code
-----------

The following code illustrates this process: WARNING: USE OF THE SAMPLE CODE
PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this sample
code "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or
fitness for a particular purpose.

  * Transmitter Code.

  * INIT event of Comm OLE control
  * 28800 baud, no parity, 8 data, and 1 stop bit.
  * In RS-232, maximum speed of 28800 baud can be used

     This.Settings = "28800,N,8,1"
     This.InputLen = 1
     This.CommPort = 1
     This.PortOpen = .T.

  * ONCOMM event of Comm OLE Control
  * The following code is needed to make sure that next set of characters
  * can be transmitted (CommEvent = 2 is triggered from the receiver side)

     IF This.CommEvent = 2
        This.input
         IF gnTop &lt;= gnEnd
           gcString = FREAD(gnFileHandle, 1)  &amp;&amp; Store to memory
           q=asc(gcstring)
           * change ASCII to character (size of 3) to preserve the lead char
      thisform.olecontrol1.output = str(q,3)
      gnTop = gnTop + 1
         ENDIF
     ENDIF

  * INIT event of form

     PUBLIC gnFileHandle
     PUBLIC gnEnd
     PUBLIC gnTop
     PUBLIC q

     * You should replace 'c:\sample.hlp' with your own binary file
     STORE FOPEN('c:\sample.hlp') TO gnFileHandle    &amp;&amp; Open the file
     STORE FSEEK(gnFileHandle, 0, 2) TO gnEnd  &amp;&amp; Move pointer to EOF
     STORE FSEEK(gnFileHandle, 0) TO gnTop  &amp;&amp; Move pointer to BOF
     gntop=1
     q=""

  -----------------------

  Property of OleControl1

  RThreshold = 1     * triggers when at least one char is on the buffer
  SThreshold = 3

  -----------------------

  * Receiver Code.

  * INIT event of OleControl1
  * 28800 baud, no parity, 8 data, and 1 stop bit.

     This.Settings = "28800,N,8,1"
     This.InputLen = 3
     This.CommPort = 1
     This.PortOpen = .T.

  * OnComm event

     IF This.CommEvent = 2 AND This.InBufferCount &gt; 0
        qq=CHR(VAL(This.Input))
        =FWRITE(gnFileHandle,qq)
        this.output = CHR(26)
     ENDIF

  * INIT event of form

     PUBLIC gnFileHandle

     * You should replace 'c:\sample.hlp' with your own file name
     IF FILE('c:\sample.hlp')  &amp;&amp; Does file exist?
        gnErrFile = FOPEN('c:\sample.hlp',12)  &amp;&amp; If so, open read-write
     ELSE
        gnErrFile = FCREATE('c:\sample.hlp')  &amp;&amp; If not, create it
     ENDIF

     = FCLOSE(gnErrFile)  &amp;&amp; Close the file

     STORE FOPEN('c:\sample.hlp',1) TO gnFileHandle     &amp;&amp; Open the file

  * CLICK event of button

     *This tells the transmitting side to start sending the file
     Thisform.Olecontrol1.output = CHR(26)

  -----------------------

  Property of OleControl1

  RThreshold = 3

  -----------------------

The event-driven technique generates an OnComm event when there are characters
waiting in the input buffer. Also, the CommEvent property will contain a numeric
2. For the OnComm event to be triggered, you must set the Rthreshold property to
a value other than zero (its default). The most common setting for the
RThreshold property is 1, meaning that the OnComm event is triggered if a
minimum of one character is waiting in the input buffer. In this article, 3 is
being used as a value of RThreshold property because 3 characters at a time are
being sent.
