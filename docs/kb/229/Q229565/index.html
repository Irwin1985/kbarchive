SYMPTOMS
========

When a client attempts to connect to a public folder in another site that has
public folder affinity configured but has no trust set up, the user may receive
the following error message:

  Unable to display the folder. The contents of this public folder are not
  currently available. Either the Microsoft Exchange server computer servicing
  this public folder is down or the public folder has not been replicated to
  this site. See your administrator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This occurs because there is not a trust between the two domains. For public
folder affinity to work between domains, the following conditions must be true:

- There must be at least a one-way trust.

- The domain with the site that has the folders has to trust the domain with
  the mailbox that needs access to the folders.

Then public folder affinity in the site where the mailboxes are located must be
configured. To set up public folder affinity, perform the following steps:

1. Log on as the Service Account to the Site where the mailboxes are located.

2. Go to the Properties of the Information Store Site Configuration, and click
  on the Public Folder Affinity tab.

3. Select the Site where the trust has been set up, and add it to the Public
  Folder Affinity list, which is on the right side.
