SUMMARY
=======

When you use Microsoft Windows NT Remote Client Installation, whether or not the
Systems Management Server (SMS) client is "pushed" to a client depends on the
Discovery Data Manager thread's evaluation of the discovery data record (DDR)
file that is processed for that system. DDRs can be generated by several
different methods, including by Network Discovery, Windows Networking Logon
Discovery, or Windows NT Server Discovery cause Discovery Data Manager to
generate a client configuration request (CCR). Discovery Data Manager verifies
that the prospective client is located within the site's boundaries before
Discovery Data Manager generates a CCR. The CCR triggers the Client
Configuration Manager (CCM) thread to attempt to install the SMS client on the
target Windows NT-based computer.

NOTE: For the purposes of this article, Microsoft Windows 2000-based computers
are identical to Windows NT-based computers. For example, Windows NT Remote
Client Installation also remotely installs to Windows 2000-based computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following criteria must be met for Discovery Data Manager to determine that
a CCR should be created:

- The architecture must be "System." Discovery Data Manager does not generate
  CCRs for routers, printers, or other network devices.

- The resource must not already be an existing client. If the resource is
  currently in the SMS database as a client, a CCR is not created.

- The resource must be assigned to the current site. The subnet of the target
  computer must be in the site boundaries for the site.

- The operating system type property must be "Windows NT." When you use Network
  Discovery as your discovery method, the "Topology, client, and client
  operating system" check box must be selected on the General tab in the
  Network Discovery properties.

- Windows NT Remote Client Installation must be enabled. You can configure
  Windows NT Remote Client Installation to push the SMS client to Windows
  NT-based workstations, Windows NT-based member servers, and Windows NT-based
  domain controllers. Windows NT Server Discovery cannot be disabled and causes
  CCRs to be generated for all site systems.

- The DDR must contain at least one property that allows a remote registry
  connection. Valid properties are NetBIOS name and IP or IPX Address.

- The computer name must not be present in the ExcludeServers registry key.

For additional information about a registry key that you can use to ensure that
the SMS client is not installed on a computer by Windows NT Remote Client
Installation, click the article number below to view the article in the

Installation Flow" section of Chapter 24 in the Microsoft BackOffice Resource
