-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Software inventory in Systems Management Server 2.0 does not report the Last
Accessed Date or Modified Date attributes of the files being inventoried. You
can use the Swinv.exe command-line tool to inventory the files you specify for
file attributes, including the Last Accessed Date, Creation Date, and Modified
Date attributes, and to report its information as a .csv file or a .mif file.

This tool works in Systems Management Server versions 1.2 and 2.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date      Time         Version       Size    File name   Platform
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  11/4/99   2:54pm   2.00.1250.6      36,864   Swinv.exe   i386
  11/4/99   3:01pm   2.00.1250.6      44,032   Swinv.exe   Alpha

The previous version of this fix had the following file attributes:

  Date      Time         Version       Size    File name   Platform
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  2/19/99   6:16pm   2.00.1250.0000   36,864   Swinv.exe   i386
  2/19/99   6:16pm   2.00.1250.0000   33,280   Swinv.exe   Alpha

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have previously used the old version of the Swinv.exe tool, then you must
first delete the AuditedSoftware and InventoryFiles group classes using the
DELGRP utility from the Windows Resource Kit. Then use SQL Enterprise Manager to
drop the following stored procedures:

  pInventory_Files_DATA
  dInventory_Files_DATA
  pAudited_Software_DATA
  dAudited_Software_DATA

NOTE: After you delete the SQL stored procedures, stop and restart the SMS
Executive service. These stored procedures are recreated when you load the first
new Swinv noidmif into the database.

NOTE: If this is not done, the dataloader does not load into the database mifs
produced by the new version of the Swinv.exe tool.

The syntax for Swinv.exe is

  swinv [/format:{csv|idmif|noidmif}] [/detail:{both|software|file}] [/drive:{a-z}*] 
  [/path:[path] [/yield:&lt;delay&gt;] [/output:drive:\[path\] [file].ext | *

where:

- /format specifies the type of output created: csv, idmif, or noidmif. It
  defaults to csv if no option is specified.

  NOTE: On Systems Management Server 2.0 clients, the IDMIF option is not
  currently supported in this tool.

- /detail specifies the type of information retrieved by SWINV. "Software"
  returns the following information from the file headers:

   - Company Name

   - Product Name

   - Product Version

  "File" returns the following file attributes:

   - File Name

   - File Size

   - File Version

   - Company Name

   - Product Name

   - Product Version

   - File Location

   - Accessed

   - Created

   - Modified

  "Both" combines the two. SWINV defaults to "both" if no option is specified.

  NOTE: There is no method of specifying particular attributes.

- /drive specifies the disk that is searched. You can specify a single drive
  letter and SWINV scans only that drive. If a drive letter is not specified,
  SWINV defaults to scan all local hard disks.

- /path specifies a directory to start searching. SWINV searches the specified
  folder and all its subfolders. If /drive is not specified and multiple drives
  have directories with that name, SWINV scans them all. If /path is not
  specified, SWINV defaults to a root folder search path.

- /yield causes SWINV to pause for the specified number of milliseconds every
  time it changes a directory during its search. This allows it to yield
  processor time to another running application. If /yield is not specified,
  SWINV defaults to zero milliseconds, which gives the maximum scan rate.

- /output writes the output to the path specified. It defaults to the Systems
  Management Server idmif or noidmif path (specified in c:\Sms.ini or
  Smscfg.ini); otherwise c:\Swinv.

NOTES:

- When used, the output path must be a folder name only. When the format is ID
  or NOID MIF, /output must not be used.

- The final parameter is required and is a filter that tells SWINV what files
  to look for. It takes the form:

     .ext (not *.ext)  -- all files with the specified extension
     Filename.ext      -- specific file name


The following sample usage provides some examples for how to use SWINV:

  
  C:\&gt;swinv /format:idmif /detail:software .exe .com
  C:\&gt;swinv /drive:m /output:c:\nwsys .exe .com .dll .ocx
  C:\&gt;swinv /format:noidmif /path:"My Documents" .doc
  C:\&gt;swinv /format:noidmif doom.exe

SWINV is completely silent unless the /? switch is used. It logs messages to the
Swinv.log file, located in the root of drive C.

After running SWINV and creating a noidmif file, in order for the information to
be reported to the Systems Management Server database, hardware inventory (not
software inventory) must run to pick up the noidmif file.

After the noidmif has been processed, you can view the data by using Resource
Explorer in Systems Management Server 2.0 or by opening Machine Properties in
Systems Management Server 1.2. The file attribute information (/detail:file) is
reported in the Inventory Files Group under Hardware Inventory. The file header
information (/detail:software) is reported in the Audited Software Group also
under Hardware Inventory.
