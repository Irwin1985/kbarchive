-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Packages installed months, weeks, or days earlier are suddenly reinstalled at
some Systems Management Server clients.

This problem occurs only on Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 and
Service Pack 4.

CAUSE
=====

Deletion, corruption, or a purge in the local Package Command Manager (PCM)
history file, Pcmhist.reg, may lead to this problem.

When such a situation occurs, PCM rebuilds a new file containing all the packages
available in the computer instruction (.ins) file, even if these packages were
already installed as mandatory packages.

A feature introduced in Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 allows this
behavior. For additional information about this feature, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q174933 SMS: PCM Service Job Does Not Log Failure If Not Mandatory

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
