SYMPTOMS
========

After you restart a computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server and no one has
logged on, you are unable to log on to the computer (locally or to the domain)
and the following error message is displayed:

  This workstation is in use and has been locked.
  The workstation can only be unlocked by \ or an administrator.
  Press CTRL + ALT + DELETE to unlock this workstation.

If you try to unlock the computer, the following error message is displayed:

  This workstation is locked. Only \ or an administrator can unlock this
  workstation.

Or, if a user has logged on and off, you are unable to log on to the computer
(locally or to the domain), and the following error message is displayed:

  This workstation is in use and has been locked.
  The workstation can only be unlocked by &lt;domain\user&gt; or an
  administrator.
  Press CTRL + ALT + DELETE to unlock this workstation.

If you try to unlock the computer, the following error message is displayed:

  This workstation is locked. Only &lt;domain\user&gt; or an administrator can
  unlock this workstation.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 when you change the default
screen saver program to a nonexistent screen saver program or to one that is
corrupted.

The registry location for screen saver program information is
HKEY_USERS\.Default\Control Panel\Desktop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use another screen saver program (such as Logon.scr)
that has password functionality.

To work around this problem and still be able to log on when the error message
states that it is locked by \:

1. When the logon screen appears, clear the Username box.

2. Clear the Domain Name box, and then clear the Password box.

3. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, and log on normally.

To work around this problem and still be able to log on when the error message
states that it is locked by &lt;domain\user&gt;:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to unlock the computer.

2. Type the logon information for the last logged on user, and then click OK.

3. When the unlock computer dialog box disappears, press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, and
  then log on normally.

NOTE: If you do not use one of these methods to log on, you must restart the
computer and log on before the screen saver program starts. You can use the
Shutdown utility in the Windows NT Resource Kit to shut down the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
