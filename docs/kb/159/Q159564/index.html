MORE INFORMATION
================

CPS (Client Profile Setup) Utility Obsolete
-------------------------------------------

The Client Profile Setup utility, or CPS, was a solution developed for Microsoft
Windows NT 3.51. For the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kits, the CPS utility
is no longer supported or developed.

The new tools for automating Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 setup are setupmgr.exe and
sysdiff.exe. For further information about these tools, please consult the
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit printed documentation or RKTOOLS.HLP.

Desktop Themes Crashes When JPEG Filter is Used
-----------------------------------------------

Symptoms:
Desktop Themes might crash (and generate a Dr. Watson log) with any of the
following symptoms:

 Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)
 Exception:  access violation (Oxc0000005)
 error in themes.exe
 Desktop Themes closes without warning

Correction:
The Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit team has developed a patch to address this
problem for all Windows NT platforms. This patch is available for free download
at the following ftp site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/

Note: You must have the original Windows NT 4.0 Desktop Themes program installed
in order for the patch to work properly.


Cause
Microsoft Office 97 (and possibly other programs) installs a JPEG filter that is
incompatible with the initial release of Desktop Themes included in the Windows
NT 4.0 Resource Kit. This incompatibility is not a problem with Microsoft Office
97. The only complete resolution is to obtain the Desktop Themes patch file.
Workaround:
To circumvent this issue without the patch, use the following steps:

1. Open Desktop Themes

2. Click the Save As button, then enter the theme named "Original
  Settings.Theme" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK to save your
  current settings as a theme

  When you save or change the current theme settings, the Settings check boxes
  become available. You now also have a desktop theme with a .BMP wallpaper.

3. Uncheck the desktop theme wallpaper option before changing desktop themes,
  and then set your theme as normal and click OK to save your change

4. To change the desktop theme again, open the Desktop Themes program in the
  Control Panel and then select the "Original Settings" theme. This theme has a
  .BMP wallpaper and should not cause Desktop Themes to crash. After changing
  the theme selection, you can once again disable the Wallpaper checkbox before
  choosing a theme that has a JPEG wallpaper.

If you wish to use the wallpapers without the patch, use another program to
convert the appropriate .JPG file into a .BMP file, and then change the display
background setting to the new .BMP file.

Please e-mail RKINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM if you find additional information regarding
this issue such as:

- Other applications known to conflict with Desktop Themes

- Other symptoms resolved by installing the Desktop Themes patch


MAILSRV: Known issues, alternatives, and support policy
-------------------------------------------------------

Summary
The Mail Server 1.1 utility (MailSrv) provided with the "Microsoft Windows NT
Server Resource Kit, Version 4.0" was designed as a basic SMTP and POP3 mail
server implementation. It was never designed or intended to be a
mission-critical, secure, or enterprise-scale solution. Microsoft has developed
two full-featured mail servers to provide superior functionality and
reliability. Microsoft recommends implementing a more secure and reliable mail
service than can be managed by the MailSrv utility, and for this reason MailSrv
has been discontinued.

More Information
The following problems have been reported with the MailSrv utility on the
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit CD-ROM.

- Mail sent to the MailSrv server is held in the spool directory and is not
  distributed to the appropriate user.

- Over a period of time, MailSrv might slowly take up to 100 percent of the
  available CPU cycles. Stopping or restarting local mail delivery service,
  POP3 service, and SMTP service will release the CPU cycles.

The Resource Kit development team is aware of these problems and will post
further information as it becomes available. However, the MailSrv utility is no
longer included with the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit. MailSrv.Exe was not
included on the "Microsoft Windows NT Server Resource Kit, Version 4.0,
Supplement One" CD-ROM, and MailSrv will not be included with any future
supplements or releases.

Alternatives
Microsoft produces two robust, secure, and full-featured mail service solutions
for an enterprise system: Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Commercial
Internet System, formerly code-named Normandy.

More information about Microsoft Exchange Server can be found on the following
Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/

More information about Microsoft Commercial Internet System and other Microsoft
enterprise solutions can be found at:

  http://backoffice.microsoft.com/

by clicking the Product Information hyperlink.

If you are looking for a small-scale Windows NT mail server solution, you might
find that a suitable freeware or shareware mail server is available. You can
find a list of third party mail server vendors by going to the following Web
site and searching for the Mail Server product category:

  http://msdnisv.microsoft.com/communication/

This site is subject to regular change, and most of the freeware and shareware
hyperlinks are updated and replaced with newer links.

NTPERL5.HTM File Missing
------------------------

NTPERL5.HTM is referenced in the following text files:
\COMMON\COMMON\PERL\README.TXT and \SOURCE\GNU\PERL\README.TXT. However,
NTPERL5.HTM is not on the NT Resource Kit CD-ROM.

More information:
The Windows NT 3.51 Resource Kit Update volume 2 contains NTPERL5.HTM and some
additional files not found on the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit CD-ROM. This is
because the PERL documentation files are an image of information posted on
public domain Internet sites not controlled or authored by Microsoft.

Correction:
The following text should appear at the top of the above README.TXT files:

***** PERL Documentation disclaimer *****
The PERL HTML documentation including the following README.TXT was
copied from public domain Internet sites.

Microsoft does not claim responsibility for any inaccuracies or
missing files related to the PERL scripting documentation
included with the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit. Please
note that NTPERL5.HTM is referenced in this file, but this file
was not included on the file image for this Windows NT Resource
Kit CD-ROM.
***************************************************

Microsoft is researching this issue and will post further information in this
article when available.

RKTOOLS.HLP: Desktop Themes Install Instructions Incorrect
----------------------------------------------------------

In the RKTOOLS.HLP section for Desktop Themes for Windows NT 4.0, the link to Run
Desktop Themes will display installation instructions if Desktop Themes is not
already installed. However, these instructions are incorrect.

To properly install the Desktop Themes utility, insert the Windows NT Resource
Kit CD-ROM and run the following command (where D: is assumed to be the CD-ROM
drive letter):

  D:\APPS\THEMES\SETUP.EXE

SYSDIFF.EXE: Unable to load sysdiff INF C:\RESKIT\sysdiff...
------------------------------------------------------------

The following error message will occur if Sysdiff.inf is not in the directory
containing SYSDIFF.EXE:

  Unable to load sysdiff INF C:\RESKIT\sysdiff.inf.
  This file is required in SNAP and DIFF modes. Consult the Windows
  NT OEM Preinstall Kit documentation for more information.

The information below is from the following Knowledge Base article:

  Q159624 Err Msg: Incorrect Arguments. Consult the Windows NT

Cause:
The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit CD-ROM does not include the Sysdiff.inf file that
is required for the Sysdiff tool to work properly.

Resolution:
To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Use the Sysdiff tool from the Support\Deptools\&lt;platform&gt; folder on
  your Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM.

- Copy Sysdiff.inf from your Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM into the folder from where
  you are running the Sysdiff tool.

Status:
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit
version 4.0 and will post new information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.

Sysdiff /diff "error=112" Caused By Insufficient Disk Space
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sysdiff /diff tries to generate a difference file containing a list of
differences between an earlier snapshot of the system and the system as it
exists at the time /diff is used. If there is insufficient hard disk space to
generate this file, error 112 will occur.

Error 112 is a standard Win32 error code, and represents an "out of disk space"
error. Please check to ensure sufficient hard disk space available.

Note: If large amounts of changes were made since the initial snapshot, your
diff_file will likewise be large. As per the Workstation Resource Guide Chapter
2 (book online, index entry "Sysdiff utility"), "The information in the
difference file includes all the binary files for the applications, as well as
the initialization file settings and registry settings for the applications."
You can also use the /log switch to trace the activities of Sysdiff during the
/diff operation.

Several NT 4.0 Resource Kit Utilities Missing
---------------------------------------------

The following Resource Kit utilities are mentioned in the
\COMMON\COMMON\RKTOOLS.HLP file, but they are not present on the Windows NT
Resource Kit CD-ROM:

- GLOBAL.EXE*

- LOCAL.EXE*

- GRPCPY.EXE

- SHOWMBRS.EXE**

* GLOBAL.EXE and LOCAL.EXE have been completed for the Intel x86 platform and are
available at the following ftp address:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/

** SHOWMBRS.EXE is present on the Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit CD-ROM.

More Information:
These utilities were planned for release with the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit but
were either incomplete or not stable when the Resource Kit released. Some
utilities have been completed and added to the Windows NT ftp address. The
Resource Kit team is working to provide the remaining utilities later either via
the Resource Kit ftp site or in future updates or supplemental volumes of the
Windows NT Resource Kit.

Service Monitor Requires Update After Password Change
-----------------------------------------------------

The Service Monitor uses your domain\username, password. If your password changes
the Service Monitor will no longer work correctly. To correct this - re-run the
Service Monitor Configuration Wizard (smconfig.exe) and enter your new password.
The configuration wizard will re-install the service based on this new
password.

TELNETD Service Does Not Install Properly
-----------------------------------------

The Telnet Server service does not install properly as described in TELNET.WRI.
When adding the Telnet service, the instructions state to select the Remote
Session Manager. However, the only selection available is Telnet Service Beta
(Inbound Telnet).

More Information:
This issue has been addressed in a new OEMSETUP.INF file for the TelnetD service.
To obtain a copy of the latest OEMSETUP.INF for TelnetD, connect to
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/ and download
OEMSETUP.INF directly to your Resource Kit Telnet directory (typically
C:\RESKIT\TELNET).

If you do not have access to ftp, you can e-mail RKINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM with the
following subject line:

  TELNET OEMSETUP.INF REQUEST

The RKINPUT alias will reply by sending a corrected OEMSETUP.INF.

UPTOMP.EXE Error "Unable to locate the UPTOMP.INF file"
-------------------------------------------------------

Clicking on the Uni to Multiprocessor icon in the Start Menu causes the following
error:

  Unable to locate the UPTOMP.INF file. This file should be in the same
  directory as the executable file or in the windows directory.

Other error dialog boxes may follow as well.

This error occurs because the Start Menu shortcut for UPTOMP.EXE does not set the
working directory to the RESKIT directory. Changing the Start In shortcut
property for the UPTOMP.EXE icon to C:\RESKIT will correct this problem for a
default Resource Kit installation.

Workaround:
To successfully run the Uni to Multiprocessor conversion program, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, then click Programs, and then click Command Prompt

2. Change directory to your Windows NT Resource Kit directory. For instance:

    CD \WINNT\NTRESKIT\ 

3. Type "UPTOMP.EXE" (without the quotation marks) and then press Enter

UPTOMP.EXE Does Not Copy WIN32K.SYS
-----------------------------------

UPTOMP.EXE, included with the "Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit" to assist
in copying the correct files, does not copy the file WIN32K.SYS. This file needs
to be copied for multiprocessor operation.

An update to UPTOMP.INF is available to correct this problem and can be obtained
from the following Internet ftp site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/

Workaround:
To manually correct the UPTOMP.INF file, use the following steps:

1. Open \RESKIT\UPTOMP.INF with Notepad or the editor of your choice.

2. Add the following text directly below the line beginning with "Winsrv.dll":

     win32k.sys = 0, 2, win32k.sys

  Note: This new line must be entered above the black box that represents the
  end-of-file marker for this file.

If you already ran UPTOMP.EXE and can no longer boot to Windows NT, you might
need to manually copy WIN32K.SYS from the Windows NT CD-ROM to your Windows NT
System32 directory. If you can boot to Windows NT, change UPTOMP.INF as noted
above and re-run UPTOMP.EXE.

Cannot Read Help Files Due To Missing WINHLP32.exe
--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOM
When opening RKTOOLS.HLP or one of the other help files included on the Windows
NT 4.0 Server or Workstation Resource Kit CD-ROM, you might receive the
following error messages:

  "This file is not a valid Windows help file."

  "A newer version of help is required to view this file."

CAUSE
The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit help files require WINHLP32.EXE to be installed
on the system. WINHELP.EXE will produce the errors listed above.

RESOLUTION
Check to make sure that WINHLP32.EXE is installed on your system.

1. Click the Start button, then click Find, then click Files or Folders

2. Type "WINHLP32.EXE" (without the quotation marks) in the Named field, and
  then click the Find Now button

If WINHLP32.EXE is not present, reinstall or expand this file from the Windows NT
product CD-ROM.If WINHLP32.EXE is installed on the computer but WINHELP.EXE is
still started when you open any help file, then use the following steps to check
and update the application that is associated with Help files:

1. Click the Start button, then click programs, and then click Windows NT
  Explorer

2. Click the View menu, and then click Options

3. Click the File Types tab in the Options dialog box, then locate and select
  the Help File registered file type, and then click the Edit button.

4. Double-click the Open action. The default value for the "Application used to
  perform this action" field should be:

      C:\WINNT\system32\winhlp32.exe

  Note that your system32 path directory might differ. If this field references
  WINHELP.EXE instead of WINHLP32.EXE, update the field and then click OK.

5. Click Close, and then click Close again to update the file association
