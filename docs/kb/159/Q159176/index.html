-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store service may appear to stop
responding with 90 to 100 percent CPU time. Any clients may also stop
responding; the cursor turns into the "wait" symbol (hourglass). When this
problem occurs, stopping and starting the Information Store reduces the CPU
usage to normal levels and frees up the clients.

CAUSE
=====

A Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store thread loops forever on a Winsock
recv() function. Winsock recv() is returning zero bytes received because the
remote computer has gracefully disconnected the connection.

The reason for the problem is that the Information Store thread is stuck in a
remote procedure call (RPC). The RPC routine is continually calling the Winsock
recv() function because it is returning zero bytes read, which is an error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, download and install the appropriate file:

Windows NT 3.51

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT351/hotfixes-postSP5/rpc-fix

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP2/rpc-fix

STATUS
======

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 4.0.

A fully supported fix is now available, but it has not been fully regression
tested and should only be applied to systems determined to be at risk of attack.
Please evaluate your system's physical accessibility, network and Internet
connectivity, and other factors to determine the degree of risk to your system.
If your system is sufficiently at risk, Microsoft recommends you apply this fix.
Otherwise, wait for the next Windows NT service pack, which will contain this
fix. Please contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.


Windows NT 3.51
---------------

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 3.51. A fully supported fix is now
available, but it has not been fully regression tested and should only be
applied to systems determined to be at risk of attack. Please evaluate your
system's physical accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other
factors to determine the degree of risk to your system. If your system is
sufficiently at risk, Microsoft recommends you apply this fix. Otherwise, wait
for the next Windows NT service pack, which will contain this fix. Please
contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
