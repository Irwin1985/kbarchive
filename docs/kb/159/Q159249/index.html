SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information on known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Inside Visual C++ Version 4."

The following topics are covered:

- CD-ROM: Setup can't copy some files in directory EXE07B

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, each entry in this document
might also include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note
that the "Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not
necessarily address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments"
section contains specific information for working around the problem.

CD-ROM:  Setup can't copy some files in directory EXE07B
--------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
--------

On some configurations of Microsoft Windows 95, running the CD-ROM Setup program
returns the following error:

  System is unable to find the specified files.

Attempting to copy these files using Copy, XCOPY, Windows 95 Explorer, or File
Manager will return the error, "File not found." Furthermore, changing to
different directories on this CD-ROM produces unexpected results, including the
apparent disappearance of the directory.

CAUSE
=====

Comments:
This CD-ROM was duplicated using long filenames.

The ISO 9660 specification, which is a long-standing CD-ROM file system (CDFS)
specification, does not allow filenames longer than 8 characters, spaces, or
lowercase letters in filenames. Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and MS-DOS (with or
without Windows 3.1) cannot read CD-ROM filenames that contain spaces or
lowercase letters. However, Microsoft Windows 95 extends the CDFS to allow
spaces, lowercase letters, and long filenames by using CD-ROM drivers designed
for this capability.

Because Windows 95 permits extended CD-ROM filenames, it does not have problems
reading the CD-ROM for this book. However, Windows 95 configurations that use
MS-DOS (or real mode) CD-ROM drivers will not be able to access the extended
CD-ROM filenames on this CD-ROM.


WORKAROUND
==========

For Windows 95, the best method of correcting this problem is to obtain a
Windows 95 CD-ROM driver. Please contact your CD-ROM manufacturer for the latest
Windows 95 drivers for your model CD-ROM drive. Many CD-ROM drive manufacturers
also offer free driver updates via the Internet. These drivers can be located by
searching for the manufacturer's company name on the World Wide Web using any
major Web search site.

If new drivers are not available, upgrading to a newer CD-ROM drive (and
installing the appropriate CD-ROM driver for Windows 95) will also resolve this
problem.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
