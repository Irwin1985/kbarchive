- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Zip IDE Insider drive is a IDE-based removable media drive. This article
will discuss information about settings and troubleshooting of this device.

Currently, the Zip IDE Insider will only work on Windows NT 4.0. Windows NT 3.51
has no removable IDE capability in its Atapi.sys driver because no removable IDE
media products were available during its product cycle.

The Windows NT 4.0 ATAPI driver is designed to recognize the new capabilities of
removable IDE products such as the IOMEGA Zip IDE Insider or the SyQuest
DataFlyer 230 IDE, and so forth.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, there are no plans to add removable media IDE capability to the
Windows NT 3.51 Atapi.sys driver.

Zip Jumper Information
----------------------

The Zip IDE Insider has a row of jumpers on the back of the unit that are
jumpered 1-3 and 5-6 from the factory.

If you are having problems getting Windows NT 4.0 to use this device you may need
to jumper pins 3 and 4 together. This enables media status notification, which
is vital to its operation in Windows NT. Otherwise, the unit will effectively
emulate a hard disk drive and can even be detected by IDE hard disk drive
detection programs typical in the BIOS of a modern computer.

1-3 Jumper is unknown at this time but appears to have no effect. 5-6 reflect
Master/Slave. No jumper on 5-6 equals Slave, Jumpered equals Master.

It is not recommended that you allow your computer's BIOS to detect and set
Cylinder/Head/Sectors settings for the Zip Insider as it will negate its
removable media properties and you will be unable to remount another Zip disk if
you eject the Zip disk while the Zip Insider is configured as a hard drive in
BIOS regardless of the operating system.

Note: The following information applies only to Windows NT 3.51. This issue was
resolved in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.

In addition, you should not format these disks with NTFS if you desire to use
several disks while in a single session of Microsoft Windows NT. This is because
NTFS is not a remountable file system and will disable software and hardware
ejections of the Zip drive while you are running Windows NT. After you have
shutdown, you can change Zip disks freely. If your Zip disks are left formatted
as FAT you change Zip disks freely.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
