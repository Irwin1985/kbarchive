MSN Starter Kit Tips and Troubleshooting
----------------------------------------

Thank you for choosing the Microsoft Network (MSN). This document contains
information that will help you solve common problems and get the most out
of MSN.

2.  System Requirements
3.  Video Cards and Display Problems
4.  Hard Disk Location of MSN Program Files

6.  Installation Problems

1.    MSN Starter Kit Contents
---------------------------

The MSN Starter Kit supports the Windows 95 AutoPlay feature and will start
automatically when you put the MSN Starter Kit CD in your CD-ROM drive.
There are two programs on the CD:

 - MSN Preview : a multimedia preview of the new MSN. It explains some of
   MSN's features and what you can expect as a member.

 - MSN Setup : a program which installs and configures the software
   necessary to access the new MSN.

The MSN Starter Kit supports the Windows 95 AutoPlay feature, and will
start the MSN Starter Kit automatically when you put the MSN Starter Kit CD
in your CD-ROM drive. One way to cure problems you encounter is to quit the
program, remove the CD from your CD-ROM drive, and then re-insert it. As
the MSN Starter Kit starts up again, it should be able to fix most problems
you might have encountered. If it doesn't, see the other items in this Read
Me or the Tips and Troubleshooting section of Help.

NOTE: If your CD-ROM driver is not Windows 95 compliant, install the MSN
Starter Kit using the following instructions:

  1. Insert the MSN Starter Kit CD in your CD-ROM drive.

  2. Click the Start button in the lower left hand corner of the Windows
95 Taskbar, and then click Run.

  3. In the Open dialog box, type the following (presuming that your CD-
ROM drive is drive D):  D:\msnstart (and click OK)

The first time you insert the CD the MSN Preview will run. Subsequent
insertions of the MSN Starter CD will display a menu of choices to run:

 1. The MSN Preview
 2. MSN Setup
 3. Connection Troubleshooter

Before installation, MSN Setup attempts to locate the software it requires
on your hard disk; if the software is not found, MSN Setup will install it.
However, MSN Setup will always install:

 - The three components of the show Rifff
 - The Media files

2. System Requirements
----------------------

 - Windows95
 - Personal computer with a 486/66 or higher processor
 - 14.4 Kbps modem or higher
 - 8MB of memory required, 16MB recommended
 - 50MB additional hard disk space
 - CD-ROM drive (2x or higher)
 - VGA or higher resolution graphics card.
 - Sound card recommended
 - Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device

MSN is only compatible with Windows 95. It does not run on Windows NT or on
Windows 3.1. In the future it is possible that MSN will support these
operating systems but as of the date of this writing, October 1996, no
support is available.

In order to fully experience MSN you will need a sound card and speakers.
MSN will function properly but audio is integral to the full experience.
Also, the MSN Preview program included on this disk makes extensive use of
audio and will not be useful if you do not have sound capabilities.

3. Video Cards and Display Problems
------------------------------------

LESS THAN 256 COLORS

The MSN Starter Kit will not run if your display is set to 16-color mode -
it is designed to run at 640x480 resolution, or higher, with a minimum of
256 colors. If your display is set to show 16 colors, change your display
setting to show 256 colors or more. If you experience problems with display
colors, check your color configuration:

 1. Go to the Start Menu and select the Control Panel option from the
Settings menu choice.

 2. Open the Display icon.

 3. Select the Settings tab.

 4. From the "Color Palette" box, select 256 colors or anything higher
than 16 colors.

MORE THAN 256 COLORS

Some video cards may encounter problems when using accelerated video
drivers, video drivers with more than 256 colors, or high resolution video
drivers. If you run into display problems:

 1. Try switching to a driver supplied with Windows 95.

 2. Change to a different display mode. An alternative to using a
different driver is to change your video mode to a standard video mode such
as 640x480 resolution with 256 colors.

For details on how to change drivers or switch to a different display mode,
see your Windows documentation.

NEC computers using the Alliance Promotion video card do not work well with
the MSN Starter Kit. Please contact your computer dealer for assistance.

4. Hard Disk Location of MSN Program Files
------------------------------------------

The majority of the files MSN requires need to be stored on your System
Disk (the drive from which your computer boots; generally the C: drive).
If you do not have enough space on your System drive, Setup will notify you
and provides an "Expert" option. If you select Expert installation you will
be prompted several times during installation for an alternative storage
area (i.e. other than your System drive).

5. Microsoft Internet Explorer Installation
-------------------------------------------

MSN requires Internet Explorer (IE) version 3.01 or higher. If you have an
older version of IE, MSN Setup will install a new version. During IE
installation, you will be prompted to accept the IE End User License
Agreement. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE IE LICENSE AGREEMENT, MSN SETUP WILL
FAIL AND YOU WILL NOT BE PROPERLY CONFIGURED TO ACCESS MSN. YOU MUST ACCEPT
THE IE LICENSE IN ORDER TO USE MSN.

6. Installation Problems
------------------------

You may sometimes get the error "MSNAUDIO.ACM is in use. Retry / Cancel"
when installing the Interactive Music Architecture. Click on "Cancel".

7. Connection Problems
----------------------

If you click on MSN Program Viewer, and you don't get the sign in screen
but instead get a message saying: "http://onstage.msn.com could not be
found" refer to the MSN troubleshooter. If you are still unable to connect
to MSN, check the following:

  - Insert the text from the EA CD README file. Include sections on proxy,
dialup provider, etc.

  - Make sure you do not have Connect Through a Proxy Server enabled in
IE.

8. Improving Performance
------------------------

Make sure that Windows 95 is optimized for your CD-ROM drive. Windows 95
provides settings for CD caching and for accessing various CD-ROM drive
speeds.

To review these settings:

  1. Select the "My Computer" icon on your desktop and click it with the
secondary mouse button (usually the right mouse button).

  2. Choose Properties.

  3. Choose the Performance tab.

  4. Choose the File System button.

  5. Choose the CD-ROM tab.
     In this box, make sure that the Supplemental Cache size is set to
     "Large." Also, verify that the Optimize access pattern is correctly
     set for the type of CD-ROM drive that is installed on your system
     (the MSN Starter Kit requires a double speed, or faster, CD-ROM
     drive).

9. CD-ROM Issues
----------------
EJECTING THE CD WHILE THE APPLICATION IS RUNNING

Do not remove the CD-ROM disc while you are running the MSN Starter Kit.
If you eject the MSN Starter Kit disc from the CD-ROM drive while running
the MSN Starter Kit, insert a disc for another program, you'll get a System
Error message. Reinsert the MSN Starter Kit disc, then choose Enter.
CONFLICTS WITH THE CD-ROM DRIVE

In Windows 95, follow these procedures to check for conflicts with your CD-
ROM drive:

  1. Double click on the "My Computer" icon with the right mouse button.

  2. Select Properties, to open the System Properties window.

  3. Select the Device Manager tab and look for the CD-ROM drive in the
list. If it appears with an exclamation point to the left of it, there is a
conflict with your hardware setup. Check the manuals that came with your CD-
ROM drive for information on how to set up your CD-ROM drive or contact the
manufacturer.
CD-ROM DRIVE CONFLICTS WITH WINDOWS 95 AUTOPLAY FEATURE

AutoPlay is a Windows 95 feature that automatically starts an application
when you put its CD in your CD-ROM drive. If the MSN Starter Kit does not
start automatically, your CD-ROM driver does not support AutoPlay or the
AutoPlay feature is disabled. To start the MSN Starter Kit manually:

  1. Insert the MSN Starter Kit CD-ROM.

  2. Click the Start button in the lower left hand corner of the Windows
95 Taskbar, and select Run.

  3. Enter "D:\msnstart.exe" (without quotation marks) in the Open dialog.

  4. Click OK, and the MSN Starter Kit will start.
The MSN Starter Kit will also create an icon in your Start menu - to start
MSN in the future, simply select MSN on your Start menu.
DISABLING WINDOWS 95 AUTOPLAY

To prevent Windows 95 from playing the MSN Starter Kit CD automatically,
press down and hold the SHIFT key as you insert the CD into the CD-ROM
drive.

10. Removing MSN Files and Shortcuts
------------------------------------

If you want to remove the MSN Program Viewer, you can delete them with the
Add/Remove Programs feature on the Windows 95 Control Panel control panel.
For details on using the Add/Remove Programs feature, see your Windows
documentation.
