SUMMARY
=======

This article provides troubleshooting ideas for OSPF routers that are not able
to establish an Adjacency. An Adjacency is established when the Link State
database of neighboring routers is fully synchronized.

1. Ping the neighboring router to ensure basic network connectivity.

2. Windows NT OSPF routers have Authentication enabled by default. The default
  password is 12345678. Be sure to change the Authentication to match all
  neighboring OSPF routers. The password is configured on a per- interface
  basis on the General tab. Passwords are case sensitive.

3. Be sure that the Hello and Dead intervals match the Hello and Dead intervals
  of neighboring OSPF routers. By default the Hello interval is 10 seconds and
  the Dead interval is 40 seconds. These intervals are configured on a
  per-interface basis in the Advanced tab.

4. Be sure that area border routers (ABR) are on the backbone 0.0.0.0. Area
  border routers are routers that are part of two or more different OSPF areas.
  An ABR does not have to be physically on the backbone if a virtual link has
  been created, attaching it to the backbone. Virtual links are configured
  globally on the Virtual Interfaces tab. Virtual neighbors must be configured
  using the router ID, not just any IP address.

5. If the routers are on a non-broadcast multi access (NBMA) network, such as
  X.25 or frame relay, their neighbors must be manually configured because
  neighbors are unable to be found through multicast. Neighbors are configured
  on a per-interface basis on the Neighbors tab. Neighbors must be configured
  using the IP address of the neighbor to which the link state information
  needs to be sent.

6. If you have an NBMA network, such as X.25 or frame relay, that is in a hub
  and spoke configuration, be sure to set the router priority on spoke routers
  to 0 and the hub router to 1 or greater. A router priority of 0 means that
  the router cannot become a designated router (DR) . The hub router must be
  the DR because it is the only router that can communicate directly with all
  other routers. The router priority defaults to 1 and is set on a
  per-interfaces basis on the General tab.

7. On broadcast (token ring, Ethernet, FDDI) or NBMA networks (X.25, frame
  relay), be sure that all routers do not have a priority of 0. At least one
  router needs a priority of 1 or greater to become the designated router.

8. Be sure neighboring routers are configured correctly with the same area ID.

9. When you configure an OSPF router, be careful not to duplicate router
  identification numbers. The router identification number should uniquely
  identify a router throughout the OSPF autonomous system.
