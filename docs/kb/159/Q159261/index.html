SUMMARY
=======

The Word FILLIN field prompts you for text that is used as the FILLIN field
result. The maximum number of characters that can be entered in a FILLIN field
is 255. In addition, the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications InputBox
statement is restricted to this 255 character limitation.

Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications allows you to construct a dialog box
using the UserForm command. The form can contain text box controls into which
you can type more than 255 characters. This article describes how to create and
display the form.

Creating the user form
----------------------

Create the form using the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Visual Basic Editor.

2. In the Visual Basic project window, click Normal.

  The form will be available to all documents.

3. On the Insert menu, click UserForm.

4. Click the TextBox control on the Toolbox toolbar and then click the form.

  The text box control appears in the default size. Drag a sizing handle to
  resize the control or drag the control to move it to a new location.

5. Click the CommandButton control on the Toolbox toolbar and then click the
  form.

  The command button control appears in the default size. Drag a sizing handle
  to resize the control or drag the control to move it to a new location.

  Repeat this step to add a second CommandButton control.

6. Select the first command button control and then click Code on the View menu.

7. In the Code window, type "Selection.TypeText TextBox1.Text" (without the
  quotation marks), so that your code looks like this:

         Private Sub CommandButton1_Click ()
            Selection.TypeText TextBox1.Text
            'When you click this button on the form, the contents of the text
            'box is inserted into the active document at the location of the
            'insertion point.
         End sub

8. On the View menu, click Object to return to the form.

9. Select the second command button control and then click Code on the View
  menu.

10. In the Code window, type "End" (without the quotation marks), so that your
  code looks like this:

         Private Sub CommandButton2_Click ()
            End
            'When you click this button after you click the first command
            'button, the form is closed. If you click this button instead of
            'the first command button, the form is canceled.
         End sub

11. On the File menu, click Save Normal.

Displaying the form
-------------------

To display the form, switch to Word, and then do the following:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

2. In the Macro Name box, type "FillInForm" (without the quotation marks) and
  then click Create.

3. In the Code window, type "UserForm1.Show" (without the quotation marks), so
  that your code looks like this:

        Sub FillInForm()
           UserForm1.Show
        End Sub

4. Save and close the macro.

5. Close the Visual Basic Editor.

6. You can now run the macro from Word to display the form.

If you want default text to appear in the text box, create the following
initialize event for the UserForm object. To do this, use the following steps:

1. Double-click the form.

2. From the Object drop-down list, select UserForm.

3. From the Procedure drop-down list, select Initialize.

4. In the Code window, type the following code

        Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
           TextBox1.Text = "&lt;default text&gt;"
        End Sub

  where &lt;default text&gt; is the text you want to appear in the text box when
  the form appears.
