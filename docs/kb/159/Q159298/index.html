The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With Exchange Server, you sometimes need to read and analyze sniffer traces when
troubleshooting server-to-server communication along with client-to- server
communication. This article addresses RPC sniffs between various Exchange Server
services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

End Point Mapper
----------------

To understand the various stages an RPC Client goes through in order to connect
to a certain service, we must first understand how the Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) Service', otherwise known as the End Point Mapper, aids Exchange in its
quest for service UUID numbers. The End Point Mapper performs a variety of tasks
but the one we are interested in is its ability to tell us the port number a
service we are looking for is listening on. UUID's can be generally categorized
by their first 2 characters, for Microsoft Exchange v4.0 and v5.0:

  A4 - STORE
  F5 - DIRECTORY
  E1 - ENDPOINT MAPPER

Let us take the following example where ExchangeA Server wants to send a message
to ExchangeB Server (ExchangeA and ExchangeB are in the same site therefore the
communication mechanism is RPC and in this case it is over TCP/IP).

The first thing that ExchangeA must do is query ExchangeB's End Point Mapper to
find where its MTA is listening. The reason for this is the port number that
each Exchange service listens on can change on subsequent startups. The End
Point Mapper is responsible for tracking which service is listening on which
point. When an Exchange service starts, it registers itself with the End Point
Mapper and asks the End Point Mapper to assign it a port number. The End Point
Mapper is always listening on port 135 for TCP/IP and the End Point Mapper's
UUID is (E1AF8308-5D1F-11C9-91A4-08002B14A0FA).

The following 11 frames show the complete conversation between ExchangeA (on port
3464) and ExchangeB's End Point Mapper (on port 135):

1. TCP: ....S., len:    4, seq: 562005063-562005066, ack:         0, win:

2. TCP: .A..S., len:    4, seq: 875064831-875064834, ack: 562005064, win:

3. TCP: .A...., len:    0, seq: 562005064-562005064, ack: 875064832, win:

7. MSRPC: c/o RPC Response:     call 0x1  context 0x0  hint 0x80  cancels
  0x0

8. TCP: .A...F, len:    0, seq: 562005292-562005292, ack: 875065044, win:
  8548, src: 3464  dst:  135

10. TCP: .A...F, len:    0, seq: 875065044-875065044, ack: 562005293, win:

Frame 1 - ExchangeA sends a Syn packet to ExchangeB.

Frame 2 - ExchangeB acknowledges the packet with a SynAck packet.

Frame 3 - ExchangeA sends an acknowledge of the SynAck. We now have a TCP
connection between ExchangeA and ExchangeB.

Frame 4 - ExchangeA is Binding to ExchangeB's End Point Mapper. We know this by
the UUID number (E1AF8308-5D1F-11C9-91A4-08002B14A0FA) it is sending the Bind to
and also by the dst: port number.

Frame 5 - ExchangeB acknowledges the Bind with a BindAck. We now have an RPC
connection between ExchangeA and ExchangeB's End Point Mapper.

Frame 6 - ExchangeA sends an RPC Request of opnum 0x3 to ExchangeB along with the
UUID of the service it is looking for (in this case it is ExchangeB's MTA). This
is to request the port number of the service with the corresponding UUID.

Frame 7 - ExchangeB returns the port number that the service that matches this
UUID is listening on. ExchangeA now has all the information it needs to find the
MTA on ExchangeB.

Frames 8 through 11 - Closing down the TCP connection between ExchangeA and
ExchangeB.

Now that ExchangeA knows the port number it needs to connect to ExchangeB's MTA.
An important note here is the Exchange MTA does an RPC bind slightly different
than most RPC binds. It performs a two-way handshake, meaning, not only does
ExchangeA have to bind to ExchangeB but ExchangeB must bind to ExchangeA before
any messages can be sent. Therefore, you should see a Bind followed by a BindAck
then another Bind from the other server followed by another BindAck as
illustrated below.

1. TCP: ....S., len:    4, seq: 562005113-562005116, ack:         0, win:

Frames 1 through 3 - Once again our TCP three way handshake.

Frame 4 - ExchangeA MTA is binding to ExchangeB MTA.

Frame 5 - ExchangeB acknowledges the Bind with a BindAck.

Frame 6 -

Frame 7 - ExchangeA sends an RPC Request with opnum 0x0. An opnum 0x0 is an
MtaBind call. This will trigger ExchangeB's MTA to issue a Bind to ExchangeA as
the MTA's need a two way connection.

Frame 8 - ExchangeB acknowledges it received Frame 7.

Framess 9 through 11 - Our TCP three way handshake initiated by ExchangeB this
time.

Frame 12 - ExchangeB MTA is binding to ExchangeB's MTA.

Frame 13 - ExchangeA acknowledges the Bind with a BindAck.

Frame 14 -

Frame 15 - ExchangeB sends an RPC Request with opnum 0x1. An opnum 0x1 is an
MtaBindBack call. This is setting up the two way conversation the MTA's need.

Frame 16 - ExchangeA acknowledges it received Frame 15.

Frame 17 - ExchangeB's response to Frame 7.

Frame 18 - ExchangeA's response to Frame 15.

This illustrates the flow of an RPC connection. The example above illustrates
specifically a typical connection between two MTA's. This same kind of
conversation will happen between the other various Exchange Services as well
although the MTA is the only one that needs a two way conversation to exchange
information.

The information contained in this article uses the MTA for its examples. An
important note is this same type of conversation will happen with any and all
Exchange RPC communication over TCP/IP.

1. The TCP three-way handshake will be established.

2. The End Point Mapper is consulted in order to determine on which port the
  service wanted is listening.

3. A Bind and BindAck between the two services will happen to establish RPC
  communication.

4. Optional - A series of Requests and Responses with opnums will be issued.

5. Optional - The RPC communication is ended.

6. The TCP connection is broken with Fin packets.

When looking through sniffer traces of RPC communications, or any TCP
communication, it is important that you are aware that multiple conversations
can be occurring simultaneously. Do not assume that simply because a Request
packet follows a BindAck packet that this Request came from the particular
conversation you are interested in. A quick check of the destination and source
ports with TCP will tell you if the packet you are looking at is part of the
conversation you are interested or not. If the destination and/or source port
number is no the same as the port numbers used in the TCP three way handshake,
the packet you are looking at is part of a separate conversation.

A good display filter within Network Monitor, filtering on the destination and
source port numbers will serve as a great aide in ensuring the packets you are
looking at do indeed belong to the conversation in question.

One other important note is this article addresses RPC over TCP only. No matter
what the underlying protocol is, the RPC piece of this article remains the same.
For example RPC over IPX would work quite similarly except the IPX communication
would have to be established prior to RPC much in the same way TCP must be
established before RPC.
