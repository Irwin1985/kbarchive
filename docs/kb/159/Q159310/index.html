SYMPTOMS
========

An updated version of Dns.exe is available to fix the following problems:

- A lookup for a non-existent A record takes about 30 seconds to time out: When
  the internal DNS server is queried, it goes to the root server. If the root
  server returns an RCODE of 0, the Microsoft DNS server does not respond to
  its client immediately. Some versions of BIND may return an RCODE of 0. This
  can cause a 30 second delay at the querying client.


- Problem resolving some MX records: If a DNS client does a recursive query to
  the Microsoft DNS server for an MX record and the authoritative DNS server
  for that MX record returns an SOA record instead (because the MX record
  doesn't exist), the Microsoft DNS server does not return that SOA record to
  the client. A BIND DNS server does return the SOA record to the DNS client
  even though it requested an MX record. Microsoft has modified its DNS service
  to be compatible with BIND.


- BIND incompatibility: When the Microsoft DNS service receives a query for a
  name that requires an authoritative lookup, and the DNS server handling the
  lookup is a BIND server, it may respond with a CNAME record, causing the name
  server (NS) record for the BIND server to be overwritten in cache. The NS
  record is used to specify the authoritative name server for a domain.


- When using the new WriteAuthorityNs reg key that was added in Windows NT 4.0
  SP3 DNS, DNS queries will always return authority records=0 and additional=0
  instead the actual count for this.


- If you delegate a zone (such as mydepartment.mycompany.com) to a DNS server
  that is not in the zone (such as yourserver.yourdepartment.company.com), when
  a client does a lookup on a host in the delegated zone, it will not succeed.
  If you ping the server that the zone was delegated to
  (yourserver.yourdepartment.company.com) once so that it is cached, lookups
  will start to succeed. The problem was caused by a problem following the glue
  record that was associated with the delegation, and it has been fixed.


- Access Violation in Dns.exe: Dr Watson may report an access violation on a
  secondary DNS server when it is receiving invalid records from the primary,
  and the data changes on the primary from the initial zone transfer.


Other updates and optimizations:

- Reduced traffic to root servers: This version eliminates the automatic root
  query on startup and in the timeout thread; instead, it queries the root only
  when it receives a query that needs to be sent to the root servers, and
  limits retrying the root servers to once every ten minutes.

- Better recursion response: This version supports direct forwarding of a
  response from the remote DNS, where possible.

- Eliminates a deadlock condition hit by a few customers. At least one person
  posting on the MS-DNS newsgroup reported hitting a deadlock. The symptom of
  this is that the server stops responding to all requests.

- Better use of SOA in authority section: This version still has an
  optimization to avoid this on local queries, but overall should be a more
  "friendly" partner for remote DNS servers when sending a NAME_ERROR or
  no-records response.

- Local network prioritization of queries: If there are multiple A records,
  this version of the server puts the one that "fits best" first; if none fits
  best, a straight round robin scheme is followed. This is off by default but
  can be turned on with the new LocalNetPriority registry flag:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

  Value Name: LocalNetPriority
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data : 0 or 1 (0 is disabled)

  NOTE: This key does not exist by default.


For more information see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q177883
  TITLE : DNS Server Stops Using Round Robin for Host Name Resolution

- WildcardAllTypes registry flag: If on, this version of DNS will use wildcards
  on all types -- even where they make no sense; this was added for a specific
  customer scenario where it is used for a security check using reverse lookup.

- Cache pollution fix: There was a recently-publicized problem where a remote
  DNS returned bogus data, polluting the cache of DNS servers on the Internet.
  This was used to point some traffic that would normally go to InterNIC sites
  to another site. This release plugs that hole. All data received must be for
  names at or below the zone for which the NS is queried. For example, when you
  query the microsoft.com DNS server, you will accept any data for
  microsoft.com or ntdev.microsoft.com but will reject any data for
  someothersite.com.

- Non-port-53 operation: The purpose of this is to allow firewall of port 53
  and still have the server go out and query the world. Anyone running a server
  on a firewall who is not interested in incoming traffic may be interested.
  You need to set the SendOnNonDnsPort registry key, to get non-53 sends. If
  you set this to a specific port &gt; 1024, you actually run on that port, any
  &lt; 1024 true value means you bind to any port.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

  Value Name: SendOnNonDnsPort
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data : Desired Port#(53 is default)(port numbers are in decimal)

  NOTE: This key does not exist by default.

- No-forward of delegations: This is on by default. If you delegate
  foo.ntdev.microsoft.com to some server, that server is usually on your lan
  and you do not want to go through your forwarding server to reach it. To turn
  it off, set the ForwardDelegations registry key.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

  Value Name: ForwardDelegations
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data : 0 or 1 (0 is disabled)

  NOTE: This key does not exist by default.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix mentioned above, may experience some problems as specified below:

- Local network prioritization of queries may cause Round-Robin load balancing
  to fail. If you experience this problem turn off the LocalNetPriority flag as
  mentioned above.


- High Speed Zone Transfers
  The default configuration does not attempt to include multiple records in each
  transaction. This may cause BIND 4.9.5 and newer DNS Servers to have slow
  zone transfers. If you experience this problem set the BindSecondaries flag
  to use faster zone transfers:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

  Value Name: BindSecondaries
  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Data : 0 or 1 (0 = high speed; 1 = slower transfers)

  NOTE: This key does not exist by default. Transfers between Microsoft DNS
  Servers will always be done with using the faster, high compression method,
  regardless of how the BindSecondaries flag is set. After changing this
  registry key, you must stop and restart the DNS Server service.
