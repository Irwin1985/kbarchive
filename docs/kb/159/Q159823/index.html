- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains sample code that illustrates how to call Windows Clipboard
API to copy a disk metafile to the Windows Clipboard using the 16-bit and 32-bit
versions of Visual Basic 4.0. The code in the article can also be used to work
around a bug in the SetData method of the Visual Basic Clipboard object. The
workaround replaces the SetData method you use when you copy a disk metafile to
clipboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following statement loads a metafile from a disk and copies it to the
Windows Clipboard:

     'DiskMetaFileName is the path to a WMF file on the disk.
     Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(DiskMetaFileName), vbCFMetafile

The metafile is successfully copied to the Clipboard. However, the metafile size
in the y dimension suggested in the disk metafile is ignored, and is set to
match the suggested size in the x dimension. You can reproduce the bug by using
the following code fragment with an Image control (Image1) on the form:

     Clipboard.Clear                        ' Clear Clipboard.
     Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(DiskMetaFileName), vbCFMetafile
     Image1.Stretch = False   'Resize the control to fit the graphics
     Image1.Picture = Clipboard.GetData(vbCFMetafile) 'Copy from Clipboard
     Debug.Print Image1.Width, Image1.Height

NOTE: Image1.Width is always the same as Image1.Height.

The sample code in this article provides a subroutine, SetMetaToClp, that works
around the bug by directly calling Windows API.


Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0. If it is already running, choose New Project from the
  File menu. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two CommandButtons, Command1 and Command2, to Form1.

3. Add one Image control, Image1, to Form1.

4. Clear all the code for Form1, and then paste the following code to the code
  window of Form1:

  'Please change the path so that it points to a valid metafile.
  Private Const strFileName = "d:\vb4\metafile\arrows\Smallarw.wmf"

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Clipboard.Clear                ' Clear Clipboard.
      Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(strFileName), vbCFMetafile
      Image1.Stretch = False
      Image1.Picture = Clipboard.GetData(vbCFMetafile) 'Copy from Clipboard
      Debug.Print Image1.Width, Image1.Height
  'Image1.Width is always the same as Image1.Height. Bug!

  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
      Clipboard.Clear                       ' Clear Clipboard.
      SetMetaToClp strFileName
      Image1.Stretch = False
      Image1.Picture = Clipboard.GetData(vbCFMetafile) 'Copy from Clipboard
      Debug.Print Image1.Width, Image1.Height

  'Image1.Width and Image1.Height now display the metafile size suggested
  'in the disk metafile
  End Sub

5. Insert a module, Module1, into the project. Copy and paste the following code
  to Module1:

  Public Const OFS_MAXPATHNAME = 128
  Public Const OF_READ = &amp;H0
  Public Const GMEM_SHARE = &amp;H2000
  Public Const GMEM_MOVEABLE = &amp;H2

  Public Const GHND = (GMEM_MOVEABLE Or GMEM_ZEROINIT)
  Public Const HFILE_ERROR = &amp;HFFFF
