SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to call various LanMan services from 32-bit Visual
Basic 4.0 applications. The sample code also applies to applications which use
the 32-bit VBA engine. An example of such an application is Microsoft Excel 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT and Windows 2000 exposes LanMan 32-bit Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) to provide network services. These APIs are called only from
32-bit programs running on a Windows NT or Windows 2000 and are used to control
both the local and remote Windows NT (or Windows 2000) machines that you have
permission to access.

Note: While Windows 2000 supports LanMan APIs for backwards compatibility, it is
recommended that ADSI be used instead for most of the functions below. For more
information about ADSI, search for Active Directory Services Interface or ADSI
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base or MSDN.

This article contains code examples of using the following LanMan APIs:

  NetGetDCName
  NetUserDel
  NetGroupAddUser
  NetGroupDelUser
  NetUserAdd        (using Level 1 structure)
  NetUserEnum       (using Level 0 structure)
  NetGroupEnumUsers (using Level 0 structure)
  NetGroupEnum      (using Level 0 structure)
  NetUserGetGroups  (using Level 0 structure)
  NetAPIBufferFree
  NetAPIBufferAllocate

Although, Visual Basic stores strings internally as UNICODE, it converts them to
ANSI when it calls APIs. Normally this isn't a problem because most 32-bit APIs
have both an ANSI and a UNICODE version. However, LanMan APIs only support
UNICODE. The code snippet below demonstrates how to use Byte arrays to pass
UNICODE parameters.

Instead of using strings, for example:

     "X = My_ANSI_API("Some String")"

use Byte arrays, such the one below, because they aren't converted to ANSI:

     Dim Temp() As Byte, Message As String
     Message = "Some String"
     Temp = Message &amp; vbNullChar     '
     MyUnicodeAPI Temp(0)
     Message = Temp                  ' modified me
