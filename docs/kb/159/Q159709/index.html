MORE INFORMATION

The Microsoft Encryption Pack 1
-------------------------------

What is the Microsoft Encryption Pack?

This compact disc contains two components, a high-encryption version of Service
Pack 1 for Windows NT(R) version 4.0, and a high-encryption version of Internet
Explorer 3.01. Service Pack 1 is available for Alpha, MIPS, PPC and x86
platforms. Internet Explorer 3.01 is currently only available for Intel(TM)
Hardware Platforms.

Why Might I want It?

The United States government restricts the strength of encryption that we may
export. In order to provide the most powerful security solutions available for
Windows NT 4.0 , Microsoft has included stronger encryption technology in
Encryption Pack 1 for customers in the United States and Canada.

Export Restricted

Export of the 128-bit strong encryption technology included on the Encryption
Pack CD is regulated by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR, 22
CFR 120-130) of the U.S. State Department, Office of Defense Trade Controls). A
State Department license is required to take this technology outside of the
United States or Canada.

The specific high-encryption components included with the CD are:

For Windows NT Workstation 4.0:

128-bit encryption support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2 in Peer Web Service

For Windows NT Server 4.0:

128-bit encryption support for SSL 2 in Internet Information Server 2.0

For Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 (runs on both Windows 95 and Windows NT
Workstation 4.0):

128-bit encryption support for SSL 2 and SSL 3
