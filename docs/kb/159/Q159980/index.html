-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 includes support for distributed link services,
where a distributed link service is configured to communicate over a native LAN
session to a link service running on a remote SNA Server, over TCP/IP sockets,
Netware IPX/SPX, or Banyan Vines.

If the distributed link service (SNAREM1, SNAREM2, etc) loses its LAN session to
the remote link service (for example, due to a network outage), the following
Windows NT application event log entry is logged by the distributed link
service:

  

  Event:  23
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: Connection TOKEN1   using Link Service SNAREM1  failed
               Qualifier = 000A

Once this occurs, the connection will remain "Inactive" and SNA Server will not
reconnect to a remote link service on another server (assuming multiple remote
link services were configured in the distributed link service setup dialog). The
administrator will be unable to manually restart the connection unless the SNA
Server service is stopped and restarted.

NOTE: When connecting over TCP/IP sockets between the distributed link service
and the remote link, it will take over 2 minutes for a network outage to be
detected. The TCP/IP socket "keep alive" interval used to detect network outages
on SNA Server is controlled by the SNA Server WatchDogTimeout parameter (which
defaults to 60 seconds), documented in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q150511 Preventing SNA Server Keepalives on Idle LAN Connections


CAUSE
=====

The cause of the initial network outage (leading to the Event 23 qualifier 0x0A)
will require debugging using a network trace tool such as Network General
Sniffer(TM) or Microsoft Network Monitor.

The cause of automatic reconnection problem was due to a problem in SNA Server.
SNA Server (Snaservr.exe) started a link reactivation timer when in fact it was
trying to deactivate the link to reuse it for an outgoing call.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no workaround for this problem, though there is an SNA Server 2.11
hotfix available from Microsoft. This problem is fixed in SNA Server 3.0.

NOTE: The cause of the network outage must be diagnosed separately, as described
in the CAUSE section above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
