SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Words property to
return a word count, the number of words returned appears to be inaccurate.

CAUSE
=====

The Words property returns a collection that represents all the words in a
range, selection, or document. The collection includes all punctuation and
paragraph marks in the selection or the document.

For example, if you attempt to determine the word count of the following three
lines of text using the Words property, the result is 21 words:

  This is x number of words&lt;return&gt;
  This is x number of words&lt;return&gt;
  This is x number of words&lt;return&gt;

WORKAROUND

article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

To return only the number of words in a document or a selection, exclusive of
paragraph marks and punctuation, use the Dialogs object instead of the Words
property.

The Dialogs object returns a word count that does not include paragraph marks or
punctuation. Using the example from the "Cause" section, the Dialogs object
returns a count of 18 words.

The following Visual Basic for Applications code shows the difference between
using the Words property and the Dialogs object method to return a word count
for a document.

     Sub CountWords()

        ' Retrieve the number of words including paragraph marks and
        ' punctuation using the Dialogs collection. This  returns the
        ' same result as if you used the Word Count command (Tools menu).
        Set wdDTWC = Dialogs(wdDialogToolsWordCount)
        wdDTWC.Execute
        dlgwordcount$ = wdDTWC.Words
        MsgBox "Word Count from Tools Word Count: " &amp; dlgwordcount$

        ' Retrieve the number of words from the Words collection.
        selwordcount$ = ActiveDocument.Words.Count
        MsgBox "Word Count from Words Collection: " &amp; selwordcount$

     End Sub

For more information about the Dialogs Object, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "Dialogs" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view "Dialogs Object."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
