SUMMARY
=======

This article answers the most frequently asked questions regarding easier
document creation and automatic features in Microsoft Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is AutoText and how do I use it?

  A. AutoText is a feature that allows you to store text or graphics you use
  frequently. For example, you can store a mailing address that you use often,
  a standard contract clause, or a long distribution list for memos. Each
  selection of text or graphics is recorded as an AutoText entry and is
  assigned a unique name. In previous versions of Word, AutoText entries were
  referred to as Glossary entries. To use AutoText, follow these steps:

  a. Click where you want to insert the AutoText entry.

  b. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.

  -or-

  On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, point to an item on the AutoText menu,
  and then click the AutoText entry you want. For example, point to Salutation,
  and then click Dear Sir or Madam.

  NOTE: To see all AutoText entries based on a style, press and hold the SHIFT
  key while you point to AutoText on the Insert menu.

2. Q. How do I add text that I use frequently to the AutoText menu?

  A. To create an AutoText entry, follow these steps:

   - Select the text or graphic you want to store as an AutoText entry. To
     store paragraph formatting with the entry, include the paragraph mark in
     the selection.

   - On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click New.

   - In the Create AutoText dialog box, type a unique name for your AutoText
     entry or accept the default, and then click OK.

For additional information about adding AutoText to the AutoText menu, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q157843 WD97: Adding AutoText to the AutoText Menu

3. Q. How do I get Word to display AutoComplete tips for words that I use
  frequently?

  A. To display AutoComplete tips, follow these steps:

  a. Turn AutoComplete on.

     1. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText.

     2. Click the AutoText tab.

     3. Click to select the "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText and dates"
        check box, and then click OK.

  b. Create the AutoText entry.

  c. In the document, type the AutoText name.

     When the AutoComplete tip appears, press ENTER to accept the tip.

4. Q. Why don't I get an AutoComplete tip for my new AutoText entry?

  A. The AutoComplete tip does not appear in the following instances:

   - The "Show AutoComplete tip for AutoText and dates" option is turned off.

   - The AutoText entry is linked to the Signature style. The AutoComplete tip
     is displayed when you type this AutoText entry at the beginning of a
     paragraph only.

   - The AutoText entry is linked to one of the Letter Wizard styles (excluding
     the Signature style) and you typed it within a paragraph. The AutoComplete
     tip is displayed when you type this type of AutoText entry at the
     beginning of the paragraph only.

   - You did not type enough characters for Word to identify the AutoComplete
     tip. For example, if you have entries called "company logo" and "company
     address," you need to type "company a" (without the quotation marks) to
     display the AutoComplete tip for the company address. On the other hand,
     if you have an AutoText entry for London called "Lond," and you do not
     have other AutoText entries that begin with these four characters, all you
     have to type is "Lond" (without the quotation marks) to view the
     AutoComplete tip.

5. Q. How can I replace one or more characters with a special symbol? For
  example, how do I replace "ss" (without the quotation marks) with the section
  symbol?

  A. To automatically replace one or more characters with a symbol, follow these
  steps:

  a. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

  b. Click the symbol you want, and then click AutoCorrect.

     The symbol you selected appears in the With box.

  c. In the Replace box, type the characters you want replaced, and then click
     Add.

  d. Click OK.

  e. Click Close.

6. Q. How do I stop Word from automatically making changes to my document while
  I type?

  A. Word uses a feature called AutoFormat As You Type to automatically format
  headings, bulleted and numbered lists, borders, numbers, symbols, and so on
  as you type. Word also uses a feature called AutoCorrect to automatically
  correct common typing, spelling, and grammatical errors. This feature can
  also automatically insert text, graphics, and symbols. To turn off some or
  all of the changes that AutoFormat As You Type makes, follow these steps:

  a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect, and then click the AutoFormat As You
     Type tab.

  b. Click to clear any option you do not want to format automatically. Click
     to select any option you do want to format automatically. If do not want
     to use AutoFormat as you type, clear all options.

  c. Click OK.

  To turn off AutoCorrect, follow these steps:

  a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect.

  b. On the AutoCorrect tab, click to clear the "Replace text as you type"
     check box.

7. Q. How do I share my AutoCorrect entries with others?

  A. AutoCorrect lists are now shared between Office programs. Any changes you
  make to the AutoCorrect entries and settings while in one programs are
  immediately available to the other programs. In addition, Word can store
  AutoCorrect items consisting of formatted text and graphics. The following
  articles contain information on how to share your AutoCorrect entries with
  other users.

  Q186237 WD97: How to Move Word AutoCorrect Entries Between Computers

8. Q. What is automatic style definition and how does it work?

  A. Automatic style definition is an AutoFormat As You Type option (see
  previous question and answer) that creates new paragraph styles based on the
  manual formatting you apply to your text. You can apply these styles in your
  document to save time and to give your documents a consistent "look and
  feel." To turn on automatic style definition, follow these steps:

  a. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect, and then click the AutoFormat As You
     Type tab.

  b. Click to select the "Define styles based on your formatting" check box.

  c. Click OK.
