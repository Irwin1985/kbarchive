The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MS-DOS-based programs included with FPNW, such as Map.exe and Login.exe,
that are supposed to modify environment variables do not work as expected when
run in a Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) under Windows, but do work as expected
outside of Windows.

CAUSE
=====

These programs, when shipped with FPNW, use an incorrect function call to modify
the program's environment space, rather than the environment space of the VDM.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the Novell versions of these programs, as they work as expected. Or obtain
the update mentioned in the Status section.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft File and Print
Services for NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

In MS-DOS, every process has a block of memory associated with it in which
environment variables are stored. When a new process is started, it inherits a
copy of the environment belonging to its parent process. By default, when an
application changes its own environment variables, those changes are not
reflected in the parent process's environment space. Rather, an application must
take explicit action to change the environment of its parent process.

When running an MS-DOS prompt within a Windows environment, there are up to four
separate levels of environment spaces to be considered:

1. The base environment of MS-DOS before Windows is started.

2. The Windows environment, which will be inherited by any MS-DOS windows
  started by Windows.

3. The environment of the VDM associated with the MS-DOS window.

4. The environment of the application, such as Map.exe. This environment is
  destroyed when the application terminates.

The problem with the files shipped with FPNW is that they were altering
environments 1 and 4 in the previous list. The fixed Map.exe described here and
the Map.exe provided by Novell also alter environment 3. Neither program
modifies environment 2.
