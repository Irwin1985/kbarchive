-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SPLIT sample demonstrates the following Foundation Class programming
concepts:

1. A ReplaceView() function can be created which replaces a view in a
  CSplitterWnd pane with another. The function replaces a view but uses the
  same CDocument object. This function can be helpful if a programmer wants to
  keep the same frame window and document for a splitter pane and only wants to
  delete a view in a pane and replace it with another.

2. The CDocument variable m_bAutoDelete can be used to prevent the destruction
  of a CDocument object if all views of the document are destroyed.

3. The CWnd::PreCreateWindow() function can be used to prevent the main
  application from having a thick frame thus preventing the user from resizing
  the main application window.

4. By trapping the WM_SETCURSOR, WM_MOUSEMOVE, and WM_LBUTTONDOWN messages of a
  CSplitterWnd, you can fix the splitter bars in a splitter window so that they
  can't be moved by the user.

5. CSplitterWnd panes can contain regular CWnd objects and are not limited to
  the use of CViews. This sample places a dialog in the first pane.

6. The undocumented CWnd::CenterWindow() can be used to position windows at the
  center of the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To understand what the sample does, first execute the program. You will see a
main application window with a splitter window (CSplitterWnd) in its client
area. A selection dialog will be displayed in the first pane and a view will be
displayed in the second pane.

Click on the "View 1" and "View 2" buttons. Notice that the view in the second
pane will switch from one to the other. The view is changing but looking at the
source you'll see that the document stays the same.

The sample project can be converted to a 32-bit Visual C++ 2.x project and will
successfully compile and execute once the following change has been made:

On line 34 of SPLITTER.CPP, change:

     ::SetWindowWord
     GWW_ID

to:

     ::SetWindowLong
     GWL_ID

If you have comments or suggestions about how to improve this sample, please send
Microsoft a message to the MFC section of the MSLANG forum.
