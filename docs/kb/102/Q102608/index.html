-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the major differences in security schemes between Windows NT
Advanced Server and Microsoft LAN Manager are:

- Under Windows NT Advanced Server, user and group permissions are cumulative.
  Deny access takes precedence over grant access. Under LAN Manager, individual
  user permissions take precedence over group permissions.

  NOTE: When Windows NT Advanced Server checks permissions, it does so in one
  pass, not discriminating between users and groups. As soon as a "deny access"
  permission is reached, the search is terminated and access to the resource is
  denied. However, LAN Manager makes two passes when it checks resource
  permissions: a user pass and a group pass. Because of this, LAN Manager could
  deny a user access, but then grant that user access if the user belongs to a
  group that has access to a resource.

- A Windows NT Advanced Server domain contains only domain controllers and
  servers. All servers are considered backup domain controllers. A LAN Manager
  domain includes a primary domain controller, backup controllers, and
  stand-alone servers.

  NOTE: LAN Manager servers in a Windows NT Advanced Server domains cannot act
  as domain controllers, nor can they validate logon attempts by Windows NT or
  Windows NT Advanced Server computers. LAN Manager servers can validate LAN
  Manager server and client logons in a mixed domain of LAN Manager and Windows
  NT computers.

- Under Windows NT Advanced Server, you must logon to any local computer with
  an account and password. Local computer security is optional under LAN
  Manager, only on computers configured to be servers.

  NOTE: Users from outside a domain with both Windows NT Advanced Server and LAN
  Manager computers cannot access LAN Manager domain resources unless a local
  account is created in Windows NT Advanced Server. This is because LAN Manager
  servers do not recognize global groups or trust relationships.

- Windows NT Advanced Server supports trust relationships between domains and a
  single network for all trusted domains. LAN Manager does not support trust
  relationships and requires that users log onto each domain separately.

- Any user account can own a file under Windows NT Advanced Server. Owners can
  grant and deny access to the files they own. This concept is not supported
  under LAN Manager.

- Windows NT Advanced Server allows you to deny access to resources not owned
  by administrative accounts. Ownership may be taken later, but an auditing
  trail is created. LAN Manager allows all administrative accounts to access
  all resources.

- Windows NT Advanced Server protects setting system functions (such as setting
  the system time and formatting the hard disk.) System functions are not
  protected under LAN Manager.

- Local and global groups are recognized by Windows NT Advanced Server. LAN
  Manager does not recognize local groups.

- Windows NT Advanced Server allows only Windows NT computers to administrate
  other Windows NT computers. LAN Manager computers can be administrated from
  any MS-DOS, UNIX, or OS/2 computer running LAN Manager, or from a Windows NT
  computer.

- File and directory permissions apply to local and network users under Windows
  NT Advanced Server. Permissions apply only to network users, unless local
  security is enabled on LAN Manager servers.
