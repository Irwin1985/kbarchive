-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article describes all features and characteristics of the Print
Server for Macintosh (also called MacPrint) and Macintosh printing.

All PostScript printers supported by Windows NT are also supported by
MacPrint.

MacPrint prints jobs from Macintosh clients with LaserWriter Chooser
version 5.2 or later. Because of compatibility problems with
PostScript dictionaries that use the EXITSERVER command, some printers
do not support jobs from Macintoshes using Chooser versions 5.2 or
6.0. The official client requirements for Services for Macintosh on
the client side are Apple System Software version 6.08 or later, which
installs supported versions of the LaserWriter driver.

Jobs from LaserWriter Chooser versions earlier than 7.0 are played
through the PostScript to GDI converter regardless of the driver
specified for the Windows NT printer. If the Windows NT printer driver
is PostScript, and the job is from a version 7.0 or later LaserWriter
Chooser, then the PostScript will be played to the printer in RAW
mode.

MacPrint does not cache PostScript dictionaries as it was done in
Chooser version 1.0. This was a complex process that did not work with
all client types and did not provide clear performance enhancements.

What Happened to the PPD Files?
-------------------------------

Unlike version 1.0, this version of MacPrint does not require PPD
files describing the various PostScript printers used by the server.
Instead, Windows NT version 3.1 provides a mechanism to query for the
same information provided by PPD files.

Why Doesn't it Display Job Information?
---------------------------------------

The Windows NT Print Manager displays numerous pieces of information
about print jobs, including the name of the document, document owner,
and the number of pages. Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions
allow the Macintosh client to include this information in the print
job. If the information is included in the print job, MacPrint gives
it to the Windows NT 3.1 Print Manager; otherwise, the Document Name
defaults to "Macintosh Document," the owner defaults to "MacPrint,"
and the number of pages is not specified.

About Printer Messages
----------------------

The Windows NT Print Manager provides clients who submit print jobs
messages about print job status (for example, Print Job Complete).
These messages are NOT provided for Macintosh clients in this release.

What About Security?
--------------------

The MacPrint service runs under the security context of the MacPrint
user account. It is therefore possible to protect a Windows NT 3.1
Printer from Macintosh clients as a group by restricting access to the
MacPrint user account. See your "Administrator's Guide" for complete
information on setting up the MacPrint user account.
