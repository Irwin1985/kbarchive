The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The NBF (NetBIOS Frame) protocol is no different from the NetBEUI
protocol. To someone monitoring a network line, there is no difference
in network packets; and, this holds true for any combination of
Windows NT and non-Windows NT computers. The differences lie in the
Windows NT implementation of the NetBIOS protocol.

Use of TDI
----------

NBF uses the upper edge of the TDI interface. NetBEUI uses the upper
edge of the NetBIOS interface.

With OS/2 and Windows for Workgroups, the server and redirector (and
any other transport clients) submit network control blocks (NCBs) to
NetBEUI. NCBs submitted by a NetBIOS application are also passed
directly to NetBEUI. The format of all of these NCBs is the same, as
defined by the IBM specification.

With Windows NT, the server and redirector submit TDI requests to
NetBEUI. The set of TDI calls implement the same general semantics as
the NetBIOS NCBs, but are optimized for a 32-bit kernel interface. An
NCB passed in by a NetBIOS application is passed to the NetBIOS driver
(NETBIOS.SYS), which examines the NCB and then submits the
corresponding TDI call or calls to NetBEUI.

TDI is also used by all other transports, such as the streams
environment or native TDI transports such as AppleTalk. There is no
user mode TDI interface currently; applications should use NetBIOS or
Windows Sockets.

Use of NDIS 3.0
---------------

NBF uses the lower edge of the NDIS 3.0 interface. NDIS 3.0 is
functionally similar to NDIS 2.0 but has some improvements that
benefit transports. The interface is a fully 32-bit asynchronous
interface.

Removal of NetBIOS Session Number Limits
----------------------------------------

One of the benefits of TDI is that it does not use a one byte session
number to identify a session, but rather a 32-bit handle. Therefore, a
single TDI client may establish a virtually infinite number of
sessions over a given TDI provider. For example, the server has been
run over NBF with more than 1000 clients connected simultaneously on a
single network adapter.

NBF is still constrained by the fact that the on-the-wire protocol
used by NetBEUI and NBF also uses a one byte session number. For any
connection between two adapters, there will be a local session number
(assigned by this machine) and a remote session number (assigned by
the other machine).

With NetBEUI the local session numbers were assigned globally,
limiting NetBEUI to a total of 254 sessions (the session numbers and
255 cannot be used). NBF gets around this by assigning its local
session numbers on a per-remote-adapter basis. That is, it may use
local session number 1 when talking to adapter A and also have a
session locally numbered 1 when talking to adapter B. The two remote
computers will not get confused because adapter A does not see frames
destined for B, and vice versa. However, if NBF establishes another
session to A at the same time, it must use a session number other than
1 to keep things in order.

NBF can only do this when it is able to determine beforehand which
adapter the connection is going to be made to. There are three cases
that need to be considered:

- A client connecting to NBF. When a client connects to a computer running NBF,
  NBF can inspect the incoming frame to determine the remote adapter's address
  and assign a session number for that adapter.

- NBF connecting to a remote client with a unique NetBIOS name. When NBF is
  connecting to a remote client, it first sends a FIND.NAME frame. If the
  remote client responds, indicating the name is a unique name, NBF can look at
  the remote adapter address in the response and assign a session number for
  that adapter because it knows only that remote owns this name.

- NVB connecting to a remote client with a group NetBIOS name. If the FIND.NAME
  response indicates that the connection is being made to a group name, NBF has
  no way of knowing which adapter belonging to the group will respond when it
  tries to connect, so it has to assign a session number on a global basis,
  just as NetBEUI did for all connections.

So, NBF has no limit on sessions, unless it is establishing
connections to group names in which case the old NetBEUI limit still
applies. To be accurate, if you have n group name connections, then
you can have 254-n connections to any given remote client. If n is 0,
then you can have a full 254 connections to a remote. If n is 253, you
can still have 1 connection to each remote, but if n is 254, then no
connections can be made until one of the existing ones is
disconnected.

T1 Tuning
---------

NBF tunes its T1 parameter dynamically on a per-link basis, based on
link conditions and throughput. The T1 parameter specified in the
Registry is used as a starting point, so if it is known that NBF is
going to be talking over a slow link, this can be increased. If this
is not done, however, NBF will detect the slow link quickly and adapt
to it.

T2 and Ti are not adapted dynamically.

No ASyncBEUI Needed for RAS
---------------------------

There is no separate ASyncBEUI product for RAS. NBF handles
communications over the RAS link as well as over the LAN. In general
NBF's auto-tuning makes specific RAS parameters unnecessary. The
exception is the WanNameQueryRetries parameter which corresponds to
NameQueryRetries but is used for connections going over the RAS line.

Memory Usage Tuning
-------------------

NBF automatically allocates memory when it needs to satisfy the
requests made by its clients. Therefore, NBF does not need to be
configured with the number of sessions, packets, buffers, etc. to
allocate. However, there are hidden Registry parameters in NBF that
can be used to control these if desired. (Query in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base for more information using the following key words: NBF
and REGISTRY.) This also means that NBF uses memory only when needed.
On an inactive machine it will consume very little memory.

No Session Alives
-----------------

NBF does not use NetBIOS session alive frames to determine if the
remote client is up. Instead, it sends LLC poll frames which serve the
same purpose. This may confuse people who are sniffing the network and
are used to seeing session alive frames from NetBEUI. NBF will respond
correctly to session alive frames, so this should cause no
interoperability problems with other implementations of NetBEUI.
