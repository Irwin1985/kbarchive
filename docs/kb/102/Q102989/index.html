Mouse and Keyboard Driver Entries
---------------------------------

Parameters in this section are for the mouse and keyboard class and port drivers,
including these drivers:

Busmouse          Inport          Mouclass
i8042             Kbdclass        Sermouse

Microsoft Bus Mouse Port Driver Entries
---------------------------------------

The following value entries for the Microsoft bus mouse are found in this
subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Busmouse\Parameters

MouseDataQueueSize REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the number of mouse events to be buffered internally by the driver, in
nonpaged pool. The allocated size, in bytes, of the internal buffer is this
value times the size of the MOUSE_INPUT_DATA structure (defined in NTDDMOU.H).
Consider increasing the size if the System log in Event Viewer frequently
contains this message from the Busmouse source: "The ring buffer that stores
incoming mouse data has overflowed (buffer size is configurable via the
Registry)."
Default: 0x64 (100)

NumberOfButtons REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the number of buttons on the bus mouse. If the number of buttons
detected at startup time and placed in the Registry is incorrect, this value can
be used to override it.
Default: 0x2 (two buttons)

PointerDeviceBaseName REG_SZ Base port device name
Specifies the base name for the device object(s) created by the bus mouse port
device driver. The device driver also writes information about the device
objects into HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DeviceMap so that the pointer class
driver can locate the pointer port device objects.
Default: PointerPort


Intel 8042 Port Driver Entries
------------------------------

The i8042prt driver handles the keyboard and mouse port mouse (also known as a
PS/2-compatible mouse) for the Intel 8042 controller. These value entries are
found in the following subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters

KeyboardDataQueueSize REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the number of keyboard events to be buffered internally by the driver,
in nonpaged pool. The allocated size, in bytes, of the internal buffer is this
value times the size of the KEYBOARD_INPUT_DATA structure (defined in
NTDDKBD.H). Consider increasing the size if the System log in Event Viewer
contains the following message from the i8042prt source: "The ring buffer that
stores incoming keyboard data has overflowed (buffer size is configurable via
the Registry)."
Default: 0x64 (100)

KeyboardDeviceBaseName REG_SZ Base keyboard port device name
Specifies the base name for the keyboard device object(s) created by the i8042prt
device driver. The device driver also writes information about the device
objects into HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DeviceMap so that the keyboard class
driver can locate the keyboard port device objects.
Default: KeyboardPort

MouseDataQueueSize REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the number of mouse events to be buffered internally by the driver, in
nonpaged pool. Consider increasing the size if the System log in Event Viewer
contains the following message from the i8042prt source: "The ring buffer that
stores incoming mouse data has overflowed (buffer size is configurable via the
Registry)."
Default: 0x64 (100)

MouseResolution REG_DWORD Mouse resolution specifier
Used in specifying the mouse port mouse resolution, where 2 to the power of
MouseResolution specifies counts-per-millimeter.
Default: 0x3

MouseSynchIn100ns REG_DWORD Time, in 100 nanosecond units
Specifies the length of time after which the next mouse interrupt is assumed to
indicate the start of a new mouse packet (partial packets are discarded). This
enables the driver to synchronize its internal notion of the mouse packet state
with the hardware state when a mouse interrupt is lost. Consider modifying this
value if the system behaves as if there are random mouse events occurring (for
example, button clicks when no mouse button has been pressed).
Default: 20,000,000 (2 seconds)

NumberOfButtons REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the number of buttons on the mouse port mouse. If an incorrect number
of buttons is detected at startup time and placed in the Registry, this value
can be used to override it.
Default: 0x2

PointerDeviceBaseName REG_SZ Base mouse port device name
Specifies the base name for the pointer device object(s) created by the mouse
port mouse driver. The device driver also writes information about the device
object into HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DeviceMap so that the pointer class
driver can locate the pointer port device objects.
Default: PointerPort

PollStatusIterations REG_DWORD Number
Specifies the maximum number of times to check the i8042 controller status
register for interrupt verification before dismissing the interrupt as spurious.
This value can be used to work around a problem experienced on some hardware
(including the Olivetti MIPS computers) where the keyboard interrupt is raised
before the Output Buffer Full bit is set in the i8042 status register.

Increase this value if the system seems to suddenly stop taking keyboard
interrupts. This can happen if a keyboard interrupt is mistakenly dismissed as
spurious, when instead it just took too long to set Output Buffer Full after
raising the interrupt. Increasing the value of PollStatusIterations results in a
longer execution time for the Interrupt Service Routine if the keyboard
interrupt truly is spurious (there is a 1 microsecond delay following each check
for Output Buffer Full).

To determine whether the driver is taking keyboard interrupts, press the NUMLOCK
key. If the NumLock light on the keyboard turns on or off, this indicates that
the i8042prt driver handled the keyboard interrupt correctly.
Default: 1

OverrideKeyboardType REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x0
This entry is not usually present. When present, it specifies the keyboard type
(overriding the keyboard type detected during system initialization). Add this
value entry if the detected keyboard type is incorrect in the Registry. Type
values 0x2 and 0x4 indicate an enhanced 101-key or 102-key keyboard, or
compatible; other values typically indicate an old-style AT keyboard (83, 84, or
86 keys), or compatible.
Default: 0x4 (Enhanced 101-key or 102-key keyboard)

OverrideKeyboardSubtype REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x0
This entry is not usually present. When present, it specifies the OEM- dependent
keyboard subtype (overriding the keyboard subtype detected during system
initialization).
Default: 0x0

PollingIterations REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x400
Specifies the standard number of times to poll the hardware (in polling mode)
before giving up and timing out the operation. Consider increasing this value if
the driver fails to initialize or work correctly and the System log in Event
Viewer contains the following message from the i8042prt source: "The operation
on ... timed out (time out is configurable via the Registry)."
Default: 0x400

PollingIterationsMaximum REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x400
Specifies the maximum number of times to poll the hardware (in polling mode)
before giving up and timing out the operation. This value is used instead of
PollingIterations when an old-style AT keyboard is detected (see
OverrideKeyboardType). Consider increasing this value if the driver fails to
initialize or work correctly and the System log in Event Viewer contains the
following message from the i8042prt source: "The operation on ...timed out (time
out is configurable via the Registry)."
Default: 0x2EE0

ResendIterations REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the maximum number of times a hardware operation will be retried before
timing out. Consider increasing this value if the driver fails to initialize or
work correctly and the System log in Event Viewer contains the following message
from the i8042prt source: "Exceeded the allowable number of retries
(configurable via the Registry) on device ..."
Default: 0x3

SampleRate REG_DWORD Mouse sample rate in Hz
Specifies the sample rate for the mouse. Intended for future use. This value
might have no effect in the first release of Windows NT.
Default: 0x3C (60 Hz)

Microsoft InPort Bus Mouse Port Driver Entries
----------------------------------------------

The value entries for the Microsoft InPort bus mouse are found in this subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inport\Parameters

HzMode REG_DWORD Mouse sample rate mode specifier
Specifies the value written to the Microsoft InPort mode register to set the
mouse sample rate. Might be used in the first release of Windows NT, but should
become obsolete.
Default: 0x2 (selects 50 Hz)

MouseDataQueueSize REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the number of mouse events to be buffered internally by the driver, in
nonpaged pool. The allocated size, in bytes, of the internal buffer is this
value times the size of the MOUSE_INPUT_DATA structure (defined in NTDDMOU.H).
Consider increasing the size if the System log in Event Viewer contains the
following message from the InPort source: "The ring buffer that stores incoming
mouse data has overflowed (buffer size is configurable via the Registry)."
Default: 0x64 (100)

NumberOfButtons REG_DWORD &gt;= 0x1
Specifies the number of buttons on the Microsoft InPort bus mouse. If the number
of buttons detected at startup time and placed in the Registry is incorrect,
this value can be used to override it.
Default: 0x2

PointerDeviceBaseName REG_SZ Base port device name
Specifies the base name for the device object(s) created by the Microsoft InPort
bus mouse device driver. The device driver also writes information about the
device objects into HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DeviceMap so that the pointer
class driver can locate the pointer port device objects.
Default: PointerPort

SampleRate REG_DWORD Mouse sample rate in Hz
Specifies the sample rate for the Microsoft InPort bus mouse. Intended for future
use. This value might have no effect in the first release of Windows NT.
Default: 0x32 (50 Hz)
