SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to optimize graphics and game performance in
Microsoft Baseball 3D.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Getting started
---------------

The first time you start a game in Baseball 3D, the program profiles your
computer to determine the settings to use when you play the game. This process
configures game settings to make the game run well on your computer, but it does
not necessarily use the best settings for your computer. You can greatly improve
your game play experience by changing a few settings.

In general, when you improve game performance, you reduce graphic quality.
Optimization is the process of finding the best overall combination of game
performance and graphic quality. Microsoft recommends the following general
guidelines for optimizing Baseball 3D:

- To improve game performance without reducing graphic quality, enable Triple
  Buffering if your 3D card supports it.

- To improve both game performance and graphic quality, enable Mip Mapping if
  your 3D card supports it.

- To improve game performance further, decrease the graphics settings one at a
  time, starting with the settings that are least important to you, and then
  play the game after you change each setting to test game performance. To
  improve game performance, disable Shadows, or select a lower screen
  resolution or Player Detail level.

- To improve graphic quality, increase the graphics settings one at a time,
  starting with the settings that are most important to you, and play the game
  after you change each setting to test game performance. To improve graphic
  quality, enable Shadows, or select a higher screen resolution or Player
  Detail Level.

Changing Graphics and Performance Settings
------------------------------------------

To change graphics and performance settings in Baseball 3D, follow these steps:

1. Check the "Driver And 3D Card Information" Help file for any issues that may
  affect your 3D card. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Programs, and then point to Microsoft Games.

  b. Point to Baseball 3D, and then click Driver And 3D Card Information.

  c. Read the "Baseball 3D and your 3D Card" Help topic for a summary of known
     3D card issues.

2. Start Baseball 3D.

3. On the Baseball 3D startup screen, click Options, and then click Performance.

4. In the Resolutions Available box, click the screen resolution you want. The
  screen resolution controls the overall level of graphic detail in the game.

  NOTE: When you select a higher screen resolution, you may reduce game
  performance. You can improve game performance by selecting a lower screen
  resolution.

5. Under Player Detail, click the level of detail you want:

   - High: The players appear smooth and natural.

   - Medium: Also looks natural, but the players do not appear as smooth.

   - Low: Looks less natural, and the players may have some sharp edges.

  NOTE: When you select a higher Player Detail setting, you may reduce game
  performance. You can improve game performance by selecting a lower Player
  Detail setting.

6. Under Additional Options, click to enable or disable Shadows. The Shadows
  feature increases realism by making players and other objects in the game
  cast shadows.

  NOTE: When you enable Shadows, you may reduce game performance. You can
  improve game performance by disabling Shadows.

7. Under Additional Options, click to enable or disable Triple Buffering. If
  your 3D graphics card supports it, Triple Buffering can improve game
  performance.

  NOTE: If you experience reduced game performance or other problems, disable
  Triple Buffering if it is enabled.

8. Under Additional Options, click to enable or disable Mip Mapping. If your 3D
  graphics card supports it, Mip Mapping can improve game performance and
  improve graphic clarity and accuracy.

  NOTE: If you experience reduced game performance or other problems, disable
  Mip Mapping if it is enabled.

9. When you finish changing performance settings, click OK, and then play a game
  to test game performance and graphic quality.
