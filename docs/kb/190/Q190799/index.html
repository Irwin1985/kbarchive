-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The C Run-Time (CRT), included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you pass C Run-time (CRT) objects such as file handles, locales, and
environment variables into or out of a DLL (function calls across the DLL
boundary), unexpected behavior can occur if the DLL, as well as the files
calling into the DLL, use different copies of the CRT libraries.

A related problem can occur when you allocate (explicitly with new, malloc, or
implicitly with strdup, strstreambuf::str, and so on) and then pass a pointer
across a DLL boundary to be freed. This can cause a memory access violation or
heap corruption if the DLL and its users use different copies of the CRT
libraries.

Another symptom of this problem can be an error in the output window during
debugging such as:

  HEAP[]: Invalid Address specified to RtlValidateHeap(#,#)

CAUSE
=====

Each copy of the CRT library has a separate and distinct state. As such, CRT
objects such as file handles, environment variables, and locales are only valid
for the copy of the CRT where these objects are allocated or set. When a DLL and
its users use different copies of the CRT library, you cannot pass these CRT
objects across the DLL boundary and expect them to be picked up correctly on the
other side.

Also, because each copy of the CRT library has its own heap manager, allocating
memory in one CRT library and passing the pointer DLL boundary to be freed by a
different copy of the CRT library is a potential cause for heap corruption.

If you design your DLL so that it passes CRT objects across the boundary or
allocates memory and expects it to be freed outside the DLL, you restrict the
DLL users to use the same copy of the CRT library as the DLL. The DLL and its
users use the same copy of the CRT library only if both are linked with the same
version of the CRT DLL. This could be a problem if you mix applications built
with Visual C++ 5.0 with DLLs that are built by Visual C++ 4.1 or earlier.
Because the DLL version of the CRT library used by Visual C++ 4.1 is
msvcrt40.dll and the one used by Visual 5.0 is msvcrt.dll, you cannot build your
application to use the same copy of the CRT library as these DLLs.

However, there is an exception. In US English version and some other localized
versions of Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, such as German, French, and Czech,
a forwarder version of the msvcrt40.dll (version 4.20)is shipped. As a result,
even though the DLL is linked with msvcrt40.dll and its user is linked with
msvcrt.dll, you are still using the same copy of the CRT library because all
calls made to msvcrt40.dll are forwarded to msvcrt.dll.

However this forwarder version of msvcrt40.dll is not available in Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition (Me), and some localized versions of
Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, such as Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. So, if
your application targets these operating systems, you need to either obtain an
upgraded version of the DLL that doesn't rely on msvcrt40.dll or alter your
application to not rely on using the same copy of the CRT libraries. If you have
developed the DLL, this means rebuilding it with Visual C++ 4.2 or later. If it
is a third- party DLL, you need to contact your vendor for an upgrade.

Please note that this forwarder DLL version of msvcrt40.dll (version 4.20) cannot
be redistributed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Case 1. Passing a File Handle Across a DLL Boundary:

Sample Code
-----------

     //testDll.cpp

     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     __declspec(dllexport) void writeFile(FILE *stream)
     {
        char   s[] = "this is a string\n";
        fprintf( stream, "%s", s );
        fclose( stream );
     }

     //testMain.cpp
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     #include &lt;process.h&gt;
     void writeFile(FILE *stream);

     void main(void)
     {
       FILE  * stream;
       stream = fopen( "fprintf.out", "w" );
       writeFile(stream);
       system( "type fprintf.out" );
     }
     /***********End of Sample code*************/ 

1. Build the DLL as follows: cl /MT /LD testDll.cpp

2. Build the .exe file as follows: cl /MT testMain.cpp /link testdll.lib

3. Run the resulting testMain.exe. You get an access violation.

4. If both the DLL and .exe file are built with /MD so that only one copy of the
  CRT is used, you get the correct result:

  this is a string

Case 2. Passing Environment Variables Across a DLL Boundary:

Sample Code:
------------

     //testDll.cpp
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

     __declspec(dllexport) void readEnv()
     {
     char *libvar;

          /* Get the value of the MYLIB environment variable. */ 
          libvar = getenv( "MYLIB" );

          if( libvar != NULL )
              printf( "New MYLIB variable is: %s\n", libvar);
          else
        printf( "MYLIB has not been set.\n");
     }

      //testMain.cpp
      #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
      #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

      void readEnv();

      void main( void )
      {
         _putenv( "MYLIB=c:\\mylib;c:\\yourlib" );
         readEnv();
      }
      /****************End of Sample Code*****************/ 

1. Build the DLL as follows:

  cl /MT /LD testDll.cpp

2. Build the .exe file as follows:

  cl /MT testMain.cpp /link testdll.lib

3. Run the resulting testMain.exe. You get an access violation.

4. If both the DLL and .exe file are built with /MD so that only one copy of the
  CRT is used, you get the correct result:

  New MYLIB variable is: c:\mylib;c:\yourlib
