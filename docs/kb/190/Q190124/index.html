The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to create a temporary table(for example, #temp) with ODBCdirect,
you receive no indication that the temporary table was created and no errors are
reported.

CAUSE
=====

The temporary table is created but as a result of its scope, the table appears
not to be created. The default execution option for Connection and QueryDef
statements is to run as a prepared statement. When the statement is executed as
a prepared statement, the SQLPrepare ODBC API function is called and a temporary
stored procedure is created in which the statement executes. As a result of the
temporary stored procedure execution, the temporary table is destroyed as the
stored procedure terminates. Thus, the scope of local temporary tables is the
transaction space or stored procedure in which they were created. SQLServer
Books Online contains a detailed discussion of the scopy of local and global
temporary tables. To reproduce the problem, refer to the code sample contained
in the MORE INFORMATION section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you need to refer to a temporary table created with ODBCdirect, send the SQL
statement in one transaction statement or use the &lt;dbExecDirect&gt; option
with ODBCDirect Connection and QueryDef objects. For example:

1. Create an ODBC DSN called &lt;Pubs&gt; with the ODBC32 administrator.

2. Open Visual Basic and create a new Standard.exe project.

3. On the Project menu, click References, and select the Microsoft DAO 3.5x
  Object Library.

4. In the &lt;Form-Load&gt; event, paste and run the following code:

        Dim ws As Workspace
        Dim cn As Connection
        Dim strConnect as string
        Dim strSQL as string

        Set ws = DBEngine.CreateWorkspace("", "", "", dbUseODBC)
        Set cn = ws.OpenConnection("", , ,
                 "ODBC;DSN=Pubs;Database=Pubs;UID=sa;PWD=")

        strSQL = "CREATE TABLE #test (field1 VARCHAR(20) NULL)" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
           "CREATE TABLE TestTemp(field1 VARCHAR(20) NULL)" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
          "INSERT INTO #test(field1) SELECT fname FROM Employee" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
           "INSERT INTO TestTemp(field1) SELECT field1 FROM #test"

        cn.Execute strSQL

5. Start ISQL_W and run the following statement:

        SELECT * FROM TestTemp
        DROP TABLE TestTemp

RESULTS: You should see rows returned in the results windows. If the #temp table
was not created in step 4, TestTemp would not exist.

This example demonstrates that the #temp table is created during step 4 but
pausing/stopping the code at any point does not reveal that fact. The SQL
statement is being executed and the connection is closed immediately, so you do
not see the details within ISQL_W or Visual Basic.

NOTE: The &lt;DROP TABLE&gt; statement deletes the table from the database so you
may run the example again.

To refer to the temporary table at some other point in the code, use the
&lt;dbExecDirect&gt; option with the Connection or QueryDef object as in the
following example.

Follow steps 1 through 3 as in the previous example. Then paste the following
code in the &lt;Form-Load&gt; event and run the project:

     Dim ws As Workspace
     Dim cn As Connection
     Dim strConnect as string
     Dim strSQL as string

     Set ws = DBEngine.CreateWorkspace("", "", "", dbUseODBC)
     Set cn = ws.OpenConnection("", , ,
              "ODBC;DSN=Pubs;Database=Pubs;UID=sa;PWD=")

     strSQL = "CREATE TABLE #test (field1 VARCHAR(20) NULL)" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
              "INSERT INTO #test(field1) SELECT fname FROM Employee"
     cn.Execute strSQL, dbExecDirect

     strSQL = "CREATE TABLE TestTemp(field1 VARCHAR(20) NULL)" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _
              "INSERT INTO TestTemp(field1) SELECT field1 FROM #test"
     cn.Execute strSQL, dbExecDirect

You should see rows returned in the results windows. This demonstrates that the
temporary table was created and its scope was not limited to a prepared
statement (temporary stored procedure) but the database connection.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ODBC DSN called &lt;Pubs&gt; with the ODBC32 administrator.

2. Open Visual Basic and create a new Standard.exe project.

3. On the Project menu, click References, and select the Microsoft DAO 3.5x
  Object Library.

4. In the &lt;Form-Load&gt; event, paste the following code:

        Dim ws As Workspace
        Dim cn As Connection
        Dim strConnect as string
        Dim strSQL as string

        Set ws = DBEngine.CreateWorkspace("", "", "", dbUseODBC)
        Set cn = ws.OpenConnection("", , ,
                 "ODBC;DSN=Pubs;Database=Pubs;UID=sa;PWD=")

        strSQL = "CREATE TABLE #test (field1 VARCHAR(20) NULL)"
        cn.Execute strSQL

        'This statement results in an error.
        strSQL = "INSERT INTO #test(field1) SELECT fname FROM Employee"
        cn.Execute strSQL

The temporary table was created but in a prepared statement (temporary stored
procedure). Consequently, the temporary table was destroyed when the stored
procedure terminated, resulting in an error on the subsequent reference to the
temporary table.
