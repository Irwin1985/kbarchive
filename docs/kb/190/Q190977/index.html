-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The AppWizard, included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Custom AppWizards based on Standard MFC AppWizard steps have the following
problems when generating applications that do not support the Document/View
architecture:

- SDI applications created with the AppWizard, that do not support the
  Document/View architecture, do not have the proper associations between their
  toolbar buttons and their images. For example: the Help About toolbar button
  has the Print image on it. When Context-sensitive help is selected, the Help
  toolbar button has the Help About image on it.
- MDI applications that do not support the Document/View architecture and have
  Context-sensitive Help do not have a Help toolbar image.

CAUSE
=====

There is one toolbar bitmap (Tbnd_.bmp) that is used for both SDI and MDI
applications without Document/View support. This same bitmap is also used when
Context-sensitive Help is selected in Custom AppWizard step 4. This bitmap does
not contain the Help toolbar image.

In the case of SDI applications, there is no File New toolbar button generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remedy the disassociation between toolbar buttons and images for SDI
applications, remove the following compile-time directives in the Toolbar
section of the template file, All.rc:

  .
  .
  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
  // Toolbar
  // 

  IDR_MAINFRAME TOOLBAR DISCARDABLE  16, 15
  BEGIN
  $$IF(!DB_NO_FILE)
  $$IF(!NODOCVIEW)

      BUTTON      ID_FILE_NEW
      BUTTON      ID_FILE_OPEN
      BUTTON      ID_FILE_SAVE
      SEPARATOR

  $$ELSE
  $$IF(!PROJTYPE_SDI)           &lt;-Remove this directive

      BUTTON      ID_FILE_NEW
      SEPARATOR

  $$ENDIF // !PROJTYPE_SDI      &lt;-Remove this directive
  $$ENDIF // NODOCVIEW
  $$ENDIF //!DB_NO_FILE

      BUTTON      ID_EDIT_CUT
      BUTTON      ID_EDIT_COPY
      BUTTON      ID_EDIT_PASTE

  .
  .

At this point, both SDI and MDI applications behave the same way--each is missing
an image on the Help button when Context-sensitive help is selected. To resolve
this problem, you must create a new toolbar bitmap that contains all of the
images in Tbnd_.bmp, but also includes a Help image. Follow these steps to
create the new toolbar bitmap:

1. In FileView, expand the Template directory. Open the Tbah_.bmp toolbar bitmap
  in the resource editor by double-clicking it. This bitmap contains the
  required images along with the File Open and File Save images.

2. In the Graphics window, select the Rectangle Selection tool if it is not
  already selected. Using the mouse, select the File Open and File Save images
  by dragging the mouse over them. Press the DEL key.

  NOTE: Toolbar images are 16x15 pixels in size. The area you select should be
  32x15 and can be verified in the status bar.

3. Using the mouse, select the remaining images to the left of the deleted area.
  These images include Edit Cut, Edit Copy, Edit Paste, Help About and Help.
  Once the images are selected, use the mouse and drag the images to the right
  so they are flush with the File New image. Resize the width of the bitmap to
  be flush with Help image. On the main menu bar, click File, and then click
  SaveAs. In this article, we will refer to it as Tbndh.bmp. Save the bitmap
  and close the resource editor.

4. On the Project menu, click Add To Project, and then click Files. Select the
  newly created bitmap from the Template directory and click OK.

5. On the Insert menu, click Resource. Click Toolbar and click Import. Select
  the new bitmap. To do this, go to the Open As list, select Custom, and click
  Import. Select "TEMPLATE" as the Resource type and click OK.

6. Right-click the resource in ResourceView and click Properties. In the ID
  drop-down box, type "TBNDH.BMP" (note that you must use the quotation marks)
  and click OK.

7. Add the following compile-time directive to the Resources section of the
  NewProj.inf template file:

  ///NewProj.inf
  .
  .
  $$// Resources

  /res
  $$IF(MULTIPLE_LANGS)
  $$BEGINLOOP(NUM_LANGS)
  .
  .
  $$ELSE  // NODOCVIEW
  $$IF(HELP) //Context-sensitive help  // &lt;-Add this directive.
  =:tbndh.bmp   res\Toolbar.bmp        // &lt;-Use the new toolbar.
  $$ELSE                               // &lt;-Add this directive.
  =:tbnd_.bmp   res\Toolbar.bmp
  $$ENDIF  // HELP                     // &lt;-Add this directive.
  $$ENDIF
  $$ENDIF //TOOLBAR
  $$ENDIF //!PROJTYPE_DLG
  .
  .

8. Recompile your Custom AppWizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SDI applications that do not support the Document/View architecture do not have
File New menu support. This is because a Frame and View are always created for
you when the application is run. You may edit the code to include a File New
menu and handler if you like. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190518 BUG: MFC AppWizard Generates Incorrect Toolbars and Bitmaps

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create and build a Custom AppWizard project based on Standard MFC AppWizard
  (exe) steps.

2. Create a project based on your new Custom AppWizard. In step 1, select Single
  Document, clear Document/View architecture support. Accept the defaults in
  steps 2 and 3. In step 4, select Context-sensitive help and click Finish.

3. Build and run the application. Verify the toolbar tooltips.

4. Create a project based on your new Custom AppWizard. In step 1, select
  Multiple Document and clear Document/View architecture support. Accept the
  defaults in steps 2 and 3. In step 4, select Context-sensitive help and click
  Finish.

5. Build and run the application. Verify that the Help toolbar button has no
  image.
