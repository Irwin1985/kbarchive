SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (Dxdiag.exe) included with
Microsoft DirectX version 8.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DirectX Diagnostic Tool is designed to help you troubleshoot DirectX-related
issues.

The default installation folder for Dxdiag.exe is:

  C:\Windows\System

To start the DirectX Diagnostic Tool:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

The following list contains a description of each tab in the DirectX Diagnostic
Tool dialog box:

System
------

The System tab provides system information about your computer and specifies the
version of DirectX installed on your computer.

DirectX Files
-------------

The DirectX Files tab lists the filename and version number for each DirectX file
installed on your computer, as well as, the filename and version number of many
common files used by games running under DirectX.

If the DirectX Diagnostic Tool detects a problem with a DirectX file, a warning
message is displayed in the Notes box.

Display'N'
----------

('N' is the number of the physical display device.)

The Display tab lists your current display settings, and allows you to disable
DirectDraw, Direct3D, and AGP Texture Acceleration. This tab also allows testing
of DirectDraw and Direct3D. Passing these tests indicates that the DirectX
Graphics runtime files are installed and operating correctly. It is not a
comprehensive test of your computer's display hardware.

The Display tab also lists your device's available memory and can tell you if
your video driver is "Signed", which indicates that it has passed Microsoft's
Windows Hardware Quality Labs testing regimen.

NOTE: Dxdiag.exe cannot report memory that is in use at the time it is launched.
Therefore, it is not uncommon to see less memory reported than your video card
actually has.

If the DirectX Diagnostic Tool detects a problem with your display settings, a
warning message is displayed in the Notes box.

Sound
-----

The Sound tab displays your current sound settings, and enables you to test
DirectSound. The Sound tab can tell you if your audio driver is "Signed" - which
indicates that it has passed Microsoft's Windows Hardware Quality Labs testing
regimen.

The Hardware Sound Acceleration Level slider is used to correct audio glitches
that might be caused by some audio drivers. Reducing the acceleration by one
notch and re-testing the application is the best way to troubleshoot DirectSound
audio problems. Lowering the Hardware Sound Acceleration Level from the default
setting of "full acceleration" may disable advanced audio processing techniques,
such as 3D spatialization from functioning.

If the DirectX Diagnostic Tool detects a problem with your sound settings, a
warning message is displayed in the Notes box.

Music
-----

The Music tab displays your current MIDI settings, and enables you to test the
DirectMusic component of DirectX.

If the DirectX Diagnostic Tool detects a problem with DirectMusic, a warning
message is displayed in the Notes box.

NOTE: DirectMusic is a new component included in DirectX 6.1.

Input
-----

The Input tab lists the input devices connected to your computer and the input
drivers installed on your computer.

If the DirectX Diagnostic Tool detects a problem with an input device or an input
device driver, a warning message is displayed in the Notes box.

Network
-------

The Network tab lists the registered DirectPlay Service Providers. These are the
connection methods that DirectPlay will operate across. A registry problem here
can normally be resolved by reinstalling DirectX.

The Registered Lobyable DirectPlay Applications section lists all applications
which have informed DirectX that they will use DirectPlay for their network
communication needs. A registry error here can normally be resolved by removing
and reinstalling that application.

The DirectPlay test opens a chat window over DirectPlay using the settings you
specify. Systems that cannot successfully chat with one another here will almost
certainly be unable to establish a network connection within games.

If the DirectX Diagnostic Tool detects a problem with a DirectPlay Service
Provider or Application, a warning message is displayed in the Notes box.

More Help
---------

If you are unable to resolve your DirectX issue using the previous
troubleshooting tabs, you can use the More Help tab to continue troubleshooting
the issue.

The following list contains a description of the functionality of each button on
the More Help tab:

- Troubleshoot
  The Troubleshoot button starts a DirectX troubleshooter.

- Sound
  The Sound button starts a sound troubleshooter.

- MSInfo
  The MSInfo button starts Msinfo32.exe, a utility that gathers system
  information about your computer. The file created by Msinfo32.exe can be sent
  to Microsoft Technical Support to help resolve persistent issues.

- Override
  The Override button changes the DirectDraw refresh rate.

NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend changing the DirectDraw refresh rate as a
general troubleshooting step.
