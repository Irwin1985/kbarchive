-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic 6.0 offers a new option for projects:

  "Remove information about unused ActiveX Controls."

This article discusses how to use this option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Make tab under the Project Properties menu has the following option:

  "Remove information about unused ActiveX Controls"

If this option is selected, any ActiveX controls that have been referenced but
not sited within the project will not have their license information included in
the final compiled executable.

Visual Basic allows ActiveX controls to be dynamically loaded at run-time. This
feature raises concerns about being able to load/use controls which a program
legally should not be able to use.

Visual Basic has two ways of using an ActiveX control legally:

- Include the ActiveX control license within the compiled executable.

- Load the license for an ActiveX control during run-time before loading the
  actual control.

Both ways ensure that the license for the control is checked (either during
development or during run-time) prior to the control being used.

A license that is included in a compiled executable will be part of the Licenses
collection object.

In order to add controls dynamically without concern about the License collection
object, make sure that the "Remove information about unused ActiveX Controls"
option is deselected.

Adding an ActiveX Control During Run-time That Requires a License
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following sample shows how to reference a control in Visual Basic and add it
dynamically during run-time without having to use the Licenses collection
object:

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Select Components from the Project menu and select "Microsoft Hierarchical
  FlexGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB)."

3. Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1.

4. Add the following code to Form1:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Command1_Click()

           Dim ctlTest As VBControlExtender

           ' add a control dynamically to this form
           Set ctlTest = Form1.Controls.Add _
           ("MSHierarchicalFlexGridLib.MSHFlexgrid","ctlTestControl")

           ' position and show the form
           ctlTest.Move 100, (Command1.Top + Command1.Height) + 100
           ctlTest.Visible = True

        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()

           ' move the command1 button to the corner for appearance.
           Command1.Move 100, 100

        End Sub

5. Compile the Project (Project1.Exe).

6. Run the compiled Project.

7. Click the "Command1" button. The following error will appear:

  Run-time Error "731"

  "In order to use "MSHierarchicalFlexGridLib.MSHFlexgrid", you must specify a
  license string for the control. Use Licenses.Add to add the license string to
  the Licenses collection."

  Although "Microsoft Hierarchical Flexgrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB)" is referenced
  within the project, the License information for the controls were removed
  because none of the controls were sited on any forms. Running within the IDE
  would result in run-time error "50153."

8. In the design environment, select Project1 Properties from the Project menu,
  then the "Make" tab on the Project1 Properties dialog.

9. Make sure that the "remove information about unused ActiveX controls" option
  is not selected.

10. Make the project again.

11. Run the compiled project.

12. Click the "Command1" button. This time the Hierarchical Flexgrid Control
  will be instantiated and will be sited on the form.
