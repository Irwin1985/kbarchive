-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Internet Information Services (IIS)
5.0 because of the way IIS interprets content that contains a particular type of
invalid MIME header. If an attacker places content that contains this type of
defect onto a server, and then requests it, the IIS service is unable to serve
any content until a spurious entry is removed from the File Type table for the
site.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have the ability to
place content onto an affected Web server. However, best practices strongly
recommend that you never allow an untrusted user to install content on a Web
server. The vulnerability affects only IIS 5.0 servers, and does not allow an
attacker to gain any privileges on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because of the way IIS handles MIME information when
serving content. If the MIME content-type information is malformed in a
particular way, the service fails when trying to process it.

RESOLUTION
==========
