  Q303984 NNTP Service in Windows 2000 Contains Memory Leak

SYMPTOMS
========

The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) service in Windows NT 4.0 contains a
memory leak in a routine that processes news postings. Each time such a posting
is processed that contains a particular construction, the memory leak causes a
small amount of memory to no longer be available for use. If an attacker sent a
large number of posts, the server memory could be depleted to the point at which
normal service would be disrupted. An affected server could be restored to
normal service by rebooting.

Mitigating Factors:

- Windows NT 4.0 does not contain a native NNTP service. NNTP is only available
  on the system if the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack has been installed.

- The default configuration of NNTP is not affected by this vulnerability, as
  no newsgroups are configured by default.

- This vulnerability would not enable an attacker to usurp any administrative
  control or compromise data on the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems that are determined to be at risk of attack. Please evaluate your
computer's physical accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other
factors to determine the degree of risk to your computer. Please see the
associated Microsoft Security Bulletin
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-043.asp)
to help make this determination. This fix may receive additional testing at a
later time, to further ensure product quality. If your computer is sufficiently
at risk, Microsoft recommends that you apply this fix now.

To resolve this problem immediately, download the fix as instructed below or
contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the fix. For a complete
list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and information on
support costs, please go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
