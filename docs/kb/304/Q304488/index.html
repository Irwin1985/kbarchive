Pages 51 &amp; 345: Correction To Question 6
----------------------------------------

On pages 51 and 345, question 6,

Change:
"6. When you use Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Cluster Service, which of the
following drive type are supported for the shared device?"

To:
"6. When you use Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Cluster Service, which of the
following technologies are supported for the shared device?"


Page 81:  Remove Windows 2000 Datacenter Server
-----------------------------------------------

On page 81, under Lesson Summary,

Change:
"This lesson explained how to perform rolling upgrades of a cluster from Windows
NT 4 Enterprise Edition to Windows 2000 Advanced Server or Windows 2000
Datacenter Server."

To:
"This lesson explained how to perform rolling upgrades of a cluster from Windows
NT 4 Enterprise Edition to Windows 2000 Advanced Server."


Page 98: Incorrect Dependencies In Table 4.3
--------------------------------------------

On page 98, in Table 4.3,

Change:
"Generic Application - None
Generic Service - None"

To:
"Generic Application - Network Name
Generic Service - Network Name"


Page 165: Incorrect Path In Figure 6.3
--------------------------------------

Page 165, in Figure 6.3,

Change:
"q:\dhcp\backup"

To:
"w:\dhcp\backup"


Page 211: Incorrect Statement About Possible Owners
---------------------------------------------------

On page 211, in the eighth bulleted item,

Change:
"Check the Possible Owners list of the group and each resource to ensure..."

To:
"Check the Possible Owners list of each resource to ensure..."


Page 335: Incorrect Information About Unexpected Manner Of Network Traffic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 335, in the top paragraph, change:
"Network traffic might be causing a large amount of collisions or might not
consistently arrive at its intended destination. In this situation, the switch
and the unicast network address are conflicting with each other. If you're using
a switch to connect the hosts in your cluster configuration, NLB must be set to
use multicast mode. If you cannot change the mode to unicast, you must connect
your cluster hosts in some other way, perhaps with a hub or coaxial cable.
Otherwise, you'll have to switch to multicast mode using the Cluster Parameters
tab of the network load balancing properties dialog box."

To:
"Network traffic might be causing a large amount of collisions or might not
consistently arrive at its intended destination when connections are made across
a switch to which the NLB virtual adapters are connected. This problem occurs
because a large number of unknown unicast and multicast packets are being
blocked on the port(s) of the switch. By default, NLB masks the source media
access control (MAC) address on outbound packets, preventing switches from
learning and forcing them to broadcast packets for unknown addresses to all
ports.

"To resolve this issue, you can replace the switch with a hub, disable port
blocking, add a static address to the MAC address table on the switch that maps
to the virtual MAC address used by the NLB cluster, or modify the registry of
each NLB cluster host to disable masking of the MAC address."
