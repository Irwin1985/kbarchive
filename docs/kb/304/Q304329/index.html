-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.6, 2.6 SP1 
- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5, versions Build 2.573.6526, Build 2.573.7326 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting with an ODBC connection (with or without a data source name)
using the Microsoft ODBC driver for Oracle, if the specified Transparent Network
Substrate (TNS) name does not exist for the Oracle server, an application may
receive an access violation. This occurs whether using SQLConnect() or
SQLDriverConnect().

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs only when ODBC connection pooling is enabled. When the
Microsoft ODBC driver for Oracle returns a connection failure (because the TNS
name does not exist), the ODBC Driver Manager pools the failed connection but
does not mark the connection as dead. The connection handle is used later and an
access violation occurs.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SQL Server 2000, the
latest service pack for MDAC 2.6, or the MDAC hotfix referenced below: For
