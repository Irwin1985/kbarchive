SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 do not respect custom paper sizes as Windows 95
and later do. The custom paper size is stored in the report header, under
PaperSize in the EXPR field. Under Windows 95 and later, the PaperSize for
custom is 256, with PaperLength and PaperWidth controlling the actual size.
Under Windows NT 4.0 and later, the custom size must correspond to a predefined
form.

To determine the correct PaperSize to use for a Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000
report, you must use Windows API calls. This article includes code that
demonstrates how to determine the name and size of the forms that are installed
on your system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 95, you can select the paper size Custom, and then select the page
height and width. Under NT-based systems, to print to a custom size, you must
select a printer form, which specifies the paper size. To view the different
forms that are available on your system, open the Printers window, and click
Server Properties on the File menu. You may not be able to directly select all
of these from Visual FoxPro.

The number of the form is stored in the report header, under PaperSize in the
EXPR field. To view this, USE the report as a table (USE myReport.frx), BROWSE
it, and double-click the Memo in the first line of the EXPR field. The default
PaperSize can also be displayed with the PRTINFO(2) function.

This code requires Christof Lange's STRUCT.VCX class, which can be downloaded at
various sites on the Internet, including the following:

  SET PATH TO c:\STRUCT  &amp;&amp; Change this to be wherever you unzipped the class.

  FOR i = 1 TO lnFormCount
     loForm = loForms.aForms[i]
