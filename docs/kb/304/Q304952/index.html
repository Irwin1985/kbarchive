-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4, 1.99 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you sign in to Passport, you are not returned to the participant Web site
and you receive the following error message:

  Passport Partner Error

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem with the key installation or configuration of Passport on the
participant Web site.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

- Verify that your encryption key is installed properly. Try rerunning the key
  installation program; at the very least, check the current version of the key
  on the server by using the showcurrent command. For more information, see the
  following Passport Software Development Kit (SDK) Web site:

  Installing the Encryption Key
  http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/Implementation/enckey.htm

- Use the Passport Manager Administration utility to check your currently
  configured Site ID. If your Site ID and return URL / RootURL correlation
  don't match, users see a Passport network page informing them that something
  is wrong with the Site ID.

- If your site is being hosted on mirrored servers, make sure that all of the
  sites use the same encryption key if they are intended to serve the same
  site. Symptoms of a bad key include Windows NT event 5021, or failure to set
  cookies even though a Ticket and Profile arrived on the query string.

- If you have configured a server for multiple Passport sites, verify that the
  following are true:

   - The Web site name field in the Passport Administration Utility for each
     site is set correctly.

   - The key installation command used the /s siteName option and the site name
     matches the Web site name that was given.

   - The Host Name/IP Address resolves to the correct Passport site on your
     server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following may also appear in conjunction with the error message that is
listed in the "Symptoms" section:

  An error has occurred at the site you are trying to log into. However, you
  are already signed in to Passport as &lt; customerxxx@hotmail.com &lt;mailto:
  customerxxx@hotmail.com&gt; &gt;, so you don't need to sign in.

On the Beta Pre-production environment, you may receive the following error
message:

  Passport Service Unavailable

This may be accompanied by NT event errors. For more information, see the
following Passport SDK Web site:

  Passport Manager Windows NT Events
  "http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/Reference/operations/ntevents.htm
