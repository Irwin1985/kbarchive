MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Evaluation CD Not Bootable
----------------------------------

The Windows 2000 Professional Evaluation Edition CD included with this book is
not bootable. In order to install Windows 2000 Professional using this CD, you
must create Windows 2000 Professional Setup Boot Disks.

For information on how to create the Windows 2000 Professional Setup Boot Disks,
please refer to the book's Appendix B, "Creating Setup Boot Disks", or to the
PRO1.txt and PRO2.txt files on the Evaluation CD.


Page XXXVI: Hard Disk Requirements Conflict With Page 27
--------------------------------------------------------

On pages XXXVI, 29, 47, 33 and 594 the minimum hard disk requirements are listed
as 500 MB, and 1GB recommended. Page 27 lists the minimum hard disk space as 650
MB, with 2 GB recommended. The correct hard disk requirements are those listed
on page 27.

Change the hard disk requirements on page XXXVI, 29, 47, 33 and 594 accordingly.

The system requirements are: one or more hard disks with a minimum of 650 MB of
free disk space, a 2GB or larger partition is recommended.

These system requirements are also listed on the Windows 2000 Professional System
Requirements web site at:
http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/professional/evaluation/sysreqs/default.asp


Page XXXVI: List Of Skills Being Measured Is Incomplete
-------------------------------------------------------

On page xxxvi, the list of skills being measured is incomplete and repetitive and
does not match the list of skills being measured for Exam 70-210 on the
Microsoft MCP Web site at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-210.asp

Please refer to the Web site listed above for an accurate list of skills being
measured for this exam.


Page XXXVII: Incorrect Amount Of RAM Listed In Hardware Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On page xxxvii, under "Hardware Requirements," change the 2nd bulleted item
from:
"At least 32 MB RAM (64 MB RAM recommended)"

To:
"64 MB RAM"


Page 10: Typographical Error
----------------------------

There is an error on page 10 in the 5th paragraph.

Change:
"Supports FAT32 file system compatibility with Windows 95 Operating System
Release (OSR) 2..."

To:
"Supports FAT32 file system compatibility with Windows 95 OEM Service Release
(OSR) 2..."


Page 22: Incorrect Instructions For Changing Password
-----------------------------------------------------

Page 22 states:
"Change Password - This is the only way you can change your own password."

Windows 2000 Professional includes a Users and Passwords applet in Control Panel.
This applet can be used to change your password. Windows 2000 Server does not
include this applet.

This item should read:
"Allows you to change your account password. You must know the old password to
create a new one."


Page 27: Memory Requirements Are Incorrect
------------------------------------------

On page 27, in table 2.1, change:

+----------------------------+
| CPU    | Pentium Based     | 
+----------------------------+
| Memory | 32 MB             | 
+----------------------------+
|        | 64 MB recommended | 
+----------------------------+

To:

+-----------------------------+
| CPU    | Pentium Compatible | 
+-----------------------------+
| Memory | 64 MB minimum      | 
+-----------------------------+


Page 33: Incorrect Information About NTFS Accessibility
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 33, in the table under "Preinstallation Checklist", the fourth item
suggests that network clients running operating systems other than Windows NT or
Windows 2000 cannot access network resources residing on the NTFS partition.
This is incorrect.

Change:
"Unless you need to dual boot operating systems or have clients running operating
systems other than Windows NT or Windows 2000 that need to access information on
this computer, format all partitions with NTFS."

To:
"Unless you need to dual boot operating systems, format all partitions with
NTFS."


Page 48: Misuse Of Words "source" And "target"
----------------------------------------------

On page 48, under "Performing an installation over the Network", in item number 3
make the following corrections to the second sentence.

Change:
"Use Winnet.exe for an installation using Windows 3.X on the source system, and
use Winnet32.exe for an installation using Windows 95, 98, NT 4 (or NT 3.4) or
2000 on the source system."

To:
"Use Winnt.exe for installation if you are using Windows 3.X on the target
system, and use Winnt32.exe for installation if you are using Windows 95, 98, NT
4 (or NT 3.5) or 2000 on the target system."

Also note: winnet.exe and winnet32.exe should be winnt.exe and winnt32.exe.


Page 48: Incorrect Version Of Upgradeable Windows NT
----------------------------------------------------

On page 48, under "Performing an Installation over the Network", in step 3,
change the version reference from NT 3.5 to NT 3.51.

Change:
"( or NT 3.5),"

To:
"( or NT 3.51),"


Page 49 &amp; 51: References To UDB File Are Inconsistent
-----------------------------------------------------

On pages 49 and 51 there are references to a Uniqueness Database File. Page 49
uses the acronym UDB and UDF for the Uniqueness Database File. Page 51 uses the
acronym UDF when referring to the Uniqueness Database File. Both acronyms, UDB
and UDF, can be used to refer to the Uniqueness Database File.

However, the Description for the winnt.exe command syntax /udf:ID[,UDF_file], on
page 49 says that setup will prompt you to insert a disk that contains the
$Unique$.udb file. The Description for the winnt32.exe command syntax on page 51
says that it will prompt you for the disk that contains the $Unique$.udf file.

The file extension should be .udb in both instances when referring to the
$Unique$.udb file.


Page 62: Correction In Table 3.1, Console User Modes
----------------------------------------------------

On page 62 in the Console User Modes table, Table 3.1, the description of when to
use Full Access is inaccurate. You cannot add or remove snap-ins in User Mode -
Full Access.

Change the second sentence in the table from:
"This includes the ability to add or remove snap ins, to create new windows, to
create..."

To:
"This includes the ability to create new windows, to create..."


Page 62: Incorrect Console Modes In Table 3.1
---------------------------------------------

On page 62 in the Console User Modes table, Table 3.1, there is an error
regarding Delegated and Limited Access.

Change:
"Delegated Access, Multiple Windows
Delegated Access, Single Window"

To:
"Limited Access, Multiple Window
Limited Access, Single Window"


Page 67: Incorrect Description In Addin Console Steps
-----------------------------------------------------

On page 67, under "To add the Event Viewer snap-in to a console", in step 3,
change:
"3. In the Add/Remove Snap-In dialog box, select Event Viewer,"

To:
"3. In the Add Standalone Snap-in dialog box, select Event Viewer,"


Page 72: First Sentence Should Say "Schedule WordPad"
-----------------------------------------------------

On Page 72, the first sentence should say "schedule WordPad" instead of "schedule
Address Book."

Change:
"In this practice, you will schedule Address Book to start at a predetermined
time."

To:
"In this practice, you will schedule WordPad to start at a predetermined time."


Page 84: Incorrect Number Of Multiple Displays
----------------------------------------------

On page 84, in the final sentence of the first paragraph under the heading Using
Multiple Displays, change:

"Windows 2000 supports extending your display across a maximum of 10 monitors."

To:

"Windows 2000 supports extending your display across a maximum of 9 monitors."


Page 97: Incorrect Minimum Paging File Size In Table 4.4
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 97, in Table 4.4, under "Small Memory Dump",

Change:
"The paging file space required is 64 K."

To:
"The paging file space required is 2 MB."


Page 97: Boot Disk Should Be Boot Partition In Table 4.4
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 97, in Table 4.4, under "Complete Memory Dump",

Change:
"You must have a paging file on the boot disk..."

To:
"You must have a paging file on the boot partition..."


Page 98: Change "system partition" To "boot partition"
------------------------------------------------------

On page 98, line 5,

Change:
"A paging file must be on the system partition"

To:
"A paging file must be on the boot partition"


Page 166: Incorrect Information In Step 5
-----------------------------------------

On page 166, in step 5, change:

"5. To verify that the IP address is working ..."

To:

"5. To verify that TCP/IP is working ..."


Page 169: Correction In Exercise 4
----------------------------------

The last sentence on page 169 states that you can simply disconnect your network
adapter cable if the DHCP service cannot be disabled.

This practice exercise will not work by unplugging the client's network cable. If
you cannot deactivate the DHCP server, it is necessary to leave the client
plugged in to the hub and disconnect the hub so that the client still thinks it
is on a network. The Automatic Private IP Addressing feature is designed to work
in a network situation only.

Change:
"If the DHCP Service can't be disabled, you can simply disconnect your network
adapter cable."

To:
"If the DHCP Service can't be disabled, you can simply disconnect the server's
network adapter cable. However, the client computer's network adapter cable must
remain connected."


Page 203: Incorrect Reference To Windows Versions
-------------------------------------------------

On page 203, in the first paragraph,

Change:
"Directory services based on Active Directory technology in Microsoft Windows
2000 is a significant enhancement over the directory services provided in
previous versions of Windows 2000"

To:
"Directory services based on Active Directory technology in Microsoft Windows
2000 is a significant enhancement over the directory services provided in
Windows NT."


Page 227: Incorrect Summary Of The Lesson
-----------------------------------------

On page 227, the Lesson Summary is inaccurate. Account options such as logon
hours, the computers from which users can log on, and account expiration are not
discussed in this lesson.

Change:
"In this lesson, you learned that in planning user accounts, you should determine
naming conventions for user accounts, requirements for password, and account
options such as logon hours, the computers from which users can log on, and
account expiration."

To:
"In this lesson, you learned that in planning user accounts, you should determine
naming conventions for user accounts and requirements for password"


Page 227: Passwords Can Be Up To 127 Characters
-----------------------------------------------

On page 227, under "Password Requirements" change:
"Passwords can be up to 128 characters"

To:
"Passwords can be up to 127 characters"


Page 227: Incorrect Reference To Table 10.1
-------------------------------------------

On page 227, in the last bulleted item under "Password Requirements", remove:

"Table 10.1 lists the invalid nonalphanumeric characters."

Please note that Table 10.1 lists the invalid nonalphanumeric characters for the
user account name, not that for the password.


Page 235: Incorrect Information About User Profile Location
-----------------------------------------------------------

The second bullet item on page 235 incorrectly states that the user profile is
stored on the system partition.

Change:
"Windows 2000 creates a default user profile for the user and stores it in the
system partition root..."

To:
"Windows 2000 creates a default user profile for the user and stores it in the
boot partition root..."


Pages 301 &amp; 302: Incorrect Reference To README.TXT
--------------------------------------------------

On pages 301 and 302, all instances of "README.TXT" should be changed to
"README.DOC".


Page 328: Incorrect Number Of Permissions
-----------------------------------------

On page 328, under "Using Special Access Permissions" sub-heading, the incorrect
number of special access permissions are listed.

Change:

Page 331: Incorrect Number of Permissions
-----------------------------------------

On page 331, in the first sentence under Lesson Summary, change:

"In this lesson, you learned that there are 14 special access permissions"

To:

"In this lesson, you learned that there are 13 special access permissions"


Page 381: In Table 16.2 The Description For No Auditing Is Incorrect
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 381, in Table 16.2, the description for no auditing is incorrect.

Change:
"No auditing indicates it is auditing this event."

To:
"No auditing indicates it is not auditing this event."


Page 405: Incorrect Information About Default Logon Requirement
---------------------------------------------------------------

On page 405, under "Disable CTRL+ALT+DEL Requirement For Logon",

Change:
"By default, Windows 2000 Professional doesn't require users to press
Ctrl+Alt+Delete to log on to the computer. To increase security on your
computers, you can disable this feature."

To:
"By default, Windows 2000 Professional requires users to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to
log on to the computer. By disabling this default behavior, you reduce the
security on your computer."


Page 406: Disable Should Be Enable
----------------------------------

backups,"


Page 490: Change Network Dial-up Connection Wizard To Network Connection Wizard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 490, under the "Allowing Inbound Dial-up Connections" heading, the first
two sentences contain incorrect titles for the wizard displayed in Figure 21.1.

Change both instances of "Network and Dial-up Connection wizard" to "Network
Connection wizard".


Page 513: Last Known Good Configuration Saved At Last Logon
-----------------------------------------------------------

On page 513, in the bulleted item "Last Known Good Configuration",

Change:
"This advanced boot option starts Windows 2000 using the registry information
that Windows 2000 saved at the last shutdown"

To:
"This advanced boot option starts Windows 2000 using the registry information
that Windows 2000 saved at the last logon"


Page 513: The Location Of The ntbtlog.txt File Is Unclear.
----------------------------------------------------------

On page 513, the first bulleted item indicates that the ntbtlog.txt file is
located in the windir folder. Then in the note at the bottom of the page it says
that this file is in the system root folder.

Both references should be changed to indicate that the ntbtlog.txt file can be
found in the WINNT folder.


Page 517: Incorrect ARC Path In Figure 22.3
-------------------------------------------

On page 517, in Figure 22.3, the left adapter is designated with an ARC path of

+------------------------------------------------------+
| Memory    | 64 MB                                    | 
+------------------------------------------------------+


Page 557:  Incorrect Information About Available Directory Service Client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 557, in the first paragraph,

Change:
"No Directory Service Client is available for computers running Windows NT 3.51
or Windows NT 4."

To:
"No Directory Service Client is available for computers running Windows NT
3.51."


Page 558: Slipstreaming Switch For Update.exe Is Incorrect
