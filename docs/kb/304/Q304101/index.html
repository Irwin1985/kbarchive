IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

This article applies to both Microsoft-supplied backup programs and to
third-party backup programs that use the NT backup application programming
interface (API).

When you run a backup program, the backup may not complete successfully. This may
occur even if you run the program locally on the server. You may also receive
the following error messages in the application log:

  ERROR 1450: Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested
  service.

  ERROR 1450: / hex 0x5aa ERROR_NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES

  Operating system error 1450 Insufficient system resources exist to complete
  the requested service.

  Write on "device" failed, status = 1450

  ERROR 1130: Not enough server storage is available to process this command.

  ERROR 1130 / hex 0x46a ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_SERVER_MEMORY

  Backup or restore operation terminating abnormally.

Although it is unlikely, you may also receive the Event ID: 2020 and Event ID:
2021 error messages from the server service.

You may receive these error messages for reasons that are not related to the
issue that this article addresses; however, if you receive these error messages
only when you back up large system volumes, the two most probable causes are
those that this article describes.

One method that can be used to identify the problem is to start Task Manager and
then click the Performance tab. At the bottom, locate the Kernel Memory section
and watch the value for Paged Pool Memory. You may experience the problem when
that value reaches approximately 160 MB (or larger on Windows 2000.) You will
not experience this issue until a much higher value of paged pool is used if the
key for paged pool has been set to a higher value (the issue may occur when the
paged pool reaches about 80 percent of the set value.) If you have gflags turned
on for pool tags and you use Poolmon, you will see higher usage of the MmSt tag,
which is the pool tag that is used to map the operating system memory that is
used to track shared files.

CAUSE
=====

The two causes of this condition are related. The most common cause is listed
first:

- More files are open than the memory cache manager can handle. As a result,
  the cache manager has used up the available paged pool memory.

- The backup program has tried to back up a file whose size is larger than the
  backup API can access on that version of the operating system. This has the
  same result (that is, the paged pool is used up).

Note that the resolution for each issue differs depending on whether you see the
condition on Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Windows 2000
------------

NOTE: You must be using Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later. For additional information
about why you must use Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q259837 You May Not Be Able to Copy Large Files on Computers That Are Running
  Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000

Resolve the First Issue:

You may have to change two registry settings. You must always change the first
setting, and you also may have to change the second setting based on your
configuration.

Registry Setting 1

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and then click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
  Manager\Memory_Management

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: PoolUsageMaximum
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Decimal
  Value data: 30

IMPORTANT: Use 30 as your initial value. If your backup does not succeed, use 10
as your value. If that does not work, you must change the behavior of your
backup program to reduce the demand of paged pool. If the value works, you may
want to increase the value by approximately 20 percent until the backup does not
work. If the backup is unsuccessful, use the second registry setting that is
described in this article.

IMPORTANT: If you are running /3GB and or /PAE, use 10 as your initial setting.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart your computer.

Because you must test these settings during the most stressful backups, you may
have to wait a month for a whole backup cycle to complete if you are not sure
which backup consumes the most resources. Because of this, Microsoft recommends
that you test low values first.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q312362 Server Is Unable to Allocate Memory from the System Paged Pool

Registry Setting 2

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and then click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
  Manager\Memory_Management

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: PagedPoolSize
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Hex
  Value data: 0xFFFFFFFF

IMPORTANT: Setting PagedPoolSize to 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) allocates the maximum paged
pool instead of other resources to the computer. This is typically required on a
domain controller or a terminal server. By default, most Windows 2000 systems
seem to be limited to a paged pool maximum size of 160 MB. You can verify this
by downloading the kernel debuggers from the public Web site and opening a
kernel dump in the debugger that you want to use. Note that the command to use
is !vm, which shows a paged pool maximum of 163840 KB, for example. Adding this
values reduces the Page Table Entries (PTEs) that are available on a system and
extends the paged pool maximum to 343 MB.

For additional information about why this value is necessary, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q126402 PagedPoolSize and NonPagedPoolSize Values in Windows NT

IMPORTANT: This value restricts the system PTEs that are available. PTEs are
another unrelated system resource that your system uses. This setting may cause
your system to display a blue screen with a stop 0x3F error when it starts. You
can recover from this by using the last know good boot option on the system boot
menu or recovery console. Use Performance Monitor to view the Free system page
table entries counter. You can add the PagePoolSize setting if the observed free
values are over 40,000.

IMPORTANT: If you are running /3GB and /PAE together, do not set this setting
without extensive testing and before you establish exactly how many system PTES
you must have in your environment. You will probably see values in the range of
10,000-20,000 free. Use the articles to configure paged pool memory but never
drop below 10,000 free system PTEs.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart your computer.

  Windows 2000

  Q247904 How to Configure the Paged Address Pool and System Page Table Entry
  Memory Areas

Resolve the Second Issue:

To resolve the second issue, make sure that SP2 or later is installed. If SP2 or
later is installed and you still experience this issue, look for hotfixes on
your system. If you have any post-SP2 hotfixes that have installed a new kernel,
uninstall the fixes and then re-test your system. If this resolves your issue,
run SP2 until a newer SP becomes available. For additional information about why
SP2 is required, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q259837 You May Not Be Able to Copy Large Files on Computers That Are Running
  Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

NOTE: You must be using Service Pack 6a.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q171458 Windows NT May Fail On Request to Open Large Files

Resolve the First Issue:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and then click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
  Manager\Memory_Management

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: UnusedFileCache
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Decimal
  Value data: 15

NOTE: This number represents the percent of pool that can be consumed by unused
segments. A value of 0 indicates that the system will use the default behavior
that is similar to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. A value of 5 through 40
indicates that the system will trim the unused file cache based on pool usage. 5
is most aggressive (that is, it increases the size of the cache the least) and
40 is least aggressive (that is, it lets the cache grow the largest before it
trims the cache.)

IMPORTANT: Use 15 as your initial value. If your backup does not succeed, use 5
as your value. If this does not work, you must either change the behavior of
your backup program to reduce the demand of paged pool, or you must upgrade to
Windows 2000, where more than double the amount of paged pool is available (for
more information, see the "Windows 2000" section). If this value works, you may
want to increase it by approximately 20 percent until the backup is
unsuccessful. If the backup is unsuccessful, use the second registry setting
that is described in this article.

IMPORTANT: If you are running /3GB and or /4GT, use 5 as your initial setting.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart your computer.

Because you must test these settings during the most stressful backups, you may
have to wait a month for a whole backup cycle to complete if you are not sure
which backup consumes the most resources. Because of this, Microsoft recommends
that you test low values first.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q192409 Open Files Can Cause Kernel to Report INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES

Resolve the Second Issue:

One possible resolution is to restrict the backup so that it backs up one file at
a time. This may or may not work depending on the sizes of the files to be
backed up. (It is expected to work on files that are smaller than 180 GB.) You
can also try this resolution if you are backing up a few large files, but each
file is smaller than 180 GB. Note that you must follow the steps to resolve the
first problem also. For files larger than 180 GB, no workaround exists and you
must upgrade the system to Windows 2000. If you try to back up the system
remotely as a workaround, you will experience the same problem.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and then click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
  Manager\Memory_Management

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: DisablePagedPoolHint
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Decimal
  Value data: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in all versions of Microsoft
Windows NT server and Microsoft Windows 2000 server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NTBackupread and NTBackupwrite both use buffered I/O. This means that Windows NT
caches the I/O that is performed against the stream. It is also the only API
that will back up the meta data of a file. This cache is pulled from limited
resources: namely, pool and nonpaged pool. Because of this, extremely large
numbers of files or files that are very large in size may cause the pool
resources to run low.

Several factors may use up the supply of paged pool memory. You can turn on pool
tagging and take poolsnaps at different time intervals to help you to understand
which driver is consuming paged pool memory. If the poolsnaps indicate that the
MmSt tag (Mm section object prototype PTEs) is the largest consumer and is over
80 MB, a very large number of files are probably open on the server.

The possible maximum paged pool memory on a computer is 343 MB of paged pool in
Windows 2000 with the paged pool key set to FFFFFFFF, or 164 MB if the key is
not present. The possible maximum paged pool memory is 192 MB in Windows NT. By
default, the Memory Manager tries to trim allocated paged pool memory when the
system reaches 80 percent of the total paged pool. For example, 80 percent of
343 MB number is 274 MB. If the Memory Manager cannot trim fast enough to keep
up with the demand, the event that is listed in the "Symptoms" section of this
article may occur. If you tune the Memory Manager to start the trimming process
earlier (for example, when it reaches 40 percent), the computer can keep up with
the paged pool demand during sudden peak usage so that it does not run out of
paged pool memory.
