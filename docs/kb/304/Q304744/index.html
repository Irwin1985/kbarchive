-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

LU3 print jobs may print at 6 lines per inch (LPI) even though the print session
is configured to print a specified number of lines per page that should result
in a different LPI value (such as 8 LPI).

Additionally, LU1 and LU3 print jobs that are configured to use a fixed font size
may have page breaks (Form Feeds) at incorrect intervals. For example, a print
job that should contain 66 lines per page may actually print with only 42 lines
per page.

CAUSE
=====

The following problems have been identified with the host print service that is
included with Host Integration Server 2000:

- The Lines Per Page, also known as Maximum Page Length (MPL), parameter is
  ignored for LU3 print sessions.

- The host print service incorrectly issues page breaks if a fixed font size is
  specified in LU1 and LU3 print sessions.

- The host print service incorrectly ignores the specified LPI or Lines Per
  Page configuration when the Do Not Scale Horizontally option is selected.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+-----------------------------------+
| Date        | Time  | File name   | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Jul-31-2001 | 07:52 | Ppd3270.dll | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Jul-31-2001 | 07:52 | Winvprt.dll | 
+-----------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The host print service that is included with Host Integration Server 2000
includes a number of configuration options that affect the formatting of host
print jobs. The following are two clarifications with regards to the available
horizontal and vertical scaling options:

- The Do Not Scale Vertically option overrides the Lines Per Page setting. If a
  specific Lines Per Page value is specified in the print session
  configuration, it implies the use of vertical scaling so that the host print
  service can fit the specified number of lines on a printed page.

- Selecting a fixed-size font in the print session configuration overrides all
  other horizontal and vertical scaling settings. Therefore, the host print
  service does not perform any horizontal or vertical scaling for print jobs
  printed through that print session.

  Configuring a specific font point size for a font determines the exact size
  and spacing of the font. It is the opposite of both the LPI and Lines Per
  Page configuration options. Using an explicit LPI setting indicates that the
  font size doesn't matter as long as the print job has the specified number of
  lines per inch. Using an explicit Lines Per Page setting indicates that the
  font size doesn't matter as long as the print job has the specified number of
  lines on the page.
