SYMPTOMS
========

You may want to move your existing Qwest.net Web site to your MSN Communities
Web site.

There are two approaches for creating your MSN Communities Web site from your
Qwest.net site:

- Transfer your existing Web pages to the MSN Communities file cabinet and then
  view the pages from the file cabinet.

- Create your Web pages using the MSN Communities Web page editor.

Consider the following before deciding which approach to take:

File Cabinet
------------

- Your Web pages must be updated on your computer and then uploaded to your MSN
  Communities site.

- Your Web site does not have Microsoft advertising or framing. Your existing
  navigation and frames are supported.

- Your Web site generally does not need to be redesigned or restructured. In
  most cases, file and directory locations names are retained.

MSN Communities Web Page Editor
-------------------------------

- Pages can be updated using the MSN Communities HTML editor

- Your Web frames are not supported. Your Web site is embedded in the MS
  Communities site.

- Requires more HTML knowledge for complex Web pages.

Other Considerations
--------------------

- The maximum size per file is 1,059,062 bytes.

- The maximum number of files per File Cabinet is 500.

- The maximum number of nested folders in a File Cabinet is 9.

- The maximum amount of content in your MSN Community account is 30 MB.

- You can not use FTP, Netscape Composer, or Microsoft FrontPage to publish
  your Web site.

- FrontPage components on pages authored with FrontPage will not work.

Additional Resources
--------------------

Please see the MSN Communities help screens at http://communities.msn.com for
additional information.

To get help with the MSN Communities File Cabinet

1. Sign in to your MSN Communities Web site.

2. Click File Cabinet, click Add Files, and then click the Help button.

RESOLUTION
==========

To move your Web site to the MSN Communities File Cabinet
---------------------------------------------------------

First, you must move your Qwest.net Web site to your computer. If you do not
already have your Qwest.net Web site saved on your computer, you can use FTP or
FrontPage to transfer it to your computer.

Moving your Web site files to the MSN Communities file cabinet is an iterative
process. You create a folder in the MSN Communities File Cabinet and then copy
the files to the folder from your computer. If your Web was authored with
FrontPage, you do not need to copy any of the FrontPage control folders or their
contents to the File Cabinet. The FrontPage control folders are as follows:

- _private

- _vti_bin

- _vti_cnt

- _vti_pvt

- _vti_txt

Also, if your Web site was authored with FrontPage or you added security using
.htaccess files, you do not need to copy the .htaccess files. They are not used
by MSN Communities Web pages.

1. Sign on to your MS Communities Web site at
  http://communities.msn.com/YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME where YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME is
  the name of your MSN Community.

2. Click File Cabinet, and then click the Add File link.

3. Click My Computer and then locate your saved Web site.

4. Select the top-level directory of your site.
  The files in this directory will then be displayed.

5. Select all the files you want copied, and then click the Upload Now button.

6. Either wait for the upload to complete or click the link to return to your
  File Cabinet.
  If your Web has any directories in it, you must create a folder for each
  directory, from the File Cabinet screen. Select Create Folder and then enter
  the same folder name as your directory. If you want to restrict access to the
  new folder, set the folder's permission, and then click Create Folder. The
  folder will be created and the File Cabinet screen will be displayed again.
  Create additional folders to match each directory in the corresponding
  Qwest.net Web site on your computer.

7. In the File Cabinet, click a Folder name, and then follow steps 2 and 3 above
  to copy the files that are in the corresponding saved Qwest.net Web site
  folder.

8. Repeat this step to upload files to each of the folders.

9. Continue to upload your Web by creating Folders and uploading the files from
  your computer for the folders.

--------------------------------------------------

First, you must move your Qwest.net Web site to your computer using the
instructions above. Next, you must create your Web site in the MSN Communities
Web pages. Then you will upload .html or .htm Web pages, upload non-html files,

  select Copy from the text editor menu.

  HTML tags.

7. Place the cursor between the two tags in the edit window, and then click.

8. Press CTRL+V to paste the copied text into the edit window.

9. Clear the use HTML to create your page box.
  Your page will display in the edit window. Pictures and links not yet copied
  to the MSN Communities Web site may not display at this time.

10. Click Save to save the page on the MS Communities Web site.

11. Continue to build your MS Communities Web site by repeating these steps for
  each Web page.

12. Upload any Web pages to the MS Communities File Cabinet that are not HTML
  (such as images).

To reconstruct Web Page links

  displayed next to the Page link.

2. Reconstruct links on your MS Communities Web pages to your other Communities
  pages.

3. In the page editor, click the Insert Link icon on the toolbar.

  the File Cabinet.

6. In the page editor, select the Use HTML to create your page box to switch to
  "HTML edit mode".

7. Find the link you want to reconstruct and make the link read :
  http://communities.msn.com/YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME/files/UPLOADED_PAGE where
  YOUR_COMMUNITY_NAME is the name of your MS Community and UPLOADED_PAGE is the
  name of the page you uploaded to the File Cabinet.

To modify the Navigation Menu

1. Modify the page Navigation links by going to the Manage Your Pages screen.

2. Follow the instructions to display or hide the links to your Web pages in the
  Navigation Menu.
