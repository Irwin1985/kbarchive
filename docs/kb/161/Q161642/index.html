-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some computers are equipped with power management features that place the
computer in a suspended power state after a certain period of inactivity. If the
Auto Insert Notification option is enabled for IDE CD-ROM drives on such a
computer, the computer may not be suspended automatically.

CAUSE
=====

Some IDE CD-ROM drives support a polling method that the power-management
components detect as drive activity. It seems that the drive is still in use,
preventing the computer from being suspended.

==========
