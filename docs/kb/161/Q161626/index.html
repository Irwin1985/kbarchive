The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The client cannot connect to a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server using
IPX/SPX. Remote procedure call (RPC) PINGs work, but not with security. In
addition, you may receive the following error message:

  Your Microsoft Exchange Server is unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

The IPX/SPX protocol is not configured correctly for Microsoft Exchange Server
access.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following is a checklist you can use to ensure that the IPX/SPX protocol is
correctly configured:

1. Make sure IPX/SPX (NWLINK) is installed on the computer running Microsoft
  Exchange Server, the computer running the Microsoft Exchange client, and any
  primary (PDC) or backup (BDC) domain controllers.

2. Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) must be installed and running on the
  computer running Windows NT Server and Microsoft Exchange Server. This is
  required so that the server broadcasts SAP 0x640. The RPC Service and the RPC
  Locator services must be running. Additionally, there must be either a
  NetWare or a Windows NT Server computer running File and Print Services for
  NetWare (FPNW) and installed on the network to maintain the Exchange Server
  computer's address in its SAP database.

  If this is a routed IPX environment, make sure SAP 0x640 is not being filtered
  on the router.

3. Check IPX/SPX frame types. It is recommended that you manually set this on
  both the computer running Exchange Server and its clients. (On the computer
  running Windows NT Server, go to the Network Control Panel and click IPX/SPX.
  Click Properties, click to select "Manual Frame Type Detection", and add the
  appropriate frame type, such as 802.2.)

4. If "Manual Frame Type Detection" is selected, make sure the network number is
  the same for every server on the IPX subnet. If an Internal network number is
  configured, it must be a unique network number.

5. Make sure the packet size is the same on Token ring, or a smaller size on
  Ethernet. In the Net.cfg file on computers running Windows for Workgroups or
  Windows 3.1, make sure MaxFrameSize equals an appropriate size, such as
  1,496. The frame of client computers running Windows 95 or Windows NT
  Workstation should be adjusted to the maximum frame size for their network
  topology.

6. On computers running Windows for Workgroups or Windows 3.1, open the Net.cfg
  (or Shell.cfg) file and make sure IPX packets=50, IPX Sockets=50, and READ
  ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF.

If you have verified that IPX is configured correctly, you can use the following
steps for additional troubleshooting:

1. Run Rpings.exe on the server. Make sure there are valid endpoints (set for
  use) for ncadg_ipx and ncacn_spx.

2. Run Rpingc32.exe on client computers running Windows 95 or Windows NT
  Workstation, to make sure IPX/SPX can complete an RPC PING to the server.
  Also try this "with security."

3. On the client, try logging in without using default network security. (On the
  Tools menu, click Services. Select Microsoft Exchange Server, click
  Properties, and then click Advanced. Click to clear the "Use network security
  during logon" check box.) This forces a prompt to appear for you to enter
  Windows NT Server domain, account, and password information.

4. Move ncacn_spx to be first in the binding order.

  For additional information about changing the RPC binding order, please see
  the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q163576 XGEN: Changing the RPC Binding Order

5. Update the IPX/SPX drivers. The latest version of the drivers, as of 6/98, is
  VLM 1.21 and can be obtained from Novell.


  NOTE: Many old VLM NetWare drivers do not connect to Microsoft Exchange
  Server. On computers running Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or Windows 3.1, you
  may need updated versions of Nwipxspx.dll and Nwcalls.dll.

6. If there is a Microsoft Proxy Server installed on the network, try turning
  off DNS. (In the Network Control Panel, select TCP/IP and click Properties.
  Click the DNS Configuration tab, and click Disable DNS.) You can keep the
  TCP/IP functionality by adding to the hosts file. In the hosts file, make one
  entry for the Microsoft Exchange Server as &lt;IP address&gt; &lt;Microsoft
  Exchange Server Name, or NetBIOS name&gt;, and one for the Proxy Server as
  &lt;IP Address&gt; &lt;proxy server fully qualified domain name, such as
  server.company.com&gt;.

7. Check the Event Viewer on the computers running Windows NT Server (the
  computers running Microsoft Exchange Server, the PDC, or the BDC servers) for
  errors.
