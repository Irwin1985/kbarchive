-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When double-clicking on an attachment with a file extension of DCX (Fax
document), the following error message may occur:

  Program Not Found
  Windows cannot find Faxview.exe.
  This program is needed for opening files of type 'DCX Image Document'."

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the Microsoft Exchange client is not installing Faxview.exe
on computers running Windows NT 4.0, but is associating DCX file types to
Faxview.exe. The Microsoft Exchange client Setup does not install Faxview
because Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0 use the Imaging Accessory
(Wangimg.exe) in place of the Faxviewer Accessory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- Associate files with a DCX extension with the appropriate fax viewing
  utility.

Faxview.exe will be in the &lt;Win95root&gt; directory if you have elected to
install the Microsoft Fax Viewer component of Microsoft Fax during Windows 95
setup. If Faxview.exe is available, faxes can be viewed by re- associating DCX
files with the Faxview.exe program in the &lt;win95root&gt; directory. If
Faxview.exe is not available then the Faxviewer Accessory will need to be
installed from Windows 95 Setup before DCX files can be associated with
Faxview.exe.

Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0 do not have the Faxviewer Accessory available
as an installable accessory. Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0 use the Imaging
Accessory (Wangimg.exe) in place of the Faxviewer Accessory. If Wangimg.exe is
available, faxes can be viewed by associating DCX files with the Wangimg.exe
program while using Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0. Wangimg.exe is located
in the Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\ImageVue\ directory on Windows NT
4.0, and in the &lt;Win95root&gt; directory on Windows 95 OSR2. If Wangimg.exe
is not available, the Imaging Accessory will need to be installed from Windows
95 OSR2 or Windows NT 4.0 Setup before DCX files can be associated with
Wangimg.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the error is displayed, you will have the opportunity select the correct
location of Faxview.exe by clicking Locate in the error message dialog box.

If you are using Windows 95 and have the Windows 95 Accessory Faxviewer installed
you can locate the program Faxview.exe in the &lt;Win95root&gt; directory. If
you are using Windows 95 and do not have the Windows 95 Accessory Faxviewer
installed you will not be able to locate the file Faxview.exe unless it has been
installed as part of another application. Windows NT 4.0 does not use the
Accessory Faxviewer and you will not be able to locate the file Faxview.exe
under Windows NT 4.0 unless it has been installed as part of another
application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
