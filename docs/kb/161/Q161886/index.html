MORE INFORMATION
================

The PropertySheet-like view is a window that has the look of PropertySheet. It
contains a row of tabs; clicking each tab will load the appropriate page (or
dialog template).

NOTE: This article does not make use of either the Property Sheet or the Property
Pages like the SNAPVW sample. Because of this, the frame window that contains
the PropertySheet-like view can be resized as it normally would. However,
controls inside a page (or dialog template) need to be moved manually to fit the
page as they appear in a regular dialog box.

The picture below shows the general layout of the frame window when it is first
running:

   | +-----------------------------------------------+ |
   +---------------------------------------------------+

As the picture shows, a frame window (CFrameWnd-derived class) contains the
following child windows:

- toolbar (CToolBar)
- view (CView-derived class)
- status bar (CStatuBar)

The view window has tab control (CTabCtrl) as its child window, and tab control
has one or more modeless dialog boxes (CDialog-derived class) as its child
windows. In other words, the tab control will occupy the whole client area of
the view window and the modeless dialog boxes (or pages) will occupy the display
rectangle inside the tab control. However, there can be only one page visible at
any given time.

For simplicity, all pages in the sample code are created after the tab control is
successfully created in the view window. (The code for page creation can be
found in the CreatePages() function in tabview.cpp file.) These pages will not
be destroyed until the application shuts down. When the view window receives the
input focus (when the application is first running), the page for the first tab
will be the visible page in the display area of the tab control.

Whenever a tab is selected from the tab control, both TCN_SELCHANGING and
TCN_SELCHANGE notification codes will be sent to the parent window (the
CView-derived class). The first notification code is to notify the parent window
that the currently selected tab is about to change. It is a good place to put
code to hide the currently visible page. On the other hand, displaying the
newly-selected page may be handled in the second notification code.

The following list shows the general steps to have a PropertySheet-like view in
an AppWizard-generated application:

1. Create all pages (or dialog boxes) for the tab control in dialog resource
  editor. Each page has a caption (for the tab text), a child style, and a thin
  border.

2. Create the header and implementation files for all pages (or dialog boxes)
  using ClassWizard.

3. Make the following changes to the header file (.h) of your CView-derived
  class:

   - Include "afxtempl.h" at the beginning of your .h file. It contains all the
     declarations for a template class variable, m_DlgArray in the
     CView-derived class.

   - Add the following two member variables to your CView-derived class:

       // Tab control is a child of tab view window.
       CTabCtrl*   m_TabCtrl;

       // Array of all the property-page dialogs
       CTypedPtrArray&lt;CObArray, CDialog*&gt; m_DlgArray;
    

   - Add a CreatePages() function prototype to your CView-derived class:

       // Call this function to create all pages for the tab view window.
       void CreatePages();
     

   - Add a HandleKeyDownMsg() function prototype to your CView-derived class.
     This function will be called in the PreTranslateMessage() function of your
     CWinApp-derived class:

       // Call this function to handle all WM_KEYDOWN messages. It
       // returns TRUE if message is being handled; FALSE otherwise.
       BOOL HandleKeyDownMsg(MSG* pMsg);
     

   - Use ClassWizard to add handlers for the following messages that are sent
     to your CView-derived class:

     WM_CREATE - to create tab control and all pages for the tab control.
     WM_SIZE - size the tab control to cover up your entire view.
     WM_SETFOCUS - show page for the first tab in the tab control.

   - Add the following function prototypes to your CView-derived class for
     handling all notification codes sent by the tab control:

       afx_msg void OnTabSelChanging(NMHDR* pnmhdr, LRESULT* pResult);
       afx_msg void OnTabSelChange(NMHDR* pnmhdr, LRESULT* pResult);
     

4. Make the following changes to the implementation file (.cpp) of your
  CView-derived class:

   - Define the identifier (id) for the tab control, such as:

       #define ID_TABCTRL  1111            // id for the CTabCtrl
     

   - Add the following ON_NOTIFY macro to the message map table:

       BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CTabView, CView)
         //{{AFX_MSG_MAP(CTabView)
         ON_WM_CREATE()
         ON_WM_SIZE()
         ON_WM_SETFOCUS()
         ...                              // other message macros
         //}}AFX_MSG_MAP
         ON_NOTIFY(TCN_SELCHANGE, ID_TABCTRL, OnTabSelChange)
         ON_NOTIFY(TCN_SELCHANGING, ID_TABCTRL, OnTabSelChanging)
         ...                              // other message macros
       END_MESSAGE_MAP()
     

   - Initialize member variable m_TabCtrl to NULL in the constructor function.

   - Perform clean-up in the destructor function of your CView-derived class.
     Refer to the destructor function sample in tabview.cpp file.

   - Create tab control and then call the CreatePages() function in the
     OnCreate() function. The tab control is a child window of your view
     window. Refer to the sample OnCreate() function in tabview.cpp file.

   - Call MoveWindow() to size the tab control in OnSize() function so the tab
     control will cover up the entire client area of your view window. Refer to
     the sample OnSize() function in tabview.cpp file.

   - Call OnTabSelChange() in OnSetFocus() function to show page for the first
     tab in tab control. Refer to the sample OnSetFocus() function in
     tabview.cpp file.

   - Implement OnTabSelChange(), and OnTabSelChanging() functions: (Sample code
     can be found in the tabview.cpp file.)

     OnTabSelChange - hide the current visible page.
     OnTabSelChanging - show the newly selected page.

   - Implement HandleKeyDownMsg() function to process CTL+TAB and
     SHIFT+CTRL+TAB, ENTER and ESCAPE keydown messages. These keystroke
     combinations are used to activate a tab that is either before or after the
     currently selected tab. Refer to the sample HandleKeyDownMsg() function in
     tabview.cpp file.

   - Include header files for all pages (CDialog-derived class) for the tab
     control.

   - Implement the CreatePages() function to create all pages for the tab
     control(CTabCtrl). Refer to the sample CreatePages() function in
     tabview.cpp file.

5. Use ClassWizard to add the PreTranslateMessage() function to your
  CWinApp-derived class. In the body of this function, call the view's
  HandleKeyDownMsg() function so it gets a chance to handle any keystroke
  messages that are relevant to its tab control. For messages that are not
  handled by the view, pass them to the default handler. Please refer to the
  sample PreTranslateMessage() in psview.cpp file.

The Readme.txt file included with the sample explains in more detail how the
sample is created in AppWizard and what files are included.
