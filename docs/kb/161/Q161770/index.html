-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you stop the SnaBase service, you may encounter the following SnaBase
critical internal error:

  Event: 560
  Description: Read from mailslot failed, rc = 6 (invalid handle)

The SnaBase service treats the Event 560 error as a critical internal error,
causing the SnaBase to create an SNA Server dump file (Snadump.log). However,
once the SnaBase fails in this way, any TCP/IP sockets it had opened are not
closed. Any attempt to restart the SnaBase service then leads to the following
errors:

  Event: 567
  Description: Creation of a named pipe failed, rc = 10048

  -or-

  Event: 553
  Description: Could not create mailslot, rc = 10048

These errors are logged if SnaBase encounters problems creating the TCP/IP
sockets used to communicate to other servers. The 10048 socket error indicates
"Address in use." These errors are also treated as critical internal errors by
SnaBase, causing the creation of an SNA Server dump file (Snadump.log, in the
&lt;Snaroot&gt;\Traces directory) to be created for these events as well. The
only way to recover SNA Server at this point is to shut down and restart the
computer running Windows NT Server.

CAUSE
=====

Event 560 is treated as a critical internal error, causing SNA Server to
generate the Snadump.log file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With this fix, event
560 is treated as a lower severity error, so no SNA Server dump is generated. If
this error occurs when stopping SnaBase, an SNA Server dump file is no longer
created, so any TCP/IP resources are then closed.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
and 2.11.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
