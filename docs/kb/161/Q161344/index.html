I. Development Environment Compatibility
----------------------------------------

Many people are still developing or supporting applications using Microsoft
Visual Basic 4.0 while switching over to Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0. There are
some known issues with maintaining both versions of Visual Basic on the same
machine. This section of the article discusses these known issues and provides
options for working around them.

1. Control Framework

  In order to improve performance in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 the Visual Basic
  development team decided to create a new framework for developing ActiveX
  controls. In Visual Basic 4.0 all controls were developed with the Microsoft
  Foundation Classes (MFC) Control Development Kit (CDK.) This new control
  framework was designed to be lighter and faster to give VB customers improved
  performance. The framework developed by the VB team was a precursor to the
  ActiveX Template Library (ATL) framework for creating controls.

  Visual Basic 5.0 shipped with new versions of the following controls compiled
  using the new framework. When installing VB5 on the same system as VB4, the
  VB4 versions of these controls are replaced with the VISUAL BASIC 5.0
  versions. Controls that are not listed were not updated.

     comctl32.ocx
     comdlg32.ocx
     crystl32.ocx
     dbgrid32.ocx
     dblist32.ocx
     mci32.ocx
     mscomm32.ocx
     msmapi32.ocx
     msmask32.ocx
     picclp32.ocx
     richtx32.ocx
     sysinfo.ocx
     tabctl32.ocx

  The VB development team made every effort to design and code their control
  framework to be compatibility with controls previously compiled using the MFC
  CDK. They did a fantastic job at maintaining this compatibility given the
  task of completely redesigning the internals of the controls to improve
  performance. However, there were a couple of unanticipated issues with the
  design that can cause problems for VB4 developers if they are not careful.

  a. Binary Persistence

     Controls written in the new framework persist binary data differently than
     MFC CDK controls. This change was made to improve performance. Also, it
     was intended to cause fewer changes to FRX files resulting in fewer
     problems with checking in forms under source code control.

     Although the binary persistence of the controls changed, the new controls
     still include code for reading the old persistence format. This allows VB4
     projects to be upgraded to the new control simply by loading the project
     in VB4 or VISUAL BASIC 5.0 on a system with the new control. However, the
     new controls always write out the persistent data in the new format. This
     means developers that do not have the new control on their systems will
     not be able to load VB4 or VISUAL BASIC 5.0 projects without the new
     control. This isn't an issue for VISUAL BASIC 5.0 because the new controls
     get installed with VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . However, this can cause problems for
     VB4 developers. Here are a couple scenarios where this is a issue:

     Scenario #1:

     Bob installs VISUAL BASIC 5.0 on his system that already has VB4 installed.
     He loads a VB4 project in VB4 to make some bug fixes. He makes some
     changes and saves his work. He decides later that he wants to continue
     work on the project from his laptop on the bus ride home. He has VB4 but
     not VISUAL BASIC 5.0 on the laptop and assumes that he will be able to
     load the VB4 project and continue working on it. So, he copies the project
     files to the laptop and leaves. Bob gets settled on the bus and attempts
     to load the project.

     Scenario #2:

     Joe is working on a shared development project in using VB4 and Visual
     SoruceSafe. In the morning he checks out the form he is working on makes
     some changes and checks them in. His co-worker on the project gets his
     changes to test the project and everything works. At lunch Joe decides to
     load up Microsoft Internet Explorer and surf the web while his co-worker
     goes out to lunch. Joe navigates to a cool page that brings up a
     certificate and a prompt asking him if he would like to download an
     ActiveX control used by the web page. He says OK and continues. This
     download process upgrades some of the controls on his system to the newer
     VISUAL BASIC 5.0 versions. After lunch he checks out the form again, makes
     some additional changes, and checks the form back in. Once again his
     co-worker gets the form out of source code control and attempts to load
     it.

     In both these scenarios the projects will have problems loading the forms
     that were upgraded to the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 versions of the controls
     because only the VB4 versions of the controls are present on the systems
     where they are being loaded. The forms contain persisted data in the
     VISUAL BASIC 5.0 format that is not understood by the VB4 versions of the
     controls. There are several other similar scenarios to those above that
     can cause this problem for VB4 developers.

     This issue will also cause problems for VB4 development projects that
     utilize a single set of source code for both 32-bit and 16-bit
     development. The 16-bit versions of the controls only understand the data
     persisted in the VB4 format. So, if you load a project in VB4-32 on a
     machine with the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 controls and save it VB4-16 will no
     longer be able to load the forms with the new persistence format.

     The best work-around to the binary persistence issue is to make sure VB4
     development machines only have VB4 controls on them. This can be
     accomplished by keeping VB4 and VISUAL BASIC 5.0 installed on different
     machines or different operating systems on a dual boot system. Another
     option is to write batch files or a utility to install and register the
     VB4 controls before doing VB4 development and to install and register the
     VISUAL BASIC 5.0 controls before doing VISUAL BASIC 5.0 development.
     Another possible work-around is to make sure all development machines are
     upgraded to the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 versions of the controls. However, there
     are additional issues with using the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 controls in VB4 that
     will be discussed in the next section of this document.

  b. Setup Dependencies

     Another effect of the new control framework is that the new versions of the
     control have different dependencies. In general they have less
     dependencies because they are no longer dependent on MFC. The VISUAL BASIC
     5.0 Setup Wizard understands .DEP files that ship along with the new
     framework versions of the controls listing all of their file dependencies.
     However, the VB4 Setup Wizard uses SWDEPEND.INI to determine setup
     dependencies. So, the VB4 Setup Wizard will create setup programs that
     work just fine for the VB4 versions of the controls but probably won't
     work with the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 versions of the controls.

     The VISUAL BASIC 5.0 framework controls are all dependent on having the
     following OLE Automation System files installed. They may also be
     dependent upon having additional files installed that vary for each
     control.

        Filename       VB 5.0  Controls Need      VB5 SP2 Controls Need
        ------------   --------------------   ---------------------
        OLEAUT32.DLL   2.20.4054 or greater   2.10.4118 or greater
          COMCAT.DLL   4.71      or greater   4.71      or greater
        OLEPRO32.DLL   5.00.4055 or greater   5.00.4118 or greater
        ASYCFILT.DLL   2.20.4056 or greater   2.20.4118 or greater
         STDOLE2.TLB   2.20.4054 or greater   2.20.4118 or greater
    

     These files are installed by many Microsoft products and service packs so
     it is very possible that they are already on systems.

     Installation of some of these files may require a re-boot. Unfortunately,
     the VB4 Setup Kit does not have the capability to install these files
     correctly by doing a re-boot.

     The result of these dependency issues is that the VB4 Setup Kit can not be
     used to deploy the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 controls unless two things are done:

     1. The SWDEPEND.INI needs to be updated to reflect the dependencies of the
        VISUAL BASIC 5.0 new framework controls installed on the system. This
        information can be obtained from the VB5DEP.INI and the matching .DEP
        file for the control.

     2. The OLE Automation system files listed above need to be properly
        installed. Installing Office 97, VISUAL BASIC 5.0 , and other Microsoft
        products can do this. Running MSVBVM50.EXE as described in the
        following Knowledge Base Article can also do it:

  Q180071 : FILE: Msvbvm50.exe Installs Visual Basic 5.0 Run-Time Files

  c. Data Bound Controls (Fixed in SP2)

     The VISUAL BASIC 5.0 data bound controls built in the new framework have a
     bug that causes them to fail to bind correctly in the VB4 design
     environment. This problem does not break applications compiled with the
     old controls that are running on systems with the new controls. Also, it
     does not affect VISUAL BASIC 5.0 development. The issue is that when you
     bind more than one data-bound VISUAL BASIC 5.0 control to the data control
     in VB4 the data will fail to appear at run-time in some of the bound
     controls. This problem was fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack Two. See
     the following Knowledge Base article for more information:

  Q171801 : FIX: Bound Controls Built in VB5 Do Not Work in VB4 IDE

2. Add-Ins

  For the most part add-ins continue to work. However, there are a couple of
  issues with regards to add-ins and compatibility:

  a. Changes to the Add-In Model

     The VISUAL BASIC 5.0 IDE has changed extensively between VB4 and VISUAL
     BASIC 5.0 . Support for multiple projects was added which greatly
     increased the complexity of the add-in model that is provided. The VB
     development team made every effort to allow add-ins created in VB4 to
     continue to work in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . However, in some cases this was
     just not possible due to the new features of the design environment.

     In some cases VB4 add-ins may cause VISUAL BASIC 5.0 to crash. If this
     happens you should disable the add-in by editing the VBADDIN.INI and
     setting the entry for the add-in to zero. If you have an add-in that is
     having this kind of problem you will want to see if a new version is
     available. In many cases you will want the new version anyway if it takes
     advantage of the powerful new extensibility object model.

     For more information on add-ins causing crashes in the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 IDE
     see the following Knowledge Base article:

  Q167346 TITLE: FIX: GPF Occurs When Starting Visual Basic 5.0

  b. VB4-16 Add-In Failure

     After installing VISUAL BASIC 5.0 VB4-16 add-ins will fail with the
     message:

  '&lt;Name of Add-In&gt;' could not be loaded.
  Remove it from the list of available Add-Ins?

     When VISUAL BASIC 5.0 installs it adds a new key in the registry under
     HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{EF404E00-EDA6-101A-8DAF- 00DD010F7EBB} for the
     new extensibility object model. This type library is correctly marked
     version 5.0. However, 16-bit automation always attempts to grab the type
     library with the greatest version number. Because of this 16-bit add-ins
     attempt to use the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 type information which results in the
     error. There is a work around for this by adding some additional entries
     to the registry that have a higher version number but point at the VB4
     Type Library. See the following Knowledge Base article for more
     information:

  Q169534 : PRB: VB 4.0 16-Bit Add-ins Fail After Installing VB 5.0

3. Control Hosting

  The VB development team worked very hard at speeding up the control hosting
  code in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . In the process they were very careful to maintain
  compatibility with controls that worked in VB4. The VB testing verified this
  with thorough examination of VB4 controls in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . In general
  VISUAL BASIC 5.0 control hosting is very compatible. However, there are a
  couple issues discussed below.

  a. Third-Party Controls

     The VB testing team can not test every third-party control to make sure it
     is compatible from version to version. Instead they rely upon extensive
     beta testing to find these issues. All the biggest control makers
     participate in our beta process and have the ability to report bugs to the
     VB development team before we ship. The VB development team takes these
     bug reports very seriously and fixes any problems that can be identified
     as a bug in VB. They even fix many bugs that are identified as control
     bugs by working around them in the VB control hosting code. If you are
     having problems with a third-party control you should first contact the
     creator to see if it is a bug and if an update has been released.

  b. Forms with many Controls (Fixed in SP2)

     The VISUAL BASIC 5.0 design environment has a problem when loading projects
     containing forms with many controls. It will incorrectly map the names as
     loading the controls which may result in a crash. There is a work-around
     which is to remove the form after loading the project and add it back in.
     This problem was fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack Two. See the
     following Knowledge Base article for more information:

  Q167165 : BUG: Too Many Controls on a Form May Crash Visual Basic IDE

  c. Invisible MFC Controls in Controls (Fixed in SP2)

     There is problem in the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 development environment with MFC
     based controls placed inside container controls such as the Picture Box,
     Frame, and SSTab control having their Visible property set to false. The
     issue is caused by MFC re-parenting the control to the desktop in this
     situation. The VB4 control hosting code was able to handle this behavior.
     However, the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 control hosting code does not handle this
     and it is considered a bug. The result of this problem is that you may
     experience a crash when closing a running form in the VISUAL BASIC 5.0
     development environment. This problem was fixed in Visual Studio 97
     Service Pack Two. For additional details see the following Knowledge base
     article:

  Q171556 : FIX: VB 5.0 IDE Causes Exception Violation During Unload of Form

4. Automation

  There a couple of OLE Automation issues that affect interoperability between
  VB4 and VISUAL BASIC 5.0 .

  a. Early-Binding from VB4-16 to VISUAL BASIC 5.0

     32-bit OLE Automation has defined a new type information format. VISUAL
     BASIC 5.0 uses this to improve performance. However, 16-bit automation can
     not understand the new format. What this means is that you must late-bind
     from a VB4-16 client to a VISUAL BASIC 5.0 32-bit server through
     automation. In VB4 it was possible to early-bind from a VB4-16 client to a
     VB4-32 server through automation.

  b. New VBR Format

     For VISUAL BASIC 5.0 the .VBR format was changed. The VB4 versions Setup
     Wizard, CLIREG16.EXE, and CLIREG32.EXE do not understand this new format.
     This means that the VB4 Setup Wizard can not create setup programs for VB4
     clients that reference VISUAL BASIC 5.0 Remote Automation servers.

5. ActiveX Control Development

  VISUAL BASIC 5.0 created ActiveX controls are intended to be usable in VB4.
  The VB testing team did testing to make sure they worked. For the most part
  they work great. However, there may be limitations, issues, or differences
  with VB4 as a control host that you need to be aware of when developing
  ActiveX controls in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 .

  a. Property Display

     The VB4 Properties window will only display control properties that are
     passed by value. If you are creating controls in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 for use
     with VB4 you should use ByVal on every one of your public property
     procedures. If you do not do this they will not be displayed in VB4 even
     though they display just fine in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . For more information
     on this issue see the following Knowledge Base articles:

  Q169772 : PRB: VB5 .OCX Property Missing from VB4 Properties Window

II. Code Compatibility

VB4 code is very compatible with VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . The majority of the time you
should be able to port VB4 projects to VISUAL BASIC 5.0 with no code changes.
However, there are a few problems and changes that may require you to change
code in some projects. This section describes these issues.

1. Printer Object

  There are couple problems with the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 Printer object that may
  require you to change your code when upgrading a project from VB4 to VISUAL
  BASIC 5.0 .

  a. Printers Collection (Fixed in SP2)

     Setting an item of the Printers collection into the Printer object fails in
     VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . The only way to work around this is to use API calls to
     change the default printer. The following Knowledge Base article explains
     the problem in detail and provides a code to work around the problem.
     However, the work-around is not necessary if you install Visual Studio 97
     Service Pack 2.

  Q167735 : FIX: Setting Printer to Item in the Printers Collection Fails

  b. User Defined Scaling (Fixed in SP2)

     In previous versions of VB you could set up a user defined scale on the
     printer by setting the ScaleMode property to indicate a user defined scale
     mode. In VISUAL BASIC 5.0 this fails to switch the Printer to the user
     defined scale mode. You can work around the problem by using the Scale
     method instead. This problem was fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack
     Two. See the following Knowledge Base article for more information on this
     issue.

  Q166908 : FIX: ScaleMode for Printer Object Can't Create Custom Scale

  c. Fonts (Fixed in SP2)

     VB4 has some problems with loosing font attributes of the Printer object.
     In VISUAL BASIC 5.0 the VB development team attempted to fix this problem.
     In some cases they did just that however there have been reports that have
     not been duplicated of loosing font attributes. There may also be
     scenarios that worked in VB4 that now fail in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . This
     problem has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack Two. Further
     details can be found in the following Knowledge Base article.

  Q168744 : FIX: Printer May Lose Font Attributes

2. Language

  There are a couple issues with the VBA language that may require you to make
  code modifications when upgrading a VB4 project to VISUAL BASIC 5.0.

  a. Passing Class Properties

     In VB4 class properties declared using the public variable method were
     always passed by reference to functions. Class properties declared using
     property procedures in VB4 were always passed by value. In VISUAL BASIC
     5.0 the new "Implements" feature forced the VB development team to always
     use property procedures behind the scenes regardless of what syntax you
     used to declare the property. Because of this all class properties are now
     consistently passed by value. However, this change can force you to change
     code if you relied upon the old behavior. In future versions of Visual
     Basic the VB development team may add code to allow you to choose whether
     to pass properties by value or by reference. The following Knowledge Base
     article has additional details on the issue and explains code changes that
     you might need to make.

  Q166928 : FIX: Public Properties of VB4 Class Are Passed by Reference

  b. Large User Defined Types (Fixed in SP2)

     VISUAL BASIC 5.0 may crash when using large user defined types that worked
     fine in VB4. Usually the user defined types that fail contain large arrays
     as elements. This problem was fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack Two.
     For more information on the problem see the following Knowledge Base
     article.

  Q171557 : FIX: Compiling VB5 Applications with Large UDTs May Crash

3. Controls

  Most of the controls require no code changes. The following lists the known
  issues that would require code changes.

  a. Combo Box Text

     In VISUAL BASIC 5.0 setting the Text property of a Combo Box in the Click
     event will clear out the Text property. In previous versions of Visual
     Basic this did not happen. This change in behavior will require code
     changes to VB4 projects when converting to VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . Additional
     information on the problem including the work-around can be found in the
     following Knowledge Base article:

  Q168824 : BUG: Setting ComboBox Control Text in Click Event Wipes Out Text

4. Forms

  Issues with Forms that may require you to make code changes when upgrading
  from VB4 to VISUAL BASIC 5.0 are listed below.

  a. MDI Child Show

     In previous versions of Visual Basic you could use the Show method to bring
     an MDI child to the front. However, in VISUAL BASIC 5.0 this no longer
     works. The Show method was never documented to have this behavior and the
     ZOrder method still works. For more information about this issue see the

5. Data Access

  VISUAL BASIC 5.0 includes new versions of Data Access Objects (DAO), Remote
  Data Objects (RDO), and the Remote Data Control (RDC.) The new versions are
  contained in new DLLs. So, both the VB4 and VISUAL BASIC 5.0 versions can
  co-exist on the same machine without any conflicts.

  When you move a project from VB4 to VISUAL BASIC 5.0 it is recommended that
  you upgrade to the new versions of DAO, RDO, and RDC. They have many bug
  fixes and new features. However, there are a few problems and changes that
  you should be aware of because they might require some code changes.

  If for some reason you wish to continue using the old versions of DAO, RDO, or
  RDC in your VISUAL BASIC 5.0 application you can. However, the VISUAL BASIC
  5.0 Setup Wizard was not set up to deploy them. You may need to create .DEP
  files or manually add all the necessary files to your setup program.

  a. RDO Move 0 (Fixed in SP1)

     In RDO 1.0 it was possible call the Move method with a parameter of zero to
     refresh the contents of the current record in the ResultSet. This useful
     feature is broken in the RDO 2.0 that shipped with VISUAL BASIC 5.0 .
     However, it has been fixed in the updated version of RDO 2.0 that ships in
     the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack. See the following KB article for more
     information concerning this problem and the fix.

  Q168162 : FIX: RDO Move 0 Fails to Refresh Record

  b. RDOQueries Collection

     Behavior of the RDOQueries collection has changed in RDO 2.0.

  c. RDC Update Error (Fixed in SP1)

     If you add a row to a Resultset using RDC, further navigation through the
     ResultSet may cause an error. This only happens with the version of RDC
     2.0 that shipped with VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . This problem has been fixed in
     the version of RDC 2.0 that ships with the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack.
     Additional information on the problem and the fix can be found in the
     following Knowledge Base article.

  Q168160 : FIX: Error on Update After AddNew with RDC and Bound Controls

  d. RDC Closing Resultset of Bound DBGrid (Fixed in SP1)

     If you bind the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 DBGrid control to the RDC 2.0 control that
     ships with VISUAL BASIC 5.0 you will not be able to close the underlying
     ResultSet. Any attempt to close it will result in an error. This problem
     has been fixed in the versions of RDC 2.0 and DBGrid that ship with the
     Visual Studio 97 Service Pack. You can find out more about this problem in
     the following Knowledge Base article.

  Q168158 : FIX: Can't Close Resultset if DBGrid Bound to RDC

  e. DBGrid Display Problems Bound to RDC (Fixed in SP1)

     The VISUAL BASIC 5.0 DBGrid control has a couple of problems displaying
     data when bound to the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 RDC 2.0 control. First, it has a
     problem displaying small ResultSets. Second, it will not display correctly
     after a MoveLast. Both these problems have been fixed in the versions of
     RDC 2.0 and DBGrid that ship with the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack. More
     information about these issues is available in the following Knowledge
     Base articles.

  Q168153 : FIX: DBGrid Bound to RDC Displays a Single Row After MoveLast

III.  Application/Component Compatibility
-----------------------------------------

VB4 and VISUAL BASIC 5.0 built applications will co-exist without problems the
majority of the time. However, there are some known compatibility issues.
Microsoft is working to resolve these problems and will provide updated
information as it becomes available. The following section describes
compatibility issues that can affect existing built and deployed VB4
applications and components.

1. Listview FindItem Method (Fixed in SP1)

  There is a problem with the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 ListView FindItem method when
  searching on Sub-Items or Tags. In VB4 if no items were present in the
  listview no error was returned. VISUAL BASIC 5.0 broke backward compatibility
  by generating an error in this case. This issue is not expected to affect
  many applications. It has also been fixed in an updated release of
  COMCTL32.OCX available in the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack. See the
  following Knowledge Base article for more information on the problem.

  Q167122 : FIX: FindItem Method of ListView Incorrectly Returns an Error

2. DBCombo Change Event

  There are some cases where the VISUAL BASIC 5.0 DBCombo no longer fires the
  Change Event as it did in VB4. This can break existing VB4 applications or
  cause a loss of functionality. The following Knowledge Base article describes
  the problem and how to work-around it.

  Q166929 : BUG: DBCombo Control Change Event Does Not Fire

3. SSTab Looses Controls (Fixed in SP2)

  There is a problem with setting the SSTab control Tab and TabVisible
  properties in the Form Load event that can cause controls contained on the
  tabs to fail to appear. This problem is fixed in the Visual Studio Service
  Pack Two. For more information on the problem see the following Knowledge
  Base article:

  Q167107 : FIX: Missing Controls on the SSTAB Control Tabs

4. VBA Type Information

  After installing VISUAL BASIC 5.0 or any product that uses VBA 5.0, such as
  Microsoft Office 97, VB4 16-bit automation clients may receive the following
  error:

  "OLE Automation Error. -2147319784 (80028018)"

  This problem does not affect VB4-32 or VISUAL BASIC 5.0 . The error occurs
  when trying to pass VBA objects such as a Collection object and early binding
  to it through type information. It is caused by 16-bit automation always
  grabbing the type information with the highest version number. When version
  5.0 type information for VBA is registered VB4-16 attempts to use it and can
  not understand the format. The following Knowledge Base article describes the
  problem and how to work-around it:

  Q165490 : PRB: VB4 16-Bit OLE Clients Receive Error -2147319784

5. Statusbar Time Panel (Fixed in SP2)

  The VISUAL BASIC 5.0 StatusBar control does not update panels displaying the
  time as frequently as VB4. This won't break any VB4 applications but it can
  cause some questions when the time in an app quits updating every second as
  it did in VB4. This problem has been fixed in the Visual Studio 97 Service
  Pack. For more information on this issue see the following Knowledge Base
  article:

  Q168792 : BUG: Statusbar Time Panel May Not Update Properly

IV.  Shared Files
-----------------

Visual Basic 4.0 and Visual Basic 5.0 share many files such as controls and
dynamic link libraries. The following Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit files
are replaced with updated Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 components when installing
VISUAL BASIC 5.0 :
