SUMMARY
=======

In the Enterprise Edition of Visual Basic for Windows version 5.0, you can use
the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to perform client/server
operations. This article shows you how to create a client/server application
that uses DCOM to retrieve the name of the server.

1. Start the Application Setup Wizard by clicking Start, Programs, Visual Basic
  5.0, Application Setup Wizard. (If the Introduction dialog box appears, click
  Next.)

2. In the Select Project and Options dialog box, click Browse. In the Locate VB
  application's .VBP file dialog box, select
  C:\DCOMDemo\Client\proDCOMDemoClient.VBP.

3. Click Open and set the following options:

  Rebuild the Project:  &lt;Unchecked&gt;
  Options:              Create a Setup Program

  Click Next.

4. In the Missing Dependencies dialog box, click Next. Dependency files are not
  required for this project. In the Confirm Missing Dependencies dialog box,
  click Yes.

5. In the Distribution Method dialog box, select Single Directory and then click
  Next.

6. In the Single Directory dialog box, select the C:\DCOMDemo\Client\Setup
  directory. Click Next.

7. In the ActiveX Components dialog box, deselect proDCOMDemoServer.exe. You do
  not need to distribute it with the client.

8. Click Add Remote. In the Add ActiveX Components dialog box, select
  C:\DCOMDemo\Server\proDCOMDemoServer.VBR. This file was created when you
  compiled the server executable. It was created because you checked the Remote
  Server Files option on the Server's Properties Component tab.

9. Click Open. The Remote Connection Details dialog box appears. Set the
  following options:

  Remote Transport:   Distributed COM (DCOM)
  Network Address:    &lt;The name of the computer the server will be
                      installed on. Do not include backslashes&gt;

  Click OK. Click Next.

10. In the Confirm Dependencies dialog box, make sure that the Stdole2.tlb file
  is listed. (If it is not listed, you will have to add it later. It is
  located in your \Windows\System directory.) Click Next.

11. The File Summary dialog box appears and the Setup Wizard processes your
  files. When it is finished you will see a list of files that will be
  included in your project. If the Stdole2.tlb file is not listed, click Add.
  In the Add Files dialog box, select the file from your system directory.
  Click Next.

12. Save the template if desired, and then click Finish.

13. Connect to the distribution directory from your client and run the Setup.exe
  file that the Setup Wizard generated.

When you run the application from the client, it returns the time of the computer
that the server component is on. When you click Compute Numbers, the result of
the addition and subtraction of the numbers appears in the text boxes. Try
changing the numbers to confirm that everything works, but don't use a very
large number because you told that class that you are passing integers.
