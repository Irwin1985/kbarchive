SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Text property of the Range object to return a text string that
contains a field, you may receive unpredictable results. For example, with field
codes view turned on, the value returned for a text string that contains the
Page field is enclosed in pipe (|) characters, like this:

  | PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT |

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about Microsoft Certified Partners, please visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

For more information about the support options that are available and about how
to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

- Turn off field codes view before you run your macro.

-or-

- Use the following Visual Basic for Applications macro. The following macro
  uses the TextRetrievalMode property to remove the unwanted characters:

  Sub GetFieldTextExample()
     Dim MyRange As Object
     Set MyRange = ActiveDocument.Range(Start:=Selection.Range.Start, _
     End:=Selection.Range.End)
     MyRange.TextRetrievalMode.IncludeFieldCodes = False
     MsgBox MyRange.Text
  End Sub

NOTE: Some field results cannot be returned at all. For instance, the ListNum
field result is displayed as a picture. If you attempt to retrieve the value for
ListNum using any Visual Basic for Applications methods or properties, you
receive either an unwanted character or an empty result. Currently, there is no
workaround for a field type that displays its results as a picture.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
