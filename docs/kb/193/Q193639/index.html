The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Service stops with an event log error 4116, which states The
following:

  Event ID: 4116
  Source:  MSExchangeIMC

  Description: An error was returned from the messaging software the
  Internet Mail Service uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange
  Server. It is possible that the piece of mail being processed at the
  time will be returned to the sender as a failed delivery instead of
  being delivered. The message will be moved to the "BAD" folder, if
  possible, and the error is not a temporary error. Otherwise it will be
  retried when the service is restarted. Use the appropriate utilities
  found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to view and
  manipulate messages that have been moved to the "BAD" folder.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Service is trying to process outbound messages and receiving
an error. The first line in the data portion of the error includes the
following:

  74 00 05 00 0e 00 07 80

The last four numbers indicate the MAPI error that was received and caused the
Event 4116. The error is 8007000e, which means out of memory. The Internet Mail
Service is programmed to stop if it receives such a memory error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 : XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Component: Internet Mail Service

  File Name      Version
  -------------------------
  Msexcimc.exe   5.5.2417.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

A memory error in this instance incorrectly reports the error condition. A
message in the MTS-OUT folder had a property header that contained more than 21
KB of data. This header, plus the sizes of all the other headers, totaled more
than 32 KB. The Exchange memory manager enforces a limit of 32 KB per remote
procedure call (RPC). The RPC failed because the message properties totaled more
than 32 KB. So the Internet Mail Service was not actually out of memory. To
resolve this, the error returned in the condition was changed to a non-critical
one, so that the Internet Mail Service would not shut down. In addition, if the
Internet Mail Service cannot successfully retrieve all message properties at
once, it divides them up and retrieves some in one attempt and the rest in a
second attempt.
