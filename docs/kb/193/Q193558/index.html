-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications that use the IStorage and IStream classes, or other classes derived
from them, to save data in the form of OLE Structured Storage may generate
corrupted data files when the size of the output file exceeds some threshold.

For example, an application that uses the CArchive method of the COleServerDoc
base class may result in the following error being generated or logged:

  0x80030109 (STG_E_DOCFILECORRUPT)

In such cases, the resultant output file may be smaller than expected with the
first part of the file being overwritten with data that should have been near
the end of the file.

CAUSE
=====

The code that implements this functionality uses one of two modes of operation
depending on the amount of memory that is available in a particular memory heap.
A problem in the low-memory mode results in the output file being corrupted.
Generation of a large or very fragmented file may tend to use up more of the
memory in this heap, resulting in corrupted output being generated.

The size threshold at which corruption takes place will depend on various factors
unique to each system but would typically only affect files larger than 80 MB.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
