How to Use a Microsoft Access Query or Table as a Word Data Source
------------------------------------------------------------------

To use a Microsoft Access query or table as a Word data source, follow these
steps:

1. If you want to use the results of a Microsoft Access query or table as your
  data source in a Word mail merge, in the Mail Merge Helper (on the Tools
  menu, click Mail Merge), click Get Data and then click Open Data Source.

  -or-

  If you want to insert the results of a Microsoft Access query or table in a
  Word document, in the Database dialog box (on the Database toolbar, click
  Insert Database), click Get Data.

  NOTE: To access the Database toolbar, on the View menu, point to Toolbars and
  then click Database.

2. In the Open Data Source dialog box, follow these steps:

  a. Change the Files of Type box to "MS Access Databases."

  b. Click to select your Microsoft Access database file.

  c. Click to select the Select Method check box.

  d. Click Open.

3. In the Confirm Data Source dialog box, select "MS Access Databases via DDE
  (*.mdb)," and then click OK.

  NOTE: If "MS Access Databases via DDE (*.mdb)" is not available, you will need
  to remove and then reinstall Microsoft Access 97 for Windows.

4. In the Microsoft Access dialog box, select the Queries tab or the Tables tab.

5. Select the query or table you want to use, and then click OK.

  NOTE: On the Queries tab, the Create Link check box is selected by default.
  This option creates a link to the Microsoft Access database query. Select
  this check box to always retrieve the most up-to-date version of any of the
  listed queries. To ignore changes to the original query instructions, clear
  the Link to queries check box.

6. Word will return the results of your Microsoft Access query or table to your
  Word document.

  If you are using mail merge, Word will prompt you with the following message:

  Word found no merge fields in your main document. Choose the Edit Main
  Document button to insert merge fields into your main document.

  Click Edit Main Document and continue your mail merge as usual.

  -or-

  If you are inserting database information, in the Database dialog box, click
  Insert Data. In the Insert Data dialog box, select either All to insert all
  of the results of the Microsoft Access query into your Word document or
  select From and specify which records you want to insert into your Word
  document.

  NOTE: In the Insert Data dialog box, the "Insert data as field" is not
  selected by default. If selected, this option inserts the data into the table
  as a field. Select this check box if you want to update the data in your Word
  document whenever the data source changes.

How to Use MS Query to Retrieve MS Access Data as a Data Source in Word
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use Microsoft Query to retrieve Microsoft Access data as a data source in
Word, follow these steps:

1. If you want to use the results of a Microsoft Access query or table as your
  data source in a Word mail merge, in the Mail Merge Helper (on the Tools
  menu, click Mail Merge), click Get Data and then click Open Data Source.

  -or-

  If you want to insert the results of a Microsoft Access query or table in a
  Word document, in the Database dialog box (on the Database toolbar, click

  by default. This option will use the Query Wizard to step you through
  building a simple query that returns data to Microsoft Excel or another
  parent program. Clear the "Use the Query Wizard to create/edit queries" check
  box to use Microsoft Query rather than the Query Wizard to build your query.

4. In the Select Database dialog box, select the Microsoft Access database file
  that you want to use and then click OK.

  NOTE: If you select the Read Only check box, you will be able to read the file
  but cannot make changes to it. If you select the Exclusive check box, the
  database file will be locked during the time Word is using the Microsoft
  Access database.

5. In the "Query Wizard - Choose Columns" dialog box, in the "Available tables
  and columns" list, make the selections you want to use for your query and add
  them to the "Columns in your query" list and then click Next.

6. In the "Query Wizard - Filter Data" dialog box, filter the data to specify
  which rows to include in your query. If you do not want to filter the data,
  click Next.

7. In the "Query Wizard - Sort Order" dialog box, specify how you want your data
  sorted. If you do not want to sort the data, click Next.

8. In the "Query Wizard - Finish" dialog box, select what you would like to do.

  Click Save Query to run the query and add this query to the list of available
  queries. Use this list when you choose a query to run from Microsoft Excel or
  Microsoft Query or when you choose a data source. Saves the query's design as
  the file type *.dqy.

  -or-

  Click "Return Data to Microsoft Word," and then click Finish to run the query
  and return the query results to Microsoft Word.

  -or-

  Click "View data or edit query in Microsoft Query," and then click Finish to
  run the query return the query results to Microsoft Query. You can view the
  data and make additional changes to your query in Microsoft Query before
  returning the data to Microsoft Word.
