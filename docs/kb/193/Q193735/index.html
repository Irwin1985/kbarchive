-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you import bulletin board information from Lotus cc:Mail (DB6) to Microsoft
Exchange Server and then view the messages in the resulting public folder, some
of the posted dates on the messages may be incorrect. The posted date may be the
date the migration was performed, instead of the date the message was originally
posted to the bulletin board.

For example, if the message was originally posted on January 1, 2001, and you
perform the migration on July 1, 2002, the posted date on the message appears as
"7/1/02" (without quotation marks) instead of "1/1/01." This problem is not
likely to occur before the year 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========
