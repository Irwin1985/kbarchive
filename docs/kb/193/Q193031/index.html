-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) and later versions of Windows
(including Microsoft Windows 98) have the ability to create partitions of type
FAT32. These partitions store files more efficiently by using smaller cluster
sizes. However, if a FAT32 partition is greater than 2 GB, INVDOS incorrectly
reports the drive as having only 2 GB of space.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is due to a limitation of the int 21 36h call made to get the drive
space information from the operating system. On these large partitions using
smaller cluster sizes, the 16-bit registers will overflow, and an incorrect
number is returned from the operating system.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

This fix has been recently updated. Please use the new versions of the hotfix
files. The NEW English version of the fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date       Time               Size      File name    Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  5/11/99   9:04am            118,960   95Getdsk.exe   x86
  5/11/99   9:05am             80,652     Invdos.exe   x86
  5/11/99   9:06am             58,068    Getdisk.exe   x86

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.

For comparison purposes, the ORIGINAL English version of this fix had the
following file attributes:

  Date       Time                Size      File name   Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  08/12/98   5:18pm             22,884    Getdisk.exe   x86
  08/12/98   5:38pm            117,920   95Getdsk.exe   x86



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the fix, perform the following steps on the site server:

1. Replace the Getdisk.exe, 95Getdsk.exe, and Invdos.exe files in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory with the
  versions obtained from the hotfix.

2. If you had not previously installed the ORIGINAL fix for this issue, you will
  also need to make changes to the System.map file to ensure that the
  95Getdsk.exe file is copied to your clients. Note that this should be done
  after the updated files have been copied to the Systems Management Server
  site server.

  WARNING: This method involves making changes to the System.map file. Editing
  the System.map file incorrectly can damage your site installation, and should
  only be done according to this specific procedure or at the direction of
  Systems Management Server Support.

  To update the System.map file, perform the following steps:

  a. Use a text editor such as Notepad to open the System.map file and search
     for Getdisk.exe.

  b. Do a copy and a paste of the complete Getdisk.exe section. This should
     produce two identical Getdisk.exe sections.

  c. Replace all references to GETDISK with 95GETDSK for the second section of
     Getdisk.exe. Also, change the size to 118960.

  d. Save the file and close the text editor. When you are done, the System.map
     entry should look like the following:

        "GETDISK.EXE", SIZE(1, 16548, 16548),  "GETDISK.EXE",
        "GETDISK.EX_", REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN95:STANDARD" = "SMS",
        "WIN16:STANDARD" = "SMS", "DOS:STANDARD" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO,
        FLAGS = 5

        "95GETDSK.EXE", SIZE(1, 118960, 118960),  "95GETDSK.EXE",
        "95GETDSK.EX_", REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN95:STANDARD" = "SMS",
        "WIN16:STANDARD" = "SMS", "DOS:STANDARD" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO,
        FLAGS = 5


3. The files will be replicated at the next Maintenance Manager work cycle to
  all Systems Management Server logon servers to the SMS\Logon.srv\X86.bin
  directory. When that occurs, you can update the clients.

  To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or
  follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:
