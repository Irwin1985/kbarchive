IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

If a Microsoft Windows NT Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) database becomes
corrupted, it may be necessary to rebuild its contents from the records of other
WINS servers. This rebuilding can be done by starting the WINS service with a
fresh database and bringing records from replication partners.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Normally, a WINS server will not receive records it owns from replication
partners. If records are lost on a local database, it is difficult to replace
these records, even if they exist in other WINS servers that are the local
server's replication partners. This difficulty is because there are generally no
records that exist on other servers that are higher than the local server's
highest version ID. WINS servers use record version IDs to keep track of which
records are new and need to be replicated to other WINS servers. Every record in
a WINS database has an owner associated with it. This owner is generally the
server that the WINS client originally registered with.

When the Microsoft WINS service is started with a blank database, it will
replicate back records from other servers' records that are owned itself. This
is because it starts with a fresh version ID.

On a WINS network with many records, a registry entry will keep the server from
accepting queries or registrations until the database is reconstructed. This
entry is configured by setting the following registry parameter to 1.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wins\Parameters\InitTimePause

  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Range : 0 or 1

This registry entry is also documented in the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q135922 Windows NT Registry Parameters for WINS
