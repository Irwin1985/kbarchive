-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Administrators of Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 can prevent their server
from acting as a relay host for unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE) messages.
Using Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1), the administrator can
configure these options on the Routing tab in the properties of the Internet
Mail Service object.

Microsoft recommends that you upgrade to either Exchange Server 5.5 SP1 or the
latest Exchange Server 5.5 service pack to obtain this functionality. If you are
unable to upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5 SP1 or later, this article describes
the registry keys that you need to add to your Exchange Server computer to gain
this functionality.

NOTE: This functionality is included with Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2
(SP2). This functionality is located in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program, under the Routing Restrictions option, on the Routing tab
under the properties of the Internet Mail Service object. Although this article
describes in detail the method to configure these options, it is best to
configure these options through the Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

When you install the Internet Mail Service, it is configured by default to enable
rerouting for Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access
Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4) clients. This rerouting is found on the Routing
tab of the Internet Mail Service object. The Internet Mail Service accepts and
relays mail to non-local recipients. Message relay occurs when a client or
remote SMTP server connects to the Internet Mail Service and submits messages
for non-local recipients. If the Internet Mail Service does not restrict message
relay, it may be used to relay UCE messages.

If your server configuration prevents the client from relaying mail, SMTP RCPT
(receipt) commands that specify a non-local recipient are refused, and the
following message is displayed:

  550 relaying prohibited.

To configure relay restrictions in the registry, use the values in the following
registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Service\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

The following examples outline the value, the data type, and the function the
value performs. After you make the changes, stop the Internet Mail Service, and
then restart it.

- RelayFlags, REG_DWORD

  Defines which relay control rules are in effect.

- RelayDenyList, REG_MULTI_SZ

  Specifies hosts that cannot relay messages through your server.

- RelayAllowList, REG_MULTI_SZ

  Specifies hosts that can relay messages through your server.

- RelayLocalIPList, REG_MULTI_SZ

  Specifies the local IP addresses of the server that an SMTP client can
  connect to and relay mail. This is useful for multi-homed servers that have
  internal and external interfaces. Enabling IP forwarding disables this
  feature.

NOTE: RelayDenyList, RelayAllowList, and RelayLocalIPList consist of a net
address and optional mask per line. Order is not important in these lists. Each
line consists of two parts, the net address and the mask, separated by a
semicolon. For example:

  Net[;mask]

If the mask is omitted, the default used is 255.255.255.255.

A net address matches a rule if the bitwise-AND of the IP address and the mask
equals the net. That is:

  (IP Address AND mask) = net

For example:

- To add net 192.168.0.0 to a list, add the following line to the list:

  192.168.0.0;255.255.0.0

- To add the host 192.168.1.17 to a list, add one of the following lines to the
  list:

  192.168.1.17;255.255.255.255

  - or -

  192.168.1.17

What follows is the logic that is used to determine if the client can relay mail.
If none of these statements apply, the client is not allowed to relay mail.

- If bit 1 of RelayFlags is set (decimal value 1) and the IP address of the
  client matches a pattern in RelayDenyList, the client is not allowed to relay
  mail.

- If bit 2 of RelayFlags is set (decimal value 2) and the IP address of the
  client matches a pattern in RelayAllowList, the client is allowed to relay
  mail.

- If bit 3 of RelayFlags is set (decimal value 4) and the client is connected
  to a local IP address that matches a pattern in RelayLocalIPList, the client
  is allowed to relay mail.

- If bit 4 of RelayFlags is set (decimal value 8) and the client is
  authenticated, the client is allowed to relay mail.

- If only bit 1 is set, the client is allowed to relay mail.

For example:

- All clients not explicitly denied can relay mail.

Set bit 1 of RelayFlags (set its decimal value to 1), and add a rule to
RelayDenyList for each host or group of hosts that you want to deny. To prevent
all hosts on the subnet 192.168.17.0 from relaying mail, add the following line
to RelayDenyList:

  192.168.17.0;255.255.255.0

- All clients not explicitly allowed are denied.

Set bit 2 of RelayFlags (set its decimal value to 2), and add a rule to
RelayAllowLists for each host or group of hosts that you want to allow. To allow
all hosts on subnet 192.168.1.0 to relay mail, add the following line to
RelayAllowList.

  192.168.1.0;255.255.255.0

- Allow all hosts on a subnet except for a subset.

To allow all hosts on a subnet, set bit 2 of RelayFlags (set its decimal value to
2), and add a rule to RelayAllowList to match the subnet. For the subnet
192.168.1.0, the following rule works:

  192.168.1.0;255.255.255.0

To prevent a subset of the hosts on subnet 192.168.1.0 from relaying mail, also
set bit 1 in RelayFlags in addition to bit 2, (which was set above); the net
result is to set its decimal value to 3. Add the IP address of each host to
RelayDenyList. If the subset of hosts is grouped together, you can add a single
rule to match all of them. For example, if 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.7 are
not allowed to relay, the following rule is adequate. Listing each address
explicitly in RelayDenyList also works.

  192.168.1.0;255.255.255.248

- Allow clients that connect to the selected network interfaces to relay.

  This method is useful if the host has multiple network interfaces, and IP
  forwarding is not enabled. Set bit 3 of RelayFlags (set its decimal value to
  4), and add the IP addresses of the network interfaces that relay mail to
  RelayLocalIPList.

- Allow authenticated clients to relay.

  Set bit 4 of RelayFlags (set its decimal value to 8) to allow clients that
  have authenticated (by using the Auth command) to relay mail.

After you create or modify these registry settings, in Control Panel,
double-click Services, and then stop and restart the Internet Mail Service so
that the changes take effect.

If you set the SMTP Interface Events diagnostics logging category to minimum or a
higher logging level in the Internet Mail Service Diagnostic Logging property
page, when a message is denied for relay through the Internet Mail Service an
event is logged to the application event log. The event indicates the sender's
IP address, sender's host name (if available), the sender's authentication
account (if authentication was used), and the recipient address for the message.
