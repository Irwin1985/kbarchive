The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The services installed by SNA Server version 3.0 and later run under a user
account context. This user account is set to be a domain administrator with
additional permissions. Though Microsoft recommends that the user context not be
changed after initial installation, some instances may arise where the service
user account needs to be changed to a different user. If this user context does
not have the correct permissions, the services may fail to start and cause SNA
Server to fail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In most cases when the SNA Server services fail to start, it is the result of
the services[ASCII 146] user password being changed, the user account being
deleted, or the user being deleted and re-added through the Windows NT User
Manager utility. Also note that if the user account that the SNA Server services
are running under does not have "Password Never Expires" selected under that
user profile, every time the password for this user is changed, each SNA Server
service must be manually changed to reflect the new password. This is not done
dynamically and must be done by the administrator. This can be a source of more
administrative overhead and greater chance of incorrect settings being made to
the SNA Server services.

By default, the SNA Server installer creates a user account with domain
administrator privileges and some additional privileges (or modifies a pre-
existing user account with privileges to this level) for use by the SNA Server
services. If SNA Server is being installed on a Windows NT Server computer that
is not participating in a domain (that is, a workgroup), the account is added to
the local Administrators group. If it is in a Windows NT domain, the installer
adds the account to the domain administrators group. If it is a Windows NT
member server, the account is also added to the local Administrators group.

A minimum of three privileges is required for a new service account to work with
the SNA Server services. These include:

- Logon as a service (se_service_logon_name privilege)

- Act as part of operating system (se_tcb_name privilege)

- Manage auditing and security log (se_audit_name privilege)

The SnaBase service and SNA Server service also require the following privilege
(which the DMOD grants during runtime):

- Generate security audits (se_security_name)

The following privileges can be added but are not required:

- Take ownership of files or other objects

- Backup and restore

Changes to the user account are made through the User Account Manager in Windows
NT. Services can be changed by going to Control Panel and double- clicking
Services.

Most issues involving a problem with the SNA Server services can be resolved by
saving the &lt;snaroot&gt;\System\Config\Com.cfg file, removing SNA Server, and
reinstalling SNA Server. This re-writes the registry and updates the user
manager with an account that has the correct permissions and service
dependencies.
