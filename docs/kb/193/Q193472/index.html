-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are using an application where the main form is a Top-Level form, and you
suppress the display of the Visual FoxPro desktop with the SCREEN = OFF command
in a Config.fpw file. Then, you create a distribution using the Setup Wizard and
install this distribution on a computer using Windows 95. When you exit the
Top-Level form to close the application, you might see an error dialog box, such
as the following:

  Fatal Exception: error code=c0000005

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this issue by installing the Distributed Component Object
Model (DCOM) for Windows 95 or by installing Internet Explorer version 4.0 or
later.

You can install DCOM for Windows 95 from the following Web URL:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.htm

You can install Internet Explorer 4.0 or later from the following Web URL:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/windows.htm

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

The installation of either DCOM for Windows 95 or Internet Explorer 4.0
eliminates the error. The download for DCOM for Windows 95 version 1.2 is 1.2MB
and the installed files are new version replacements for existing files. There
is information about redistribution on the DCOM 95 Internet site referenced in
the RESOLUTION section. Installing Internet Explorer 4.0 gives Internet browser
functionality, but its installation also requires more disk space than DCOM 95.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual FoxPro project named TestProj.

2. Add a program called Main.prg to the project. It should contain the following
  code:

     PUBLIC oform1
        oform1=NEWOBJECT("form1")
        oform1.Show
        READ EVENTS
        RETURN

        DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form
           ShowWindow = 2
           AutoCenter = .T.
           Caption = "Form1"
           Name = "form1"

           ADD OBJECT command1 AS commandbutton WITH ;
              Top = 180, ;
              Left = 144, ;
              Height = 27, ;
              Width = 84, ;
              Caption = "Quit", ;
              Name = "Command1"

           PROCEDURE QueryUnload
              Release thisform
              CLEAR EVENTS
           ENDPROC

           PROCEDURE command1.Click
              Release thisform
              CLEAR EVENTS
           ENDPROC
        ENDDEFINE

3. Create a file called Config.fpw in the directory with your project and add
  the following line:

  SCREEN = OFF

4. Add this file to the project. Click the Other tab in the Project Manager.
  Select the Text Files item in the list, click the Add button, type
  "Config.fpw" (without the quotation marks) in the Select file text box, then
  click OK.

5. Mark the Config.fpw file as included by right-clicking it in the Project
  Manager, and then choose Include from the Context menu.

6. Build the project into an executable, and save it as Testproj.exe.

7. Place the Testproj.exe file into a directory by itself, such as c:\testproj.

8. Run the Setup Wizard.

9. Select the directory containing the executable file created in the "Setup
  Wizard - Step 1," and then click Next.

10. In the Setup Wizard dialog box for step 2, select the run-time check box and
  then click Next.

11. In step 3 of the Setup Wizard dialog box, select a directory and any of the
  disk image check boxes and then click Next.

12. In step 4 of the Setup Wizard dialog box, type "Test App" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Setup dialog box Caption text box, enter None in the
  Copyright information text box, and then click Next.

13. In step 5 of the Setup Wizard dialog box, type "VFP Test Apps" (without the
  quotation marks) in Program group text box, and then click Next.

14. In step 6 of the Setup Wizard dialog box, check the PM item check box, type
  "Test App" (without the quotation marks) in the Description text box, and
  type "%s\testproj.exe" (without the quotation marks) in the Command line
  text box. Click OK, and then click the Finish button twice. Next, click the
  Done button in the Disk Statistics dialog box when it appears.

15. Install the program from the 144Disk\Disk1, Netsetup, or Websetup directory
  that the Setup Wizard creates to a Windows 95 computer. This computer must
  not have Visual Studio, DCOM 95, or Internet Explorer 4.0 installed.

16. Run the .exe file.

17. Click the Quit button or close the form.

  The form disappears and then an error dialog box appears with the following
  text:

  Fatal Exception: error code=c0000005

  This error does not occur if DCOM for Windows 95 or Internet Explorer 4.0 is
  installed on the Windows 95 computer. This error does not occur in Windows
  NT 4.0.
