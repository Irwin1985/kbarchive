-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your Remote Access Service (RAS) clients may experience problems attempting to
connect to your computer running Windows NT Server and running either RAS or
Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). The RAS clients may receive one or
more of the following error messages when they fail to connect:

  Dial-Up Networking could not negotiate a compatible set of network protocols
  you specified in the Server Type settings. Check your network configuration
  in the Control Panel then try the connection again.

-or-

  TCP/IP CP reported error 733: the PPP control protocol for this network
  protocol is not available on the server.

NOTE: This issue has only been reported with RAS or RRAS servers that are
configured to assign IP addresses through Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP).

CAUSE
=====

This issue may be caused by the RAS or RRAS server failing to successfully
obtain a complete set of IP address leases from the DHCP server.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Change the configuration of the RAS or RRAS Server to use a static pool of IP
  addresses for its dial-up clients, using the following steps:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
     the Network icon.

  2. Click the Services tab, click Remote Access Service, and then click
     Properties.

     NOTE: For an RRAS server, click Routing and Remote Access Service instead
     of Remote Access Service.

  3. Click Network in the Remote Access Setup dialog box and click Configure
     for the TCP/IP Protocol in the Server Settings section in the Network
     Configuration dialog box.

  4. Click the Use Static Address Pool radio button and type a beginning and
     ending range of IP addresses to use for your RAS clients.

  5. Click OK twice, click Continue, click Close, and then restart your
     computer when prompted.

-or-

- Obtain a new set of IP Addresses for your RAS pool by performing the
  following steps:

  1. Delete all active leases in DHCP manager for the RAS or RRAS Service by
     performing the following steps:

     a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then
        click DHCP Manager.

     b. Double-click the DHCP Scope.

     c. Select the active leases and click Delete.

  2. Delete the DHCPAddresses key from the registry by performing the following
     steps:

     a. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32.exe" (without the quotation
        marks), and then click OK.

     b. Go to the following subkey:

        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
        \RemoteAccess\Parameters\IP\DHCPAddresses

     c. Click Delete on the Edit menu and click Yes in the Warning dialog box.

     d. Close Registry Editor and restart your computer.

-or-

- Verify that your DHCP Server is operating correctly by trying to Renew the
  address of one of your Local Area Network (LAN) clients.
