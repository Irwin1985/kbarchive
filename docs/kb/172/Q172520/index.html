-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you share a CD-ROM (IDE or SCSI) or floppy disk drive but then try to
access it over the network (either remotely or locally through UNC or NET USE)
the following error message is displayed:

  Access Denied

Additionally, the directory \\&lt;machinename&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt; remotely or
locally will cause the following error message to appear:

  File Not Found

Sharing and accessing a hard drive remotely or locally in the same manner will
work fine.

CAUSE
=====

There are 2 registry entries in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\
WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon subkey:

AllocateCDRoms:REG_SZ
AllocateFloppies:REG_SZ

One or both of these entries has been added and/or set to 1, thus disabling
access to everyone but the locally logged on user.

AllocateCDRoms   REG_SZ     0 | 1
---------------------------------

Default: 0

Determines whether data in the CD-ROM drive is accessible to other users. This
value entry satisfies, in part, the C2 security requirement that you must be
able to secure removable media.

Value Meanings:

0 Compact discs in the CD-ROM drive can be accessed by all administrators in the
domain.

1 Only the user logged on locally can access data on the compact discs in the
CD-ROM drive.

Because the CD-ROM drive is a volume, by default, it is shared as an
administrative share on the network. If the value of this entry is 1, the CD-ROM
drive is allocated to the user as part of the interactive logon process and,
therefore, only the current user can access it. This prevents administrators and
remote users (and even the same user at a different workstation) from accessing
the drive while the current user is logged on to the computer. The drive is
shared again when the current user logs off the computer.

Windows NT does not add this value entry to the registry. You can add it by
editing the registry or by using a program that edits the registry.

AllocateFloppies     REG_SZ     0 | 1
-------------------------------------

Default: 0

Determines whether data in the floppy disk drive is accessible to other users.
This value entry satisfies, in part, the C2 security requirement that you must
be able to secure removable media.

Value Meanings:

0 Floppy disks in the floppy disk drive can be accessed by all administrators in
the domain.

1 Only the user logged on locally can access data on the floppy disks in the
floppy disk drive.

Because the floppy disk drive is a volume, by default it is shared as an
administrative share on the network. If the value of this entry is 1, the floppy
disk drive is allocated to the user as part of the interactive logon process
and, therefore, only the current user can access it. This prevents
administrators and remote users (and even the same user at a different
workstation) from accessing the drive while the current user is logged on. The
drive is shared again when the current user logs off.

Windows NT does not add this value entry to the registry. You can add it by
editing the Registry or by using a program that edits the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and select the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\ 
  CurrentVersion\Winlogon

  AllocateCDRoms:REG_SZ
  AllocateFloppies:REG_SZ

2. Change the value for these entries to 0 or remove the entry.
