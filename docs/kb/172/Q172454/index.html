-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open the Sounds tool in Control Panel, you may receive an error message
similar to the following message:

  An error occurred while windows was working with control panel file
  C:\windows\system\mmsys.cpl

CAUSE
=====

A registry entry for one of the sound schemes may be damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

The following registry key lists the programs that have sounds associated with
events:

  Hkey_Current_User\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps

To identify and repair the damaged program registry key, follow these steps:

1. Click and rename one of the program key folders. For example, click

  Hkey_Current_User\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps\Explorer

  and rename it to:

  Hkey_Current_User\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps\Explorer1

2. Test to see if you can open the Sounds tool in Control Panel without an error
  message.

3. Rename the program key folder to the original name.

4. If you received an error message in step 3, repeat steps 1-3 for the next
  program key folder.

When you can open the Sounds tool in Control Panel without the error message, you
have found the damaged registry entry. Renaming the program key folder to the
original name corrects the damaged registry entry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior seems to occur most frequently with non-default schemes, and is
often associated with a problem during installation of the particular program.
The default schemes listed in the registry are: .Default, Explorer, Mplayer, and
SndRec32.
