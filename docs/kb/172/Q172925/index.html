SUMMARY
=======

This article covers the security issues you need to be aware of when creating or
launching ActiveX objects from either an ISAPI extension or an Active Server
Pages (ASP) page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Whenever an object is created in the context of Internet Information Server
(IIS), the security context it will have depends on the object's threading
model. The security context given to the object will then affect all actions
performed by that object, including such things as accessing files, accessing
databases and creating other objects.

IIS passes on security contexts depending on the authentication scheme that you
are using in IIS. For example, if you are using Anonymous authentication, the
object runs in the security context of a user account called
IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt;, where &lt;machinename&gt; is the name of the machine
on which IIS is running. For additional information on authentication schemes
and security from IIS, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q158229 : Security Ramifications for IIS Applications

The security context given to an in-process object (a .dll file) is dependent on
its threading model as marked in the registry and how the client apartment is
created. When the threading models between the client and the server are mixed,
such has a single-threaded apartment client creating a free-threaded or unmarked
object, the system must provide a proxy for interaction between the object and
the client apartment. This proxy is created in and is given the security context
of the main application. In the case of IIS, the proxy runs in the security
context of the SYSTEM account. For additional information on threading models,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q150777 : Descriptions and Workings of OLE Threading Models

What this means to someone creating their own inproc server that will be called
by IIS, through either Active Server Pages or their own custom ISAPI DLL, is
that if the object is not designed with the same threading model as that used by
the client apartment, the object is run in the security context of the SYSTEM
account. This behavior is a potential security concern, and may also limit the
functionality of the component if it needs to access resources on a remote
machine.

By default ASP creates single-threaded apartment clients, which means that only
single-threaded apartment inproc servers are given the desired security context
passed on by IIS. In ASP it is a good idea to create single-threaded apartment
objects since they will run faster than free- threaded objects or unmarked
objects because they don't go through a proxy to make the calls. Thus for
performance and security reasons, ASP components should have their Threading
Model registry value set to either "Apartment" or "Both" in the registry.

If you are instead creating your own ISAPI DLL that will be instantiating objects
and you want to get the security context passed by IIS, you will need to make
sure that you call CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_MULTITHREADED) for free-threaded
apartment servers and CoInitializeEx(NULL, APARTMENTTHREADED) for
single-threaded apartment servers.

Objects marked as "Both" will get the right security context when instantiated in
either single-thread apartments or free-thread apartments. However, these
objects must be created with the synchronization considerations of any
free-threaded object, which can be considerably more difficult to program and
test.

DCOM
----

Beginning with NT 4.0, the launching and accessing of objects is done through
Distributed COM (DCOM). DCOM allows you to configure the ability of a client
application to launch and access objects on remote machines and the local
machine. This configuration is done through a utility provided with NT called
"DCOMCNFG." You will need to make sure that when a client application running
under a certain account wants to launch or access an object, it has the proper
permissions in DCOM. By default, you will see in DCOMCNFG that certain accounts
already have permission to launch and access objects, such as the INTERACTIVE
account, so that client applications running as the interactive user can use
objects; the SYSTEM account, so the system can use objects; and the
IUSR_&lt;servername&gt; account, passed by IIS. If you are using some
authentication scheme other than anonymous, you need to make sure that the
account that the client is using is listed as having launch and access
permissions.

Recommendations
---------------

Because of the way IIS assigns and reuses threads, you would typically not get
much benefit from creating a free-threaded apartment object as opposed to a
single-threaded apartment object. Although free-threaded objects do not need to
have their interfaces marshalled between threads of a free- threaded client
apartment, this usually means very little under the context of IIS because in
most cases the only interface of interest is IDispatch, and the system has a
built-in marshaller for this interface. Unless you plan on using your own ISAPI
DLL instead of ASP and are creating an object that takes a long time to
initialize, or you want to pass data between instances of the objects, you
should create single-threaded apartment objects.

It is important to note that Visual Basic 4.0 does not create "Apartment" model
objects, but Visual Basic 5.0 does.

Local Servers
-------------

When a local server object (an .exe file) is instantiated, by default it is given
the SYSTEM security context. However, this can be changed with the DCOMCNFG
utility. For additional information on launching OLE local servers from IIS, see
the following article on the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q156223 : How To Launch OLE Servers from ISAPI Extensions

Determining Your Current Security Context
-----------------------------------------

If you are having problems accessing other files, databases, or objects from
within your object, you can always check your security context programmatically
by adding a call to the Win32 API function: GetUserName(). Or to get the full
Domain/UserName call
OpenProcessToken()/GetTokenInformation()/LookupAccoundSID().

Another way to debug security context problems is to turn on auditing with the NT
User Manager. This will allow you to log selected activities in the event viewer
and is an easy way to determine which account tried to access a given file or
resource.

Changing Your Security Context
------------------------------

If for some reason you cannot get the security context that you need, you can
impersonate the desired security context by creating a method in your automation
server that takes as parameters the user name and password of the security
account that you need. Once you have the user name and password you can change
the current security context with the Win32 API functions: LogonUser() and
ImpersonateLoggedOnUser().
