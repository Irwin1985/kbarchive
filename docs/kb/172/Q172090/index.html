Microsoft Access 97 run-time application, you may receive the following error
message

  Run-time error '2501': The RunCommand action was canceled.

followed by:

  Execution of this application has stopped due to a run-time error. The
  application can't continue and will be shut down.

CAUSE

application.

RESOLUTION
==========

For more information about simulating Filter-by-Form in a run-time application,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q166634 ACC97: Filter-by-Form Example for Run-Time Apps Available in Download
  Center

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Access 7.0, Filter-by-Form works in both the full version and the
run-time version. However, the Filter-by-Form functionality wasn't designed to
be available in a Microsoft Access 7.0 run-time application.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

CAUTION: Following these steps will modify the sample database Northwind.mdb. You
may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file and perform these steps on a copy of
the database.

1. Open the sample database Northwind.mdb, and open the Customers form in Design
  view.

2. Add a command button to the form.

3. Change the Name property for the command button to btnFilter.

4. Place the following code in the OnClick event procedure of the command
  button:

        Private Sub btnFilter_Click()
           DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdFilterByForm
        End Sub

5. Close and save the form.

6. On the Tools menu, click Startup.

7. Under Display Form, select Customers from the list, and then click OK.

8. On the Start menu, click Run, and then type the following command.

  NOTE: In the following sample, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is used
  as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the
  line when typing this command.

  NOTE: In the following sample, replace C:\Program Files\Microsoft
  Office\Office\ with the path to where Msaccess.exe is located on your hard
  drive.

     "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Msaccess.exe" _
     "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb" _
     /Runtime

9. When the Customers form opens, click the button that you created in step 2.

  Note that the filter-by-form view does not come up, and you receive the errors
  listed in the "Symptoms" section.
