-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Word after you have run the Microsoft Office
97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) Patch, you may receive the following error message:

  The wrong WWINTL32.DLL has been loaded.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when the versions of the Winword.exe file and the
Wwintl32.dll file are not the same.

NOTE: It is not sufficient to check the file version information that is
displayed when you right-click the program icon and click Properties on the
shortcut menu.

This problem may also occur if a wwintl32.dll file is located in the
Windows\System directory.

WORKAROUND
==========


To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel. Click
  Add/Remove Programs.

2. Select Microsoft Office and click Change (in Microsoft Windows 2000) or click
  Add/Remove (in Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98).

3. When prompted to put in the Office CD, do so, and then click OK.

4. Click Add/Remove. Click to clear Microsoft Word.

  This will remove Microsoft Word only.

5. Click OK on the message that you have selected XXX components to remove.

6. Using Windows Explorer, search for and manually delete any instances of
  WINWORD.EXE.

7. Search for and delete any instances of the Wwintl32.dll file located in a
  folder other than the \Office folder.

8. Disable all terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs), virus checkers, or
  utility programs such as Clean Sweep or First Aid.

9. Reinstall Microsoft Word 97 from the original media.

10. If the system restarts successfully, ensure that all TSRs in are still
  disabled, and reinstall the patch.

If the preceding steps do not work, you may need to completely remove Office. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Select Microsoft Office and click Change (in Microsoft Windows 2000) or click
  Add/Remove (in Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98).

4. When prompted to put in the Office CD, do so and then click OK.

5. Click Remove All.

6. Using Windows Explorer, search for and manually delete any instances of
  WINWORD.EXE.

7. Search for and delete any instances of the Wwintl32.dll file located in a
  folder other than the \Office folder.

8. Disable all terminate-and-stay-resident programs (TSRs), virus checkers, or
  utility programs such as Clean Sweep or First Aid.

9. Reinstall Microsoft Office 97 from the original media.

10. If the system restarts successfully, ensure that all TSRs in are still
  disabled, and reinstall the patch.
