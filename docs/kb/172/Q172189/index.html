SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article explains how to setup a Dial-on-Demand (DOD)
connection between two Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) Servers using a
null serial cable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps assume that you have already installed Routing and Remote
Access Service and that it is operating correctly. Perform the following steps
on both servers:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
  double-click the Modems icon.

2. Click Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list and click Next.

3. Click Dial-Up Networking Serial Cable between 2 PCs, and then click Next.

4. Click the physical com port to which the cable is attached, and then click
  Next.

  NOTE: If this is the first modem that you have installed you will now need to
  enter the area code and any dial out prefix that is required.

5. Restart your server.

6. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
  double-click the Modems icon. Verify the modem properties on both servers and
  make sure the maximum speed matches.

  NOTE: It is best to start at 9600 bps and increase it later to a speed that
  does not give serial overruns. Each time you change the speed, you will need
  to stop and restart Routing and Remote Access Service for the change to take
  effect.

7. Start Routing and Remote Access Service Administrator and add a DOD interface
  on both servers, using the following steps:

  a. Click LAN and Demand Dial Interfaces.

  b. Click Actions, click Add Interface..., and then type the name for your DOD
     connection. For the sake of simplicity, use the same name on both servers.

  c. Click Next.

  d. Click the appropriate routing options to enable them.

     For example, if you are using Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for IP
     then you would enable the option Route IP packets on this interface.

  e. Click the following options to create the user accounts:

     1. Add a user account so a remote router can dial in Authenticate remote
        router when dialing out

  f. Click Next, click Dial-Up Networking Serial Cable between 2 PCs (ComX),
     and then click Next.

     where X is the com port number.

  g. Leave the phone number blank, and then click Next.

  h. Enter the same name that you used in step b for the User Name, Password,
     and Confirm Password.

  i. Click Next and type the same name as steps b and h for the Password and
     Confirm Password.

  j. Click Next, and then click Finish.

8. Click the desired routing protocols, and then accept the default options.

9. Once both DOD Interfaces are created, from one server only in Routing and
  Remote Access Service Administrator, click LAN and Demand Dial Interfaces.
  Right-click on the new DOD interface, and then click Connect.

At this point your two servers should be connected through the null serial cable.
When you use DOD connections with Routing and Remote Access Service the routes
are not automatically updated so you have to manually update any routes by
performing the following steps:

1. In Routing and Remote Access Service from both servers, expand IP Routing
  and/or IPX Routing depending on which routing protocols you have installed.

2. Click Summary, right-click the DOD interface, and then click Update Routes.

3. Click Static Routes, and if the routes were exchanged successfully, you
  should see the routes from the opposite server.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you are experiencing problems connecting or exchanging routes between the two
servers, check for one or more of the following:

- Check the modem properties and verify the Maximum Speed for the Serial Cable
  connections match on both servers.

  -or-

- From both servers, verify the Initial Speed setting by performing the
  following steps:

  1. In the Routing and Remote Access Service Administrator, click LAN and
     Demand Dial Interfaces.

  2. Right-click the new DOD interface, and then click Configure Interface.

  3. Click Configure, and verify that Initial Speed matches the Maximum Speed
     in the modem properties, and that these speeds match the other server.

     NOTE: It is imperative that if you make any changes to the modem
     properties, Routing and Remote Access Service must be stopped and
     restarted.

-or-

- If both servers seem to be connecting successfully but cannot exchange RIP
  routes or clients on either side of the routers cannot communicate but the
  servers can, then check to see if a RAS connection was made instead of DOD
  using the following steps:

  1. In the Routing and Remote Access Service Administrator, click LAN and
     Demand Dial Interfaces.

  2. Verify that the Connection State for the DOD interfaces are displaying
     Connected.

     NOTE: If only the dialing computer shows connected, then, most likely, a
     RAS connection has been made. If this is the case, check to see that the
     User Name being used in the credentials on the dialing server matches the
     name of a DOD interface on the server being dialed.
