SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a Network Address Translator (NAT) separating a Windows NT domain
controller from its domain members or other trusted domains, Netlogon
communication may fail. You will still be able to successfully redirect a drive
across the NAT, and browse across the NAT, but logon attempts and trusts may
fail. For example:

- When a client attempts to log on to the domain across the NAT, it may receive
  an error message similar to the following:

  A domain controller for your domain could not be contacted. You have been
  logged on using cached account information. Changes to your profile since you
  last logged on may not be available.

  -or-

- When you attempt to establish a trust relationship between domains, you may
  receive an error message similar to the following:

  Could not find domain controller for this domain.

NOTE: The error messages and conditions may differ from the above, but it will
always be Netlogon communications that fail.


CAUSE
=====

Your NAT is not translating the source IP address from the NetBIOS header in
your network traffic.

RESOLUTION
==========

To successfully implement a Windows NT domain structure using a NAT, the NAT
will have to translate the addresses in NetBIOS datagram headers. Please consult
the vendor of your NAT for information on this issue.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NATs are used in IP networks to translate addresses from one network to another.
For example, if an internal network used one of the non-routable private network
IDs from RFC1597, such as 10.0.0.0, you could use a NAT to translate these
addresses into a public IP address and route them to the Internet. When a packet
comes back to the NAT, it retranslates the address back to the private address
of the originating host.

If you send a NetBIOS datagram, as Netlogon does, the NetBIOS header contains the
source IP address. The reply to this NetBIOS datagram will be sent directly to
this IP address that is found in the NetBIOS header as defined in RFC1002,
section 4.4. If the NAT only translates addresses in the IP header, and not in
the NetBIOS header, the packet may be sent to the wrong address. In this
example, the packet would be sent back to the computer on the 10.0.0.0 network,
which is a private address and not routeable.

The following NetBIOS headers contain an Owner IP address field which may require
translation:

NetBIOS Name Management
-----------------------

- Name Registration/Refresh/Release Request

- Name Registration/Refresh/Release Response

- Positive Name Query Response

NetBIOS Datagram
----------------

- Datagram Service Header

- Directed and Broadcast Datagram

- Datagram Error Packet

NetBIOS datagrams are used for the following purposes:

- Locating a logon server

- Sending a logon request

- Performing domain synchronization

- Browser host name announcements

- Browser workgroup/domain announcements

- NetBIOS Master Browser Existence and Election Packets

- NET SEND /d:&lt;Domain&gt; "Message"

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
