SUMMARY
=======

This article provides an overview of how to certify your Visual Basic for
Windows application with the Microsoft Windows Logo Program. For more
information, see the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/certification/default.asp

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following are the steps required to certify your Visual Basic for Windows
application with the Microsoft Windows Logo Program.

1. Obtain and sign the following license agreements and submit them on paper
  along with your product for testing:

   - The Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo license, available by
     phone/fax service at (425) 635-2222, document #830.

   - VeriTest's testing agreement, available by phone/fax service at (425)
     635-2222, document #831.

2. The online VeriTest Vendor Questionnaire must be completely filled out. The
  Vendor Questionnaire can be found on the VeriTest Web site at
  http://www.veritest.com/mslogos/. The more information you provide in the
  Vendor Questionnaire the better. You must list exceptions and requests for
  exemptions here. By filling out the Vendor Questionnaire accurately and
  completely you will ensure that your product is tested in the shortest amount
  of time possible. After filling out the Questionnaire, click Submit and you
  will receive a Tracking Number from VeriTest. We recommend that you write the
  tracking number on your product disk when you send it in for testing (see the
  next step).

3. Submit your product to VeriTest. Your submission packet must include the
  following:

   - Your software product (on floppy disk, or CD-ROM).

   - The results of a pretest that you have run on your product using the
     Installation Analyzer can be found at:

  http://www.veritest.com/installation_analyzer.htm

     For more information about this requirement, refer to section 4.2.3 of the
     Logo Requirements.

   - The VeriTest Testing Agreement (submit on paper-please see above).

   - The Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo License Agreement (submit on
     paper-please see above).

     License Agreement:
     Your signature on these contracts does not mean that you can start using
     the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo. It means that you have
     agreed to the license terms and are awaiting your product's passage of the
     tests and Microsoft's signing of the license.

     Confidentiality Option:
     On the Testing Agreement with VeriTest, you are given the option to keep
     your testing and test results confidential from Microsoft. If you choose
     this option, upon passing you must sign a release allowing VeriTest to
     send the results to Microsoft. Only after you sign this release can
     Microsoft grant you license to use the Logo.

4. You will receive test results from VeriTest within eight business days from
  the date when your complete application package was received. VeriTest will
  send both you and Microsoft a copy of the test results.

5. If your product passes testing, VeriTest will then send Microsoft the license
  agreement that you previously signed and submitted with your product testing
  to VeriTest.

6. Please read the Windows and Windows NT trademark guidelines (available at
  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/winlogo/ before using the Logo.

7. Please see http://www.veritest.com/mslogos/ for the current fee schedule. All
  testing fees are paid to VeriTest, not Microsoft.

8. If your product box is printed before you obtain the license to use the
  Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, you may order the Logo sticker
  from Special Effects, Seattle, WA (an outside vendor) at
  specialeffex@msn.com. The stickers will be delivered when you receive the
  license to use the Logo.

9. Microsoft will sign the license agreement and send it to the person
  designated as the marketing contact in the Vendor Questionnaire that you
  submitted. At this point, you may download an electronic copy of the Logo
  artwork kit from a secure web server using the password provided to you by
  VeriTest. This contains electronic copies of the Logo and Logo usage
  guidelines.

10. If your company already has product(s) licensed to use the Designed for
  Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, Microsoft will send you an update to the
  license after we receive your positive test results. This update will
  reflect the addition of the new product(s) to the license. Your signature on
  this update is required in order to complete the process.

11. The license allows you to use the Logo on packaging, advertising, your Web
  site, and other promotional materials.
