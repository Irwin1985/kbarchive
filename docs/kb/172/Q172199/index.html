SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic allows you to retrieve data from Jet databases (MDB files) by using
Structured Query Language (SQL). These query operations can be made more
efficient by implementing some of the suggestions in this article.

This article assumes that you are using the Microsoft Jet database engine. If you
are querying ODBC tables, many of these points still apply. For more information
regarding improving performance of ODBC queries, please search on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ODBC and Optimizing and Tables

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are some tips for optimizing your SQL queries:

Performance Analyzer
--------------------

If you have Microsoft Access 95 or 97, you can open the database and use the
Performance Analyzer to profile your queries and suggest improvements.

Table Design
------------

When defining a field in a table, choose the smallest data type appropriate for
the data in the field. This increases the number of records that can fit on a
page.

Fields you use in joins should have the same or compatible data types.

Compact the Database
--------------------

This has two performance benefits:

1. The Microsoft Jet database engine uses a cost-based method of optimization.
  As your database grows, the optimization scheme may no longer be efficient.
  Compacting the database updates the database statistics and re-optimizes all
  queries.

2. As your database grows, it will become fragmented. Compacting writes all the
  data in a table into contiguous pages on the hard disk, improving performance
  of sequential scans.

  To compact your database, use the CompactDatabase statement. This example
  compacts the database and makes a backup:

  DBEngine.CompactDatabase "C:\VB\BIBLIO.MDB", "C:\VB\BIBLIO2.MDB"
  Kill "C:\VB\BIBLIO.BAK"
  Name "C:\VB\BIBLIO.MDB" As "C:\VB\BIBLIO.BAK"
  Name "C:\VB\BIBLIO2.MDB" As "C:\VB\BIBLIO.MDB"

  If your database is updated heavily, you may want to consider compacting
  nightly.

Avoid Expressions in Query Output
---------------------------------

Expressions in query output can cause query optimization problems if the query is
used later as input to another query and you add criteria to the calculated
output. In the following example, Query1 is used as input for a second SELECT
statement:

     Dim DB As Database
     Dim RS As RecordSet
     Set DB = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).Opendatabase("Biblio.MDB")
     DB.CreateQueryDef("Query1", _
        "SELECT IIF(Au_ID=1,'Hello','Goodbye') AS X FROM Authors")
     Set RS = DB.OpenRecordSet("SELECT * FROM Query1 WHERE X='Hello'")

Because the IIF() expression in Query1 cannot be optimized, the WHERE condition
in second SELECT statement also cannot be optimized. If an expression gets
buried deeply enough in a query tree, you can forget that it is there. As a
result, your entire string of queries cannot be optimized.

If you can, merge the SQL into a single level of nesting:

     Set RS = DB.OpenRecordSet("SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE Au_ID=1")

For more complex nested queries, expose the fields that make up the expression:

     DB.CreateQueryDef("Query1", _
        "SELECT IIF(Au_ID=1,'Hello','Goodbye') AS X, Au_ID, FROM Authors")
     Set RS = DB.OpenRecordSet("SELECT * FROM Query1 WHERE Au_ID=1")

If you cannot avoid calculated values in query output, place them in the
top-level query and not in lower-level queries.

Output Only the Fields Needed
-----------------------------

When creating a query, return only the fields you need. If a field doesn't have
to be in the SELECT clause, don't add it. The above example of exposing
additional fields to make nested queries more efficient is an exception.

GROUP BY, Joins, and Aggregates
-------------------------------

This is an issue when you are joining two tables. For example, if you join two
tables on the Customer Name field, and also GROUP BY the Customer Name field,
make sure that both the GROUP BY field (Customer Name) and the field that is in
the aggregate (Sum, Count, and so on) come from the same table.

NOTE: This query is less efficient because the SUM aggregate is on the Ord table
and the GROUP BY clause is on the Cust table:

     SELECT Cust.CustID,
            FIRST(Cust.CustName) AS CustName,
            SUM(Ord.Price) AS Total
     FROM Cust INNER JOIN Ord ON Cust.CustID = Ord.CustID
     GROUP BY Cust.CustID

A more efficient query would be to GROUP BY on Ord.CustID:

     SELECT Ord.CustID,
            FIRST(Cust.CustName) AS CustName,
            SUM(Ord.Price) AS Total
     FROM Cust INNER JOIN Ord ON Cust.CustID = Ord.CustID
     GROUP BY Ord.CustID

NOTE: The First and Last functions do not have the overhead of other aggregates
and should not weigh very heavily in this decision.

GROUP BY As Few Fields As Possible
----------------------------------

The more fields in the GROUP BY clause, the longer the query takes to execute.
Use the First aggregate function to help reduce the number of fields required in
the GROUP BY clause.

Less efficient:

     SELECT Cust.CustID,
            Cust.CustName,
            Cust.Phone,
            SUM(Ord.Price) AS Total
     FROM Cust INNER JOIN Ord ON Cust.CustID = Ord.CustID
     GROUP BY Cust.CustID, Cust.CustName, Cust.Phone

More efficient:

     SELECT Ord.CustID,
            FIRST(Cust.CustName) AS CustName,
            FIRST(Cust.Phone) AS Phone,
            SUM(Ord.Price) AS Total
     FROM Cust INNER JOIN Ord ON Cust.CustID = Ord.CustID
     GROUP BY Ord.CustID

Nest GROUP BY Clause Before Joining
-----------------------------------

If you are joining two tables and only grouping by fields in one of them, it may
be more efficient to split the SELECT statement into two queries. making the
SELECT statement with the GROUP BY clause into a nested query joined to the
non-grouped table in the top-level query.

Less efficient:

     SELECT Ord.CustID,
            FIRST(Cust.CustName) AS CustName,
            FIRST(Cust.Phone) AS Phone,
            SUM(Ord.Price) AS Total
     FROM Cust INNER JOIN Ord ON Cust.CustID = Ord.CustID
     GROUP BY Ord.CustID

More efficient:

     Query1:
     SELECT CustID, SUM(Price) AS Total
     FROM Ord
     GROUP BY CustID

     Query2:
     SELECT Query1.CustID, Cust.CustName, Cust.Phone, Query1.Total
     FROM Cust INNER JOIN Ord ON Cust.CustID = Ord.CustID

Index Both Fields Use in Join
-----------------------------

When joining tables, try to index the fields on both sides of a join. This can
speed query execution by allowing the query optimizer to use more sophisticated
internal join strategy.

However, if you know one table is going to remain relatively small (occupy 1-2 2K
pages), it may be more efficient to remove indexes in that table because fewer
pages will have to be read into memory. You should try this on a case-by-case
basis.

Add Indexes to Speed Searches and Sorts
---------------------------------------

Place an index on all fields that are used in a join or in a restriction. With
the use of Rushmore query optimization technology, the Microsoft Jet 2.0 and
later database engine is able to take advantage of multiple indexes on a single
table, which makes indexing multiple fields advantageous.

Avoid restrictive query criteria on calculated and non-indexed columns whenever
possible.

Use sorting judiciously, especially with calculated and non-indexed fields.

Use Optimizable Expressions
---------------------------

Try to construct your queries so that Rushmore technology can be used to help
optimize them. Rushmore is a data-access technology that permits sets of records
to be queried very efficiently. With Rushmore, when you use certain types of
expressions in query criteria, your query will run much faster. Rushmore does
not automatically speed up all your queries. You must construct your queries in
a certain way for Rushmore to be able to improve them.

Use the REFERENCES section at the end of the article to locate more specific
information.

Use COUNT(*) Instead of COUNT([Column Name])
--------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Jet database engine has special optimizations that allow COUNT(*)
to be executed much faster than COUNT([Column Name]).

NOTE: These two operations also have slightly different behavior:

- Count(*) counts all rows returned.

- Count([Column Name]) counts all rows where [Column Name] is not NULL.

Avoid LIKE on Parameters
------------------------

Because the value of the parameter is unknown at the time the query is compiled,
indexes will not be used. You can gain performance by concatenating the
parameter value as a literal in the SQL statement.

Use the REFERENCES section at the end of the article to locate more specific
information.

Avoid LIKE and Leading Wildcard
-------------------------------

If you use the LIKE operator with a wildcard to find approximate matches, use
only one asterisk at the end of character string to ensure that an index is
used. For example, the following criteria uses an index:

  Like "Smith"
  Like "Sm*"

The following criteria does not use an index:

  Like "*sen"
  Like "*sen*"

Test Joins with Restrictions
----------------------------

If you use criteria to restrict the values in a field used in a join, test
whether the query runs faster with the criteria placed on the "one" side or the
"many" side of the join. In some queries, you get faster performance by adding
the criteria to the field on the "one" side of the join instead of the "many"
side.

Use Intermediate Tables
-----------------------

Use SELECT INTO statements to create work tables, especially if the results are
going to be used in a number of other queries. The more work you can do
up-front, the more efficient the process.

Avoid NOT IN with SubSelects
----------------------------

Using sub-selects and NOT IN is poorly optimized. Converting to nested queries or
OUTER JOINs are more efficient. The following example finds customers without
orders:

Less efficient:

        SELECT Customers.*
        FROM Customers
        WHERE Customers.[Customer ID]
              NOT IN (SELECT [Customer ID] FROM Orders);

More efficient:

        SELECT Customers.*
        FROM Customers LEFT JOIN Orders
             ON Customers.[Customer ID] = Orders.[Customer ID]
        WHERE ((Orders.[Customer ID] Is Null));
