SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Routing and Remote Access (RRAS) Update for Windows NT 4.0
on your Windows NT 4.0 RAS server, Dial-Up Networking (DUN) clients may not be
able to connect to your RAS server when using third party security
authentication; one such product is SecurID from Security Dynamics. You may also
note the following event log message in the event viewer on the RRAS server:

  Event ID: 20100
  Source: Router
  Description: The user was authenticated as %1 by the third party security host
  module but was authenticated as %2 by the RAS security. The user has been
  disconnected.

Where %1 and %2 are variables that represent user names.

NOTE: In Windows 2000 you receive Event ID: 20096 but the text is the same.
