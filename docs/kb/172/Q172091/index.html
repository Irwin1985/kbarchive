Microsoft products and are unable to respond directly to each one. However,
be assured that your recommendations, ideas, and remarks are recorded and
will help shape future versions of our Mastering Series products.

2 Setup Issues
==============
The Setup program's default settings will load the Mastering Internet
Development title to your C: drive in the MID folder. You can assign
application files to a different drive; however, Setup will copy as much as
8.5 MB of system files to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

Because Mastering Internet Development installs system files that may be
shared with other applications, you must shut down other applications,
including Microsoft Office, before running Setup. If you have closed all
other open applications and you encounter problems during Setup, make sure
your system meets the minimum requirements necessary to install Mastering
Internet Development.

Setup will not complete properly if you remove the Mastering Internet
Development CD-ROM during Setup, or attempt to start the application before
Setup is complete.

Internet Explorer 3.0 Beta 2
To help you get onto the World Wide Web quickly, Mastering Internet
Development includes the Beta 2 version of Internet Explorer 3.0. You
should install the most recent version of Internet Explorer as soon as
possible. Internet Explorer is available to download from the Internet
Explorer page on the Microsoft Web site, http://www.microsoft.com/ie.

System Requirements
Mastering Internet Development will run on the following minimal system;
however, performance will improve with more RAM or a faster CD-ROM drive.

- Personal computer with a 486DX or higher processor, running Windows 95
- 8 MB of memory (16 MB or more recommended)
- 10 MB of available hard-disk space (40 MB to work with lab files on
 your hard drive)
- MPC2-compatible CD-ROM drive
- Super VGA or higher-resolution video adapter capable of displaying 256
 colors or greater
- Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device
- MPC2-compatible audio board

3 Operating System Issues
=========================
Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
Mastering Internet Development runs under Microsoft Windows 95. It will not
run under Windows NT version 3.51. The reason for this is that Mastering
Internet Development is dependent on Microsoft Internet Explorer version
3.0 beta or later, which does not run under Windows NT version 3.51.

Several lab exercises included in this title, however, require you to run
Windows NT 3.51 or later, in order to run Microsoft Internet Information
Server. If you want to complete lab exercises that require Windows NT, and
want to have Mastering Internet Development running simultaneously, we
recommend the you have two PCs; one functioning as a client machine, the
other functioning as a server:

Client PC
- Windows 95
- Internet Explorer 3.0 beta or later
- Mastering Internet Development

Server PC
- Windows NT 3.51 or later
- Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 or later

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 beta or later
When we released Mastering Internet Development,  Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0 was in beta.  Because the beta status of Windows NT 4.0 at the
time Mastering Internet Development released, we do not offer product
support for users attempting to run Mastering Internet Development under
Windows NT 4.0.

If you want to run Mastering Internet Development on a PC running Windows
NT 4.0 beta or later, we recommend you do so on a test machine, that does
not contain any work-critical data or applications.  We will not offer
product support to users running Mastering Internet Development under
Windows NT 4.0 beta or later.

4 Removing Mastering Internet Development
=========================================
To remove Mastering Internet Development from your computer, run Setup
again and choose Remove All. You can also uninstall Mastering Internet
Development by running the Add/Remove Programs application in the Control
Panel.

You may also need to do the following:
- Delete the Mastering Internet Development shortcut. If you moved the
 shortcut to a different folder after installing the application, Setup
 will not be able to detect the new shortcut location or delete it.
 After running Setup (with Remove All), go to Windows Explorer and
 delete the shortcut(s).
- Delete the MID directory. The MID directory (or the directory you
 specified as the destination directory during Setup) will not be
 removed because it may contain files that you modified. If you did a
 Complete installation, two subdirectories were added: "Lists" and
 "Labs." If you worked on any of the labs or added topics to the
 Notebook, that information is saved in those subdirectories. If you
 still want to remove these directories,  you can delete them by going
 to Windows Explorer, selecting the directory, and pressing DELETE.

Warning
When running Setup with the Uninstall option you may receive a dialog box
with a warning about deleting a shared file. This dialog only occurs when
Setup prepares to remove a file that another application may use. If you
remove the file, be aware that other unregistered applications that use
that same file may no longer run correctly.

5 Using the Title's Internet Features
=====================================
Mastering Internet Development includes the following Internet features:

Launching URLs
This product contains Universal Resource Locators (URLs) that allow you to
jump to information on the Internet. URL addresses change over time as Web
sites and pages are added, deleted, modified, and moved. To keep the
Mastering Internet Development title current, a URL jump table has been
implemented in the title. Whenever you click on an URL jump in the title,
the table resolves this request to an Internet URL, then launches Internet
Explorer to locate that resource.

Product Update
The Product Update feature allows you to modify the title's URL jump table.
If a URL link fails, or you suspect it has changed, use the Product Update
command from the File menu to update this table from the Internet. Please
note that after you use this command, you may need to restart the Mastering
Internet Development title to see any changes in the content. If you have
questions about using the Product Update feature, consult the Help file.

Product Web Site
Use the Product Web Site command from the Help menu to jump to the
Mastering Internet Development Web page. This page will contain any future
errata information, and pointers to additional information.

6 Potential Problems Running this Title
=======================================
This section describes problems you may experience when running Mastering
Internet Development.

- Beta Software: Some of the material in this course is based on
 pre-released versions of Microsoft Internet tools and operating
 systems. There may be discrepancies between information referenced in
 the course and the released versions of these products.

- Lab 4, Exercises 1 and 2: The Spin32 and MaskedEdit controls may not
 self-register properly when downloaded by Internet Explorer Beta. This
 will cause them to work incorrectly. If you have Microsoft Visual Basic
 or Microsoft Visual C++, installing these products on the Client
 computer will correctly register the controls.

- Chapter 5, "Setting and Returning Properties Sample" sample code: The
 Slider control may not self-register properly when downloaded by
 Internet Explorer Beta. This will cause it to work incorrectly. If you
 have Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++, installing these
 products on the Client computer will correctly register the control.

- Lab 5, Optional Exercise: This exercise may not work correctly, due to
 problems with the HTML Select control in the Beta version of Internet
 Explorer.

- Lab 9, Lab Solution: This lab requires installation of Microsoft
 Exchange in order to install the OLE Messaging library. If you do not
 have Microsoft Exchange installed on your machine, you will receive the
 VB error "Can't find project or library" when trying to send e-mail
 using the lab solution application.

- User Profiles: If you change User Profiles in Windows 95 after
 installing this course, you should continue to log onto your machine
 with the same username you used when installing the course. Different
 users who have altered the default User Profiles settings may
 experience a path error dialog when restarting the course. Using the
 original username will avoid this problem.

- Library Articles: Library articles included in this title are not
 edited by the Mastering Internet Development team. You may encounter
 documentation errors, references to page numbers or files, and
 formatting problems. Addresses, phone numbers, and other contact
 information appearing in this title may have changed since the time of
 publication.

- Topic Titles: Some of the topic titles in the application will be cut
 off when running Mastering Internet Development in lower display
 resolutions.

- Palette Flash:  Palette flashes can occur when switching between
 Mastering Internet Development and other running applications, and when
 starting or stopping animations and demos.

- Graphics: This title is designed to run on machines capable of
 displaying 256 colors or more. Though the title does run on systems
 displaying 16 colors, there is a noticeable drop in image quality. Some
 large graphics may display out of the window when running the title at
 640 x 480 resolution. It is recommended that you run this application
 in 800 x 600 mode or greater. The graphic viewer in this application
 allows you to toggle graphics between large and small views. By
 clicking on the viewer, you can change the size of the graphic. The
 viewer will remain the size that you last viewed a graphic. If an image
 appears distorted or compressed, click in the graphic viewer to make
 sure you are viewing the entire image. Note that some small graphics do
 not change size.

- Navigation and Topic areas:  If using keyboard keys to navigate through
 the Table of Contents or the Topic area, you may need to manually
 change the focus of the application, depending on the content you want
 to affect. You can change the focus by clicking on the area you want to
 navigate. On some systems, the vertical scroll bar may change size when
 scrolling through topics and labs, or navigating through the Table of
 Contents.

- Printing: The media represented by icons in the text area (graphics,
 sample code, tips, and answers) will not print when printing the
 current screen. To print this information, choose Print when the media
 is displayed in the active window. If you experience problems printing
 over a network, consult your network administrator to make sure your
 printer settings are correct. Solutions for common printing problems
 are described in Section 8 of this README file, "Printing Problems." If
 you choose to print the Glossary, the entire Glossary will be printed.

- Text: Mastering Internet Development uses your system settings to
 display some foreground and background colors. You may want to choose a
 compatible display combination (such as the Windows Standard color
 scheme) for best visual results. When displaying glossary popups within
 the text, the application will sometimes lose focus. To remedy this,
 click in the Topic area; focus will return to the application.

- Video: .AVI files will only run if you've installed the Multimedia
 options when setting up Windows 95. Setup will look for multimedia
 options on your system and notify you if they are not installed. If
 this is the case, you will need to install the appropriate options.
 Even with appropriate hardware, you may experience long wait times
 while video files are being loaded, and you may encounter errors in
 audio/video synchronization during playback.

7 Performance Issues
====================
There are several ways to make Mastering Internet Development run faster.
Many of the methods described below are general tips that will improve the
performance of any application under Windows. Consult your Windows manual
for more details.

Mastering Internet Development uses your computer's random access memory
(RAM) to display pictures and play video and audio. If Mastering Internet
Development runs slowly or if you get error messages saying you are out of
memory, you may not have enough RAM available. Here are some tips to make
the best use of your available memory:

- Close all applications that you are not using.

- Add more RAM (memory) to your computer. You can determine how much
 memory is available by starting MS-DOS, typing mem and pressing ENTER.
 This starts a program that will tell you how much memory you have. You
 need at least 8 MB of RAM, and 16 MB is recommended.

- If you are using more than 256 colors in your video display, you may
 want to lower your video colors to 256. For instructions on how to
 change your Windows display, consult your Windows documentation.

For more details on improving performance, consult your Windows 95 and CD-
ROM manuals.

8 Hardware Problems
===================
In rare situations, Mastering Internet Development may encounter display
problems when using accelerated video drivers, video drivers with more than
256 colors, or high-resolution video drivers. One example of these problems
is a video display with garbled images. Another is a crash occurring when
trying to play a video. There are several things you can do if you
encounter such problems:

1. Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video card
manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video card to determine if
newer versions are available. The manufacturer's phone number should be in
the manuals that came with your video card or personal computer. Another
option for obtaining updated drivers is the Microsoft Download service
(MSDL), an electronic bulletin board that can be accessed by modem at (425)
936-MSDL (425-936-6735).

Drivers provided on MSDL are compressed with the PKWare utilities and are
in the form of executable files (.EXE extension). It is best to download
the file or files you need into an empty directory on your hard disk or a
blank formatted floppy. To decompress these drivers after downloading them,
either:

a. From Windows 95 Explorer, double-click on the filename that you
downloaded.

-or-

b. From the DOS prompt, change to the directory containing the downloaded
file, type the filename, and then press ENTER.

2. An alternative to obtaining a new or updated display driver is to change
your video mode to a standard video mode, such as 640 x 480 resolution with
256 colors.

To find out what video driver you are using, open Display from Control
Panel. In Windows 95, click on the Settings tab. Then click the Change
Display Type button. Your display type will be listed there. For
instructions on how to install or change drivers, click the Help button.

9 Printing Problems
===================
Screen resolution and printer resolution are often not the same, so the
resulting printout may not match the quality you see on the screen.

If you encounter a general protection fault when you print a topic, check
your printer driver. Switch to a more current version of the driver, if one
is available. Additionally, ensure that the printer is online and that you
can print to it from another application. If the problem persists, click on
the Property page for the Printer you are using. Choose the Fonts tab and
click on the method of downloading TrueType fonts that works best with your
system.

If you are using an HP LaserJet printer, make sure that you have the most
current printer driver, or try setting the printer resolution to 300 dpi
(graphics may not print properly at 600 dpi).

You should be able to print grayscale images from Mastering Internet
Development. If you have a black and white laser printer, you may need to
upgrade your printer driver. Call the dealer from whom you bought the
printer or call the printer manufacturer.
