-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

When you insert an ActiveX control that shipped with the Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition (ODE) Tools, or when you attempt to access the properties of
the ActiveX control, you receive the following error message:

  You don't have the license required to use this ActiveX control.

CAUSE
=====

Before you installed the ODE Tools, you installed an application that uses
run-time versions of the ActiveX controls. If more recent versions of the files
for these controls already existed on your computer when you installed the ODE
Tools, the ActiveX control (.ocx) files were not updated. As a result, the
corresponding dependency (.dep) files were not installed, and registry entries
required to give the controls design-time functionality were not made.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use either of the following methods to resolve the problem, but Method 1
is the recommended resolution.

Method 1
--------

Download the Odelic.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Odelic.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/office97dev/fix/1/WIN98/EN-US/Odelic.exe)

The Odelic.exe file contains the following files:

  OdeOcxFx.exe    Office Developer Edition ActiveX Control Update
  Readme.txt      Readme file

Running OdeOcxFx.exe provides you with a design-time license to the ActiveX
controls that ship with the ODE; it updates the registry and copies the .dep
files onto your computer if they do not already exist.

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Method 2
--------

1. Rename Comctl32.ocx, Comdlg32.ocx, and Richtx32.ocx, which are files that are
  located in the Windows\System folder.

2. Rename the Setup.stf file in the ODETools\Setup folder; the default location
  of this folder is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office.

3. Reinstall the ODE Tools.

4. Replace Comctl32.ocx, Comdlg32.ocx, and Richtx32.ocx with the original files
  that you renamed in Step 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Scenarios in which this problem can occur include, but are not limited to:

- Installation of the ODE Tools after you have installed the Exchange/Outlook
  Wizard, which uses Comctl32.ocx.

- Installation of the ODE Tools after you have installed a custom application
  that uses a run-time version of one of the ActiveX controls. The custom
  application was developed in Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0, Microsoft
  Visual C++ version 4.0, or Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 5.0.

- Installation of the ODE Tools after you have installed a custom application
  that uses a run-time version of one of the ActiveX controls. Microsoft Visual
  Basic version 5.0, Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0, or Microsoft Visual
  FoxPro version 5.0 is installed on the development computer, and the Setup
  Wizard included with the ODE Tools was used to package the custom
  application.

Additional query words: you don t have the license required to use this ActiveX control
