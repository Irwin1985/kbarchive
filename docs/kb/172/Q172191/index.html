SYMPTOMS
========

When using Desktop Themes from the Microsoft Windows NT Server or Workstation
4.0 Resource Kit, Desktop Themes may crash and generate a Dr. Watson log with
any of the following symptoms:

  

  Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

  Exception: access violation (Oxc0000005)

  Error in themes.exe

  Desktop Themes closes without warning

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Office 97 installs a JPEG filter that is incompatible with the initial
release of Desktop Themes included in the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit. This
incompatibility does not occur with Microsoft Office 97 on machines that do not
have the Desktop Themes included in the resource kit installed.

The only complete resolution is to obtain the Desktop Themes patch file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit team has developed a patch to address this
problem for all Windows NT platforms. This patch is available for free download
at the following ftp site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/reskit/nt40/

NOTE: You must have the original Windows NT 4.0 Desktop Themes program installed
in order for the patch to work properly.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue without the patch, use the following steps:

1. Open Desktop Themes.

2. Click Save As, then "Original Settings.Theme"(without quotation marks) to
  save your current settings as a theme and then click OK

  When you save or change the current theme settings, the Settings check boxes
  become available. You now also have a desktop theme with a bitmap (.BMP)
  wallpaper.

3. click to clear the desktop theme wallpaper option before changing desktop
  themes, and then set your theme as normal and click OK.

4. To change the desktop theme again, open the Desktop Themes program in the
  Control Panel and then select the "Original Settings" theme. This theme has a
  .BMP wallpaper and should not cause Desktop Themes to crash. After changing
  the theme selection, you can once again disable the Wallpaper check box
  before choosing a theme that has a JPEG wallpaper.

If you wish to use the wallpapers without the patch, use another program to
convert the appropriate .JPG file into a .BMP file, and then change the display
background setting to the new .BMP file.
