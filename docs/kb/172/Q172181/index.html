SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the WithEvents keyword to trap application events in Microsoft
Word, you cannot trap the Quit event.

CAUSE
=====

If no documents are open when Word exits, Word does not generate the Quit event.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, have your Visual Basic for Applications macro
create at least one document prior to exiting Word. The document can be a blank,
empty document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

WithEvents is an optional keyword for the Dim, Private and Public declaration
statements. It is used to trap specific Application or ActiveX object events,
and is valid only in class modules.

To create sample Visual Basic for Applications code that uses the WithEvents
keyword, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macros and then click Visual Basic Editor.

2. In the Visual Basic Editor, click to select the Normal module.

3. On the Insert menu, click Class Module.

4. In the General Declarations section of the class module, type the following
  declaration

  " Public WithEvents App As Application " (without the quotation marks)

  and the following procedure

        Private Sub App_Quit()
           MsgBox "Exiting Word"
        End Sub

5. In the General Declarations section of a module, for instance the NewMacros
  module, type the following declaration

  " Public cExit As New Class1 " (without the quotation marks)

  and the following procedure

        Sub AutoExec()
           Set cExit.App = Application
        End Sub

6. Exit and restart Word to initialize the class.

When you exit Word again, the message box containing the Exiting Word prompt is
displayed.

NOTE: If no documents are open when you exit Word, the Quit event is not
generated, and the message box is not displayed.

For more information about WithEvents, from the Visual Basic for Applications
Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "Public Statement" (without the
quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "Public Statement."

For more information about trapping events, click the Office Assistant, type
"events" (without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click one of the
following topics:

- Using Events with ActiveX Controls

- Using Events with the Application object

- Using Events with the Document Object

- Quit Event

- Open Event

- Auto Macros

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
