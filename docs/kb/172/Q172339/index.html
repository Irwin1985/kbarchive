SYMPTOMS
========

Error 3167 "Record is Deleted" is a common error when using the Data Access
Objects (DAO) or a data control to access ODBC tables. This is due to the way
that the Microsoft Jet Database Engine manipulates its cursor for the recordset.
It is not limited to DAO. Similar errors can be raised by any engine that
maintains a cursor. The ODBC cursor library and servers themselves can and will
raise similar errors. Understanding why and how these errors are caused requires
a knowledge of resultset and cursor behavior.

CAUSE
=====

The "Record is Deleted" error (error 3167) is a byproduct of the Jet engine's
keyset cursor for the dynaset type recordset. A keyset cursor is fixed in
membership, but there is nothing stopping another user from deleting a row in
the underlying table that you have selected in your keyset. When you attempt to
get the data or update the data in a deleted row, the "Record is Deleted" error
message is generated. Again, this behavior is not limited to the Jet engine, but
can occur in any keyset cursor.

This is not the only cause of the error. There are several other causes that are
far more subtle and depend on the keyset implementation. Because the Jet engine
uses a keyset based on a unique index in the underlying tables, it is possible
to get this error if something changes the index information. When the fields
that the keyset is built from are changed in the underlying table for a given
record, the Jet engine is not able to find the record to read or update the data
and raises the "Record is Deleted" error. In most cases the Jet engine knows
that the indexed fields changed in the underlying table if it made the changes,
but the following could change the indexed fields without the Jet engine being
aware of it:

- Other users. Other users may change the values in the indexed fields. When
  the Jet engine is unable to find that record based on the value that it is
  storing, it raises an error.

- Triggers. Triggers can change the values in the indexed fields. Since a
  trigger changes the values from what the Jet engine thinks it put in there,
  the cached keyset value and the actual value in the table differ. When the
  Jet engine tries to fetch the record, it will raise an error.

- Null and Empty String behavior. Many databases automatically change data if
  necessary without alerting the Jet engine. For example, if the user were to
  add a record where the indexed column was a varchar() and the user submitted
  a "" value for that field, SQL Server would change the "" into a space (" ")
  and not alert the Jet engine. The Jet engine would then try to find that
  record with "", fail to do so and raise the "Record is Deleted" error.

- Functions. Many indexed fields are updated with server functions such as
  GetDate(). These can change the indexed data without the Jet engine knowing
  it.

- Indexes on non-standard datatypes or floating point datatypes. Some server
  datatypes have no ODBC or Jet engine equivalent datatype. In most cases, the
  Recordset is created as read-only, but sometimes it is not. Rounding or
  conversion errors on the datatypes can cause the error as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

Proper table structure and recordset creation is all that is usually needed.
Where this is not possible, there are a few alternatives:

- Use SQL statements to do the updating and deleting and use read-only snapshot
  type recordsets to view the data. Refresh the recordset as needed.

- Refresh the recordset after every edit or addnew or execute operation that
  affects the data in the recordset. The Jet engine will rebuild the keyset
  with the updated information.

- Remove triggers, functions, and so forth from the ODBC table and perform
  those actions manually.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. Keyset cursors behave in this manner. Since the Jet
engine implements a keyset cursor, it is subject to the limitations of the
cursor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A resultset is the set of records obtained from an SQL query (generally a SELECT
statement). A cursor is a way of maintaining position in a resultset, but is
often thought of as the combination of the resultset and the actual cursor.

Cursors (as they apply to ODBC and most database servers) are either Forward Only
or Scrollable. A Forward Only cursor is a very simple cursor. You can move
forward only one row at a time. Scrollable cursors allow you to move back and
forth through the cursor, optionally allowing for exact positioning, determining
position, finding records, and so forth. Scrollable cursors can optionally be
Block cursors in that the cursor can fetch records a block at a time. The block
of data is often referred to as a rowset. Cursors can also be Static, Dynamic,
Keyset, or Mixed.

A Static cursor is a cursor in which membership, order, and values are fixed upon
opening. The data appears to be static. It may change in the underlying tables,
but the cursor is unaware of the changes until it is refreshed.

A Dynamic cursor is exactly the opposite. The membership, order and values are
completely dynamic. The data reflects what is currently in the underlying tables
at that moment (usually limited by some refresh rate).

A Keyset cursor is a cursor that is fixed in membership and order, but not in
values. A keyset cursor gets its name because a set of keys (bookmarks) that
point to the data in the tables is created. Think of it as an array of pointers
to the actual data for each record in the tables.

A Mixed cursor is a mix of Dynamic and Keyset cursors. It is essentially a cursor
where the keyset does not contain all of the rows of the resultset (to save on
memory). Therefore, there is a rowsetsize that is the size of the block of data
fetched, a keysetsize that is the size of the keyset, and a resultsetsize that
is the size of the entire resultset. The cursor is mixed because it is keyset
within the current keyset, but dynamic outside of the current keyset.

In regards to ODBC there are two classifications of cursors, Client-side
(ODBC)and Server-side. Client-side cursors are maintained on the client's system
and Server-side cursors are maintained on the server. Client-side cursors cannot
realistically be dynamic.

Due to bandwidth limitations and other factors, client-side cursors are generally
limited to Forward Only, Static, and Keyset. Server-side cursors can be of any
type.

The Jet engine creates and maintains its own cursors for ODBC recordsets. It does
not rely on the ODBC cursor library cursors or server-side cursors. It does this
so that it can provide the updatability of dynaset type recordsets and allow SQL
statements that span multiple Access, ISAM, or ODBC databases. It provides the
following cursors:

  Recordset Type       Cursor Type
  -------------------- ---------------------------
  Table                Dynamic (MDB and IISAM only; not available for
                       ODBC)

  SnapShot             Static read-only
  Dynaset              Keyset

Forward-Only Snapshot Forward-only read-only

A Note About Jet's Keyset Cursor Implementation
-----------------------------------------------

The Jet engine creates a keyset for the cursor based on a unique index on the
table. It queries the database for information on the table to find a unique
index. If one is not found, a non-unique keyset cursor (dynaset type recordset)
will be built, but it will be read-only. This is because Jet updates records via
an UPDATE statement using the key fields to limit the changes to a single
record. If the table does not have a unique index, Jet cannot ensure that an
update affects only a single record.

Other cursor libraries, like the ODBC cursor library, use more sophisticated
updating schemes that can handle tables without indexes, but are more complex
and error prone.
