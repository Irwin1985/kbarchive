SYMPTOMS
========

Taking ownership of a file or folder remotely does not log a security event the
same way as taking ownership locally.

If, when taking ownership locally, the only audit policy enabled is "Use of User
Rights," several "Privilege Use" events are logged. When taking ownership
remotely over the network (through another Windows NT-based workstation or
server or a Macintosh client connecting through Services for Macintosh), no
events are generated in the security log.

CAUSE
=====

When you take ownership of an object, there are two ways to get access to take
ownership:

- Use the "Take Ownership of files or other objects" User Right.

  -or-

- Have WRITE_OWNER access to the object. WRITE_OWNER is part of Full Control in
  the Access Control List (ACL) so, if you grant Full Control to a user through
  NTFS permissions, the user can take ownership locally or remotely.

Therefore, when you take ownership remotely, you are not using the "Take
Ownership" user right so no "Use of User Right" event is generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To get an audit event when taking ownership remotely, you need to have the "File
and Object Access" audit policy turned on. The events are logged but can be
difficult to find because there are so many events (every time an object is
selected, an event is generated). Here is a sample of the event generated when
taking ownership remotely:

  Event ID: 560
  Source: Security
  Category: Object Access
  Description:

  Object Open:
     Object Server: Security
     Object Type: File
     Object Name: C:\users\jdoe
     New Handle ID: 868
     Operation ID: {0,94189}
     Process ID: 4285605632
     Primary User Name: SYSTEM
     Primary Domain: SYSTEM
     Primary Logon ID: (0x0,0x3E7)
     Client User Name: jdoe
     Client Domain: DOMAINX
     Client Logon ID: (0x0,0x16A08)
     Accesses  WRITE_OWNER
        ReadAttributes
     Privileges     -

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you take ownership locally and "Use of User Rights" is enabled, four Event
578s are logged and the last Event 578 gives the detail about the actual
ownership transaction, as is shown in the following example:

  Event ID: 578
  Source: Security
  Category: Privilege Use
  Description:

  Privileged object operation:
     Object Server: Security
     Object Handle: 232
     Process ID: 4289438976
     Primary User Name: jdoe
     Primary Domain: DOMAINX
     Primary Logon ID: (0x0,0xDC4)
     Client User Name: jdoe
     Client Domain: DOMAINX
     Client Logon ID: (0x0,0xDC4)
     Privileges: SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege

STATUS
======

This audit process is by design.
