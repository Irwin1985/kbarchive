-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you type in a text form field, Microsoft Word may not behave the way you
expect it to.

Case 1: AutoCorrect Features
----------------------------

Microsoft Word will ignore the following AutoCorrect rules for the typed text:

- Capitalize the first letter of a sentence.

  -and-

- Correct TWo INitial CApitals in a sentence.

NOTE: "Capitalize names of days" and "Correct accidental usage of CAPS LOCK key"
options function correctly in a text form field.

Case 2: "Replace Text As You Type" Ignored
------------------------------------------

Some "Replace text as you type" text will not be replaced.

For example, when you type :) in a text form field, Word will not replace the :)
with a smiley face. This problem occurs with the following default AutoCorrect
entries.

  Text typed     Function
  -----------------------
  ...            Ellipse
  :(             Unhappy face
  :-(            Unhappy face
  :)             Smiley face
  :-)            Smiley face
  :|             Uncertain face
  :-|            Uncertain face
  &lt;--            Left arrow
  &lt;==            Bold left arrow
  &lt;=&gt;            Double arrow
  ==&gt;            Bold right arrow
  --&gt;            Right arrow

Case 3: Editing Features
------------------------

Some editing features (shortcut keys) do not work. For example, you cannot use
the following shortcut keys.

  Shortcut keys         Function
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  CTRL+BACKSPACE        Delete one word to the left
  SHIFT+F3              Change the case of characters
  SHIFT+HOME            To extend selection to the beginning of a line
  SHIFT+END             To extend selection to the end of a line

NOTE: It is also not possible to do Font formatting from the Formatting Toolbar
in protected text form fields. Font enhancements such as "Bold", "Italics," and
"Underline" are not available using the buttons on the Formatting Toolbar.

Case 4: Proofing Tools
----------------------

Word will not check the typed text for spelling or grammar.

NOTE: Spelling and grammar mistakes are ignored regardless of the method you use
to check for them.

WORKAROUND
==========

Case 1: AutoCorrect Features
----------------------------

Create a case-sensitive AutoCorrect entry for each word that would start a
sentence or type your text with correct capitalization into your text form
field.

For more information about how to create an AutoCorrect entry, click the Office
Assistant, type "How do I create a new AutoCorrect entry?" click Search, click
to view "Use shortcuts to insert frequently used text and graphics", and then
click to view "Create an AutoCorrect entry to store and automatically insert
text and graphics."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q120802 Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office Program or Component

Case 2: "Replace Text As You Type" Ignored
------------------------------------------

There is no known workaround for this problem. You cannot type, paste, or insert
the symbols that are listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article into a
text form field.

Case 3: Editing Features
------------------------

Select text in a text form field using the mouse or the SHIFT+ARROW keys. To
delete selected text in a text form field, click Cut on the Edit menu or press
the DELETE key on your keyboard. Note: If your form fields are in a table,
selecting text with the mouse or SHIFT+ARROW keys does not work. You must click
and delete or backspace to edit the text.

Case 4: Proofing Tools
----------------------

To check spelling for text that is contained in a text form field, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119698 WD: Form Fields Lose Text When Protected for Forms
