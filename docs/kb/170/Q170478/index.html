The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a Microsoft Exchange Server is removed from a Microsoft Exchange Site and
Organization and then re-installed using a different Organization and Site name,
messages sent to that Server may appear to loop or stick in the Microsoft
Exchange Server Message Transfer Agent (MTA) for a long period of time.
Eventually, they are returned to their originators with a Non-Delivery Report
(NDR) that includes the following text:

  The recipient could not be processed due to congestion in the message
  transfer service.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two scenarios that can cause this type of behavior:

1. Once a Microsoft Exchange Server is removed from the Site and Organization
  that it was replicating with, the other Servers in the Site will not
  instantly know that the Server was removed. Users will be able to send
  messages to recipients on the old Server and the messages will be routed to
  the proper queue. They will wait there until their internal 512 hop count is
  exceeded and then NDR with the above error message. To prevent this, once a
  Server is removed from the Organization or Site, force a replication session
  among all of the remaining Servers so that users from the old Server will no
  longer appear in the Global Address List (GAL).

2. Another scenario is when a Server is removed from a Site, the sitename is
  changed, and then the Server is re-added to the Organization. Messages that
  are pending to go to the old Site will see that the Site is back, based on
  the MTA name. The MTA has no method of detecting that the messages are
  invalid since the old MTA name still exists as a valid route. Again, the
  messages will loop until their 512 hop limit is exceeded and they NDR. This
  problem is also easily avoidable. Once the Server is removed from the Site,
  delete any messages pending for users on the old Server. This can be done by
  going to each Server in the Site and looking at its pending queue to the old
  Server. When the messages are deleted from the queue, they will NDR back to
  the originators. This behavior is by product design.
