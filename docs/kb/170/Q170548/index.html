SYMPTOMS
========

When using transactions to an ODBC database, it is possible to cause a Visual
Basic application to appear to hang until the ODBC query time-out interval is
reached and error 3146 "ODBC Call Failed" is raised. The DBEngine errors
collection will show an ODBC "Time-out Expired" error.

The Visual Basic application appears to hang and will eventually display and
error with an ODBC Time-out message after the interval specified in the
QueryTimeout property of the database object (default = 60 seconds). If the
error is trapped and handled, the application can resume normally although the
data may have been rolled back or partially committed.

CAUSE
=====

When the Microsoft Jet Engine, used by Visual Basic, performs transactions on an
ODBC database, it issues ODBC transactions down each connection that it opens
between the BeginTrans and the CommitTrans/Rollback. It then commits or rolls
back all of the transactions on all of the connections when a CommitTrans or
Rollback is issued.

It must do this because the Jet engine offers global and nested transactions
while the current ODBC specification does not; it only allows for a single
transaction on a per connection basis.

If needed, the Jet engine will open multiple connections in order to perform the
transactions. The server sees each connection as a separate process. It has no
way of knowing that it is from the same application or that you may want the
connections to get along with each other in terms of locking or available data.
It simply treats each connection as a completely independent and distinct
entity.

This raises a problem. If the Jet engine opens a connection, begins a transaction
that affects a given page of data on a given table, then opens another
connection and begins another transaction that affects the same page of data,
the server will block (serialize) the second connection until the first one
releases the locks (completes). This causes the Visual Basic application to hang
on the line of code that is running the statement on the second connection until
the transaction that it sent on the first connection completes. This can never
happen because the transaction on the first connection is open until a
CommitTrans or Rollback is encountered in the Visual Basic code, but that code
is hung waiting for the transaction to complete. It is hung indefinitely unless
a time-out occurs on one of the connections, which is what eventually happens.

The following example demonstrates the problem with most ODBC servers:

1. Create a datasource for your server named DSN_BLK_TEST using the ODBC
  Administrator applet.

2. Open Visual Basic and start a new project.

3. Reference the appropriate DAO reference in the References dialog.

4. Add a CommandButton to the form.

5. Add the following code to the click event of the CommandButton:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()

           Dim db As Database
           Dim rs As Recordset
           Dim strSQL As String
           Dim intLoop As Integer

           'Open up the ODBC datasource
           Set db = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase("", _
           False, False, "ODBC;DSN=DSN_BLK_TEST;DATABASE=TestDB;UID=sa;PWD=;")
           'Create a table with two fields one a primary key
           strSQL = "IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sysobjects WHERE id = "
           strSQL = strSQL &amp; "object_id('t_blocking')) DROP TABLE t_blocking"
           db.Execute strSQL, dbSQLPassThrough
           strSQL = "CREATE TABLE t_blocking (f_pkey int " &amp; _
                    "NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,"
           strSQL = strSQL &amp; " f_dummy varchar(10) NULL)"
           db.Execute strSQL, dbSQLPassThrough
           Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM t_blocking")
           'Demonstrate Blocking
           BeginTrans
           'Add some records
           For intLoop = 1 To 25
              rs.AddNew
              rs.Fields("f_pkey") = intLoop
              rs.Fields("f_dummy") = "test" &amp; Str$(intLoop)
              rs.Update
           Next intLoop
           'Try to update a few records. This should cause a second
           'connection' to be created by the JET engine
           'causing a blocking condition.
           strSQL = "UPDATE t_blocking SET f_dummy = 'updated' " &amp; _
                    "WHERE f_pkey &gt; 20"
           db.Execute strSQL
           CommitTrans

        End Sub

The code should appear to hang on the last db.Execute statement. Using the server
administrative tools for the server that you are using, check the locking status
on the t_blocking table. It should show the first connection blocking the
second.

NOTE: Depending on the locking mechanisms of the server, this test may not cause
a locking problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem:

1. Keep transactions as small as possible. If this condition is encountered,
  check the locking on the server and limit the transaction to the point where
  blocking occurs.

2. Use the ODBC API. If you are using the 32-bit Visual Basic Enterprise
  Edition, use Remote Data Objects (RDO) or ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). When
  using RDO or ADO, you have complete control over connections and transactions
  on the connections, so you can avoid this problem.

3. Use SQLPassthrough queries that combine the blocking statements into one
  statement that does transactions within the SQL statement. This could be ad
  hoc SQL or precompiled into a stored procedure.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
