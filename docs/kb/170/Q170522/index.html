a Windows NT computer:

- An internal SCSI tape device works properly for three days, and then the
  following error message appears within the tape backup program:

  tape device is not responding.

  After you restart your computer, the tape device works for another three
  days.

  -or-

- The tape device does not consistently eject the cartridge. Attempting to
  eject the tape may cause the tape device to fail with the following error
  message:
