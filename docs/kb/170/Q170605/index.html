SUMMARY
=======

This article describes issues related to synchronization of the local .scd file,
and troubleshooting steps to help correct these issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Background
----------

Schedule+ can use a local .scd file that replicates the server based schedule
file. This file allows Schedule+ to be used without a network connection. It
also improves overall speed and response times, reduces network traffic, and
prevents network-related interruptions.

When a user reconnects to the server after working locally, changes to the local
.scd file merge with the schedule file on the server. While connected to the
server, Schedule+ synchronizes the local .scd file automatically. The user is
normally unaware that the files are being synchronized, because no confirmation
prompts are displayed.

Synchronization Options
-----------------------

In Schedule+, if you click Options on the Tools menu, the following settings are
available on the Synchronize tab.

Synchronize Every N Minutes:

This option sets the synchronization interval between 1 and 99 minutes of CPU
idle time. Because this is based on CPU idle time, a heavily used system may not
automatically synchronize regardless of this setting. Clearing this option turns
off synchronization, and forces the local .scd file to be used exclusively.

Always Synchronize upon Exit:

This option synchronizes the local .scd file with the server copy when you exit
Schedule+.

NOTE: Synchronization occurs only if the time interval specified by the
"Synchronize every &lt;n&gt; minutes" option has expired.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q164421 Behavior of Schedule+ 7.0 Synchronize on Exit

Work Primarily from Local File:

This option saves updates to the local .scd file. Updates to the server are made
according to the "Synchronize every &lt;n&gt; minutes" option, and whenever
Synchronize Now is clicked. If a local .scd file does not exist, selecting this
option generates a prompt for a new .scd name.

For additional information about creating an .scd file, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q149986 Creating a .SCD File for an Existing Profile

NOTE: If there is a problem connecting to the Microsoft Exchange Server when you
start Schedule+, or if you run Schedule+ offline, this option is automatically
selected. You must clear this option again to work exclusively from the server.

NOTE: If others regularly update your schedule, you should probably clear this
option. This insures that updated information from the server is always being
displayed.

Synchronize Now:

This button causes the local .scd file and the server schedule file to
synchronize immediately. You must run Schedule+ online for this option to be
available.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q163634 Can't Synchronize Microsoft Schedule+ File if Offline

Troubleshooting
---------------

IMPORTANT: Before you perform these steps, you should first make a backup copy of
your schedule data. To do this, point to Export on the File menu, and then click
Schedule+ Interchange.

NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Exchange 4.0, update BOTH the Exchange client
and server to Service Pack 2 (or later) prior to performing any synchronization
troubleshooting. This corrects certain major issues with file locking.

Typical issues that may arise with schedule synchronization include:

- A delegate updates their manager's schedule, and the manager cannot see the
  update.

- A user has updated their schedule, but others viewing the schedule cannot see
  the updates.

- Synchronization error messages are displayed, either during startup or during
  synchronization.

To troubleshoot synchronization issues, you must do two things:

1. Determine if the problem is truly a synchronization problem, or a problem
  with the server based schedule data.

2. Determine if the problem is account (mailbox) specific, and if so repair the
  mailbox by exporting the data and resetting the account.

The rest of this article describes a specific sequence of methods for
troubleshooting synchronization issues. If a given method does not resolve the
problem, go on to the next method.

Setup Schedule+ to Work Strictly from the Server:

To test if there is a synchronization problem, follow these steps to setup
Schedule+ without a local .scd file (so there is nothing to synchronize).

1. On the File menu, click "Exit and log out."

2. Rename all local *.scd files to *.old

3. Start Schedule+, and in the "Welcome to Schedule Plus" dialog box, select "I
  do not want a schedule file on this machine."

  This prevents an .scd file from being created, and allows you to work directly
  from the server.

4. Test the creation of appointments, make a meeting, and so forth.

NOTE: Even when working strictly from the server, if a delegate (user2) changes
the schedule for user1, user1 may need to switch views to immediately see the
change. Under typical conditions, the screen refreshes within one or two
minutes.

Create a New .scd File:

If no problems are encountered while working strictly from the server, follow
these steps to create a new .scd file:

1. Start Schedule+.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. On the Synchronize tab, select "Work primarily from local file," and then
  click OK.

4. In the Select Local .SCD dialog box, enter the correct name in the File Name
  box, and then click Open.

A new local .scd file is created using the Schedule+ information from the
Microsoft Exchange Server.


Troubleshoot the Mailbox:

If Schedule+ stops responding while logging into a server based folder, follow
these steps to determine if the problem is account (mailbox) specific:

1. Create a new profile to another mailbox on the same server.

2. Log on as a user who can use that mailbox. Start Microsoft Exchange, and then
  start Schedule+. Select the Connect option when prompted.

3. If both Microsoft Exchange and Schedule+ work correctly, then you may need to
  re-create the original mailbox of the user. See the "Creating a New Mailbox"
  section later in this article.

4. If the user still can not log on, then it may be necessary to check for
  network connectivity issues or reinstall the Microsoft Exchange Client.

  For additional information about reinstalling the client, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q165961 How to completely remove the WIN95 and NT Exchange client

Attempt to Force Synchronization:

To attempt to have Schedule+ immediately synchronize with the server, follow
these steps:

1. Start Schedule+ (online).

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. On the Synchronize tab, select "Work primarily from local file," and then
  click Synchronize Now.

Reset Server Based Schedule+ Information:

If you suspect the server based Schedule+ information is corrupted, you may clear
that information.

For additional information about how to do this, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q150612 Deleting the Schedule+ Data From the Exchange Server

NOTE: You need to reset permissions on the schedule file after performing this
procedure.

Creating a New Mailbox:

If resetting the Schedule+ file on the server does not fix the synchronization
problem, you may need to re-create a new mailbox.

For additional information about how to do this, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q146920 Restoring Individual Mailboxes, Messages, or Folders
