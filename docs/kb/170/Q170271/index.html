SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) for Windows NT
Workstation 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is a set of
tools, methodologies, and guidelines designed to help corporate administrators
install and configure Windows NT Workstation-based computers that are centrally
administered. By using ZAK, a corporation can reduce end-user operations costs.
These costs include time wasted due to self-induced system problems and
unproductive activities. Examples of behaviors that can result in wasted time
include:

- Unintentionally deleting necessary system files from a hard disk.

- Modifying Control Panel or registry settings incorrectly.

- Introducing incompatible components or viruses by installing new software.

- Changing system settings like colors, backgrounds, and desktop arrangement.

- Installing and using unapproved software, such as games.

Using the ZAK, an administrator can prevent these types of actions and increase
the manageability of Windows NT Workstation systems by centralizing
functionality. ZAK tools and methodologies are intended for use by experienced
system administrators. An administrator can customize ZAK to meet the specific
computing needs of a corporation.

ZAK takes advantage of the security and reliability of the Windows NT File System
(NTFS) and the power and flexibility of system policies and user profiles. These
tools are already built into Windows NT 4.0.

The ZAK Setup program provides two options for configuring a workstation:
Taskstation mode and Appstation mode. Taskstation mode is designed for users who
run task-specific programs or browser-based programs. A typical scenario for
selecting Taskstation mode is a user who runs one or more form-based programs.
The default ZAK Taskstation mode configuration allows users to run Microsoft
Internet Explorer for Windows NT.

Appstation mode is designed for users who run a well-defined set of programs. A
typical scenario for selecting Appstation mode is a user with access to a
limited set of well-defined programs installed on a central server. The default
ZAK Appstation mode configuration allows users to run Microsoft Office 97
programs and Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows NT.

Note that setting up an environment for corporate-wide deployment of Microsoft
Windows NT and Microsoft Office is a task that requires careful thought and
thorough planning. Although ZAK provides a method for implementing Windows NT
Workstation and Microsoft Office 97, it should not take the place of the careful
planning that must go into deploying these products.
