Lightweight Controls Must Be Borderless
---------------------------------------

When creating a lightweight User control by setting the Windowless property to
True, the BorderStyle property is invalidated. By definition a lightweight
control has no border.

If you first set the BorderStyle property to anything other than 0 - None and
subsequently change the Windowless property to True, you will receive an error
message "Windowless UserControls only support BorderStyle = None". Run Time
Error 711: Compiled .Exe Doesn't Contain Information About Unreferenced Control
Causing Controls.Add to Fail

Problem:

1. Create a new Standard EXE. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a user control to the project.

3. Add the following code:

        Dim WithEvents x as VBControlExtender

        Private Sub Form_Load ()
            Set x = Controls.Add ("Project1.Usercontrol1", "XX")
            x.Visible = True
        End Sub

4. On the File menu, click Make Project1.exe (Don't run the project.)

5. Run the EXE.

  Result: You get an error (711) stating that Project1.Usercontrol1 is an
  invalid ProgID since no info about it can be found in the exe.

  Solution: Before compiling the project, under the Project menu, click Project1
  Properties. On the Make tab, clear the "Remove information about unused
  ActiveX controls" check box.

Remarks

By default, ActiveX controls that are referenced but not placed on any type of
form at design time are not available for Controls.Add at runtime or in an
executable.

  flexSingleLine       0       (Default) Displays text on a
                               single line only.

  flexWordBreak        1       The lines are automatically
                               broken between words.

  flexWordEllipsis     2       Truncates text that does not
                               fit in the rectangle and adds

  sis                          adds ellipsis if text doesn't
                               fit in the rectangle.

Hierarchical FlexGrid Control: ColIsVisible and RowIsVisible Properties are

Read Only
---------

The ColIsVisible and RowIsVisible properties are read-only properties and cannot
be set programmatically. You can use the properties to test whether a column or
row is visible, and hide the column or row, if appropriate, as show below:

    With MSHFlexGrid1
       If .ColIsVisible(1) Then .ColWidth(1) = 0
       If .RowIsVisible(1) Then .RowHeight(1) = 0
    End With

Hierarchical FlexGrid Control: Additional Settings for GridLines, GridLinesBand,
GridLinesFixed, GridLinesHeader, GridLinesIndent, and

GridLinesUnpopulated Properties
-------------------------------

Two additional settings are possible for the following properties:

ridLines, GridLinesBand, GridLinesFixed, GridLinesHeader, GridLinesIndent,
GridLinesUnpopulated Properties. The possible settings are show in the table
below:

  Constant             Value    Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  flexGridDashes       4        Dashed Lines. Sets line style
                                between cells to dashed lines.

  flexGridDots         5        Dotted Lines. Sets line style
                                between cells to dotted lines.

Remarks:

These settings can be used in addition to flexGridNone, flexGridFlat,
flexGridInset and flexGridRaised.

DataRepeater Control: Setting Public Properties Affect only the Current

Control
-------

When creating a user control to be used in a DataRepeater control, be aware that
public properties of the control will be set only on the current control (the
"live" control with the focus). For example, if you expose the Font property of
a user control, at run time, resetting that property (as shown in the example
code below) will only affect the current control in the DataRepeater control.
The font of repeated controls will not be affected.

    Private Sub Command1_Click()
       ' Only the current control's Font will be affected.
       DataRepeater1.RepeatedControl.FontName = "Courier"
    End Sub

The corresponding code in the user control would resemble the following:

    Public Property Get FontName() As String
       FontName = txtProductName.Font.Name
    End Property
    Public Property Let FontName(ByVal newFontName As String)
       txtProductName.Font.Name = newFontName
    End Property

TabStrip Control: Separators show only when the Style property =

TabFlatButtons
--------------

Separators will only appear on a TabStrip control when the Style property is set
to TabFlatButtons. An example is shown below:

    Private Sub Form_Load()
       With TabStrip1
          .Style = tabFlatButtons
          .Separators = True
       End With
    End Sub

Data Report Designer: Error in Event Handling Code
--------------------------------------------------

In the topic titled Data Report Events, there is an error in code that shows how
to handle asynchronous errors. For more information, search online, with Search
titles only selected, for "Data Report Events" in the MSDN Library Visual Studio
6.0 documentation.

The code is found under the heading "Error Events' for Asynchronous Events." The
code omits a "Select Case ErrObj.ErrorNumber" statement. The corrected code is:

     Private Sub DataReport_Error(ByVal JobType As _
     MSDataReportLib.AsyncTypeConstants, ByVal Cookie As Long, _
      ByVal ErrObj As MSDataReportLib.RptError, ShowError As Boolean)
        Select Case ErrObj.ErrorNumber
           Case rptErrPrinterInfo ' 8555
              MsgBox "A printing error has occurred. " &amp; _
               "You may not have a Printer installed."
              ShowError = False
              Exit Sub
           Case Else ' handle other cases here.
              ShowError = True
        End Select
     End Sub

RichTextBox Control: SelPrint Method Has New Argument
-----------------------------------------------------

The SelPrint method now features a second, optional argument. The syntax and part
descriptions are shown below:

Syntax

  object.SelPrint(lHDC As Long, [vStartDoc])

The SelPrint method syntax has these parts:

  Part        Description
  -----------------------------------------------------
  object      An object expression that evaluates to a
              RichTextbox control.

  lHDC        Long. The device context of the device you
              plan to use to print the contents of the
              control.

  vStartDoc   Boolean. Specifies the behavior of the
              control regarding startdoc and enddoc printer
              control operations, as shown in settings.

Settings
--------

The settings for vStartDoc are:

  Constant    Value      Description
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  True        -1    (Default) The control retains its
                    original behavior and sends startdoc
                    and enddoc commands to the printer.

  False       0     The control doesn't send startdoc and
                    enddoc commands, but sends only
                    startpage and endpage commands to the
                    printer.

Remarks:

The argument was added to remedy situations when printers do not print with the
default behavior. When the SelPrint method is invoked, both Visual Basic and the
RichTextBox control send startdoc and enddoc commands to the printer resulting
in a nested pair of startdoc/enddoc commands. Some printers respond only to the
first pair of commands and thereby become disabled when the RichTextbox control
sends the second pair. In that case, setting the vStartDoc argument to False
prevents the second pair of commands from being sent.

Visual Basic 5 Version of MSChart Control Available in Tools Directory
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For pre-release users of Visual Basic only:

A Visual Basic 5.0x version of the MSChart control is now included with Visual
Basic. If you need a Visual Basic 5 version of the Chart control, and you have
installed the pre-release version of the MSChart control, please overwrite the
pre-release version with the version contained in the Tools directory of the
Visual Basic CD.

Toolbar Control: Style Property Settings Changed
------------------------------------------------

The Style property settings for the Toolbar control have been changed. The help
topic for the property lists tbrTransparent and tbrRight as possible settings,
however these are not implemented in the current version. The actual possible
settings and descriptions are shown below:

  Constant      Value     Description
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  tbrStandard    0      (Default) Standard toolbar.

  tbrFlat        1      Flat. The borders of a button
                        dynamically appear when the cursor
                        hovers over the button.

Visual Basic Run-Time Error 720: Attempting to Add Anything Except a

Control to Controls Collection Causes Run-Time Error
----------------------------------------------------

Attempting to add an object that is not a control to the Controls collection
causes run-time error 720. You can only add Visual Basic intrinsic controls or
ActiveX controls to the collection. To reproduce:

1. Create a new Standard Exe. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add the following code:

        Private Sub Form_Load ()
           Controls.Add "Excel.Application", "MyExcelApp")
        End Sub

3. Run the exe.

Result: You get an error (720): Invalid class string.

Hierarchical FlexGrid Control: Correcting Errors Binding a Recordset to the

HFlexGrid
---------

If you receive the following error when trying to bind the Hierarchical FlexGrid
to an ADO Recordset object, "DataSource settings may be incorrect", try changing
some of the behavioral properties associated with the ADO Recordset Object or
Command. For example, change the CursorLocation property to adUseNone or
adUseClient.

Hierarchical FlexGrid Control: How to Change the Font of Individual Bands
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since the same font object is used for the entire grid object, you must create a
new font object to change the fonts of individual bands, rather than changing
the font directly.

For example, this way will not change the font for the individual band:

     MSHFlexGrid1.FontBand(1).Name = "Arial"

Since you are directly modifying the font object, this will change the fonts in
all of the bands to Arial.

To change an individual band, first create a new Font object, then assign that
Font object to the FontBand property:

    Dim ft As New StdFont
    ft.Name = "Arial"
    Set MSHFlexGrid1.FontBand(1) = ft

This will change just the band's font to Arial.

Hierarchical FlexGrid Control: Avoiding the display of duplicate headers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the Hierarchical FlexGrid control uses the first FixedRow in the
Hierarchical FlexGrid as a set of headers (which means it displays the names of
the fields bound to each column in this row). Since, by default, the HFlexGrid
control displays one FixedRow, if you enable the display of headers on Band 0,
it will appear as though the header is being duplicated twice. To avoid this,
set the FixedRow property to 0, or clear out the text values in the first
FixedRow using code.

ADO Data Control: FetchProgress and FetchComplete Events Not Implemented
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the reference topic for the ADO Data Control includes links to the
FetchProgress and FetchComplete events, the events are not implemented for the
control.

DataGrid: SizeMode and Size Properties Do Not Accept Value of 2

(dbgNumberOfColumns)
--------------------

The reference topics for the Split object's SizeMode and Size properties refer to
a non-existent property value of 2 (dbgNumberOfColumns). Please ignore this
value.

Controls: ImageList Control on Page Designer
--------------------------------------------

When using the ImageList control on a DHTML Page designer, images cannot be added
at design time. If you try to use the following code in an uncompiled .dll
project, you will get the run-time error: -2147418113 (8000ffff), "Method 'Add'
of object images failed".

    Private Sub DHTMLPage_Load()
       ImageList1.ListImages.Add , , LoadPicture("C:\Winnt\winnt.bmp")
    End Sub

However, the code will work when the .dll project is compiled.

MSComm Control: EOFEnable Property Doesn't Stop Data Input
----------------------------------------------------------

The EOFEnable property determines if the OnComm event occurs when an EOF
character is detected. Contrary to the documentation for the property, however,
input does not stop.

Treeview Control: Node Object's Visible Property is Read-Only
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Visible property of the Treeview control's Node object is a read-only
property. If the node is not visible, you can use the EnsureVisible method to
make it visible, as shown in the example:

    Private Sub Command1_Click()
       If Not TreeView1.Nodes(10).Visible Then
          TreeView1.Nodes(10).EnsureVisible
       End If
    End Sub

SysInfo Control: Constants Not Supported
----------------------------------------

The reference topics for the following events have lists of constants that
identify devices and device data.:

- DeviceArrival Event

- DeviceOtherEvent Event

- DeviceQueryRemove Event

- DeviceQueryRemoveFailed Event

- DeviceRemoveComplete Event

- DeviceRemovePending Event

Contrary to the documentation, however, these constants are not supported by the
events or the SysInfo control. The values associated with the constants listed
in the help topics are valid, but the constant names are not.

User Control: Binary Persistence of PropertyBag Data Causes Page Designer

to Fail
-------

The PropertyBag saves data in binary format. Due to a known problem with binary
persistence and the DHTML page designer, however, such data causes the page
designer and Visual Basic to fail. See Page Designer: Binary Persistence Issue
for more information.
