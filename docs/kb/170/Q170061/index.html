The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.01, 8.02 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article is taken from the Readme file included with the Outlook driver for
Microsoft Schedule+ 7.x.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Contents:

- Overview

- Supported Configurations/Platforms

- Known Issues

Overview
--------

This driver enables a Microsoft Schedule+ 7.x user to open a Microsoft Outlook
user's calendar in Schedule+ ("Schedule+ 7.x" is a general term referring to
Schedule+ 7.0, Schedule+ 7.5, and Schedule+ 95).

After the driver is installed, the Schedule+ user can open an Outlook user's
calendar (Open command, File menu, Open Other's Appointment Book submenu). The
Schedule+ user must have Read permission for the Outlook user's calendar, and
that calendar must be stored on the Exchange Server.

NOTE: The Schedule+ user can only read the Outlook user's Calendar, not add to or
edit it, regardless of the permissions granted by the Outlook user.

Supported Configurations/Platforms
----------------------------------

This driver works only on 32-bit versions of Microsoft Schedule+ 7.x (for Windows
95 and Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0). It does not work with the 16-bit version of
Schedule+ 7.x (for Windows 3.1 and 3.11).

Both the Schedule+ and Outlook users must be running Exchange Server.

Installing the Driver
---------------------

Computer requirements: x86 architecture

Operating system requirements: Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51, or 4.0 (32-bit)

Dependent programs: Schedule+ 7.x (32 bit)

To install the Microsoft Outlook 97 driver for Schedule+ 7.x:

1. Make sure the computer has Schedule+ 7.x installed.

2. If Schedule+ is running, click Exit and Log Off on the File menu.

3. Double-click Msoutl.exe. (located in the same folder as Schedule+ 7.x)

4. When asked if you want to continue, click Yes.

5. When the installation is complete, restart Schedule+.

Files installed:

- Msoutl32.dll

- Mssotubs.dll

- Msoutl.inf

- Unins351.reg

- Readme.txt

Removing the Driver
-------------------

To remove the Microsoft Outlook 97 driver for Schedule+ 7.x in Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4.0:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Outlook 97 Driver for Schedule+
  7.x and then click Add/Remove.

NOTE: Windows NT 3.51 users can remove the driver by running Unins351.reg and
then deleting Msoutl32.dll and Msostubs.dll. These files are located in the same
folder as Schedule+ 7.x.

Known Issues
------------

- All-day events in Outlook appear as appointments when viewed in Schedule+ 7.x
  using the Outlook Driver for Schedule+ 7.x.

- If Schedule+ 7.x is re-installed, then the driver will also need to be
  re-installed afterward.

- An Outlook user might share his or her Outlook Calendar with other users,
  then switch to using Schedule+ 7.x as the primary calendar. In this case,
  Schedule+ 7.x users who are using the Outlook Driver for Schedule+ 7.x to
  open that user's calendar will continue to open that user's Outlook calendar
  instead of that user's Schedule+ 7.x calendar. To solve this, the Outlook
  user needs to remove the permissions on his or her Outlook Calendar folder so
  that the Outlook Driver for Schedule+ 7.x will not open it.

- Outlook appointments with more than 32 KB of text in the Notes field will
  appear to have a blank Notes field when viewed in Schedule+ 7.x using the
  Outlook Driver for Schedule+ 7.x.
