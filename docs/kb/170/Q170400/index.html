The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be able to install and run some programs on a Windows NT Zero
Administration Kit (ZAK) client workstation, even though you should be
restricted from doing so. You may be able to do this by installing programs to
and running them from the folder defined in the TEMP user variable (the
temporary folder). In a ZAK client workstation, the default temporary folder is
C:\Temp.

CAUSE
=====

The temporary folder is not restricted on ZAK client workstations because many
programs, including Microsoft Office, do not function properly if the temporary
folder is restricted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, you can configure the policy file for the ZAK client
workstation to allow only specific programs to run. The policy file resides on
the ZAK server and can be modified by using the following steps:

1. Log on to the ZAK server (this is the primary domain controller for the
  network) as the domain administrator.

2. Start Policy Editor (Poledit.exe), and then open the Ntconfig.pol file in the
  following folder:

     %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts

3. Double-click the user icon for the ZAK client user, double-click System, and
  then double-click Restrictions. Click the Run Only Allowed Windows
  Applications check box to select it.

4. Click Show, click Add, type the executable file name of the program you want
  to allow the ZAK client user to run, and then click OK. Repeat this procedure
  for every program you want the user to be able to run.

  For example, to allow the ZAK client to run Microsoft Word, type "winword.exe"
  (without the quotation marks) as the allowed program. To determine the
  executable file names, view the shortcuts on the Start menu of the ZAK client
  in the Netapps folder on the ZAK server.


5. Click OK, and then click OK.

6. Save the file, and then quit Policy Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
