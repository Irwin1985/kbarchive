MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample File Locations
---------------------

If you choose to include Visual Basic samples in your MSDN setup, they are
installed to the directory:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
  Studio\MSDN98\98VS\1033\Samples\VB98.

If you choose not to include the Visual Basic samples in your MSDN setup, you can
find the Visual Basic samples on the MSDN CD at:

  D:\Samples\Vb98

NOTE: The drive letters mentioned above may vary on your system.

Visual Basic Sample: Biblio and Mouse Samples Omitted
-----------------------------------------------------

The Biblio sample program, found in the Visual Basic documentation table of
contents, is no longer included with the Visual Basic product. The Mouse sample,
mentioned in "Responding to Mouse and Keyboard Events" is also no longer
included with the product.

Visual Basic Samples: ChrtSamp Description
------------------------------------------

ChrtSamp is a new sample program included with Visual Basic that demonstrates the
major features of the MSChart control. If you have installed the Visual Basic
samples, the sample can be found in the following location on your hard disk:

  \\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
  Studio\Msdn98\98vs\1033\Samples\Vb98\ChrtSamp

If you have not installed the Visual Basic samples on your hard disk, the sample
can be found on the MSDN CD at the following location:

  Samples\Vb98\ChrtSamp

The sample uses an Excel spreadsheet to supply data for a chart. The sample also
allows you to display multi-series charts by clicking various buttons. Finally,
the sample demonstrates 3D features of the control by setting the ChartType
property to an appropriate value.

    File              Description
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Chrtsamp.vbp    The project file for the sample.

    Frmchart.frm    The main form for the sample.

    Frmchart.frx    Binary data for the form.

    Gas.xls         The Excel worksheet containing the data.

    Modchart.bas    Code module containing functions and procedures
                    for the sample.

To Run
------

Press F5 to run the sample. After all data has loaded, click on the "Chart Type"
to change the type. To see the three-dimensional features of the sample, click
the Chart Type combo box and select a 3-D chart type, such as 3dArea. While
holding down the CTRL key, right-click the chart, and use the cursor to change
the aspect of the chart.

Visual Basic Samples: CtlsAdd Sample: Controls.mdb Must Be Read/Write

Enabled on Hard Disk
--------------------

If you attempt to run the CtlsAdd samples from the MSDN CD, an error will occur
if you attempt to use the controls.mdb database found on the CD. Because
CtlCfg.vbp sample uses an Access database (controls.mdb) to store license key
information about controls, the database must be installed on a hard disk. Copy
the controls.mdb file to the hard disk and make it writable.

DHSHOWME.VBP Sample: You May Need to Reset the SourceFile Property For This

Sample to Work Correctly in Design Mode
---------------------------------------

If your Page Designer samples appear blank when you open them in design mode,
please reset the SourceFile property to reflect the location on your computer to
which the project's HTML files were installed. You must reset this property for
each designer in the project. Your sample should then work correctly.

To reset the SourceFile property for a designer, either type a path directly into
the SourceFile property in the Properties window, or select the Project
Properties icon from the toolbox, click Save as an External File, then click
Open and navigate to the correct .htm file.

PROPBAG.VBP Sample: Possible Error on Loading the Module for this Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Propbag.vbp references a module (Module1.bas) that is located in the default
installation directory for MSDN samples. If you move this sample to another
directory, you will receive an error when you open the project that the module
path is incorrect. To fix this, load the project without the module, then re-add
the module from the directory to which you installed your samples.

Running the IObjSafe Sample Application
---------------------------------------

Due to some late-breaking changes, the IObjSafe sample application (IObjSafe.vbp)
will not run properly unless you first make the following modifications:

Load the IObjSafe.vbp project file into the development environment.

Choose ucObjSafety Properties from the Project menu. On the Debugging tab, delete
the path and file name from the Start program text box.

Type the actual path and file name for IObjSafe.htm in the Start browser with URL
text box. The actual path may vary depending on your installation.

Choose Options from the Tools menu. On the General tab, choose the Break on
Unhandled Errors option button.

The application should now run properly.

An updated version of the IObjSafe sample application is available online at the
Microsoft Visual Basic samples page.

Obtaining Updated Versions of Sample Applications
-------------------------------------------------

Updated versions of many of the Visual Basic sample applications, as well as
additional samples not included on the CD, are available online at the Microsoft
Visual Basic samples page.
