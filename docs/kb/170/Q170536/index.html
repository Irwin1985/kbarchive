SUMMARY
=======

In DAO, using the Close method on a database opened with ODBC drivers does not
close the database; a cached connection remains idle before timing out. The
default duration of this timeout is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If your
application cannot accept the default behavior, you could control this time-out
period by customizing the ConnectionTimeout value in Windows registry setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can control the duration of ConnectionTimeout by creating a
ConnectionTimeout registry entry for Jet. In Windows NT 3.51, the type is called
"REG_DWORD"; in Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me (with DAO JET 3.6), Windows
2000, and Windows NT 4.0, the type is called "DWORD." "REG_DWORD" and "DWORD"
are different terms referring to the same thing, a 32-bit number.

Although Visual Basic includes the SaveSetting and GetSetting functions to save
and retrieve information from the registry, entries of types other than "REG_SZ"
("String" for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows NT4.0) are not
recognized. This article demonstrates how to use the registry API to set the DAO
ConnectionTimeout setting to 1, which closes the connection after the Close
method with only a one-second delay.

Sample Program
--------------

The following example has three CommandButton controls:

- Command1 creates a testing Registry entry
  "Software\MyApp\Jet\3.5\Engines\ODBC" under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE root key, and
  sets the ConnectionTimeOut value to 1.

- Command2 establishes the connection by opening the Pubs database.

- Command3 closes the database.

You can check the detailed connection information by executing SP_WHO stored
procedure on the SQL Server, then open/close database with/without the registry
entry created.

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic and choose "Standard EXE." Form1 is
  created by default.

2. Reference the Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library under Project, References menu
  items.

3. Add three CommandButtons, Command1, Command2, and Command3 to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1:

      Option Explicit
      Dim ws As Workspace
      Dim db As Database
      Dim TimeOutValue As Integer

      Private Sub CreateNewKey(sNewKeyName As String, lPredefinedKey As Long)
         Dim hNewKey As Long         'handle to the new key
         Dim lRetVal As Long         'result of the RegCreateKeyEx function

           lRetVal = RegCreateKeyEx(lPredefinedKey, sNewKeyName, 0&amp;, _
                 vbNullString, REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, _
                 0&amp;, hNewKey, lRetVal)
           RegCloseKey (hNewKey)
      End Sub

      Private Sub SetKeyValue(sKeyName As String, sValueName As String, _
           vValueSetting As Variant)

           lRetVal = RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, sKeyName, 0, _
                              KEY_ALL_ACCESS, hKey)
           lRetVal = RegSetValueExLong(hKey, sValueName, 0&amp;, _
                              REG_DWORD, vValueSetting, 4)
           RegCloseKey (hKey)
      End Sub

      Private Function QueryValue(sKeyName As String, sValueName As String) _

           Dim lRetVal As Long        'result of the API functions
           Dim hKey As Long           'handle of opened key
           Dim vValue As Variant      'setting of queried value

           lRetVal = RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, sKeyName, 0, _
                                  KEY_ALL_ACCESS, hKey)
           lRetVal = QueryValueEx(hKey, sValueName, vValue)
           If lRetVal = ERROR_NONE Then
               QueryValue = True
               TimeOutValue = vValue
           Else
               QueryValue = False
           End If
           RegCloseKey (hKey)
      End Function

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
           If QueryValue("Software\MyApp\Jet\3.5\Engines\ODBC", _
                  "ConnectionTimeout") Then
              If TimeOutValue &lt;&gt; 1 Then
               SetKeyValue "Software\MyApp\Jet\3.5\Engines\ODBC", _
                  "ConnectionTimeout", 1
              End If
            MsgBox "Test registry key already set"

              SetKeyValue "Software\MyApp\Jet\3.5\Engines\ODBC", _
                          "ConnectionTimeout", 1
              MsgBox "Test registry key created successfully"
           End If
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
           Dim strConnect As String

           DBEngine.IniPath = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MyApp\Jet\3.5"
           Set ws = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)
           strConnect = "ODBC;SERVER=MyServer;" &amp; _
                 "DRIVER={SQL  SERVER};DATABASE=pubs;UID=sa;PWD=;"
           Set db = ws.OpenDatabase("", False, False, strConnect)
           MsgBox "Connection established"
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command3_Click()
           If db Is Nothing Then
              MsgBox "Already Disconnected"
              Exit Sub
           End If

           db.Close
           ws.Close

           Dim Start As Long
           Start = Timer
           Do
             DBEngine.Idle dbFreeLocks
           DoEvents
           Loop While Timer &lt;= Start + 1
           MsgBox "Disconnected"
      End Sub

      Private Sub Form_Load()
           Command1.Caption = "Create/Set test registry entry"
           Command2.Caption = "Open database"
           Command3.Caption = "Close database"
      End Sub

5. From the Project menu, select Add Module, then click Module. Copy and paste
  the following code into the General Declarations section of Module1:

      Global Const REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE = 0
      Global TimeOut As Integer

        lrc = RegQueryValueExNULL(lhKey, szValueName, 0&amp;, lType, 0&amp;, cch)
        If lrc &lt;&gt; ERROR_NONE Then Error 5

        lrc = RegQueryValueExLong(lhKey, szValueName, 0&amp;, lType, _

        QueryValueEx = lrc
        Exit Function
      QueryValueExError:
        Resume QueryValueExExit
      End Function

6. Make sure to change your SERVER, UID, and PWD parameters in the connection
  string under Command2_Click.

7. Start the program or press the F5 key.

8. You can observe the connection information by executing the SP_WHO stored
  procedure at SQL Server. Compare the result before and after opening a
  database and before and after closing the database.

NOTE: Modify the Jet Engine version in the code, from 3.5 to a higher number, in
order to work with the required version of the Jet Engine.

Starting with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6, MDAC no longer
contains the following Jet components:

- Microsoft Jet
- Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider
- ODBC Desktop Database Drivers
