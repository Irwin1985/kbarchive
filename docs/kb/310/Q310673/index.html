-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Microsoft Windows 2000-based system, you may experience errors when you
attempt to open files that reside on a file share that was created by the
Microsoft SNA Server Shared Folders Gateway.

For example, if you use Notepad to access a text (.txt) file by using the
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) as follows

  \\&lt;server name\share name\path\file name&gt;.txt

you may receive the following error message:

  "Cannot open the \\&lt;server name\share name&gt;\test.txt file. Make sure a
  disk is in the drive you specified."

CAUSE
=====

In certain situations, Windows 2000 generates a FileInternalInformation request
when programs access files, and this request is then sent to the file server.

The Shared Folders Gateway in Microsoft SNA Server does not support the
FileInternalInformation information request type and returns an Invalid
Parameter response to the client system.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------+
| File name  | Date       | Time  | 
+---------------------------------+
| Sfgw.exe   | 10/26/2001 | 12:10 | 
+---------------------------------+
| Sfcapi.dll | 10/26/2001 | 12:09 | 
+---------------------------------+
| Sffsd.sys  | 10/26/2001 | 12:09 | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



NOTE: If this product was already installed on your computer when you purchased
it from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and you need this fix, please
call the Pay Per Incident number listed on the above Web site. If you contact
Microsoft to obtain this fix, and if it is determined that you only require the
fix you requested, no fee will be charged. However, if you request additional
technical support, and if your no-charge technical support period has expired,
or if you are not eligible for standard no-charge technical support, you may be
charged a non-refundable fee.
