SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply the Q299444 security roll-up fix, the Lexmark Printer driver may
stop responding (hang).

Q299444 stores the local procedure call (LPC) port data in the client thread and
makes sure a reply comes back via the same port. This results in a more secure
callback routine, but stops bidirectional communication with the Lexmark
software.

NOTE: This behavior can also occur with programs that use Distributed Component
Object Model (DCOM) technology or remote procedure call (RPC) technology, such
as Zone Labs' ZoneAlarm firewall software.
