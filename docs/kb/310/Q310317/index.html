MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing the Hotfix
---------------------

Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q310317.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  permissions.

3. On the site server, quit the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator
  console.

4. Run Q310317.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard.

Manually Installing the Hotfix:

To install the hotfix, follow these steps on the SMS site server:

1. Copy the contents of the hotfix (including the subfolders) to a local folder
  on the site servers and software-metering-role computers that you want to
  update.

2. Stop the SMS Site Component Manager and SMS Executive services on the SMS
  site servers on which you are installing the hotfix files.

3. Stop the SMS_LICENSE_SERVER service on all software-metering-role computers.

4. Copy the Remodbc.exe file from the hotfix installation &lt;Platform&gt;
  folder to the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder on the SMS site servers.

5. Copy the Remodbc.exe file from the hotfix installation &lt;Platform&gt;
  folder to the &lt;Drive:\Swmtr&gt; folder on software-metering-role computers
  (where &lt;Drive:\Swmtr&gt; is the drive and installation folder that was
  selected during the installation of Software Metering Server).

6. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager and SMS_LICENSE_SERVER services. The
  SMS Executive service is automatically restarted by Site Component Manager.
