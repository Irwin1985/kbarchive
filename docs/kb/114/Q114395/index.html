The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may receive Notice 40 error messages while performing a variety of
Microsoft Mail administrative tasks, most commonly when adding or removing
users. The Notice 40 message is difficult to troubleshoot because it can be
caused by several different problems ranging from corrupted files to
network incompatibility issues. In the section below, "Troubleshooting
Notice 40 Error Messages," many possible causes and workarounds are listed.


TROUBLESHOOTING NOTICE 40 ERROR MESSAGES
----------------------------------------


You may receive a Notice 40 error message when you import or export address
lists. The actual text of the Notice 40 message may be different, depending
on what administrative task has failed. For example, when you add a new
user, this text follows the Notice 40 error:

  Error in sending updated users and groups


If you get a Notice 40 error after attempting to delete a user, this text
follows:

  Deletion failed, messages queued to MTA


The following list contains possible causes and resolutions for Notice 40
error messages. The list is organized roughly by probability: the most
common causes of this error are listed first.


Problems Accessing the REQTRANS.GLB File
----------------------------------------


Problems accessing the REQTRANS.GLB file occur only if the user you are
adding or removing, or the postoffice you are working with, are taking part
in directory synchronization (Dir-Sync). Before troubleshooting any
further, try adding a new mail account without choosing to include the user
in Dir-Sync. If the Notice 40 error still occurs, troubleshoot the problem
further, using one of the sections below.

If the Notice 40 error seems to be related to Dir-Synch, the Mail
Administrator program is likely having problems opening and modifying the
REQTRANS.GLB file. This file stores the changes to the Postoffice Address
List.

Because of a network issue, the Mail Administrator program may not be able
to access the REQTRANS.GLB file. In general, network rights problems
anywhere in the postoffice can cause Notice 40 errors. (See the Postoffice
Directory or File Problems section below.) One specific case involves LAN
Manager for UNIX. This problem has been attributed to version 2.1a of NCR's
LAN Manager for UNIX. There is a patch available from NCR called "Microsoft
Mail Notice-40 Patch." If you are running LAN Manager for UNIX, regardless
of the hardware platform, it may be helpful to contact your hardware vendor
to see if they are aware of this problem.

NOTE: As a temporary resolution to this problem, you can disable all Dir-
Sync. You can update Postoffice Address Lists manually until you solve the
problem by using the External Mail program. However, the External Mail
program does not respect the Dir-Sync flag, so groups and users who are not
set up for Dir-Sync will be sent to other postoffices.


Low Conventional Memory
-----------------------


You may be able to avoid Notice 40 errors by increasing the amount of
conventional memory available to the Mail Administrator program. Try
loading fewer terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. If you are running the Mail
Administrator program from an MS-DOS command prompt under the Microsoft
Windows operating system, try running it before starting Windows.


Postoffice Directory or File Problems
-------------------------------------


Notice 40 errors can be caused if any of the following are true about your
postoffice files and directory structure:


- There are not enough network rights or permissions on the directory structure
  or its files. You should have full access to all the directories and files in
  the postoffice. If it is feasible, you can test for network rights problems
  by moving the postoffice directory structure to a local hard disk drive. If
  the problem recurs, you'll know it had nothing to do with network rights.

  NOTE: If you do move the postoffice, make sure you use the XCOPY command (with
  the /S, /V, and /E parameters) because many of the directories and files are
  empty but still need to exit for the postoffice to function correctly.

- There are missing postoffice directories. There are 19 subdirectories in the
  postoffice; they all need to exist even if they are empty. You can re-create
  the full postoffice directory structure by running Setup and choosing the
  Update an Existing Postoffice option. When asked if you want to update the
  database, choose Yes.

- There are missing MAI postoffice directories. When you create a new user in
  Admin, one of the processes is to send that new user a welcome message. This
  welcome message is created as a .MAI file and put into the appropriate
  directory under the MAI directory. The MAI directory contains 16
  subdirectories. If the Notice 40 is occurring with EVERY new user being
  created, then it is possible that none of these directories exist. If the
  Notice 40 occurs randomly, then it is possible that only one of the MAI
  subdirectories is missing.


- The Access files are corrupted. To check this, divide each Access file size
  by its associated record size:

     File          Record Size
     -------------------------
     ACCESS.GLB       586
     ACCESS2.GLB       69
     ACCESS3.GLB      512

Software Version Incongruities
------------------------------


Notice 40 error messages can be caused by running different versions of the
Mail software (for example, if you are running version 3.0 of the Mail
Administrator program on a version 2.1 postoffice).


Corrupted NME Files
-------------------


Notice 40 error messages may appear if either the ADMIN.NME or ADMINSHD.NME
file is corrupted. If you suspect this to be true, make a backup copy of
each of these files and then copy ADMIN.NME over ADMINSHD.NME.
