SUMMARY
=======

The VWRHOOK sample contains code for a HOOKS.DLL which can be used to execute
Viewer commands when an MCI file within a Viewer title finishes playing. The
dynamic link library (DLL) will work with MCI files which have been included in
the title with an {ewX MVMCI2, ViewerMCI...} statement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Vwrhook.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/sample9/1/WIN98/EN-US/vwrhook.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The DLL accomplishes this by installing a task specific WH_GETMESSAGE hook for
Viewer. When an MCI file in a Viewer title finishes playing, the hook procedure
will receive a MM_MCINOTIFY message. The hook procedure processes this message
by sending a command to Viewer using VwrCommand().

The DLL can be used by multiple instances of Viewer because it keeps track of
which instances of Viewer have called it.

To use HOOKS.DLL with a Viewer title, the title should register the functions
HookMCINotify() and ChangeCommand() in the [CONFIG] section of its .MVP file as
follows:

     RegisterRoutine(`hooks.dll', `HookMCINotify', `i=U')
     RegisterRoutine(`hooks.dll', `ChangeCommand', `i=S')

HookMCINotify() sets the hook. Its only parameter is the internal hwndApp
variable. It returns 1 if the hook was successfully installed, and 0 otherwise.
Typically, a title would call HookMCINotify(hwndApp) from the [CONFIG] section
of its .MVP file (after it has been registered).

ChangeCommand() is used to set the command which should be executed when any MCI
file in the title finishes playing. This command can be called from the [CONFIG]
section, as a topic entry command, as a group entry or exit command, or as a
hotspot command. Note that the HOOKS.DLL keeps track of only the most recent
command that was set. There is no default command, so this function must be
called if any command is to be executed when the hook procedure gets the
MM_MCINOTIFY message. This function should only be called after HookMCINotify()
has been called. ChangeCommand() takes as its parameter a string with the
command in it. The string can have multiple commands, separated by semicolons
(;). ChangeCommand() returns 1 if it was successful, and 0 otherwise.

A Viewer title can also register UnhookMCINotify() if it will specifically unhook
the hook. It should be registered as follows:

  RegisterRoutine(`hooks.dll', `UnhookMCINotify', `')

It does not take any parameters. If a title does not call this function,
HOOKS.DLL will unhook the hook when the instance of Viewer that called
HookMCINotify() terminates.

The sample also includes the files necessary to build a sample title which uses
the DLL.
