MORE INFORMATION
================

Each product suggestion is read by a member of our product feedback team,
classified for easy access, and routed to the product or service team to drive
Microsoft product and/or service improvements. Because we receive an abundance
of suggestions (over 69,000 suggestions a year!) we can't guarantee that each
request makes it into a final product or service. But we can tell you that each
suggestion has been received and is being reviewed by the team that is most
capable of addressing it.

All product or service suggestions received become the sole property of
Microsoft. Should a suggestion be implemented, Microsoft is under no obligation
to provide compensation.
