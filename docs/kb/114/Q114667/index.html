The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5x, 2.6a 
- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running a graph-dependent application that has been distributed
using the FoxPro for Macintosh Distribution Kit, the following FoxPro Graph
Wizard error message appears:

  Error Initializing OLE
  Press any key to Continue...

CAUSE
=====

Either MS Graph is not installed on the workstation, MS Graph has not been
initialized, or the Shared Code Manager, OLE Registration, Client, and Server
DLLs are not properly installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A FoxPro application can take advantage of graphing capabilities by making calls
through GENGRAPH.APP to communicate with MS Graph. GENGRAPH is a FoxPro
application provided with both FoxPro for Windows and FoxPro for Macintosh. Ms
Graph is an application included with Microsoft Word 5.x for the Macintosh,
Microsoft PowerPoint 3.x for the Macintosh, and Microsoft FoxPro for the
Macintosh.

While MS Graph is available in a run-time, distributable form on the Windows
platform, this is not the case on the Macintosh platform. In order for customers
of a FoxPro for Macintosh developer to successfully run a graph-dependent
application, those customers must already own a license for a product that
includes MS Graph for the Macintosh. These applications include Microsoft Word
5.0 for the Macintosh, Microsoft PowerPoint 3.0 for the Macintosh, and Microsoft
FoxPro for the Macintosh.

PowerPoint and FoxPro both install MS Graph in the System
Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph subfolder.

Microsoft Word installs the MS Graph in the Word Commands:Microsoft Graph
subfolder that is contained in the folder where Word is installed. Word also
puts an alias pointing to this location in the System
Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph subfolder. If the Word Setup program finds
MS Graph in the System Folder:Extensions:Microsoft:MSGraph subfolder, it does
not install MS Graph again in either location.

Although Microsoft Excel 4.0 for Macintosh does include graphing capabilities,
they are built into Microsoft Excel and not stored as a separate application.
Accessing the graphing capabilities of Microsoft Excel using FoxPro for
Macintosh involves the use of AppleScript. For more information about
AppleScript, see the "Installation and Macintosh Features Guide" included with
FoxPro. For information about scripting Microsoft Excel, see the Microsoft Excel
Software Development Kit (SDK).

RESOLUTION
==========

Once it has been established that the recipient of the FoxPro application has a
licensed copy of MS Graph installed on his or her Macintosh, the recipient may
need to run MS Graph once in order to register the application as an OLE
server.

To register MS Graph, double-click the MS Graph application, and then choose Yes
in the dialog box that states that MS Graph can be run only from within another
program. The Embedding Preferences file stored in the System Folder:Preferences
subfolder maintains this registration information.

In order for GENGRAPH to communicate with MS Graph, the Shared Code Manager
extension and the OLE Registration, Client, and Server documents must be
properly installed in the System Folder:Extensions subfolder. If the Setup
Wizard included with the FoxPro Distribution Kit was used and the Shared Code
option was selected during this process, these files are automatically installed
on the client workstation.
