SUMMARY
=======

********************************************************************

              MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIMULATOR  Version 5.0a
                     R E L E A S E    N O T E S

********************************************************************

This document contains important information about Microsoft Flight
Simulator. For more details on how to fly, read the Microsoft Flight
Simulator  Pilot's Handbook.

Memory Configuration:
* To run Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.0, you need a computer with at
least 530K of free conventional memory. If your computer does not
have an expanded memory manager, you need 560K of free conventional
memory. Flight Simulator informs you if your computer has
insufficient conventional memory and you cannot run the program.
Please refer to the troubleshooting section on the inside back cover
of the Flight Simulator Pilot's Handbook for tips on optimizing your
system performance.

* You can significantly enhance Flight Simulator's performance if you
configure your computer for expanded memory. Please refer to the
troubleshooting section on the inside back cover of the Flight
Simulator Pilot's Handbook or to your MS-DOS manual for instructions
on how to configure your computer for expanded memory.

* If you have no extended or expanded memory, or encounter out of
memory errors when running Flight Simulator, you can get better
performance if you turn off the sound option.  To do this, choose
Preferences from the Options menu, and then choose the Sound button.
In the Sound Preferences dialog box, choose No Sound Device from the
Sound Board list. When you turn off the sound option in the
Preferences dialog box, you can save additional conventional memory
and run more features.

Running Flight Simulator under Microsoft Windows:
* To run Flight Simulator under Windows, you must configure your
system for expanded memory.  If you run Flight Simulator under
Windows with extended memory it can cause memory errors and Windows
will terminate your Flight Simulator session.  Please refer to the
troubleshooting section on the inside back cover of the Flight
Simulator Pilot's Handbook or to your MS-DOS manual for instructions
on how to configure your computer for expanded memory.

* Loading Sound into Conventional Memory.
Flight Simulator loads sound files into XMS memory for storage and
quick playback.  Running under Windows can cause this memory to be
moved, resulting in noisy sounds or system crashes.  Windows informs
you of any system problems.  If this occurs, choose Preferences from
the Options menu, and then choose the Sound button.  In the Sound
Preferences dialog box, change the Use XMS Memory option to No.  When
you choose this option, Flight Simulator uses additional conventional
memory but resolves sound playback problems using XMS memory.

* If the aircraft in Flight Simulator are not flying smoothly under
Windows, run Flight Simulator directly from MS-DOS for a higher
display rate and smoother flying.

Running Flight Simulator under OS/2 2.1:
* For best system performance, make sure that you have the following
settings for your MS-DOS session:

 HW_TIMER = ON
 VERTICAL_RETRACE_EMULATION = OFF

* If you are running SVGA graphics, switching back to the desktop may
cause the screen not to refresh.  Press CTRL+ESC, and then press
ENTER to return to Flight Simulator.

* To run Flight Simulator in a window, select VGA 320x200 256 color
graphics mode.  Press ALT+HOME to switch between full screen and a
window.

Joystick Support:
* You cannot engage thrust reversers on the Learjet with the
joystick. You must press F2 to decrease your thrust and engage the
thrust reversers.

* A Colorado Spectrum Notebook Gameport driver is included for use
with the joystick.  You must add the line DEVICE=CS_STIK.FSO to your
FS5.INI file to use it.  NOTE:  You must also install the gameport
driver (NG.EXE from Colorado Spectrum) for your joystick to work.
For more information on installing the gameport software, see the
manufacturer's instructions.

SVGA Support:
* Orchid Fahrenheit (S3) and Thunder &amp; Lightning (Cirrus) cards. The
monitor selection must be correct in order for SVGA mode to function
on these cards.  Improper monitor selection can cause the display to
sync improperly resulting in an unstable picture, or a screen that
looks compressed.  For more information, refer to the documentation
included with your video board.

* VESA 1.2 Compatibility
 Some VESA 1.2 drivers are not fully implemented.  Function 7 and
modes 100h or 101h must be implemented in order for Flight Simulator
to work in SVGA mode. For more information, refer to the
documentation included with your video board. If Flight Simulator
does not display properly when you select SVGA using a VESA driver,
run Flight Simulator Setup again from the Flight Simulator directory
and select the VGA display option. Contact your video board
manufacturer for an updated VESA 1.2 compatible driver.

* VGA 320x200 Mode
 Flight Simulator 5.0a supports certain SVGA cards in the 320x200
mode. You can choose these cards from the list of video board
manufacturers when you select VGA 320x200 mode.  Although selecting a
specific manufacturer in this mode may increase your frame rate to 10
to 20 percent faster than the standard VGA 320x200 option, some
graphics cards may not work properly. If your screen flashes or does
not display at all, choose standard VGA when you select the VGA
320x200 mode.  VESA support on VGA 320x200 is equivalent to standard
VGA.

Sound Support:
* Using Flight Simulator under Microsoft Windows NT.
 PC Speaker sound causes problems under Windows NT.  Avoid these
problems by choosing No Sound Device from the Sound Board list when
you install Flight Simulator.

* Running Microsoft Flight Simulator under DR DOS.
 PC Speaker cockpit sounds cause problems under DR DOS.  Avoid these
problems by choosing No Sound Device from the Sound Board list when
you install Flight Simulator.  If you want to play sounds other than
cockpit sounds (plane crashes and wheel screeches), choose
Preferences from the Options menu, and then choose the Sound button.
In the Sound Preferences dialog box, turn off the Cockpit Sounds
check box. Then (and only then) choose PC Speaker from the Sound
Board list to turn the sound back on.

* The Sound Blaster Options
 The Sound Blaster/Sound Blaster Pro driver is designed for optimal
performance on any Sound Blaster or compatible sound card. If you
experience any problems with this driver, choose the Sound Blaster
Universal driver from the Sound Board list.  Make sure that the Sound
Blaster software is properly installed on your system before
selecting either of these drivers.  Without the proper Sound Blaster
software installation, Flight Simulator may crash when you try to
access the sound card.  For proper software installation
instructions, refer to the documentation included with your sound
card.

* Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum Sound Cards.
 It is very important to correctly install Media Vision's driver
(MVSOUND.SYS) before running Flight Simulator 5.0 with this sound
card. If the driver is not installed correctly, your system will
crash. or more information on installation, refer to the
documentation included with your sound card.  If you get poor sound
support from the Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum Sound Card, you may
need to disable DMA sharing with your card.  Again, for more
information, refer to the documentation included with your sound
card.  You should not set the Pro Audio Spectrum card to INT 1 or
your system may crash.

* Gravis Ultrasound Sound Card.
 The Gravis Ultrasound driver uses the SBOS or MEGAEM Sound Blaster
emulation.  Make sure that you have one of these drivers loaded
before running Flight Simulator.

* Loading Sound into XMS Memory.
 Flight Simulator loads sound files into XMS memory for storage and
quick playback. Certain memory configurations can cause this memory
to be moved, resulting in noisy sounds or system crashes.  If this
occurs, choose Preferences from the Options menu, and then choose the
Sound button. In the Sound Preferences dialog box, change the Use XMS
Memory option to No. When you select this option, Flight Simulator
uses additional conventional memory but resolves sound playback
problems using XMS memory.

Undocumented Features:
* ADF Radio Improvements.
 The ADF can be converted to a 5-digit ADF, tunable in 100 Hz
increments. Choose Preferences from the Options menu, and then choose
the Instrument button. In the Instrument Preferences dialog box,
choose the 100 Hz ADF Frequency Adjustability option. NDBs on .1
increments are common in Europe.

* Autopilot Improvement: One Keystroke Altitude Hold.
 Press CTRL+Z (instead of just Z) to activate the autopilot, turn on
altitude hold, and set the altitude to your current flight altitude.
All other autopilot settings are unaffected.

* EFIS VOR Tracking Improvement.
 Tracking altitude is now MSL rather than AGL.  This eliminates the
roller coaster effects as ground altitude changes under you, and lets
you find the path at the altimeter altitude you specified for the
EFIS altitude.
