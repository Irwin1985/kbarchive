If you are experiencing problems with BASIC's game port (or joystick)
routines, such as STICK or STRIG, this article provides information
that may help you to diagnose whether the symptom is the result of a
ROM BIOS problem. This information applies only if your computer has
an Intel 80286 or 80386 microprocessor chip.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50; to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for
MS-DOS; and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.

The way in which BASIC handles joystick commands (which include the
STICK function, STRIG function, and STRIG statement) depends on which
kind of Intel microprocessor chip the computer uses. If the computer
has an 8086/8088 or 80186/80188 microprocessor, the joystick commands
talk directly to the hardware without going through the BIOS. If the
computer has either an Intel 80286 or 80386 microprocessor, the
joystick commands are handled by going through BIOS interrupt 15 hex.
Because of errors in some BIOS joystick functions on some computers,
STICK or STRIG may not work at all, or may not work properly.

If your computer has an Intel 80286 or 80386 microprocessor chip, you
can use the code example below to determine if the problem you are
having is ROM BIOS related. The program accesses the game port by
directly calling INTERRUPT &amp;H15 with function &amp;H84, which is the BIOS
joystick routine. If the problem still occurs when calling the BIOS
joystick routine directly, then the problem is with the computer's
BIOS joystick function and not with BASIC's STICK or STRIG.

To access the BIOS joystick routines, you call interrupt &amp;H15 (21
decimal). The AH register should contain &amp;H84 (132 decimal) to
indicate the game port support function.

Register values prior to issuing interrupt &amp;H15 should be:

   AX = &amp;H8400    ' This puts &amp;H84 in the AH register.
   DX = 0 or 1

If DX = 0, this indicates to "read switch settings." If DX = 1, this
indicates "read resistive inputs."

Depending on the value of DX when you make the call, different
parameters will be returned by the interrupt. If DX = 1, then upon
returning from Interrupt &amp;H15, the registers will contain:

   AX = Port1 x coordinate
   BX = Port1 y coordinate
   CX = Port2 x coordinate
   DX = Port2 y coordinate

If DX = 1, then bits 4 - 7 are used to represent switches. The AX
register will contain the switch settings in bits 4 through 7. BX, CX,
and DX will be unchanged.

The following code example shows how to use the CALL INTERRUPT routine
to directly call the BIOS joystick routines. To compile the program,
use the following compile and link lines:

   BC joystick.bas ;
   LINK joystick ,,, QB.LIB ;   [For BASIC PDS 7.x use QBX.LIB ;]

To run this program in the QB.EXE or QBX.EXE environment, invoke QB or
QBX with the /L option (to load the QB.QLB or QBX.QLB Quick library).

JOYSTICK.BAS

'This code prints to the screen the values of AX, BX, CX, DX registers
'when interrupt &amp;H15, function &amp;H84 is called with given values in the
'DX register. This will allow you to observe the values
'corresponding to a specific action taken on a given device attached
'to either of the two game ports supported by an IBM or compatible.

'$INCLUDE 'QB.BI'     ' For BASIC PDS 7.x, use QBX.BI
DIM inregs AS RegType
DIM outregs AS RegType
inregs.ax = &amp;H8400          'puts &amp;H84 in AH register
DO
 inregs.dx = 1          '1 - read resistive inputs
 CALL INTERRUPT(&amp;H15, inregs, outregs)
 CLS
 LOCATE 16, 10: PRINT "RESISTIVE INPUTS: (STICK)"
 LOCATE 19, 20: PRINT "AX","BX","CX","DX"
 LOCATE 20, 20: PRINT  outregs.ax, outregs.bx, outregs.cx, outregs.dx

 inregs.dx = 0          '0 - read switch settings
 CALL INTERRUPT(&amp;H15, inregs, outregs)
 LOCATE 6, 10: PRINT "SWITCH SETTINGS: (TRIGGER)"
 LOCATE 9, 20: PRINT " AX"
 LOCATE 10,20: PRINT outregs.ax       'only bits 4 - 7 are important
LOOP WHILE INKEY$ = ""           'loop till any key is pressed
END

References:

Note: The INTERRUPT routine is considered an external subroutine by
the compiler. The routine is located in the files QB.LIB and QB.QLB
for QuickBASIC 4.x and in QBX.LIB and QBX.QLB in BASIC PDS 7.x.
Programs that execute a CALL INTERRUPT statement when compiled in the
QB.EXE editor require the presence of the QB.QLB or QBX.QLB Quick
library. This means that QB.EXE and QBX.EXE must be invoked with the
/L option, which automatically loads the correct Quick library.

Compiled programs that execute CALL INTERRUPT must be linked with the
file QB.LIB or QBX.LIB. More information on the use of CALL INTERRUPT
can be found under the CALL statement in the language reference manual
for each BASIC product. For more information on how to use CALL
INTERRUPT, query on the following words:

   CALL and INTERRUPT and application and note and QuickBASIC

For a description of the dependency of STICK and STRIG on computers
with certain Intel chips, query on the following:

   STICK and STRIG and BIOS

It may be possible to avoid the BIOS routines altogether by directly
accessing the game port using get and put functions. (BASIC's INP and
OUT statements cannot do this because of the speed required to read
the port.) It may be possible for you to write an assembly subroutine,
which could be called from BASIC to talk directly to the game port.
