The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft LINK for OS/2, version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When LINK is run under a Novell network, LINK may fail with the following
error:

  L1085: cannot open temporary file

In addition, the C version 6.0 Setup program (SETUP.EXE), the Programmer's
WorkBench (PWB) for MS-DOS versions 1.0 and 1.1, and real-mode CodeView (CV.EXE)
versions 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11 may all hang when run under some Novell NetWare
software.

These problems are directly related to the network software, but may be corrected
with a set of patch files available from Microsoft as an application note titled
"Network Patches for Utilities" (SC0381). Application notes can be obtained by
calling Microsoft Product Support Services.

This file has been removed from the Software Library but can be requested by
calling Microsoft Product Support Services.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is the complete text of the application note, which includes the
details of the problems mentioned above:

======================================================================

                   Network Patches for Utilities

======================================================================

The enclosed Network Patches for Microsoft Utilities disk contains the following
five files:

  README.DOC
  CVPATCH.EXE
  PWBPATCH.EXE
  SETUPFIX.EXE
  LINK.EXE

These files solve conflicts with certain network setups. Please be sure to make
backup copies of the original files.

Network Patch Files
-------------------

When run under certain network software, some Microsoft utilities may hang. The
enclosed patch files are designed to correct these problems for CodeView
versions 3.00, 3.10, and 3.11; the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.00
and 1.10; and the C 6.00 Setup program.

To install the patches, first copy the patch files (PWBPATCH.EXE, CVPATCH.EXE,
and SETUPFIX.EXE) to the directories where you have installed PWB, CodeView, and
Setup, respectively. Each patch assumes that the utility file it is to patch is
in the same directory.

Run SETUPFIX.EXE to patch SETUP.EXE. The original file will be saved as
SETUP.BAK. Run CVPATCH.EXE to patch CV.EXE. The original file will be saved as
CV.BAK. Run PWBPATCH.EXE to patch PWBED.EXE. The original file will be saved as
PWBED.BAK. The patched utilities should run free of network interference.

Microsoft LINK Version 5.13
---------------------------

LINK version 5.13 includes code to work around another problem that sometimes
occurs when running on a network. On large projects, the linker needs to open
some temporary files to work around DOS memory limitations. LINK version 5.10
(supplied with C 6.00) will sometimes fail in its attempts to open a temporary
file when run under certain network software.

The problem actually lies in the network software, not the linker. When the
network is loaded, the return value from an open call sometimes gets corrupted.
When the call fails, it is because an "Out of handles" error (EMFILE) is
returned as a "No such file or directory" error (ENOENT). If this occurs, LINK
5.10 halts with an "L1085: cannot open temporary file" error.

LINK 5.13 includes a change to correct for the above situation (even though the
problem is in the network software). When LINK version 5.13 receives an ENOENT
error on a failed open call, it will still try to free some file handles and
reopen the temporary file, regardless of the error returned.

To make the correction, locate LINK version 5.10 and replace it with LINK version
5.13 from the enclosed disk. Again, be sure to save a backup copy of the
original file (LINK 5.10).
