The "PWB Build Switch Reference" contains detailed descriptions and
examples for customizing PWB build switches.

The Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) can build various types of projects
based on the information contained in "build switches." These build
switches are interpreted by PWB in order to create a makefile for a
project. The switches are normally set for you by PWB for common types
of projects, but you may define your own build switches to handle an
advanced project where you require more control over the build
process. For example, customized build switches will allow you to
utilize different languages, to incorporate other tools into a
project, or to build new kinds of targets.

Although build switch customization is documented in the PWB online
help, the information is somewhat limited. Therefore, an application
note was created to cover the customization process in detail. The
title of this application note is "PWB Build Switch Reference" and it
can be obtained by calling Microsoft Product Support Services at (206)
637-7096.

The "PWB Build Switch Reference" can also be found in the Software/
Data Library (as file SW0330.ARC) by searching on the keyword SW0330,
the Q number of this article, or S12875. SW0330 was archived using the
PKware file-compression utility.

Note that the application note found in the Software/Data Library is
an ordinary text file, which lacks the typefaces and formatting of the
printed version that is available by calling Microsoft Product Support
Services. Because the printed application note is clearer and easier
to follow, it is highly recommended that you call for the printed
version, and that you use the downloaded version only as an interim
copy.

Also note that you normally DO NOT need to modify build switches just
to customize the compile and link operations -- this can generally be
done by selecting commands from the Options menu. By selecting options
from the Compile or LINK Options dialog boxes, the correct build
switches are automatically modified to contain the desired
information.
