SUMMARY
=======

Page 16-25 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Guide to
Programming" for Windows 3.0 and page 350 of the "Windows Software Development
Kit Guide to Programming" for Windows 3.1 state:

  Under the Windows standard mode and 386 enhanced mode memory configurations,
  there is a system-wide limit of 8192 global memory handles, only some of
  which are available to any given application.

With regard to standard mode, this statement is incorrect. The limit is 4096
global memory handles when Microsoft Windows runs in standard mode and 8192 when
Windows runs in enhanced mode. Standard mode uses two LDT entries for each
memory handle while enhanced mode uses one LDT entry for each memory handle.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each memory block has an associated handle that Windows and applications running
in the Windows environment use to access the block. The Intel 80286 or higher
microprocessor maintains records of each segment using a descriptor, which
describes the attributes of each memory block such as its base address, size,
attributes (read, write, execute), and privilege level. In enhanced mode, each
memory block has one handle and at least one descriptor. In standard mode, each
memory block has at least two descriptors. Because Windows and its applications
run in 16-bit protected mode, global memory blocks larger than 64K (the maximum
segment size in 16- bit protected mode) use several descriptors.

The architecture of the Intel CPUs requires that each descriptor table fit into
its own 64K segment. Because each descriptor is 8 bytes long, each descriptor
table can hold a maximum of 8192 descriptors (64K divided by 8 bytes equals 8K).
Therefore, each descriptor table can manage up to 8192 segments. For more
information, see the "386 DX Microprocessor Programmer's Reference Manual,"
(Intel Corporation).

Windows creates a global descriptor table (GDT) for the system, and one local
descriptor table (LDT) for itself and all applications running under Windows.
Because all applications use the same LDT, a maximum of 8192 descriptors are
available to Windows and applications. Enhanced mode can manage a maximum of
8192 segments because each segment requires one descriptor. Standard mode can
manage a maximum of 4096 segments because each segment requires two descriptors.
Because descriptors are used for code, data, and resource segments, the maximum
number of descriptors available for applications to use for global memory blocks
is considerably less than 8192 and 4096.

Windows does not provide a way to determine how many selectors are available for
a given application to use. All Windows API functions fail when there is not
enough free memory to satisfy a given request, or when there are not enough
descriptors available. Either way, Windows is unable to satisfy the
application's memory request. It is important that selectors be used with
deliberation because each Windows-based application must cooperate with other
Windows-based applications. Instead of allocating many small blocks from the
global heap, an application should allocate fewer blocks that are larger in
size. The application can then divide each larger memory block into pieces for
its own use.

If small memory blocks are required by the application, use the local
memory-management routines provided by Windows. A local handle does not impact
the selector limit at all because a local memory block is allocated inside a
global memory block. For example, the LocalAlloc() function allocates a memory
block from an application's or a dynamic-link library's (DLL's) local heap.

In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to employ a more sophisticated
memory-management scheme called multiple FAR heaps. This technique is useful if
the application requires a number of blocks of memory, say 100, and the total
number of bytes in each block is not above 64K. Chapter 18 (pages 602-617) of
"Windows 3.1 Power Programming Techniques", 2nd edition by Peter Norton and Paul
Yao, contains more details on this technique. In this chapter, Norton and Yao
state the steps necessary to perform local heap allocation in a dynamically
allocated segment. This chapter effectively describes the technique of using
multiple FAR heaps and also provides some sample code.

This technique involves four steps:

1. Globally allocate a block of memory with GlobalAlloc().

2. Lock the block of memory with GlobalLock().

3. Initialize the block of memory by calling LocalInit().

4. Modify the local memory-management routines so each updates the DS register
  to point to the new heap just before a call to a local memory- management
  routine. When access to the new heap is complete, immediately restore the DS
  register.

Overall, this technique uses fewer global handles and less memory overhead with
each call.
