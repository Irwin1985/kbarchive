The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may experience problems running Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in standard
mode. These problems include the following:

- Windows hanging at the logo screen

- Unrecoverable Application Errors (UAEs)

- Windows defaulting to real mode even when you type Win

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps may reduce problems running Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in
standard mode:

1. Ensure that the system has at least an 80286 processor and has enough memory
  to run in standard mode. You need between 384K to 512K of combined
  conventional and extended memory to run Windows in standard mode. You should
  have at least 128K free conventional memory and at least 192K free extended
  memory.

2. Verify that Windows can run in real mode. If so, you may have installed
  mouse, keyboard, video, or printer drivers designed for an earlier version of
  Windows. These drivers often prevent Windows from running in standard mode.
  Update to the proper Windows 3.00 driver. If Windows doesn't run in real or
  standard mode, you may have selected the wrong driver or computer type.
  Reinstall Windows.

3. Check your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files for TSRs
  (terminate-and-stay-resident programs), sufficient buffers, files, and
  environment space. For more information on troubleshooting the AUTOEXEC.BAT
  and CONFIG.SYS files, query on the following words:

  tshoot and AUTOEXEC.BAT

4. Verify that Windows 3.00 is correctly installed on the system by clicking the
  Setup icon from the Main group of Program Manager. Check that the correct
  keyboard, pointing device, video driver, and network were chosen during
  setup. Also check through the "Microsoft Windows Version 3.00 Hardware
  Compatibility List" to see if your computer requires special handling. If so,
  exit Windows and reinstall, using only minimum drivers (no mouse, no network,
  lower-resolution video driver) with the SETUP/I option.

5. Disable the autoswitching or autosensing feature on the video card if
  applicable.

6. Disable RAM shadowing if supported by the system.

7. Verify that you are using the correct version of DOS for the system. You
  should be using a DOS version 3.10 or later that was designed for the
  machine. For example, do NOT use IBM PC DOS on non-IBM computers and
  vice-versa.

8. Ensure that HIMEM loads successfully. If not, try ALL A20 handlers 1 to 8.
  The CONFIG.SYS file should include the /m:x switch on the DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS
  line, where x denotes a handler from 1 to 8. For example, if you are using a
  PS2, this line should read DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS /M:2. Some A20 handlers may
  lock up your computer. As a result, have a bootable DOS floppy disk available
  in case of problems.

9. Install Windows in a clean directory. Do not install Windows version 3.00
  over a 2.x version of Windows because some files and drivers may not get
  updated properly.

10. Confirm that you are using a recent system BIOS. If not, you may want to
  contact the manufacturer for an update.

11. Some 286 computers may not run Windows in standard mode unless you put the
  statement PadCodeSegments=1 in the [Standard] section of the SYSTEM.INI
  file.
