<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q68027
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 7.10
Operating System(s): OS/2
Keyword(s): ENDUSER | SR# S901116-141 S_PWB | mspl13_basic
Last Modified: 9-JAN-1991

If you are running under OS/2 and you have QuickBASIC Extended
(QBX.EXE from Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System) version
7.10 running in the DOS box, as well as Programmer's WorkBench
(PWB.EXE) in an OS/2 window, you may be unable to access BASIC help
files from QBX.EXE.

The error message

   File &lt;HelpFile&gt;.HLP not found -
   Correct your help path in options + set paths

will appear in QBX.EXE when you attempt to use the online help if
PWB.EXE is already using the same help files. Ending the PWB session
will allow QBX.EXE to use the BASIC help files.

Note: PWB does not need to have open the same help screen as QBX.EXE
for this error to occur.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) version 7.10 for MS OS/2. A workaround is
given below.

If you have PWB configured to use the BASIC help files, then while
running it in protected mode, the BASIC help files cannot be accessed
from QBX.EXE. It does not matter in what order you start the programs;
PWB.EXE can access the help files, and QBX.EXE cannot.

The following error message is misleading:

   File &lt;HelpFile&gt;.HLP not found - ...

In the test performed, the help file existed, the HELPFILES
environment variable was set correctly, and the help files path under
the Options menu within QBX.EXE was set correctly.

Workaround
----------

Make two copies of the help files on your hard drive and set the help
files path in PWB.EXE and QBX.EXE, each to a different set of help
files. Make sure that the help files are not in the same directory as
either PWB.EXE or QBX.EXE. In this situation, the two programs will
not conflict with one another.
