SUMMARY
=======

The Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver for Microsoft
Windows 3.0 supports both the HP DeskJet 500 and HP DeskJet PLUS printers. This
printer driver is also completely compatible with the HP DeskJet printer, but
the print speed is slower. The print quality is the same for all three HP
DeskJet printers.

The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver can be obtained from HP's fulfillment
center (StarPack). The driver is free if you own an HP DeskJet 500 (the serial
number of the printer must be provided) or can be purchased.

NOTE: This driver can only be obtained from HP. Microsoft does not distribute
this driver due to licensing agreements.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver incorporates the IntelliFont Scalable
Outline Font system and includes three scalable typefaces from the HP MasterType
Library: CG Times, Courier, and Univers. It can also be used with additional
MasterType Library scalable typefaces.

The IntelliFont type scaling technology scales and rasterizes the HP MasterType
Library format typefaces on your computer. It has been built directly into the
HP DeskJet 500 printer driver so you do not need HP Type Director 2.0 to use the
scalable HP MasterType Library typefaces. If you have previously installed any
HP MasterType Library typefaces with HP Type Director 2.0, you need to reinstall
these typefaces by using the HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver.

Information for installing HP MasterType Library format typefaces is available by
choosing Troubleshooting from the Help menu in the HP DeskJet 500 Scalable On...
dialog box.

NOTE: The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver does not support internal
printer fonts, font cartridges, or soft fonts. To access these fonts, use the HP
DeskJet Family printer driver.

The HP Deskjet 500 does not physically print graphics in landscape mode. Instead,
it sends the graphic out in portrait mode and rotates it to appear in landscape
mode.

The HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver requires approximately 1 MB of free
disk space for installation of the driver and the three printer fonts that come
with it (Courier, CG Times, and Universe).

To use the HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Printer Driver for Microsoft Windows 3.0, do
the following through the Windows Control Panel:

1. Install the driver and its support files on your hard disk.

2. Select printer settings.

3. Install printer fonts.

4. Create screen fonts (optional).

5. Activate your printer.

For information on installing unlisted printer drivers, please refer to pages
158-174, "Installing a Printer," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

The HP products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
