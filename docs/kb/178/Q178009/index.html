The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested

AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows NT, a domain is uniquely identified by both a NetBIOS name and by a
Security Identifier (SID). Most Access Control Lists (ACLs) and other security
features of Windows NT identify the domain by a SID; therefore, it is possible
to change the name of the domain with little disruption to network services.

The following procedure describes how to safely rename a Windows NT domain. This
will work for a single domain, or for an accounts domain or resource domain in a
network using the master domain model.

Please read this article in its entirety before attempting to rename your domain.
Some BackOffice products are adversely affected by renaming a domain; these
products are detailed later in this article.

Microsoft cannot guarantee that any third-party software that is installed will
function after changing the domain name. You should work with third-party
application vendors to ensure you understand how their product will react to a
domain name change.

Microsoft strongly recommends that you thoroughly test, outside of a production
environment, the effects of renaming your domain, before you actually change the
domain name on your production computers. This article does not attempt to
address every issue that might arise as a consequence of renaming your domain.

Use this procedure at your own risk.

Important notes:

- Do not install any primary domain controller (PDC) or backup domain
  controller (BDC) during this procedure, under either the old or new domain
  name.

- Do not promote any BDC to PDC during this procedure.

- This procedure should only be undertaken during a time when ALL network
  services related to this domain can be disrupted. All clients should log off
  and remain logged off until the rename is complete and all computers involved
  have been restarted.

- Perform a full backup on all computers involved immediately before beginning
  this process.

- Create separate, updated Emergency Repair Disks for each computer involved
  immediately before and after the update.

- Have a copy of the Windows NT Server compact disc, the latest service pack,
  and Windows NT boot disks (appropriate to your version of Windows NT)
  available during the procedure.

- The NETDOM utility in the Windows NT Server Resource Kit, Supplement 2, can
  be used to change the domain name remotely on some computers, preventing a
  visit to each computer involved.



MORE INFORMATION
================

To change a domain name, follow these steps:

1. Document and then break all trust relationships between the domain whose name
  you will be changing and all other domains. Be sure to remove the trust entry
  on both sides of the trust (in User Manager for Domains for both domains in
  the trust).

2. Stop all BackOffice services such as Microsoft Exchange Server, SQL Server,
  and Internet Information Server. Set startup to manual on all these services.

3. Change the domain name on the PDC.

4. Restart the PDC. This will cause the &lt;1Bh&gt; entry for the new domain to
  appear in the WINS server.

5. If you are using WINS for NetBIOS over TCP/IP name resolution, force
  replication from the PDC's primary WINS server to all other WINS servers to
  propagate the &lt;1Bh&gt; entry for the new domain. Name resolution to the
  PDC is necessary for each BDC to successfully change to the new domain name.
  If you are using TCP/IP without using WINS, create an LMHOSTS file with a
  &lt;1Bh&gt; entry for the new domain and put it on each BDC.

6. On each BDC, change the domain name and restart. The restart is necessary for
  the BDC to correctly register its &lt;1Ch&gt; entry with WINS.

  For additional information about what to do if the BDC refuses the domain name
  change, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139471 Unable to Change Domain Name of Windows NT BDC

7. Force replication from all WINS servers to propagate the &lt;1Ch&gt; entry.

8. Re-establish the trust relationships. Using Server Manager, synchronize both
  domains involved in each trust.

9. In the Services tool in Control Panel, re-enter the service account for each
  of the BackOffice services that were stopped in step 2. Pick the account by
  using the Startup button rather than typing in the account name. Set the
  services back to Automatic startup, if appropriate. Restart the services in
  the correct order.

10. Make any necessary service-specific changes, as detailed elsewhere in this
  article.

11. Change the domain name on each member server or workstation. For downlevel
  clients such as Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups, change the workgroup
  name to the new domain name.

12. Synchronize the entire domain.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter errors on any of the BDCs after the name change is completed,
the most likely causes will be either name resolution or accounts database
synchronization problems. The first thing you should do to troubleshoot is to
open Server Manager on the computer that has problems and synchronize it with
the PDC. For name resolution issues, make sure that WINS has replicated or that
your LMHOSTS files are correct.

You may encounter some errors in batch files and so on, with the old domain name
embedded. For this reason, you should check all such files. They are likely to
be found in the NETLOGON share on your domain controllers, referenced by the
Scheduler service where it is installed, and in any other scripting or
automation tools that you use.

You can find out more information about specific error events by searching the
Microsoft Knowledge Base for "event id XXXX" where XXXX is the event id number
of the error event. The Microsoft Knowledge Base is available on the World Wide
Web at:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/support

If you encounter any problems after the domain name change, they are likely
related to the name change, especially if you see any of the following errors:

  Network name not found

-or-

  Error 53

Typically, these are name resolution issues that are specific to one computer.
Check for the COMPUTERNAME&lt;00h&gt;, COMPUTERNAME&lt;03h&gt;, and
COMPUTERNAME&lt;20h&gt; entries in WINS, and replicate if necessary.

  A domain controller for this domain could not be found.

-or-

  Unable to contact the domain controller for this domain.

Typically, these are name resolution issues specific to the domain. Look for the
DOMAIN&lt;1Bh&gt; and DOMAIN&lt;1Ch&gt; entries in WINS, and replicate if
necessary.

  The trust relationship failed.

Typically, this is either a trust relationship with another domain that was not
re-established, or an invalid machine account. Reestablish the trust, or delete
and re-create the machine account for the computer and remove and re-add the
computer to the domain.

Possible Side Effects of a Domain Name Change
---------------------------------------------

- Service accounts are stored textually, not as SIDs, in the Service Control
  Manager database. Therefore, any services, on any computer, that use domain
  user accounts as their service account will have to be manually adjusted. The
  Sc.exe utility from the Windows NT Server Resource Kit may be useful for
  making this change on remote computers.

- If you are using integrated security in SQL Server, you will need to reset
  the "Default Domain" field in SQL Security Manager. Additionally, if the
  users are not part of the "Default Domain" you may need to remove and re-add
  users and groups from the renamed domain or local groups containing groups
  from the renamed domain.

- Microsoft Exchange Server service accounts will need to be reassociated with
  the new domain name, as described earlier. Additionally, in the Exchange
  Administrator program, select Tools, select Options, and then click the
  Permissions tab, you will need to change the default Windows NT domain name
  to the new domain name.

- Security settings on all Exchange Server public folders will be lost. Before
  renaming the domain, use the command line utility Pfadmin.exe to export the
  public folder security settings to a text file to make reconstruction of the
  permissions easier. This utility can be downloaded as part of the Microsoft
  Exchange Server Resource Kit from the following Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/servers


- If Systems Management Server primary or secondary sites exist in the domain
  that is being renamed, Systems Management Server will have to be uninstalled
  and then reinstalled with the new domain name. You will not be able to
  restore the existing Systems Management Server database after reinstallation;
  you will have to start with a clean database.

- If the domain being renamed is part of an Systems Management Server site but
  has no primary or secondary sites located in it (only logon servers and
  clients), the domain should be removed from the site prior to the name change
  and added back into the site after the change. Please refer to the Systems
  Management Server Installation and Configuration Manual, Chapter 3, "Adding
  Domains, Servers, and Clients."

- If you are running Internet Information Server, you may need to change the
  account specified in virtual paths.
