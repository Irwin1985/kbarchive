The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows 
- Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 97 Deluxe for Windows 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft Encarta 97 Encyclopedia for Windows on a
computer running Microsoft Windows 95/98, the Setup program may quit, and you
may receive the following error message:

  Could not Start Another Application During Setup. Run Setup Again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the hardware or software of the IDE CD-ROM drive is
not properly configured. This can occur for any of the following reasons:

- The CD-ROM drive is not ATAPI 1.2 compliant.

- The CD-ROM drive is slaved to the hard disk on a single IDE channel.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods:

Install Ios.vxd Update (Windows 95 only)
----------------------------------------

There is a problem in the Ios.vxd file that may cause excessive seeks on data
requests from the CD-ROM drive if your computer is configured to use
protected-mode IDE drivers and the IDE CD-ROM drive is configured as the slave
device on an IDE channel. Microsoft has released an updated version of the
Ios.vxd file that corrects this problem.

NOTE: Microsoft Windows 98 includes the updated version of the Ios.vxd file.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Iosupd.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/tool_k/1.0/W95/EN-US/Iosupd.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To install the updated Ios.vxd file:

1. Download the Iosupd.exe file to an empty folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Iosupd.exe file that you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the updated Ios.vxd file.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Enable Real-Mode Drivers and Disable Protected-Mode Drivers
-----------------------------------------------------------

CAUTION: Although this method can resolve the issue, it may also cause problems
when you use other Windows programs. If you encounter problems with other
Windows programs, undo these changes and then restart the computer.

If the above method does not resolve the issue or if you are using Windows 98,
configure the computer to use real-mode MS-DOS drivers for the CD-ROM drive, and
then disable the protected-mode Windows drivers for the IDE channel that
controls the CD-ROM drive. To do this:

1. Install or enable real-mode CD-ROM drivers on your computer. For more
  information about how to obtain, install, or configure real-mode CD-ROM
  drivers, consult the documentation included with the CD-ROM drive, or contact
  the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive.

2. Disable the protected-mode IDE (Hard Disk) controller that controls the
  CD-ROM drive in Windows. To do this:

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click System.

  c. On the Device Manager tab, click the plus sign (+) next to Hard Disk
     Controllers to expand the branch.

  d. Click Secondary IDE Controller, and then click Properties.

     If Secondary IDE Controller is not listed, then click the second Standard
     IDE Controller, and then click Properties.

  e. On the General tab, click to clear the Original Configuration (Current)
     check box, or click to select the Disable In This Hardware Profile check
     box, and then click OK.

  f. Click Close.

  g. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

3. Contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive to inquire if you need to
  install a firmware update to bring your CD-ROM drive into full compliance
  with the ATAPI 1.2 specification.

4. Contact your hardware manufacturer for more information about how to
  troubleshoot the IDE hardware configuration on your computer.
