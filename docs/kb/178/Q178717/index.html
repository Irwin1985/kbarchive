-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The primary documentation for both the Microsoft Excel and Text ODBC drivers is
the Microsoft Desktop Database Drivers Help file, invoked from the Help buttons
under ODBC Administrator. This article is intended to elaborate on the
functionality of both the Excel driver and the Text driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Excel Driver Characteristics
----------------------------

- Reading:
  To use the ODBC catalog functions, an Excel table must have data in it.

  The Excel driver supports Excel versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0/7.0, and 97. Column
  names, if present, must be in the first row. Excel 3.0, 5.0, and 97 file
  formats must have a database range defined.

- Writing:
  When creating a table, the driver will create:

   - A 3.0 version if the version of the data source through which the
     connection was made is "Excel" (that is, Excel 3.0/4.0).

   - A worksheet in the workbook to which it is connected if the version of the
     data source was "Excel 5.0/7.0" or "Excel 97".

- Concurrency:
  By default, all tables are opened read-only. The user must explicitly choose
  to open exclusively by clicking to clear the Read Only check box in Excel
  Setup.

- Maximum column name length:
  Column names over 64 characters will produce an error.

- Delimited column names:
  The Excel driver will allow column names to contain any valid Excel
  characters, including spaces. Delimited Identifiers will have to be used in
  this case. Do not use an exclamation point character (!) in a column name,
  because it has a special meaning in Excel; if a column name contains an
  exclamation point, the Excel IISAM will internally convert it to a dollar
  sign ($) character.

- Driver-generated column names:
  Unspecified (blank) column names will be replaced with driver-generated names
  (for example, Col1 for column 1, and so on).

Excel Driver Limitations
------------------------

- Inserting into table:
  Applications that want to use the Save As option for Excel data would issue a
  CREATE TABLE statement for the new table and then do subsequent INSERT
  operations into the new table. INSERT statements result in an append to the
  table. No other operations can be done on the table until it is closed and
  reopened the first time. After the table is closed the first time, no
  subsequent inserts can be done.

- Unsupported SQL:
  The driver will not support DELETE, UPDATE, or ALTER TABLE statements. While
  it is possible to update values, DELETE statements will not remove a row from
  a table based on an Excel spreadsheet. These operations are not supported.
  Basically, you can only append (insert) to a table.

- Treatment of zero-length strings:
  Because the underlying data format doesn't have any way to differentiate
  between an empty string and NULL data, a query with a search condition
  containing an empty string will not match any empty strings in the table.
  This is because the empty string is treated as a NULL in this case, and NULL
  never matches anything (not even another NULL).

Text Driver Limitations
-----------------------

- No HTML support

- Unsupported SQL:
  The driver does not support DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, or ALTER
  TABLE statements.

- Maximum length of a text column recognized by "Guess":
  The Guess functionality of the Text driver only works on Text columns that are
  less than 64,513 bytes.

- Treatment of zero-length strings:
  Because the underlying data format doesn't have any way to differentiate
  between an empty string and NULL data, a query with a search condition
  containing an empty string will not match any empty strings in the table.
  This is because the empty string is treated as a NULL in this case, and NULL
  never matches anything (not even another NULL).

Additional query words: col colum
