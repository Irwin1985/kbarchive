IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

When you save a document in Word as a WordPerfect file, by default, Word assigns
the "doc" file extension to the saved file. It is possible to change the default
file extension Word assigns to saved WordPerfect files.

Starting with WordPerfect 6.x, the default file extension when saving files from
WordPerfect is "wpd." To make it easier to convert your file back to
WordPerfect, you may want to change the default file extension Word uses when
you save a document in WordPerfect format.

This article details how to customize Word so files saved in WordPerfect format
are saved with the .wpd extension (or another other desired extension) by
default.

NOTE: The WordPerfect 6.x converter provided in Word is an import only converter.
You cannot save from Word as a WordPerfect 6.x (or later) file. You must use the
WordPerfect 5.x converter to save a Word document as a WordPerfect file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

When the WordPerfect converters are installed, the default file extension of
"doc" is set in the Windows Registry as the save extension for WordPerfect
documents. However, you can change the default save extension by modifying the
Windows Registry.

To change the default file extensions for saving WordPerfect documents, follow
these steps:

1. Quit Word and all other Windows applications.

2. On the Start menu, click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "RegEdit" (without the quotation marks) and then click
  OK.

4. In the Registry Editor, open the following Export registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text
     Converters\Export

  -or-

  You may find the Export key at the following location in the registry:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Text
     Converters\Export

  Word provides the following WordPerfect registry keys in the Export folder for
  saving (exporting) WordPerfect documents.

     Key Name          WordPerfect Conversion Name
     ------------------------------------------------------

     WrdPrfctDat       WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 Secondary File

     WrdPrfctDat50     WordPerfect 5.0 Secondary File

     WrdPrfctDOS50     WordPerfect 5.0

     WrdPrfctDOS51     WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS

     WrdPrfctWin       WordPerfect 5.x for Windows

5. Click to select the desired key name you want to change the default file name
  extension for.

  For example, if you save your documents as WordPerfect 5.x for Windows, and
  you want those files to be saved with the .wpd extension, click to select the
  WrdPrfctWin key.

6. In the desired key, click to select Extensions.

7. On the Edit menu, click Modify.

8. In the Value Data box, delete the current extension and then type WPD (or any
  other file name extension that you want to save your WordPerfect files with),
  and then click OK.

9. On the Registry menu, click Exit.

After you restart Word and save your document as WordPerfect, your document will
be saved with the default extension you specified.

NOTE: When you save your document, if you type a file name with an extension (for
example, Filename.doc), Word will not assign the default file extension you
specified, but rather Word will save the file with the extension you typed when
you saved the file.
