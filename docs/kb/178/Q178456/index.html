SUMMARY
=======

Volume.exe is a self-extracting compressed file that contains a sample project
demonstrating how to set the volume and microphone levels using Visual Basic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Volume.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/file/1/WIN98/EN-US/Volume.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After downloading and running the self-extracting file, the following files are
copied to the Volume Level Project directory on your hard drive:

 Form1.frm    - the main form in the project
 Module1.bas  - the module containing the function and type declarations.
 Project1.vbp - the project file
 Project1.vbw - the project workspace file
 Readme.txt   - you are currently reading this file.

To set these microphone and volume levels from Visual Basic, use the following
Windows API functions:

- GlobalAlloc - allocates the specified number of bytes from the heap.

- GlobalLock - locks a global memory object and returns a pointer to the first
  byte of the object's memory block. The memory block associated with a locked
  memory object cannot be moved or discarded.

- GlobalFree - frees the specified global memory object and invalidates its
  handle.

- mixerClose - closes the specified mixer device.

- mixerGetControlDetails - retrieves details about a single control associated
  with an audio line.

- mixerGetDevCaps - queries a specified mixer device to determine its
  capabilities.

- mixerGetID - retrieves the device identifier for a mixer device associated
  with a specified device handle.

- mixerGetLineControls - retrieves one or more controls associated with an
  audio line.

- mixerGetLineInfo - retrieves information about a specific line of a mixer
  device.

- mixerGetNumDevs - retrieves the number of mixer devices present in the
  system.

- mixerMessage - sends a custom mixer driver message directly to a mixer
  driver.

- mixerOpen - opens a specified mixer device and ensures that the device will
  not be removed until the application closes the handle.

- mixerSetControlDetails - sets properties of a single control associated with
  an audio line.

The next section shows how to create a sample project that uses these functions
to set the volume and microphone levels.

Create the Sample Project
-------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add two command buttons, two text boxes, and two labels to Form1.

3. Add a Module to the project by completing the following steps:

   - From the Project menu, click Add module. The Add Module dialog box
     appears.

   - From the New tab, choose Module and click OK. A new module is added to
     your project.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of Module1:

6. On the Run menu, click Start or press the F5 key to start the program.
  Minimize the Visual Basic IDE so all that appears on your display is Form1.
  Maximize the Volume Level program in the Task bar. Arrange Form1 and the
  Volume Level program so both programs are visible.

7. Enter a value between the minimum and maximum values shown in one or both
  text boxes and click one of the command buttons in Form1. Note that the
  corresponding slider in the Volume Level program is adjusted to your
  specified level.
