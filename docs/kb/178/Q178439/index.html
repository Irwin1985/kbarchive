MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 18: Web Site Returns Error Message
---------------------------------------

Page 18, paragraph 2, Web address:

Change the link for the Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility List to:

http://www.microsoft.com/isapi/hwtest/hcl.idc

If this Web site has changed, please navigate to it from the Microsoft Home
page:

http://www.microsoft.com


Page 26: Correction For First Bulleted Item
-------------------------------------------

On page 26, the first bullet point should be corrected as follows.

Change:
"Choose to create a partition of 4 GB or less, then complete the installation.
After you finish installing Windows NT, log on as Administrator and start Disk
Administrator. You can then use Disk Administrator to extend the NTFS partition.
Extending an NTFS partition allows you to add unused disk space to the
partition."

To:
"After you finish installing Windows NT, log on as Administrator and start Disk
Administrator. You can then use Disk Administrator to create an NTFS partition
the size needed. If you have already created an NTFS partition and wish to
increase the size, you will need to remove the existing partition then create a
new partition of the desired size."


Page 56: Change "Server Operators" to "Account Operators"
---------------------------------------------------------

In the first Note on page 56, change Server Operators to Account Operators.
Administrators and Account Operators have the Add Workstation to Domain user
right by default.

Change:
"...a user account that has been granted the Add Workstations to Domain user
right (Administrators and Server Operators have this right by default) and..."

To:
"...a user account that has been granted the Add Workstations to Domain user
right (Administrators and Account Operators have this right by default) and..."


Pages 365 and 367: Changes To Review Question And Answer #3
-----------------------------------------------------------

Change the question on page 365, and the question and answer on page 367, to
read:

3. Your computer running Windows NT Server runs TCP/IP as its primary protocol.
The server also has NWLink installed, for the sole purpose of hosting
connections from NetWare clients. How would you optimize the bindings for the
network?

Examine the Workstation bindings to verify that TCP/IP is listed first. Disable
the binding between the Workstation service and NWLink, because the workstation
will never need to establish connections over NWLink.


Page 558: Change "system partition" To "boot partition"
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 558, in the first paragraph under the "Installing the Administration
Tools on Windows NT Workstation" heading, change "system partition" to "boot
partition".

Change:
"The administration tools are installed in the systemroot\System 32 folder on the
computer's system partition."

To:
"The administration tools are installed in the systemroot\System 32 folder on the
computer's boot partition."


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
