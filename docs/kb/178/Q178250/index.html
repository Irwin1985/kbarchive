Quit All Unnecessary Programs

  completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Safe Mode Command
  Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

  the SHIFT key for the duration of Windows startup. This prevents any programs
  from loading automatically at startup.

3. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.
