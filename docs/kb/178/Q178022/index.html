The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1, 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a program issues a synchronous NetBIOS SEND (SEND_WAIT) command using
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) on a Windows 95- based
computer, the command immediately returns indicating successful completion, even
if the computer to which the command is sent does not receive the data at the
NetBIOS layer. Specifically, the SEND command may be completed even if the
recipient does not post a NetBIOS RECEIVE Network Control Block (NCB).

This may be a problem if the sending program terminates the session immediately
after the synchronous SEND command is completed. If the recipient computer posts
a NetBIOS RECEIVE NCB after it acknowledges the TCP/IP data, the sent data may
no longer be available to be received.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft TCP/IP protocol included with Windows 95 acknowledges the receipt
of NetBIOS data before the data is received at the NetBIOS layer, even if a
NetBIOS RECEIVE NCB has not been posted.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design. However, the behavior of the NCBSENDWAIT command
over TCP/IP is inconsistent with the behavior of the NCBSENDWAIT command over
other protocols included with Windows 95 (such as Internetwork Packet
Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange [IPX/SPX]- compatible protocol and NetBIOS
Enhanced User Interface [NetBEUI] protocol). With other protocols, the
NCBSENDWAIT command does not return until the recipient receives the data at the
NetBIOS layer.

This behavior may be undesirable if a program sends NetBIOS data, then terminates
as soon as the SEND command is returned. Instead, if the program posts a NetBIOS
RECEIVE command and waits for the recipient to complete the receive, this
behavior has no adverse impact.
