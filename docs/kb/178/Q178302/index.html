CAUSE
=====

When certain virus checking programs are installed, they add various File System
Filters as devices. These devices are enabled automatically (or when the server
is started) and prevent JET 97 (ESE), the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
database, from installing and functioning correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround that is presented below will allow the setup program complete the
upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. However, to ensure that
Microsoft Exchange Server database utilities will function properly, you should
obtain and install a post-Service Pack 3 hotfix for Windows NT 4.0 before you
restart any virus software programs on a Microsoft Exchange 5.5 Server
computer.

1. Disable the anti-virus software. Double-click the Services icon in Control
  Panel to set the appropriate services to Disabled.

2. Disable the system devices. Double-click the Devices icon in Control Panel.
  Set the appropriate system devices to Disabled.

3. Stop all Microsoft Exchange Server Services and set them to Manual startup.

4. Restart the server and then proceed with the upgrade.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server
version 4.0 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack
4.


For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postSP3/roll-up

NOTE: Review the Readme.txt file in that directory before you attempt to install
the hotfixes.
