-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an unattended installation on a computer that uses Advanced
Graphic Port (AGP) technology, your system will restart with one of the
following error messages:

  Invalid Display Settings

  The currently selected display resolution is invalid.

  The default resolution has been temporarily used by the system.

  Please use the Display option in the Windows NT Control Panel to select your
  preferred display resolution.

One of these messages is displayed even though a valid resolution supported by
the adapter has been selected.

CAUSE
=====

On systems with a PCI bridge, Windows NT Service Pack 3 is required prior to
installing AGP video drivers. Because this is an unattended installation using
AGP drivers, the video drivers are installed prior to SP3 being installed. For
additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q174567 AGP Video Support for Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem can be resolved by using the HAL from SP3 during the unattended
installation. Modifications were made to the HAL in SP3 to accommodate AGP
technology.

You should identify which specific HAL the computer requires and only copy those
files. You can copy all of the HAL files to the distribution server, but it is
not recommended.

1. On the distribution share containing the source files, rename the original
  HAL to HAL.ORG

2. Copy the desired HAL from the Windows NT Service Pack 3 compact disc to the
  distribution share containing the source files.

3. Continue with the unattended installation.

Example of HALs to be installed, based on computer type.

  486c_up       = hal486c.dll
  astmf_mp      = halast.dll
  cbus2_mp      = halcbus.dll
  cbusmc_mp     = halcbusm.dll
  e_isa_up      = hal.dll
  mca_up        = halmca.dll
  mps_up        = halapic.dll
  mps_mp        = halmps.dll
  mps_mca_mp    = halmpsm.dll
  ncr3x_mp      = halncr.dll
  oli5030_mp    = haloli.dll
  syspro_mp     = halsp.dll
  wyse7000_mp   = halwyse7.dll

NOTE: In order to ensure proper functionality of the computer, apply Service Pack
3 (SP3) either during or after the unattended install is completed. Simply
copying the Service Pack 3 files in this article does not constitute the
application of Service Pack 3. Service Pack 3 can be applied during an
unattended Setup using the /e command-line switch with the WINNT command (for
additional information about the /e command-line switch, please see the NT
Deployment Guide), or it can be manually applied after the computer is starts
for the first time.
