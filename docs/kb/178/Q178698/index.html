-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the Move Mailbox command in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program, the Reminders dialog box for scheduled appointments fails to display
using Outlook 97 clients.

CAUSE
=====

Outlook 97 introduced some new MAPI properties. These properties were not being
correctly mapped to the older properties that actually contained the Reminder
information after the mailbox was moved to the new server.


WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To clean your reminders so they are displayed when they normally should be,
follow these steps:

1. Apply the latest service pack for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 on an
  Exchange Server 5.0 computer. For information on obtaining the service pack,
  query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
  spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

  NOTE: The fix that allows you to clean your reminders has been implemented
  only in the Administrator program for Exchange Server 5.0. However, the
  Exchange Server 5.0 Administrator program can be used to clean your reminders
  on an Exchange Server 4.0 computer.



2. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Locate the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\MSExchangeAdminCommon

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

     Value name: CleanReminders
     Value type: REG_DWORD
     Value data: 1

5. Quit the Registry Editor.

6. Start the Administrator program. To do so, click Start, point to Programs,
  point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

7. In the left pane, select the appropriate Recipients object. In the right
  pane, select the desired mailboxes.

  NOTE: The users should not be logged on to the server when you perform these
  steps.

8. On the Tools menu, click Clean Mailbox. Click OK, and then click OK again.

9. When Clean Mailbox finishes, start Outlook and log on to the server using the
  mailbox that was experiencing this problem. When you do so, the Reminders
  folder is rebuilt and your reminders should be displayed.

NOTE: When the CleanReminders registry value is set to 1, the Clean Mailbox
command only cleans the Reminders folder for the selected mailboxes. The Clean
Mailbox command does not delete any messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

To cause the Clean Mailbox command to return to its normal behavior, you must do
one of the following:

- Set the CleanReminders registry value to 0.

  -OR-

- Delete the CleanReminders registry value.
