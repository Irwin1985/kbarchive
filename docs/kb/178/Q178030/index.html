The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains some helpful tips and suggestions for how to fly Lessons
and Adventures in Flight Simulator 2000 and Flight Simulator 98. Please follow
these tips as closely as possible.

It is important to realize that even a slight deviation from the flight path may
cause problems or abnormal behavior in the Lesson or Adventure. Because it is
impossible for Microsoft Technical Support to monitor your flying technique,
these tips are your best resource for improving your flying skills.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To successfully complete an Adventure or Lesson, you must follow the
instructions accurately for the aircraft and flight, and, more importantly,
adhere closely to the flight plan. NOTE: Extensive real-world piloting skill and
experience does not guarantee that you can successfully adhere to the flight
plan in Flight Simulator. However, it can certainly be helpful.

Carefully Review Instructions
-----------------------------

It is very important that you read and follow both the pre-flight briefings and
checklists for your flight and aircraft. To find the pre-flight briefings for
your flight, use the appropriate method for your version of Flight Simulator.

Flight Simulator 2000:

1. On the Help menu, click Simulator Help.

2. Double-click Flights/Lessons/Adventures.

3. In the left pane, click Preflight Briefing.

4. In the right pane, double-click the appropriate Help topic for your flight.

Flight Simulator 98:

1. On the Help menu, click Contents.

2. Double-click Preflight Briefings.

3. Double-click either Lessons or Adventures.

4. Double-click the appropriate Help topic for your flight.

To view the aircraft checklists for your flight, use the appropriate method for
your version of Flight Simulator.

Flight Simulator 2000:

1. After you select a Lesson or Adventure and are in the cockpit of the
  aircraft, on the Aircraft menu, point to Kneeboard, and then click
  Checklists.

2. Click the checklist you want to review.

Flight Simulator 98:

1. After you select a Lesson or Adventure and are in the cockpit of the
  aircraft, on the Aircraft menu, point to Checklists.

2. Click the checklist you want to review.

Using the Autopilot
-------------------

If quick maneuvers are required for the Lesson or Adventure you want to attempt,
you should probably not use the Autopilot. As an example, a quick descent or
ascent is usually required for a takeoff or landing. The Autopilot may not
change altitude quickly enough to stay within the flight path for the Lesson or
Adventure. However, it may be appropriate to use the Autopilot to track the
Instrument Landing System (ILS) during a landing.

If you use the Heading Hold feature on a long leg of a flight, your aircraft may
drift off course from the VOR radial. Eventually, the aircraft can drift into
the edge of the flight path. When this happens, the co-pilot or instructor tells
you about it repeatedly. To stay on course more accurately, use the NAV 1 Course
Hold setting.

For more information about how to use the Autopilot, please see the Autopilot
Help topics in the Flight Simulator online Help file. To do this, use the
appropriate method for your version of Flight Simulator.

Flight Simulator 2000:

1. On the Help menu, click Simulator Help.

2. Click "Getting From Here to There".

3. In the left pane, click "Using the Autopilot".

Flight Simulator 98:

1. On the Help menu, click Index.

2. In the "Type the first few letters of the word you're looking for" box, type
  "autopilot" (without the quotation marks), and then click Display.

3. Click Using The Autopilot, and then click Display.
