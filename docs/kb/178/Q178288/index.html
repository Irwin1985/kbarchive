MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft(r) Flight Simulator(tm) Setup Patch Instructions
September 1997

(c) Copyright 1997 Microsoft Corporation.

What This Patch Is For

An error has been identified in the Setup program for Microsoft Flight
Simulator 98. This error results in an erroneous message being generated
by Setup.exe to the effect that 4096MB of free space is required on your
C: drive in order to properly set up the application. In reality, nowhere
near this much space is actually required.

This error occurs most commonly on hard drives which are partitioned,
compressed, or larger than 2GB total.

If you have encountered this problem and are unable to successfully install
Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, this patch should resolve your problem.

This package also contains an update to the DirectPlay system components.
If you are experiencing difficulties with the Multiplayer options in Flight
Simulator 98, or are having difficulties with the Zone connections, this
patch may also help you.

Using the Corrected Setup

To use the corrected Setup program, follow these steps:

Place the extracted files Setup.exe, Setupenu.dll, and Dplay50a.exe
  in any convenient location on your hard drive which does not already
  contain a file named Setup.exe, such as the Windows desktop. Normally,
  the self-extraction tool places these files on your Windows desktop.
  If your Windows folder is in another location than C:\Windows, then
  you can find the extracted files in the C:\Windows\Desktop folder.

Place the Flight Simulator 98 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. If the
  Setup program begins automatically, click Exit. (This is the original
  flawed Setup program.)

Using the Run command on the Windows 95 Start Menu, type the following
  command line:

     c:\Windows\Desktop\Setup /patch:&lt;your CD-ROM drive letter&gt;

  For example, if your Flight Simulator 98 CD-ROM is in drive D:,
  you should type:

     c:\Windows\Desktop\Setup /patch:d:

  NOTE: If you extracted Setup.exe to a location other than
  C:\Windows\Desktop, replace C:\Windows\Desktop with the path to
  the appropriate location.

At this time, the Setup program should run correctly and copy the
  necessary files from the Flight Simulator 98 CD-ROM. Once the Setup
  program completes successfully, you may remove the patch files from
  your hard drive, although we recommend retaining them in a secure
  location in the event that you need to reinstall Microsoft Flight
  Simulator 98 again at some time in the future.

If you still encounter any sort of problem with incorrect disk space
  calculations, you can also run the Setup program with a "/force" flag
  in addition to the "/patch:" flag listed in step 3, to force Setup to
  ignore drive space requirements. Note that if you do not have enough
  space for the Setup options you select, this results in an incomplete
  and aborted installation.

To install the DirectPlay 5.0a components, simply double click the
  Dplay50a.exe file.
