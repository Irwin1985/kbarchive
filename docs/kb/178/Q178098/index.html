-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot problems related to the video
components of DirectX, which include DirectDraw and Direct3D. DirectX is a suite
of components that helps multimedia programs achieve higher performance by
accessing hardware features directly. DirectDraw is used to directly access
video adapter hardware. Direct3D is used to directly access 3D rendering
features built in to many video adapters.

DirectX may be installed by programs such as a game, or you can download DirectX
5.0 as a separate component from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp

MORE INFORMATION
================

Certification of DirectX Components
-----------------------------------

Microsoft supports all certified DirectX drivers. If a driver is not certified,
contact your hardware manufacturer for support.

1. To determine if your DirectX drivers are certified, run the Maintenance-Mode
  DirectX Setup program (Dxsetup.exe). If you installed DirectX 5, Dxsetup.exe
  is located by default in the Program Files\Directx folder. If it is not
  located in this folder, find the file. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

  b. Type the following line in the Named box, and then click Find Now:

  " dxsetup.exe " (without the quotation marks)

  c. Double-click Dxsetup.exe.

NOTE: Some non-certified drivers may work with DirectX. It is not necessary for
the driver to be listed as certified to work with DirectX programs.

DirectX Setup displays a list of DirectX core components, the version number for
each component, and whether the component is certified. For more information
about the Dxsetup.exe program, see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q158957 Description of DirectX 1.0, 2.0 Maintenance Setup Dialog Box

  Q158958 Description of DirectX 3.0 Maintenance Setup Dialog


For more information about the files installed for each version of DirectX, see
the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q158959 Files Installed by DirectX 1.0

  Q158960 Files Installed by DirectX 2.0a

  Q158961 Files Installed by DirectX 3.0

  Q173479 Files Installed by DirectX 5.0

Note that there is no DirectX 4.0.

DirectX Compatibility with Your Display Driver
----------------------------------------------

Contact your hardware manufacturer to verify that the driver for your display
adapter is DirectX-compatible.

A list of the updated display adapter drivers for DirectX 1.0-5.0 is available
from Microsoft. For more information, see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q158953 Updated Display Drivers Included with DirectX

  Q175894 Video Adapter Drivers Included with DirectX 5

For the most recent list of supported adapters for DirectX 5.0, see the following
Microsoft Web page:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp

Some display adapters may be compatible with either DirectDraw or Direct3D, but
not both.

Known Problems with DirectX and Your Display Adapter
----------------------------------------------------

When you attempt to install a program that uses DirectX, you may receive error
messages or experience display problems. Upgrade to the latest display drivers
and, if necessary, reinstall any programs that require DirectX.

Contact your software manufacturer to determine if there are known issues using
DirectX with your adapter and their driver software. Microsoft recommends
upgrading to an updated driver if they have one available.

You can also check Microsoft Support Online on the Internet to access the
Microsoft Knowledge Base at the following Web page:

Display Problems Due to Conflicting Versions of DirectX
-------------------------------------------------------

If you still have problems running programs that use DirectX, check the version
of DirectX running on your computer. To do so, follow these steps:

1. If you are running DirectX 5.0, use the DirectX Driver Tool (Dxtool.exe) to
  display version information for each DirectX component.

2. If you do not have DirectX 5.0 or the DirectX Driver Tool is unavailable,
  check the file versions of specific files. For more information, see the
  following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q158960 Files Installed by DirectX 2.0a

  Q158961 Files Installed by DirectX 3.0

  Q173479 Files Installed by DirectX 5.0

3. If you are using DirectX 5.0, you can also use DirectX Information
  (Dxinfo.exe) to determine which DirectX files are installed. Dxinfo.exe is
  located in the Program Files\Directx\Setup folder and lists each file
  installed with DirectX, including the file version number, file date, and
  file size. This information can also be saved as a text file. If the file is
  not located in this folder, look for the file. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

  b. In the Named box, type the following line, and then click Find Now:

  "dxinfo.exe" (without the quotation marks)

  c. Double click Dxinfo.exe.

4. If you have conflicting versions installed, rename any files from the older
  version of DirectX. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

  b. In the Named box, type the following line, and then click Find Now

  "&lt;dxdriver&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

     where &lt;dxdriver&gt; is the name of one of the older DirectX drivers.

  c. Click a file, and then click Rename on the File menu.

  d. Type the name of the file as follows

  "&lt;dxdriver&gt;.xxx" (without the quotation marks)

     where &lt;dxdriver&gt; is the name of the DirectX driver file.

  e. Repeat steps 1-2 for each older DirectX file.

  f. Reinstall the more recent version of DirectX.

  g. Test the DirectX program and verify that the problem no longer occurs.

  h. If the problem no longer occurs, click Start, point to Find, and then
     click Files Or Folders.

  i. In the Named box, type the following line, and then click Find Now

  "&lt;dxdriver&gt;.xxx" (without the quotation marks)

     where &lt;dxdriver&gt; is the name of one of the renamed DirectX drivers.

  j. Click Delete on the File menu.

  k. Repeat steps I-J for each file renamed in steps C-E.

5. If you still experience problems, you may want to reinstall DirectX. You may
  receive the following error message attempting to reinstall DirectX:

  Insert Disk
  The disk labeled 'DirectDraw Drivers' is now required
  This disk is provided by your computer manufacturer.
  Click OK to continue.

  If you receive this error message, see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q170184 Err Msg: DirectSound or DirectDraw Drivers Disk Is Now Required


1. If you did not experience problems with an earlier version of DirectX, you
  may want to revert to the earlier version of the DirectX driver. To do so,
  follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

  b. In the Named box, type the following line, and then click Find Now:

  "dxsetup.exe" (without the quotation marks)

  c. Double click Dxsetup.exe.

  d. Click Restore Display Drivers, and then click OK.

NOTE: Some drivers overwrite previous drivers or rename driver files. This option
may not be available in this case.
