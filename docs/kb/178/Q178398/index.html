-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After installing the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 3 and opening a project under
source control, you may get the following error:

  Microsoft Visual SourceSafe
  The database is unavailable. Would you like to disable source control
  integration?

There are two possible causes:

- You have set up a user name using the Visual SourceSafe administrator that is
  not the same as the user name you use to log into your workstation and the
  SourceSafe user name has a password.

- You have the same user name in Visual SourceSafe as you use to log into your
  workstation, but you have deselected "Use network name for automatic user log
  in" in the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, Tools menu, Options menu item,
  General tab.

Use one of the following resolutions as a workaround:

- After you start your developer application, but before you open a project
  that is under source control, start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer from the
  Project menu, Source Control submenu in Visual C++ or Tools menu, Visual
  SourceSafe submenu in Visual Basic. This will present you with a login
  dialog. After a successful login, you will be able to open the project under
  source control in Visual Studio.

- Using the Visual SourceSafe Administrator, check "Use network name for
  automatic user log in" in the Tools menu, Options menu item, General tab.
  Then make sure that all user names match the login names used to log into
  Windows NT and/or Windows 95. The Visual SourceSafe passwords are ignored
  during login in this case.

- If you are using a Visual SourceSafe login name that is different than your
  login name for Windows, then don't use a password.

- Roll back to the Service Pack 2 (05.00.2220) version of Ssscc.dll that is in
  SssccSP2.exe. Please see the MORE INFORMATION section for instructions on
  obtaining this file.

  The following file is the only file included in SssccSP2.exe:

  Ssscc.dll, version 05.00.2220


- "set" the SSUSER and SSPWD environment variables using the following
  procedure:

  Method 1
  --------

  Setting a command prompt shell environment. You need to do this each time you
  open the application.
  a. Open a command prompt and type something, such as set ssuser=guest. If
     this user has a password, you must also set the SSPWD variable, such as
     set sspwd=password.

  b. While still in the command prompt, use "cd" to change to the install
     location of your development application and start it up.

  Method 2
  --------

  Setting the Windows shell environment. In Windows NT:
  a. Right-click My Computer and click the Environment tab.

  b. Put the cursor in the Variable: text box and type SSUSER.

  c. Hit tab to the Value: text box and type in a valid Visual SourceSafe login
     name, such as guest. If this user has a password, you must also set the
     SSPWD variable in the same manner.

  d. Click OK.

  e. Restart Windows NT.

  In Windows 95:
  a. Add the following two line to the Autoexec.bat:

  set ssuser=&lt;username&gt;
  set sspwd=&lt;password&gt;

  b. Save and restart Windows 95.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
This bug was corrected in Visual SourceSafe 6.0.
