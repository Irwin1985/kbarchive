When invoking the on-line help in Microsoft QuickC Version 2.00 or
QuickAssembler Version 2.01 for the _putimage() function, the
description section mentions five manifests constants, but does not
describe what they mean.

The following information is taken from the "Microsoft QuickC Run-Time
Library Reference" manual, Page 470:

   _GAND     Transfers the image over an existing image on the screen.
             The resulting image is the logical-AND product of the two
             images: points that had the same color in both the existing
             image and the new one will remain the same color, while
             points that have different colors are ANDed together.

   _GOR      Superimposes the image onto an existing image. The new image
             does not erase the previous screen contents.

   _GPRESET  Transfers the data point-by-point onto the screen. Each
             point has the inverse of the color attribute it had when it
             was taken from the screen by _getimage, producing a negative
             image.

   _GPSET    Transfers the data point-by-point onto the screen. Each
             point has the exact color attribute it had when it was taken
             from the screen by _getimage.

   _GXOR     Causes the points on the screen to be inverted where a point
             exists in the image buffer. This behavior is exactly like
             that of the cursor: when an image is put against a complex
             background twice, the background is restored unchanged. This
             allows you to move an object around without erasing the
             background. The _GXOR constant is a special mode often used
             for animation.
