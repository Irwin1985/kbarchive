The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you cannot send messages to an auto-addressed user/group recipient in
Microsoft Mail, there may be another user/group from another server with the
same name on the network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have been using a form with an auto-addressed recipient (user or group)
and it suddenly stopped working, it is very likely that a user or group with an
identical name was added to one of the servers on the network. To find out if
the form is not working for this reason, you can use one of the following two
methods:

Method 1
--------

If the User List box in the custom form is visible (that is, the auto-addressed
recipient name is displayed), the name disappears once an identical name (user
or group) is added to one of the Mail servers on the Network.

Method 2
--------

If the User List box in the custom form is invisible (that is, the auto-addressed
recipient name is never displayed), the Send button is grayed out. If there is
more than one fixed recipient, the Send button is not grayed out; however, that
user or group will not receive a copy of the message.

How to Correct This Problem
---------------------------

Cases
-----

1. The recipient is a user and there is another user or group with the same
  name.

  In this case, you must add the "@" (without the quotation marks) symbol and
  the name of the server after the auto-addressed recipient's name by using the
  following syntax:

  User Name@Server Name

  This is a common problem when you create a custom form with the Network
  Manager as the auto-addressed recipient. If you have more than one Mail
  server in the network, there are probably several accounts named "Network
  Manager." The server name and the user name are needed because Mail does not
  know which Network Manager you are trying to send the message to.

2. The recipient is a group and there is a user with the same name.

  In this case, you must add the "@" (without the quotation marks) symbol and
  the word "group" (without the quotation marks) after the auto-addressed
  recipient's group name by using the following syntax:

  Group Name@group

3. The recipient is a group and there is another group with the same name.

  In this case, you must rename one of the groups. You cannot create a Mail
  custom form with an auto-addressed group recipient name if another group with
  the same name exists on the network.
