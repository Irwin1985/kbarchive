SUMMARY
=======

We are not aware of any kind of Windows-to-Macintosh interpreter or translator
that will allow you to directly run Windows code on the Macintosh, but there are
some alternatives:

1. The January 1989 issue of the "Microsoft Systems Journal" contains two
  relevant articles titled "Developing Applications with Common Source Code for
  Multiple Environments" and "Porting Apple Macintosh Applications to the
  Microsoft Windows Environment."

2. The "Windows Developer Guidebook" [available by calling (800) 426-9600]
  contains a listing for a product that helps you develop code in an
  environment-independent way. The product is called XVT (Extensible Virtual
  Toolkit) for Microsoft Windows, Presentation Manager, and Macintosh. XVT is
  made by the following company:

  GSS (Graphical Software Systems)
  9590 SW Gemini Drive
  Beaverton, OR 97005
  (503) 643-8642

  According to GSS, "XVT allows developers to create and maintain one set of
  source code and port it to Windows, PM, and Macintosh environments."


3. A third-party product called CommonView contains Glockenspiel C++ object
  libraries to simplify creation of applications for Windows and OS/2
  Presentation Manager (PM) using the same core source code. Contact the
  company to find out more about porting to the Macintosh.

  CommonView is a set of class libraries for creating Microsoft Windows and PM
  applications. They come with the C++ compiler, which is an object-oriented
  version of C. They are actually translators that translate C++ code into C
  code, which you can then run through your C compiler. You can write an
  application using CommonView, and it will isolate you from the particular
  Windows environment. The product is distributed by Imagesoft, (800) 245-8840
  or (516) 767-2233.

XVT and CommonView are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make
no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
