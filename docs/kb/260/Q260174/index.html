SYMPTOMS
========

After you turn on the special pool feature, the system may reboot to a bugcheck.
This may occur upon every reboot and at any phase of the reboot process,
preventing access to the system and the ability to complete a successful memory
dump. Common memory access stop codes include, but are not limited to: Stop
0x00000050, Stop 0x0000001E, Stop 0x0000001A and Stop 0x0000000A.

CAUSE
=====

When the special pool features are used to isolate pool damage, the system
bugchecks immediately if a driver attempts to corrupt the pool. If the driver
attempts to corrupt the pool during the boot process, the system bugchecks. If a
driver consistently attempts to corrupt the pool during boot, the system is not
able to boot with the special pool feature turned on.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following technique to allow the system to boot and complete the memory
dump. In some situations you may have to start by removing the pool tags as in
step 6, or by manually editing the registry and then proceeding with step 1.

1. Verify that the crash recovery options are set correctly to ensure successful
  capture of the memory dump.

the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q235496 How to Enable a Memory.dmp File Capture Using the Graphical User
  Interface or the Registry

2. Turn on (or in some cases, turn on again) the special pool as necessary.

3. Restart the computer and do not log on.

4. Let the computer crash and complete the dump of contents from memory to the
  pagefile. You will see this on the screen.

  Once this is complete, restart the computer. The computer will restart
  automatically if set to do so in the crash recovery settings.

5. When the computer restarts, use the "last known good" configuration option to
  start the computer.

This will remove the registry changes set by the special pool feature, restore
the computer to its previous state, and allow the computer to complete the
startup process. This should allow the pagefile write operation to complete and
result in a successful memory dump.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use the "last known good" configuration, follow these steps:

1. Start the computer and select the proper boot menu entry on the OS Loader
  screen.

  You will see the following message displayed on the screen for a few seconds:
  "NTDETECT V4.0 Checking Hardware".

2. Press the SPACEBAR when you see the next message, "Press spacebar NOW to
  invoke Hardware Profile/Last Known Good menu." This will bring you to the
  default Configuration menu, which allows you to select different hardware
  profiles.

3. Press L to switch to the "last known good" configuration menu.

  Original Configuration is selected by default.

4. Press ENTER.

For more information on how control sets and last known good configuration are
handled by the registry, see the "Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit," Chapter
36, Pages 1051 - 1053.
