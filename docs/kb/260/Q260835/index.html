SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, there may be a need to discover which computer a user is using to
access a mailbox. You can obtain this information by using a combination of
Microsoft Windows NT auditing and Microsoft Exchange Server diagnostic logging.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sets of steps are performed in User Manager and the Exchange
Server Administrator program for the server being accessed by the user.

Use Windows NT auditing to determine which system a user logged on from; to do
so, follow these steps:

1. Start User Manager for Domains.

2. Click Audit on the Policies menu.

3. Click to select the Success check box in the "Logon and Logoff" category.
  Optionally, you may also select the Failure check box.

After you have completed these steps, Windows NT logs an event in the Security
Event Log for each successful logon attempt. The log appears similar to the
following example:

  Event Type:	Success Audit 
  Event Source:	Security 
  Event Category:	Logon/Logoff 
  Event ID:	528 
  Date:		4/25/2000 
  Time:		4:54:33 PM 
  User:		Domain\UserName 
  Computer:	ServerX 
  Description: 

  Successful Logon:
  User Name:	Administrator 

       Domain:		Domain 

	Logon ID:		(0x0,0x3F0D6) 

	Logon Type:	3 

	Logon Process:	NtLmSsp 

	Authentication Package:	MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0 

	Workstation Name:	ComputerX  

Use Exchange Server diagnostic logging to determine which user account was used
to log on to a particular mailbox; to do so, follow these steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. Select the server where the mailboxes are homed.

3. Click Properties on the File menu.

4. Select the Diagnostics Logging tab.

5. In the Services pane, expand MSExchangeIS, and then select Private.

6. In the Category pane, click Logons, and then change the Logging level to
  Maximum.

7. Click OK.

After you have completed these steps, Exchange Server logs an event in the
Application Event Log for each successful logon attempt. The log is similar to
the following example:

  Event Type:     Success Audit 

  Event Source:   MSExchangeIS Private 

  Event Category: Logons 

  Event ID:       1009 

  Date:           4/25/2000 

  Time:           4:54:33 PM 

  User:           N/A 

  Computer:       ServerX 

  Description: 

  Domain\UserName logged on as
  /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=Mailbox

Finally, to determine the computer used to access the mailbox, follow these
steps:

1. Find the event ID 1009 that is generated in the Application Event Log when
  the mailbox in question is accessed.

2. Note the time that the event ID 1009 is generated.

3. Find the event ID 528 generated in the Security Event Log with the same time
  as the event ID 1009 noted above.

4. Match event IDs 1009 and 528 by their common time of generation.

These matching event IDs reference the computer and the account (respectively)
used to access the mailbox.
