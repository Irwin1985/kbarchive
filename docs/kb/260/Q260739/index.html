SUMMARY
=======

This article describes common troubleshooting tips for SerialKeys and how to use
more sophisticated methods of access. SerialKeys enables you to control the
computer by using an alternate input devices.

assistive aid, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

SerialKeys is usually used by accessibility aids to provide input in place of
that provided by the computer's keyboard or mouse. The Microsoft implementation
of SerialKeys follows the connection and communication protocol outlined in the
General Input Device Emulating Interface (GIDEI) protocol defined by the Trace
Research and Development Center at the University of Wisconsin. Details of the
GIDEI protocol are available from Trace at the following Trace Research and
Development Center Web site:

  http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/gidei/gidei.htm

Troubleshooting SerialKeys
--------------------------

If you are using SerialKeys and the aid stops sending keys successfully, try the
following items:

- Check to make sure you included any necessary periods in your key names.

- Send three null characters. (The null character is different from a zero;
  usually you can generate it on the aid by pressing CTRL+@.

- Reset both the aid and SerialKeys to 300 baud. (If there is a communication
  difficulty, SerialKeys may automatically reset itself to 300 baud, making it
  unable to communicate with the aid if the aid is sending at a different
  rate.)

Note the following items:

- SerialKeys uses hardware handshaking (DTR/RTS) and software (XON/OFF)
  handshaking to control the flow of characters from the aid. Characters may be
  lost if the aid ignores these handshaking signals.

- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 manages the COM ports, including the hardware
  interrupt lines. Windows NT does not allow another device to use or share the
  interrupt line that SerialKeys is using. This means that if, for example, you
  have SerialKeys turned on using COM port 1, you cannot use the Windows
  Terminal program on COM port 1. Also, if you have SerialKeys on COM 1, and
  another program is experiencing problems while using COM 3, you must move the
  program or SerialKeys to COM 2 or COM 4. See your computer documentation for
  details on how COM 1 and 3 and COM 2 and 4 should be set, and whether the
  computer supports COM ports 3 and 4.

Microsoft recommends programming the aid to use the IBM Enhanced Keyboard (101
keys). Even if the computer does not have this keyboard, SerialKeys functions as
the 101-key keyboard. This can be to your advantage, because some programs
recognize the additional keys, enabling you to use additional features. If you
choose to program the 83-key or 84-key keyboard, there are a few exceptions you
should be aware of:

- To use the Break function, you would ordinarily press and hold down the CTRL
  key and press the SCROLL key. For SerialKeys, press and hold down the CTRL
  key and press the PAUSE key.

- To use the Pause function, you would ordinarily press and hold down the CTRL
  key and press the NUM LOCK key. For SerialKeys, just press the PAUSE key.

Advanced Mouse Movements
------------------------

It is a good idea to program at least a square or selection on the aid to move
the mouse in the four directions by 1, 10, and 100 units. This lets you make
small, fine movements and large, fast movements. For example:

  [esc],move,+1,0.         Moves mouse pointer 1 unit right
  [esc],move,-1,0.         Moves mouse pointer 1 unit left
  [esc],move,0,+1.         Moves mouse pointer 1 unit down
  [esc],move,0,-1.         Moves mouse pointer 1 unit up
  [esc],move,+10,0.        Moves mouse pointer 10 units right
  [esc],move,-10,0.        Moves mouse pointer 10 units left
  [esc],move,0,+10.        Moves mouse pointer 10 units down
  [esc],move,0,-10.        Moves mouse pointer 10 units up
  [esc],move,+100,0.       Moves mouse pointer 100 units right
  [esc],move,-100,0.       Moves mouse pointer 100 units left
  [esc],move,0,+100.       Moves mouse pointer 100 units down
  [esc],move,0,-100.       Moves mouse pointer 100 units up

Resetting SerialKeys
--------------------

If you are using SerialKeys in a multiple-user environment, the first command you
send to SerialKeys should be the reset command. This ensures that SerialKeys
operates at 300 baud and is ready to accept your keyboard and mouse actions. The
reset command consists of sending three null (ASCII 0) characters with the aid
configured to 300 baud. You can usually generate a null character on the aid by
pressing CTRL+@.

Using Lock and Release
----------------------

You can use this command to hold a key down and lift it back up again as separate
actions. Its primary use is in using SerialKeys in combination with MouseKeys.

1. Turn on MouseKeys by pressing left ALT+left SHIFT+NUM LOCK.

2. Decide which direction you want to move the mouse. Find out which numeric
  keypad key moves the mouse in that direction in MouseKeys.

3. Send a lock command with that key name. For example, to move the mouse
  pointer to the right:

  [esc],lock,kpright.

4. When the mouse pointer has moved as far as you want in that direction, send
  the release command:

  [esc],rel.

You can program the lock part and the release part of this sequence under a
different selection on the aid so that you do not have to type them each time
you use them. Make sure to include the commas and periods.

NOTE: MouseKeys also enables you to hold down and release a mouse button or click
a mouse button.

Using the Keyboard Combine Command 
----------------------------------

If you want to program a modifier key and another key under a single selection on
the aid, use the combine command to place several keystrokes under one selection
on the aid. This can be useful for common multiple-key command combinations that
are required by software. There must be commas between the keys and a period at
the end. No more than five keys can be combined. For example:

  [esc],combine,shift,ctrl,enter.

Using the Mouse Goto Command
----------------------------

This moves the mouse to a specified location. You should send the moureset
command first. Both the horizontal and vertical direction numbers require only a
plus (+) sign. (See the example for moving the mouse earlier in the "Advanced
Mouse Movements" section.) For example:

  [esc],goto,+20,+25.

Using the Mouse Anchor Command
------------------------------

You can use this command to anchor the mouse pointer to a position within a
Windows-based program. If you change the active window between setting the mouse
anchor and returning to that anchor, the mouse anchor command does not work. The
following example shows how to use the mouanchor (mouse anchor) command to mark
a current window position, go to a new location and click the mouse to select a
new tool, go to another new location and click the mouse to select another
color, and then return to the location you left to use that tool:

  [esc],mouanchor.    Sets the position or anchors the pointer
  [esc],goto,+10,+10. Goes to a new location
  [esc],click.        Click selects a new tool in this
                      program at location 10,10
  [esc],goto,+50,+10. Goes to a new location
  [esc],click.        Click selects a new color in this
                      program at location 50,10
  [esc],mouanchor.    Returns to where you left from,
                      anchor released

Using the Baudrate Command
--------------------------

This command enables you to change the SerialKeys baud rate from the aid. The
possible baud rates are 300; 600; 1,200; 2,400; 4,800; and 9,600. This command
is never absolutely necessary because you can also set the baud rate in
SerialKeys. For example:

  [esc],baudrate,300.

If you decide to run SerialKeys at a baud rate faster than 300, be aware of the
special automatic reset feature in SerialKeys. When SerialKeys receives three
consecutive characters with a transmission error, it automatically resets to 300
baud. This enables people in a multiple-user environment to place SerialKeys in
a known state (300 baud). SerialKeys signals any transmission problem with a
short beep. If SerialKeys resets to 300 baud, it generates a long beep.
SerialKeys also signals a baud rate change with a long beep.
