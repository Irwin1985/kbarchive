-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a Direct Cable Connection to play a multiplayer game of
Microsoft Age of Empires II, The Age of Kings, you may receive an error message,
stating that you cannot connect.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:

- A Direct Cable Connection is already established.

- The computers are connected with a parallel cable.

- The computers are using a network protocol that is not supported by Age of
  Empires II, The Age of Kings.

- Direct Cable Connection is not properly installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Install the Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings 2.0a Update
-----------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest update for Age of Empires II: Age of Kings. The latest update,
Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings 2.0a Update, includes multiplayer
performance enhancements.

To download the Age of Kings 2.0a Update, visit the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/age2/downloads.htm

Close the Existing Direct Cable Connection
------------------------------------------

If a Direct Cable Connection is already established, close the connection, and
then start Age of Empires II, The Age of Kings.

Install and Use the IPX/SPX Network Protocol
--------------------------------------------

If your computers are connected with a parallel cable, install and use the
IPX/SPX network protocol:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. Click Add, click Protocol, and then click Add.

4. Click Microsoft, and then click IPX/SPX Compatible Protocol from the list.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

6. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.

7. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

8. Double-click Network.

9. Click IPX/SPX-compatible Protocol, and then click Properties.

10. Click to select the "I want to enable NetBIOS over IPX/SPX" check box.

11. Click the Advanced tab.

12. In the Properties box, click Ethernet 802.3 in the Frame Type box.

13. Click Maximum Connections, and then select or type "10" (without the
  quotation marks), in the Value box.

14. Click Maximum Sockets and then select or type "10" (without the quotation
  marks), in the Value box.

15. Click to select the "Set this Protocol to be the default protocol" check
  box.

If you use this method, make sure that you establish the Direct Cable Connection
before you start the game, and make sure that you select an IPX/SPX game instead
of a Direct Cable Connection game.

NOTE: NetBEUI is an unsupported network protocol for all Microsoft DirectPlay
games. Do not use the NetBEUI network protocol to play a DirectPlay game when
you use Direct Cable Connection.

Make Sure That Direct Cable Connection Is Properly Installed
------------------------------------------------------------

To make sure that Direct Cable Connection is properly installed:

- Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

- Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

- Click the Windows Setup tab.

- Under Components, click Communications, and then click Details.

- Click to clear the Direct Cable Connection check box, click OK, and then
  click Apply.

- Under Components, click Communications, and then click Details.

- Click to select the Direct Cable Connection check box, and then click OK.

- Click OK again.
