IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or reinstall Outlook Web Access (OWA) you may receive the
following error message:

  Access Denied Microsoft Windows NT ID no: 0xc0020005

The following event may also be logged in the application event log of the
Windows NT Event Viewer.

  Event ID: 14, Source: W3SVC, description: "exchfilt.dll could not be loaded."

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if a folder or file is corrupted. It can also be
the result of a locked file, a lack of appropriate permissions, or a service
that does not stop or start.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Because there is more than one possible cause for this error message, to resolve
this issue perform the following steps (these are steps that have resolved this
issue in the past):

1. Stop any unnecessary services. These include, but are not limited to:
  antivirus software, backup software, and any third-party Internet-related
  services.

2. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, make sure that the permissions
  for the Organization, Site, and Site Configuration containers are sufficient.
  Generally there is an Administrator account that has Permissions
  Administrator rights and a Site Service account that has Service Account
  Administrator rights. Make sure that there are no unnecessary entries, such
  as a user or group that has Search rights.

3. Make sure that you are logged on with an account that has Administrator
  rights to the domain and at least Permissions Administrator rights in
  Exchange Server. (To test permissions, try to stop and start the World Wide
  Web Publishing service manually.)

4. Look for an Exchsrvr\Webdata folder. If one exists, back up any customized
  Active Server Pages (ASP) files, and then delete this folder.

5. Locate a Exchsrvr\Webtemp folder; if one exists, delete it.

6. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeWEB

  If this key exists, back the key up, and then use Registry Editor to delete
  the key.

7. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup\Web Connector

  If this key exists, back the key up, and then use Registry Editor to delete
  the key.

8. Use the Add/Remove option in your Exchange Server Setup program to reinstall
  Outlook Web Access.
