-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message to Exchange Server recipients by using a personal
distribution list (DL) or Exchange Server DL, you may receive a non-delivery
report (NDR) message that is similar to the following for many of the members of
the DL:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject: Message Subject -- April 3 Sent: 2000-04-03 8:38AM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

  Doe, John on 2000-04-03 8:40 AM
  The message was undelivered because the specified recipient postal address was
  incorrect
  MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:SITE1:SERVER1

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur in Microsoft Outlook 97 and Microsoft Outlook 98 if the
following conditions exist when you send a message:

- You send the message to a personal DL or Exchange Server DL and request a
  delivery receipt.

- You open that message in the Sent Items folder, click "Reply to All", and
  then send the message.

- A blue letter "i" is displayed in the original message icon in the Sent Items
  folder before you use the "Reply to All" option to reply to the message. This
  icon is displayed when one of the delivery receipts for the original message
  is opened. If this icon is not displayed for the message, an NDR message is
  not generated.

When the blue "i" is displayed in the message icon in the Sent Items folder, a
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) property is set on the
message that prevents the delivery of the message to many of the DL recipients.
If you use the Reply to All option after this MAPI property is set, an NDR
message is generated.
