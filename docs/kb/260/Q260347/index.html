The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 2, 2000, Microsoft released an updated patch to correct a new variant of this vulnerability. Please see the Resolution section below for information on how to obtain the latest patch.

to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q275657 IIS 5: Fix for Cross-Site Scripting Issues

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has identified a vulnerability that could enable a malicious user to
cause code to run on the computer of another user in the guise of a third-party
web site. Such code could take any action on the user's computer that the
third-party web site was permitted to take. In addition, the code could be made
persistent, so that if the user returned to the web site again in the future,
the code would begin running again.

The vulnerability could only be exploited if the user clicked on a hypertext
link, either in an HTML mail or on a malicious user's web site - the code could
not be "injected" into an existing session.

CAUSE
=====

Certain Web services provided by Internet Information Server 4.0 do not properly
validate all inputs before they use them, and are therefore vulnerable to
Cross-Site Scripting (CSS).

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

To resolve this problem, obtain the Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup Package. For

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on this security vulnerability, please see the following
Microsoft web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-060.asp

CSS is a recently discovered security vulnerability that potentially enables a
malicious user to "inject" code into a user's session with a Web site. Unlike
most security vulnerabilities, CSS does not apply to any single vendor's
products, but instead, it can affect any software that runs on a Web server and
does not follow defensive programming practices. In early 2000, Microsoft and
CERT worked together to inform the software industry of the issue and lead an
industry-wide response to it.

Microsoft published extensive information about CSS, including information for
developers on how to check their code for potential vulnerabilities. Microsoft
has identified several places in IIS where proper checking was not performed;
some of these were found by our internal security teams, and others were
identified by customers.

For more specific information about CSS, see the FAQ on the following Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/crsstFAQ.asp
