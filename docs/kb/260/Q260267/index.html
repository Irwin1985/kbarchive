-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
- Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The FrontPage 97 and 98 Server Extensions include two image map files,
Htimage.exe and Imagemap.exe, which are server-side NCSA and CERN compliant
components, that are used to support server-side image maps.

These files were originally provided to support image maps with Netscape and
Internet Explorer versions 1.0 and 2.0. However, both files contain unchecked
buffers that may be used to run arbitrary code. These files expose security
vulnerabilities, which can result in buffer overruns, exploits of cross-site
scripting, and access to drive path and file information.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in the FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate this vulnerability, customers who are hosting Web sites using any
of the affected products need to delete all copies of the Htimage.exe and
Imagemap.exe files from their servers. The only functionality lost by deleting
these files is the ability to support image mapping for Web site visitors using
legacy browser products.

This is a short-term fix, because it is possible that FrontPage customers may
unknowingly publish the files to the server in their normal course of updating
their Webs.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft FrontPage 97 and 98
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The risk posed by this vulnerability is significantly restricted by the fact
that the affected components run "out of process" and in the security context of
the user. Therefore, there is no capability through this vulnerability that
causes either the Web service or the server itself to stop responding, nor is
there an opportunity to run code in an elevated security context. However, it
may still be possible for a malicious user to perform actions that, although
permitted, he or she would otherwise be unable to take because the functionality
is not exposed through a Web page or script.

The server-side image map components are rarely used, because, by default,
FrontPage creates client-side image maps. Therefore, removing the files from the
Web server results in minimal or no impact to the end user.

Affected Software Versions:

The affected components are part of the FrontPage 97 and 98 Server Extensions.
However, they are also included with several other Web server products. The
following is a complete list of products in which these components are
included:

- FrontPage 97 Server Extensions, included in FrontPage 97

- FrontPage 98 Server Extensions, included in FrontPage 98

- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack

- Personal Web Server 4.0, included in Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft
  Windows 98

Remediation:

It is recommended that ISPs and server administrators use the functionality that
is built into the Server Extensions to limit authors from uploading files to
executable folders on the Web server. The default setting for the FrontPage 2000
Server Extensions is to deny uploading files to executable folders. The default
setting for FrontPage 2000 prevents the Htimage.exe and Imagemap.exe files from
being published to the Cgi-bin folder in the Web.

To learn more about these settings with the FrontPage 2000 or FrontPage 98 Server
Extensions, please see the following resources:
