SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Routing Wizard for parallel routing, you may not receive the
final report for several days, even though the posted message is approved or
rejected immediately by all the recipients.

CAUSE
=====

The Routing Wizard uses the following map for the routing process:

  ......

  1010   Wait              0     10080
  1012   Goto              0     1020
  1014   Wait              0     0 
  1020   ORSplit           0     IsTimeout            
  ......

  5000   ORSplit           0     IsApprovedTable
  ......

  10000  FinalizeReport    2     False                False
  ......

  20000  FinalizeReport    2     True                 False
  ......

  20020  Terminate         0     0
  20030  Goto              0     20020
  30000  Terminate         0     1
  ......

You can only reach the ORSplit action at 5000 and create the final report when
the IsTimeout action returns True. However, the following action indicates that
the routing process will use the waiting time that was used by the previous Wait
action, which is 10080 minutes (7 days):

  Wait    0      0   

RESOLUTION
==========

Routing Wizard is a sample tool that is used to illustrate some of the
capabilities of the Exchange Server Routing objects. You can and should use the
ideas that are provided by the Routing Wizard to write your own tools. If you
want your tools to behave differently, you can modify the script source code or
change the routing map.

To speed up the routing process, modify the routing map as follows:

- Reduce 10080 (7 days) to a smaller number, such as 1440 (1 day).

To do this, replace the following code

  1010   Wait    0     10080

with:

  1010   Wait    0     1440

- Specify the wait time instead of using the existing waiting time.

To do this, replace the following code

  1014   Wait    0      0   

with:

  1014   Wait    0      60    'one hour

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 provides the Routing Wizard routing
tool. The Routing Wizard sample application illustrates the type of routing
tools that can be built easily with Microsoft Exchange Routing. With the Routing
Wizard, you can define and install simple sequential or parallel routing and
approval logic into Exchange Server folders.
