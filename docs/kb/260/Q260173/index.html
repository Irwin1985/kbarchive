- Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are configuring the Microsoft Exchange (MAPI-based) Management Agent
(MA) and you click "Test your configuration", you may receive the following
error message:

  Error was encountered in function: CheckDAPI calling DAPIStart.
  Error message: Could not bind to the Microsoft Exchange Directory server.
  Please check that the DSA name "&lt;Servername&gt;" is valid and is running.

  The server connection test was a failure.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if either of the following conditions exists:

- You are running Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) as a service and the
  account that is used to start the service does not have permissions to the
  Exchange server.

- You are running MMS as a program and the user account that you are using to
  log on to Windows does not have permission to the Exchange server directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are running MMS as a service, use the appropriate steps to resolve the
issue.

Microsoft Windows 2000

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click
  Administrative Tools, and then double-click Services.

2. Double-click the Zoomit Server service.


3. On the General tab, click Stop.

4. After the service is stopped, click the Log On tab.

5. In the Log On As section, click This Account. Use the button to the right of
  the This Account box to select the domain account with appropriate
  administrative permissions for the Exchange server.

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0

account that has administrative permission to the Exchange server.
