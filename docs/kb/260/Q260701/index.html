-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In large systems, public folder replication status messages may grow to a large
number and size.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because in Exchange Server 5.5, each server in the Exchange
Server organization that has a public information store sends at least one
status message each day to every other server in the organization that has a
public information store. In an Exchange Server organization that has hundreds
of servers that have public information stores, these public folder status
messages can overload the low bandwidth links.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A new algorithm is implemented in this fix that dramatically reduces the number
of public folder status messages in most systems.

The following are the changes that the new algorithm provides:

- The unconditional status broadcast and site-folder broadcasts during the
  information store startup are now removed.

- When the status of a public folder is broadcast once, another status
  broadcast is not sent unless some changes are made locally to that public
  folder.

- Each time a change is made, the status send time is set to 24 hours from the
  time that the change was made. The network is not flooded with the same
  status message over and over. Instead, the message is sent more than once
  only if something has changed.
