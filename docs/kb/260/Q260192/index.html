SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable a Container Level Search control for Address Book Views (ABV)
according the following article,

  Q182902 XADM: How To Setup Container Level Search Control

a mailbox is a member of more than one ABV container, and the Primary Microsoft
Windows NT account of this mailbox has Search control permissions on all ABV
containers for which they are a member.

When this user logs on to the mailbox and views the contents of the Global
Address List, the user may expect to see the contents of all ABV containers for
which their mailbox is a member. The user can still view the contents of all ABV
containers by specifically choosing this ABV container from the list in the
Outlook Address Book; however, the Global Address List only displays the
contents of one ABV container where this mailbox resides.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

If you enable the Container Level Search control, a user can only see the
contents of the largest ABV container in the Global Address List for which they
are a member.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this example, an Exchange organization has two ABVs. One is called
"ABV-Office" (without quotation marks), and the other is called "ABV-Dept"
(without quotation marks). ABV-Office is sorted by the attribute Office, and
this ABV contains an ABV container that has a grouping value of "SEATTLE"
(without quotation marks). ABV-Dept is sorted by the Department attribute, and
it contains an ABV container that has a grouping value of "MARKETING" (without
quotation marks).

If a mailbox has an Office attribute of SEATTLE and a Department attribute of
MARKETING, this mailbox is displayed in both ABV containers. Assuming that there
are more employees in the SEATTLE office than in the MARKETING department, the
user who logs on to this mailbox sees the contents of the ABV container that has
a grouping value of SEATTLE in the Global Address List because this container
has a larger membership than the ABV container that is grouped by MARKETING.
