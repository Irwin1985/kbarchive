-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user on a client workstation does not see the status of a program when the
server is busy updating the System.lkp file. The program does not run and no
status is displayed in Advertisement Program Manager (APM) until the server is
done updating the System.lkp file.

CAUSE
=====

If you schedule a program to run immediately by using the APM Wizard and the
offer file was updated more than 15 minutes ago, the program does not run. Also,
the client does not log an execution request for that program. The user on the
client workstation must manually run the package again for a successful
completion.

If a client is offered a large number of programs, the Offer Data providers can
take a long time to run. APM does not run an advertisement while the Offer Data
providers are running. If an administrator constantly adds or updates offers,
the program may never run, even with a 15-minute interval. The Offer Data
providers run for 20 to 30 minutes. In this case, the .lkp file is more than 15
minutes out of date before the program can be rescheduled.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
