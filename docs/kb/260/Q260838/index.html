The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a malicious user provides a password change request that is missing an
expected delimiter, the algorithm conducts an unbounded search. This prevents
the servicing of additional HTR requests, and can also slow the overall response
of the server.

CAUSE
=====

The body of the request for a HTR page is assumed to be valid.
