-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Novell Server is replaced with a Windows NT Server running Microsoft File
and Print Services for NetWare, Novell clients may start receiving Access Denied
messages when trying to connect. In addition, the domain controller that the
FPNW server has a secure channel with may no longer be visible on the network.

CAUSE
=====

When a printer is configured for NetWare, JetAdmin is run to give the printer a
server name and a user name to logon with. The printer then tries to logon to
the specified server. If the Novell server is removed and a Windows NT Server is
put in its place with the FPNW server software configured with the same name as
the old Novell server, the printers will contact the FPNW server to logon. Since
the Windows NT computer is a resource server, it must pass the logon request to
a domain controller (DC). The code through LSA that is run by FPNW requests
contains a path where a security object is opened, but never closed. The
printers exacerbate the leak Because they continually try to logon.

WORKAROUND
==========

Correctly configuring the printers so they no longer attempt to logon will
eliminate the handle leak as well as the extra RPC traffic on the network.
Installing the fix for the LSA handle leak will eliminate the handle leak.
However, unless the printers are configured correctly, you will still have the
additional RPC traffic that is generated when trying to authenticate the printer
logon requests.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected in the latest Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

NOTE: JetDirect is no longer supported by HP. SDI (Simple Device Installation) is
now used to install network printers. For more information on this, see:

  http://www.hp.com/cgi-bin/cposupport/ccsearch/getdoc?doc=bpj05973

  or

  http://www.hp.com/cposupport/networking/support_doc/bpj06765.html

HP recommends a new software admin package (TCP/IP / IPX/SPX based). For further
information see:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack and
Windows NT 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
