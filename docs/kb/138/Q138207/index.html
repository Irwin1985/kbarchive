MORE INFORMATION
================

README file for Downloading
---------------------------

Encarta 96 Encyclopedia Web Site ReadMe

This folder contains files used with the Microsoft Encarta 96 Encyclopedia
CD-ROM. The following files are in this folder:

- Enc96fix.exe: This file fixes a problem with non- appearing article updates.
  For more information, see Enc96fix.exe, below.

- Sep95a.eyb: This file is the September 1995 yearbook builder update for the
  Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.

- Readme.doc: This file contains troubleshooting and downloading information.

- Readme.txt: An ASCII version of this file.

- Enc96fix.exe: Read this section if you are running Windows 95 and you chose
  Slower Execution during setup.

This file corrects a problem with the Windows 95 registry occurring when you
select the slower execution option when setting up Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.
(This problem does not occur with the faster execution option.) The result of
the registry problem is the Yearbook Builder article updates cannot be seen in
the Yearbook Builder browser, and the icon indicates an article has been updated
does not appear.

To Test for and Repair the Registry Problem
-------------------------------------------

1. In Encarta 96 Encyclopedia, click on Find and open the article on Yugoslavia.
  For more information about using Pinpointer to search for articles, see
  online Help.

2. Examine the article's title bar, the black bar containing the word
  Yugoslavia.

  If the title bar has a yellow yearbook icon at its right- hand side, you can
  click on the icon to bring up an update called The Shameful Ending of
  Yugoslavia, then your encyclopedia is installed correctly and you don't need
  to proceed to step three.

  If the title bar doesn't have a yearbook icon at its right-hand side, then
  proceed to step three.

3. Download and run Enc96fix.exe. Your encyclopedia is repaired.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Article Update Icons Don't Appear

- Users who choose the Slow execution option when setting up Encarta 96

- Encyclopedia may not be able to see the update icons in encyclopedia
  articles.

  To fix this problem, download the Enc96fix.EXE file from the FTP site and run
  it on your computer

- Error Occurs During Article Integration

  If an error occurs after you click the Integrate button in Yearbook Builder,
  download the update installment (the .eyb file) again and click on Integrate
  in Yearbook Builder again.

- Downloading Yearbook Builder Updates

  The below downloading instructions are specific to two popular browsing
  applications.

NOTE: If an error occurs after you click the Integrate button in the Yearbook
Builder feature, download the update installment (the .eyb file) again and click
on Integrate in Yearbook Builder again.
