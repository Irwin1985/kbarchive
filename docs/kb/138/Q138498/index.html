SUMMARY
=======

Both the AddItem and AddListItem methods add items to combo boxes or list boxes.
This article highlights their functionality and the differences between the two
methods. In particular, this article demonstrates why the AddListitem method
might be a better way to populate a multiple-column combo box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Additem and AddlistItem methods add items to a list and accept two optional
parameters. The differences between the two methods are mirrored in the
differences between their first parameter; AddItem accepts nListIndex as its
first parameter, and AddListItem accepts nListItemId as its first parameter.

There are two ways to identify an item in a list:

- Its relative position, which represents the order in which the items are
  displayed in the list. If an item is added to the list, the relative position
  of other items might change. This is similar to the index order of a table.
  The integer that holds this value is referred as nIndex.

- Its absolute position, which represents the order in which the item is added
  to the list. This value is not dependent on the way items are displayed in
  the list, and it does not change as the number of items in the list are
  modified. This concept is similar to the RECNO() function, which is used to
  identify records in a table. The integer that holds this value is referred as
  nItemId.

These two numbers can be identical, but they are different when the list is
sorted, or when items are added or removed from the list.

The Additem method inserts an item based on its relative position in the list.
The syntax is:

  Control.AddItem(cItem [, nIndex] [, nColumn])

The AddListItem method allows you to create a unique id for the item, and uses
nItemId. If the item already exists, the prompt is replaced. The syntax is:

  Control.AddListItem(cItem [, nItemID] [, nColumn])

The following example illustrates how to use the Additem and AddListItem methods.
To run the example, copy and paste the code in a program file.

Sample Code
-----------

  Omyform=CREATE('myform')
  Omyform.Show()
  READ EVENTS

  DEFINE Class myform AS Form
     ADD OBJECT list1 AS mylist
     ADD OBJECT list2 AS mylist2
     ADD OBJECT cmd1 AS cmdquit
  ENDDEFINE

  DEFINE Class cmdquit AS CommandButton
     Top=105
     Left = 55
     Caption="Quit"
     PROCEDURE Click
        CLEAR EVENTS
        RELEASE Thisform
     ENDPROC
  ENDDEFINE

  DEFINE Class mylist AS ListBox &amp;&amp; Defines a list filled with Additem
     Top = 3
     Left=5
     Width=90
     Height=90
     RowSourceType=0
     PROCEDURE Init
        This.AddItem('Apples',1)
        This.AddItem('Oranges',2)
        This.AddItem('Lemons',2)  &amp;&amp; Element inserted before 'Oranges'
     ENDPROC
  ENDDEFINE

  DEFINE Class mylist2 AS ListBox &amp;&amp;Defines a list filled with AddListitem
     Top = 3
     Left=100
     Width=90
     Height=90
     RowSourceType=0

     PROCEDURE Init
        This.AddListItem('Apples',1)
        This.AddListItem('Oranges',2)
        This.AddListItem('Lemons',2) &amp;&amp; Prompt overwrites 'Oranges'
     ENDPROC
  ENDDEFINE

Multiple-Column List Boxes
--------------------------

The AddItem method might not yield expected results when it is used to populate a
multiple-column list box. The following step-by-step example illustrates how the
elements of a multiple-column list box are displayed when the AddItem method is
used.

1. Create a form.

2. Place a list box on the form.

3. Change the following properties of the list box:

     ColumnCount : 2
     ColumnWidths: 80,80

4. Save the form as TestForm, and run it.

5. In the Command window, type:

     TestForm.List1.AddItem("One",1,1)
     TestForm.List1.AddItem("Two",1,2)
     TestForm.List1.AddItem("Three",2,1)
     TestForm.List1.AddItem("Four",2,2)

The resulting list looks as follows:

   ---------------------
   |         |   Two    |
   |         |   Four   |
   | Three   |          |
   | One     |          |
   ---------------------

This occurs because the AddItem inserts each item at the relative position
specified by the nIndex integer.

Use the ListItemId to populate a multiple-column combo box and add items on the
same row. By using the example above and replacing AddItem with AddListItem, the
list looks like this:

  ------------------------
  | One       | Two      |
  | Three     | Four     |
  ------------------------

For more information about the AddItem and AddListItem methods, search for
"AddItem" or "AddListItem" in the Visual FoxPro Help file.
