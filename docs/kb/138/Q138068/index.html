SUMMARY
=======

A Visual Basic 4.0 form object can exist in five possible states:

1. Unloaded

2. Created but not loaded

3. Invisible but loaded (hidden)

4. Visible

5. Unloaded but control is loaded

Four of these states (1, 3, 4, and 5) existed in Visual Basic version 3.0 also.
The new state in Visual Basic version 4.0 is the "Created but not loaded" state.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unloaded
--------

In this state the form hasn't been loaded yet. It does not exist.

Created But Not Loaded
----------------------

This is new in Visual Basic version 4.0. To explain this state, it is beneficial
to think of the form as having two parts: a code part and a visual part. Think
of the code part as including all the methods and properties that may be defined
in the form module (this part is new in Visual Basic version 4.0). Think of the
visual part as all the rest such as the form properties in the Property window
(this part is same for Visual Basic version 3.0 and Visual Basic version 4.0).

In Visual Basic version 4.0, forms are objects. When you use an auto-
instantiating variable to refer to a user-defined property or method (that is,
any member in the code part), the Form object is created but not loaded (that
is, only the code part of it is loaded). This means that the Initialize and
Terminate Events for the form are invoked.

Say there is a Sub procedure called MyMethod defined in the form module. Then the
following code illustrates the semi-loaded state of a form:

     Dim x As New Form1
     x.MyMethod

Invisible But Loaded (Hidden)
-----------------------------

In this state, the form is loaded and then its Visible property is set to False.
The line of demarcation for this state is the execution of the Form_Load()
event.

Visible
-------

The normal state of the form being loaded and then shown.

Unloaded But Control is Loaded
------------------------------

You get into this state by loading the form, setting a reference to a control on
the form, and then unloading the form. The reference to the control still stays
alive.

This can be a very dangerous state to leave your form in because on unloading the
form, the code in the Form_Unload() event is executed, yet the form and its
controls are not destroyed. The Form object and all the objects it contains
still exist. What's more, they will be loaded back into memory, with all their
current property values and states, the moment your code uses that control
reference, even if its just to query a property of the "loaded" control. The
dangerous part is that the Form_Load() event will not be executed. It is as if
you just made the form visible again.
