SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article details changes and updates contained in the
Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD), for Windows NT 3.5x, version 1.16. The
information for this article was taken directly from the NTREADME.HLP file found
on the SSD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 1.16 release of the Compaq Support Software Diskette for Windows NT 3.5x (NT
SSD) contains the following new features and maintenance modifications:

New Features in Compaq NT SSD Version 1.16 Pass B
-------------------------------------------------

Compaq On-Line Recovery Server Option:

New support that provides automated switch over for pairs of Compaq servers
connected via a serial link. The system is composed of the Compaq ProLiant
Storage, Recovery Server switch and the On-Line Recovery agent. If one system
fails, the surviving server detects the failure and causes the switch of the
drives from the failed server to itself. This feature is listed in the SSD as
option line-item Compaq On-Line Recovery Server.

New Features in Compaq NT SSD Version 1.16 Pass A
-------------------------------------------------

Compaq NT SSD Setup:

Added the option line-item Convert to Uniprocessor Support when downgrading from
a multi to single processor unit.

Added the option line-item Upgrade to Multiprocessor Support when upgrading from
a single to multiprocessor-processor unit.

Added the option line-item Compaq On-Line Recovery Agent for support.

Compaq HAL Support:

Added new support for the Advanced Program Interrupt Controller (APIC) for dual
processor support (HALMPS.DLL)

Fixed a problem where the /PRINT option in BOOT.INI can now work with the
crashdump utility.

Fixed a problem where a time delay was occurring per array controller during
shutdown with a Compaq Array Controller installed in the system

Added a /MOVEINT BOOT.INI option. (See the Compaq HAL features for more detailed
information).

Compaq 32-Bit SCSI-2 Controllers SCSI Miniport Driver:

Fixed a problem where the driver was not detecting disabled Compaq 32-Bit
Fast-Wide SCSI-2 /E controllers.

Updated NCR SCSI processor script code

Additional code and resource optimizations

Compaq ProLiant  Storage System Driver:

Fixed a problem where the device indicator information in the device slot pages
were not being updated when indicator states changed.

Compaq SCSI Compression/Options Adapter SCSI Miniport Driver:

Removed driver support. Driver supporting this adapter is located on Compaq NT
SSD Version 1.15 and earlier.

Compaq Systems Management Driver:

Fixed a problem where under heavy stress the system will experience a lock up.
This problem will only occur on Compaq ProLiant 4000 and ProLiant 4500 installed
with 4 processors.

Compaq Integrated NetFlex-L Driver:

Modified interrupt routine to be able to see an Apple Talk Network on a Windows
NT system.

Fixed a problem where the correct maximum lookahead value was not getting
reported correctly.

Fixed a problem where the All Multicast list was getting overwritten by a request
to change to receive a specific multicast list.

Compaq NetFlex-2 Driver:

Fixed a problem where the adapter might not initialize because of timeout events
with assigning interrupts.
