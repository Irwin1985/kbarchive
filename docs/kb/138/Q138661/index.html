-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the AS clause is used to rename a field in the Query or View designer, it
will be lost when the Query or View is reopened. As long as the Query or View is
created and saved, the AS clause remains and works correctly. If the Query or
View is modified, then the AS clause will disappear.

WORKAROUND
==========

A query can be created with FoxPro's SELECT - SQL statement. The following
example will create a query.

     SELECT &lt;tablename.fieldname&gt; AS custom_name FROM ;
         &lt;tablename&gt; INTO CURSOR queryname

A view can be created with FoxPro's CREATE SQL VIEW statement. The following
example will create a local view.

     CREATE SQL VIEW mysqlview AS SELECT &lt;tablename.fieldname&gt; AS ;
         custom_name FROM &lt;database container.tablename&gt;

Instead of opening the Query or View designer and losing the AS clause, the code
can be changed in a .prg file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Query or View designer, a field can be assigned another name using the AS
clause. This is done under the Fields tab in the Functions/Expressions box.
Typing the field name and adding the AS clause with a name after it gives the
field the name that follows the AS clause. For example,

     customer.cust_id AS Customer_Id

gives the field customer.cust_id the name of Customer_Id when browsed.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Creating a Query:

1. Select the File menu pad and choose New. Click the Query radio button and
  choose the New File button. Select a table from the "Add Table or View"
  window.

2. Choose the Fields tab and type the name of a field from the table in the
  Functions/Expressions box, followed by "AS custom_name" (without the
  quotation marks).

3. Click the Add button to place the expression In the Selected Output box.

4. Run the query, and note that the field has the title of "custom_name." Save
  and close the query after giving it a name. Reopen the query and choose the
  Fields tab. Note that the field in the Selected Output box no longer contains
  the AS clause.

Creating a View:

1. A database container must be open to create a view and it has to be opened
  exclusively. So, make sure Exclusive is on by typing "SET EXCLUSIVE ON"
  (without the quotation marks) in the Command window. Then, open a database
  container.

2. From the File menu, click New. Click the View radio button, and then click
  the New File button. Select a table from the "Add Table or View" window.

3. Click the Fields tab and type the name of a field from the table in the
  Functions/Expressions box, followed by "AS custom_name" (without the
  quotation marks).

4. Click the Add button to place the expression In the Selected Output box.

5. Run the view and note that the field has the title of "custom_name." Save and
  close the view after giving it a name. Reopen the view and click the Fields
  tab. Note that the field in the Selected Output box no longer contains the AS
  clause.
