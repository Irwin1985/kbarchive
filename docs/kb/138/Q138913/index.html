SUMMARY
=======

The record marker is the small box on the leftmost side of each record in the
grid. There will be a black arrow in the record marker of the current record if
the grid has the focus. The record marker of a grid does not move when scrolling
though a table if the grid does not have the focus as the record pointer is
being moved.

If the grid does not have focus, then the record marker will not appear beside
the current record until the grid receives the focus. The record marker box is
available only if the RecordMark property of the grid is set to true. Use the
SetFocus property to make the record marker of the grid refresh every time a
record is moved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Demonstration
--------------------------

1. Create a new form and place a grid on it. While the mouse pointer is over the
  grid, click the right mouse button, and then click the Builder to place
  fields in the grid easily.

2. Place a command button on the form and add the following code to its Click
  event:

     SKIP

3. Run the form and note that the record marker doesn't appear in the grid until
  the grid is clicked.

4. Close the form, and then modify it, adding the following line of code after
  the SKIP command in the Click event of the command button:

     THISFORM.GRID1.SETFOCUS()

5. Run the form and click the command button. Note that the record marker moves
  as the record pointer of the table is moved with the command button.

Adding the Next and Previous Buttons
------------------------------------

If you are using command buttons created by the Form Wizard, place the following
code in the Next button of the command button group:

     TXTBTNS.CMDNEXT::CLICK
     THISFORM.GRID1.SETFOCUS()

This will call the code in the Click event of the base class of the Next button.
To make the Prior button work, change the CMDNEXT to CMDPRIOR in the above
code.

Setting the focus to the grid each time that the record pointer is moved allows
the record marker to be updated. If another object on the form is clicked, the
record marker will disappear until the grid receives the focus again.
