SYMPTOMS
========

After entering the path to the project file in Setup Wizard and selecting next,
you receive this error:

  &lt;An invalid pathname with two drive specifiers&gt; File not found. An
  error occurred while trying to build the project .exe or .dll

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when, before running the Setup Wizard, you choose to make an
.exe file in a directory one or more levels higher in the directory tree than
the directory where your project files are located.

For example, if your .vbp file is in C:\Myprogs\Prog1 and you choose to make the
.exe file in C:\, C:\Myprogs, or C:\Myprogs\Prog2, you may encounter this
problem.

The Setup Wizard always tries to recompile your project, but it fails while
making the attempt. The Setup Wizard will correctly handle the case where the
.exe is made in a subdirectory of the directory where the .vbp file is located.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use either of the following two methods to resolve the problem:

- Before running the Setup Wizard, from within Visual Basic, make the .exe file
  in the directory containing the .vbp file -- or in a subdirectory.

-or-

- Using a text editor like Notepad, modify the Path32 line in your .vbp file to
  point to your .exe file relative to the directory where your .vbp file is
  located. For example, if the .exe file is in C:\Temp and the project file is
  in C:\Vb, change the Path32 line so that it has an entry of ..\Temp. The
  problem with this solution is that the change is only temporary. The next
  time you save the project from Visual Basic 4.0, Visual Basic will force this
  line to be absolute again, overwriting your change.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic.

2. Using the File Manager or Explorer, create a new temporary subdirectory on
  the root directory (for example, C:\Newtemp).

3. On the File menu, click Make EXE. Change the path for where the new .exe file
  will reside from the default of C:\Vb to the new temporary directory you just
  created. Click OK to make the new .exe file. It will reside in the temporary
  directory you created.

4. On the File menu, click Save Project, and save the default Form1.frm and
  Project1.vbp files in the C:\Vb directory.

5. Exit Visual Basic, and start the Setup Wizard.

6. When prompted for a path to the project file, give the Setup Wizard
  C:\Vb\Project1.vbp, and click Next. The Setup Wizard will minimize, and
  Visual Basic will start, but then Visual Basic will exit without compiling
  your project. At that point, the Setup Wizard will display the error saying
  that it couldn't find the file.
