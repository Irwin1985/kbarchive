The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to implement the %SERVERNAME% environment variable in
the user profile path of the Windows NT User Manager. This environment variable
must be set on the workstation computer, not the domain controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you have configured a user's profile path in User Manager, the entry looks
similar to this:

  UserProfiles User Profile Path: \\%SERVERNAME%\profiles\user1.usr

The %SERVERNAME% variable provides load balancing and performance improvements.
As Administrator, you can spread the load of processing user profiles to another
server by setting the SERVERNAME environment variable to the name that is
located close to the workstation. When a user logs into the domain, they are
directed to \\%SERVERNAME%, where %SERVERNAME% has been set to the name of a
server, for example, "Server1".

The profile server should be close to the client's computer (not located across a
slow link) to expedite log on. For example, on all workstations in Phoenix, set
the variable to a Server name that is located in Phoenix. On workstations in
Seattle, set the variable to a Server name that is located in Seattle. That way,
when a user is in Phoenix, his or her logon script is executed on a controller
in Phoenix. When that user visits Seattle, his or her logon script is executed
on a controller in Seattle.

Setting the Environment Variable On Workstation Using A Server
--------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Log on to a to the domain as "Administrator".

2. Run the Registry Editor (REGEDIT32.EXE) and select the workstation's computer
  name from the list.

3. Be sure to select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE of the workstation you have
  connected to, not your computers' HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

4. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Mgr\Environment

5. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

6. Enter the following:

  Value Name: SERVERNAME
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String: &lt;Server1&gt;

7. Click OK and quit the Registry Editor.

8. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

9. Open User Manager on a domain controller.

10. Edit one of the user accounts. For example:"user1". In the Profile, set the
  User's Profile Path to:
  \\%SERVERNAME%\share\user1.usr
  Make sure that there is a shared directory on Server1.

11. Exit User Manager.

12. Enter the User Profile Editor.

13. Select the user that you want to access this profile, "user1".

14. Make the appropriate changes.

15. Save this to a file and place it on \\&lt;Server1&gt;\&lt;share&gt;.

16. Have the user log on to the domain.

NOTE: The directory where the profiles reside must be shared. In this example,
the directory PROFILES was given a share name of "share". This must be done on
every Server that participates. In this case, there is only one Server (Server1)
involved.
