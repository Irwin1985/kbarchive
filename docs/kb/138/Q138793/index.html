SUMMARY
=======

MPR (Multi-Protocol Router) consists of the following: RIP (Routing Information
Protocol) for TCP/IP, BOOTP (Boot Protocol) relay agent for DHCP, and RIP for
IPX. RIP is used by routers to dynamically exchange routing information. With
RIP for IP and RIP for IPX installed, Windows NT will route these protocols and
dynamically exchange routing information with other routers running the RIP
protocol. The BOOTP relay agent will allow the Windows NT Router to forward DHCP
requests to DHCP servers on other subnets. This allows one DHCP server to
service multiple IP subnets. See Riproute.wri in the MPR directory for
additional documentation on MPR.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installation
------------

MPR requires Windows NT Server 3.51 and Service Pack 2. In addition, two or more
network cards are needed for full MPR functionality.

To install MPR:

1. Run UPDATE.EXE from the MPR\i386 directory (or the directory for the
  appropriate hardware type) on the Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 2 CD-ROM
  disc.

  Update.exe copies files to your Windows NT installation and make new software
  choices available under Control Panel Network (Add Software).

  NOTE: You need to run this UPDATE.EXE program in addition to the UPDATE.EXE
  program used to install Service Pack 2.

2. Run Control Panel, click Network, and click Add Software.

3. Select RIP for Internet Protocol, Bootp Relay Agent, or RIP for NWlink
  IPX/SPX compatible transport, and then click Continue.

4. When prompted, provide the path for the MPR distribution files (for example,
  D:\MPR\I386).

WARNING: After you install RIP, Windows NT will start exchanging routing
information with other RIP routers. If you have misconfigured the IP address of
your network cards or used a fake IP address, this could have a severe impact on
your network. Do not install RIP without fully understanding TCP/IP and the
design of your network.


RIP for IP, Configuration and Troubleshooting
---------------------------------------------

No manual configuration is needed. After installing RIP for IP, the Enable IP
Routing box in Advanced TCP/IP configuration will automatically be selected. RIP
for IP runs as a service and can be stopped and started using Control Panel
Services.

To see what routes your computer has, type ROUTE PRINT at the Windows NT Command
Prompt. This will show the routes that Windows NT creates by default, and routes
learned through RIP.

If RIP for IP is installed on a computer that has only one network card, it is
configured for Silent Mode. In Silent Mode, Windows NT listens to RIP broadcasts
and updates its route table but does not advertise its own routes. If an
additional network card is later installed in the computer, RIP will
automatically turn off Silent Mode and enable IP routing.

Bootp Relay Agent, Configuration and Troubleshooting
----------------------------------------------------

After you install the BOOTP Relay Agent you will be prompted with a configuration
screen. You must enter the IP address of DHCP servers that you would like to
send DHCP requests to. Maximum Hops and Seconds Threshold can be left at the
defaults. If you later need to change the configuration, click the Config Relay
Agent button under Advanced TCP/IP Configuration.

RIP for NWlink IPX/SPX compatible Transport,
Configuration and Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When installing RIP for NWlink, Setup displays a message that NetBIOS Broadcast
Propagation (broadcast of type 20 packet) is currently disabled. If you are
using NetBIOS over IPX or are unsure, choose Yes to enable broadcast of type 20
packets. Reboot the computer as directed. Type 20 broadcast can be later
configured by selecting RIP for NWlink IPX in Control Panel Network and clicking
configure.

Enable RIP Routing is automatically selected when you install RIP for NWlink IPX.
RIP for NWlink IPX can be enabled or disabled by clicking Enable RIP Routing in
NWlink IPX/SPX Protocol Configuration. The SAP agent is automatically installed
with RIP for NWlink IPX. SAP is a service, and can be started and stopped from
Control Panel Services. Microsoft recommends that you configure the Internal
Network number through the NWLink configuration in Control Panel Network. If you
do not, a random number will be generated for you.

The command line utility Ipxroute.exe has been updated and can be used to get
RIP, SAP, and source routing information and statistics.

For more information on MPR, refer to Riproute.wri in the Windows NT 3.51 Service
Pack 2 CD-ROM disc \MPR directory.
