The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The installation of Microsoft SNA Server on Citrix's OEM version of Windows NT
requires specific steps which are documented by Citrix. There are specific
requirements depending on whether SNA Server Version 2.11 or 3.0 will be
installed.

The required steps are documented in either the Help file that is included with
the Citrix Winframe software or in application notes provided by Citrix.
Additional information can also be located on Citrix's Website (www.citrix.com).

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server 2.11 (all service packs):

The following is an excerpt from the Winframe Help file and pertains only to
2.11:

SNA Server and Client Installation

For the SNA Server-based installation on a WinFrame application server, follow
the instructions as described in the Microsoft SNA Server Installation Guide.

However, installing on a WinFrame application server has an additional caveat.
There are three files that must be registered as system global. Follow the
procedures below:

1. From the SNA Server Setup Finish dialog box, choose the Exit button.

2. From the Main Group, start an MS DOS Prompt.

3. REGISTER SNADMOD.DLL /SYSTEM
  REGISTER SNAMANAG.DLL /SYSTEM
  REGISTER SNAADMIN.EXE /SYSTEM

4. Type "NET START SNABASE" (without the quotation marks) and press Enter.

Configuration

To configure the Microsoft SNA Server connection, LU and users, follow the
instructions as described in the Microsoft SNA Server Administration Guide.

SNA Server 3.0 (all service packs):

Citrix WinFrame Version 1.6 or higher with Service Pack 5 and Hotfix SE165075 is
required when using SNA Server 3.0.

There are three known issues when installing SNA Server 3.0 on Cirtrix Winframe
1.6.

1. SNA Setup causes an exception in PROGMAN.EXE when Winframe Service Pack 5 is
  installed.

2. Installation of SNA Server is very slow on WinFrame.

3. SNA system EXEs and DLLs must be registered system global in order to run SNA
  Server.

To Install Microsoft SNA Server on a WinFrame Server
----------------------------------------------------

SNA Server is installed by executing the program SETUP.EXE on the SNA Server
compact disk. This is a 16-bit program that calls the actual 32-bit install
program ACMSETUP.EXE. Because of a WinFrame performance tuning Registry entry,
SETUP.EXE consumes nearly 100% of the CPU while running in the background
Because of this, ACMSETUP.EXE does not receive enough CPU resources to complete
in a timely fashion. The procedure below modifies the performance tuning
parameters to allow SNA Server to install properly, and restores the settings
after installation.

1. Install WinFrame on your server hardware.

2. After installing WinFrame , obtain and apply WinFrame Service Pack 5. You can
  download Service Pack 5 from the Citrix Web site:

  http://www.citrix.com.

3. Obtain and apply WinFrame Hotfix WF160514. As of 08/13/97, use SE165075.EXE
  because it is the replacement hotfix for WF160514 which is no longer on the
  FTP server. You can download hotfixes from the Citrix Web site. If you do not
  apply Hotfix WF160514 after applying Service Pack 5, the SNA Setup program
  will cause a trap in PROGMAN.EXE when you attempt to install SNA Server 3.0.

4. Log on as an administrator.

5. At a command prompt, type regedt32 and press Enter.

6. Locate the Registry key:

  \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Citrix\Compatibility\Applications\SETUP

7. Change the value MsgQBadAppSleepTimeInMillisec: REG_DWORD from 0 to 1.

8. Save the changes and exit the Registry Editor.

9. At a command prompt, enter the following commands:

  "change user /install
  setbuild /ms" (without the quotation marks)

10. Install Microsoft SNA Server and SNA Client according to the supplied
  installation instructions in the SNA Server documentation.

11. At a command prompt, type regedt32 and press Enter.

12. Locate the Registry key:

  \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Citrix\Compatibility\Applications\SETUP

13. Change the value MsgQBadAppSleepTimeInMillisec: REG_DWORD from 1 to 0.

14. Save the changes and exit the Registry Editor.

15. Use change user /execute to return the session to execute mode.

16. Use Notepad (or another text editor) to create a batch file named SNAREG.CMD
  that contains the following commands:

     @ECHO OFF
     REM *** SNAREG.CMD: Batch file to register SNA Server 3.0 ***
     REM *** files system global ***
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNADMOD.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNAMANAG.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\WAPPC32.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\DBGTRACE.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\MNGBASE.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNATRC.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNALM.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNANW.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNAIP.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNABASE.EXE /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNASERVR.EXE /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNASII.DLL /SYSTEM
     REGISTER %SNAROOT%\SNALINK.DLL /SYSTEM

  This file contains commands used to register some SNA executable files and
  DLLs as system global. Save the file and exit Notepad.

17. Before executing the SNAREG.CMD batch file, you must stop the SNABase
  service or the batch file will not function properly. To stop the SNABase
  service:
  a. After installing SNA Server 3.0, run the Services application in Control
     Panel. The Services dialog box appears.

  b. Select the SNABase service in the Service list box and then click the
     Startup button. The Service Startup dialog box appears.

  c. Select Disabled in the Startup Type box and then click OK.

  d. Click the Close button in the main Services dialog box.

  e. Exit Control Panel. Shutdown and reboot the WinFrame server.

  f. Logon to WinFrame as an administrator.

  g. Start a command prompt session and execute the SNAREG.CMD batch file.

  h. After the SNAREG.CMD batch file has completed, run the Services
     application in Control Panel. The Services dialog box appears.

  i. Select the SNABase service in the Service list box and then click the
     Startup button. The Service Startup dialog box appears.

  j. Select Automatic in the Startup Type box and then click OK.

  k. Click the Close button in the main Services dialog box.

  l. Exit Control Panel. Shutdown and reboot the WinFrame server.

18. Configure SNA Server as required for your installation according to the SNA
  Server 3.0 documentation.

Note: If you upgrade to SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 3, it is necessary to stop
the snabase service and re-register all the DLLs mentioned in step 16.
Otherwise, the SNA Server connections may remain in a "Pending" state and not
activate correctly.
