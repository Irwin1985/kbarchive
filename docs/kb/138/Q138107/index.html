-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Foxuser resource file is saved in the same directory as an executable and
this Foxuser file has been created with any toolbars visible, when the
executable is first run, the toolbars will appear. The toolbars, however, will
be inactive and if closed, will not reappear upon restarting the executable.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by having the Foxuser resource file in the same directory as the
executable. The Foxuser file is a resource file that records the state of the
development environment when last used. It retains such settings as window
placement and the toolbars that were left visible when Visual FoxPro was closed.
If a Foxuser resource file is not in the same directory as the executable when
this behavior occurs, it could be because there is a PATH= system variable set
to a directory that contains a Foxuser resource file. This may or may not be the
Foxuser resource file that is maintained in the Vfp directory. Other Foxuser
files may exist that are being referenced by the executable via the PATH= system
variable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Include in the directory with the executable a Foxuser resource file that has
been created with the toolbars inactive or not visible.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project in a different directory from Visual FoxPro.

2. Make a new form, and place a command button on it. In the button's Click
  event, place this line of code:

     CLEAR EVENTS

3. In the activate event of the form, place this line of code:

     READ EVENTS

4. Build the project into an executable in the directory created in step 1.

5. Close the project.

6. Before quitting Visual FoxPro, on the View menu, click Toolbars, and then
  select a couple of the check boxes of the toolbars. Click OK.

7. Quit Visual FoxPro.

8. Copy the Foxuser and Foxuser.fpt files from the Vfp directory to the same
  directory in which you built the executable.

9. Double-click the executable. The toolbars left open when you closed Visual
  FoxPro appear. The toolbars are not of any use and if undocked can be closed
  by clicking the close box in the upper-right of the title bar.

10. Click the button to exit the program. Restart the program to see that the
  toolbars are no longer visible.
