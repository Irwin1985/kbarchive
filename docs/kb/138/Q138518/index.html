SUMMARY
=======

The WindowFromPoint and ChildWindowFromPoint API functions require that a Point
structure be passed by value. Visual Basic is not capable of passing a structure
by value, only by reference. However, it is possible to pass the elements of the
user-defined type in the correct order so that these API functions can be used.
This article explains and demonstrates how to pass the Point structure by value
to the API in the 16-bit and 32-bit editions of Visual Basic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 16-bit API is unusal because it allows you to pass the Point
structure to the WindowFromPoint functions by value. Typically, user- defined
types are passed to functions by reference because passing them by value can use
up a lot of stack space and be much slower than passing the address of the
structure. An exception was made for the Point structure in certain functions
(such as ChildWindowFromPoint and WindowFromPoint) because in 16-bit programming
the size of the structure was only 32 bits long, which is the same length as a
far address anyway.

However, on a 32-bit operating system, this structure becomes 64 bits. To
preserve compatibility, Microsoft decided that the Point structure should still
be passed by value for these two API functions in the 32-bit user dynamic link
library (DLL).

Visual Basic is not capable of passing structures by value, but the value of the
elements of the structure can be placed on the stack in the correct order.
Therefore, when passing the elements of the Point structure in 32-bit
programming, two long values should be passed. When passing the elements in
16-bit programming, two integers should be passed to the function.

Another important consideration is that 32-bit Visual Basic uses the C convention
(stdcall) of passing parameters. This convention specifies that arguments are
placed on the stack from right to left. 16-Bit Visual Basic maintains the Pascal
convention of passing parameters from left to right. (API functions are declared
using the Pascal calling convention.) As a result, the elements of the structure
must be listed in reverse order (that is, element y followed by x) when calling
the WindowFromPoint function using 32-Bit Visual Basic. When using 16-bit Visual
Basic, element x is passed to the API function before element y.

Step-by-Step Example of How to Call the WindowFromPoint API
-----------------------------------------------------------

The code in the following example uses conditional compilation so that the code
can be placed in either the 16-bit or 32-bit version of Visual Basic.

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Change the ScaleMode of the form to 3 - Pixels. (The coordinates of the Point
  must be passed in pixels.)

3. Insert a new code module in the project (on the Insert menu, click New
  Module). Place the following code in the new module:

     #If Win32 Then
     Declare Function WindowFromPointXY Lib "User32" _
         Alias "WindowFromPoint" (ByVal xPoint As Long, _
         ByVal yPoint As Long) As Long
     #Else
     Declare Function WindowFromPointYX Lib "User" _
         Alias "WindowFromPoint" (ByVal yPoint As Integer, ByVal _
         xPoint As Integer) As Integer
     #End If

     Function VBWindowFromPoint(ByVal x As Long, ByVal y As Long) As Long
     #If Win32 Then
         VBWindowFromPoint = WindowFromPointXY(x, y)
     #Else
         VBWindowFromPoint = WindowFromPointYX(y, x)
     #End If
     End Function

4. Place the following code in the MouseDown event of Form1:

     ' Convert form coordinates to screen coordinates
     screenX = X + Form1.Left / Screen.TwipsPerPixelX
     screenY = Y + Form1.Top / Screen.TwipsPerPixelY

     ' Retrieve the window handle
     hWindow = VBWindowFromPoint(screenX, screenY)

     If hWindow = Form1.hWnd Then
     MsgBox "Success"
     End If

5. Run the code by pressing the F5 key. Click Form1. The message box should
  appear indicating that the API call successfully returned the window handle
  of Form1.
