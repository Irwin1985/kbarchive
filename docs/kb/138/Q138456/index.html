SUMMARY
=======

This article explains what Visual FoxPro Builders are and outlines some of the
points about Builders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro Builders are tools that help you set properties for a specific
control. For example, you can use a ListBox Builder to set the properties for a
list box or a Grid Builder to set properties for a grid. Builders facilitate the
process of setting up objects with the proper set of attributes (property
values).

Builders are different from wizards in that builders are re-entrant. That is, a
builder can be used repeatedly on an object without altering or destroying the
original attributes the object possesses. For example, when you are creating a
screen that has a command button group and you decide to add an extra command
button, you can reuse the builder to do it.

Wizards, however, are not re-entrant. They are intended to be used once to create
a usable item such as a simple data entry screen. Runnning a wizard a second
time using the file name of an existing object will destroy the original work of
the same name, including any and all modifications you made previously.

While you can edit a container object manually to add a new command button and
set its properties individually, it is usually easier to run the builder over
the CommandButton Group to add the new button. The builder asks a series of
questions about the control you are modifying and then sets the appropriate
properties to make the control work the way you want it to work.

You can also use builders to add objects to a form, not just to modify existing
objects. If you want to add a new text box to a form, the builder will ask a
series of questions to help define the object's attributes. When you finish the
definition, the builder adds the object to the form.

Builders can be started in two ways. You can click the Builder button on the
Properties window. Or you can click the Builder Lock button on the Form Controls
toolbar, and then click another button on the Controls toolbar to both create a
new control and automatically start the builder for that control.

Visual FoxPro supports the following Builders:

- Text Box Builder

- Edit Box Builder

- Command Group Builder

- Option Group Builder

- Combo Box Builder

- List Box Builder

- Grid Builder

- Form Builder - AutoFormat Builder - Referential Integrity Builder

To find out the specific attributes available under each builder, place the
desired object on a form, and activate the builder for the object. All other
objects not listed here (such as the Page Frame or Spinner controls) do not have
native builders. If you want to have such functionality for an unlisted object,
you can use Visual FoxPro to write your own builder for that object.

To add a control by using a builder, follow these steps:

1. In the Form Controls toolbar, click the Builder Lock button.

2. Select the control you want from the Form Controls toolbar, and drop it on
  the form.

3. Fill in the information on the builder tabs.

In summary, builders are useful and powerful tools that help take some of the
drudge work out of defining object attributes.
