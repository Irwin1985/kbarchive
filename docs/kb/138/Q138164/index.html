About Yearbook Builder

Yearbook Builder is an exciting new feature that keeps your encyclopedia
current by attaching updates to your Encarta 96 Encyclopedia articles. With
Yearbook Builder, your Encarta 96 Encyclopedia stays up to date with the
current events and hot topics affecting the timeliness and accuracy of all
encyclopedias.

Each Yearbook Builder installment contains Month in Review, a chronology of
the month's noteworthy events, and yearbook updates, a collection of
detailed accounts linking and enhancing the articles in your Encarta 96
Encyclopedia.

The first installment of Encarta Yearbook Builder is included on the 1996
CD-ROM as a sample. Later installments are available for downloading via
your modem from either your subscription to The Microsoft Network or the
Microsoft World Wide Web page on the Internet. Best of all, Microsoft gives
you the first 12 installments (September 1995 to August 1996) as a FREE
trial offer.

Yearbook Builder FAQ

Q. What is in the Encarta Yearbook Builder?

A. Each month, your Yearbook Builder installment contains a Month in Review
  chronology of the month's key events and issues and approximately 30-40
  yearbook updates, articles including several photos. Each Yearbook
  Builder monthly file profiles the latest political changes, scientific
  discoveries, and current events you would expect to find in an up to
  date encyclopedia.

Q. How does this feature benefit Encarta 96 Encyclopedia?

A. Encarta Yearbook Builder lets you own the most current encyclopedia
  possible. No longer will your information be out of date. Your content
  is always timely and accurate, and your research will always be
  complete. Encarta Yearbook Builder applies the power of online to the
  in-depth content on CD-ROM to create a living encyclopedia.

Q. How do I get Yearbook Builder files?

A. You can download Encarta Yearbook Builder files from your subscription
  to The Microsoft Network or the Microsoft World Wide Web page on the
  Internet. Easy downloading instructions are available in the Yearbook
  Builder's "Add New Months" screen, which guides you step-by-step through
  the download process. Also, a handy quick reference card is also
  provided to remind you to update you encyclopedia each month.

Q. How does Microsoft get this updated content?

A. Every day, the Encarta Encyclopedia editorial team monitors events and
  developments worldwide, looking for news that affects Encarta
  Encyclopedia's content. The editors summarize and package this
  information (text and photos) into Encarta Yearbook Builder files, which
  are then made available to you on a monthly basis as a part of the
  Yearbook Builder feature in Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.

Q. How does this information work with the CD product?

A. After the monthly Yearbook Builder files are downloaded from the
  Microsoft Network or the Internet via modem to your PC's hard disk,
  links are automatically created between the Yearbook Builder updates and
  their related CD articles, making the information accessible from within
  your Encarta 96 Encyclopedia.

  These updates can be accessed from two locations. The first is within
  the Yearbook Builder feature itself, in the Update Browser. The second
  way you can access these updates is by clicking on the Update icon in an
  Encarta Encyclopedia article. This icon indicates updated information
  relating to the article is available.

Q. What if I don't get my Encarta 96 Encyclopedia until January 1996. Do I
  still get Yearbook Builder files?

A. New Yearbook Builder installments will be available at the beginning of
  each month and will remain available to Encarta 96 Encyclopedia
  subscribers through December 1996. The number of Yearbook Builder
  installments available the first time you download is dependent on the
  month you first access the service. If you first use the service in
  January, you will have five months of Yearbook Builder files - September
  to January - available for immediate downloading.

Q. How long does downloading these files take and how much hard disk space
  is required?

A. Downloading one month's Yearbook Builder files will take approximately 6
  minutes with a 9600 BPS modem. With 30-40 articles downloaded per month,
  you will need about 400- 500 KB of hard disk per month or 7.5 MB of hard
  disk for the full 12 installments.

Q. How much does this online service cost?

A. Encarta Yearbook Builder is being offered as a free trial service which
  entitles you to 12 installments that will be available from September
  1995 to August 1996, regardless of when you obtain/receive Encarta 96
  Encyclopedia or access the Yearbook Builder service. By providing
  Yearbook Builder free this year, we invite you to use the feature and
  give us feedback to help us improve our service to you.

Q. Do I need an account on The Microsoft Network?

A. No. Encarta Yearbook Builder are available on both The Microsoft Network
  and the Microsoft World Wide Web page on the Internet.

More information on this topic may be available from Microsoft Information
Services.  Microsoft Information Services are available on the World Wide
Web by connecting to http://www.microsoft.com.  The FTP site is located at
ftp.microsoft.com.

Q. What happens to Yearbook Builder after August 1996?

A. With improvements in technology, we expect even more opportunities to
  integrate online features with future releases of Encarta Encyclopedia.
  So be sure to register your Encarta 96 Encyclopedia and then watch your
  mail for news for the next edition of Encarta Encyclopedia and the new
  Yearbook Builder features it will support.
