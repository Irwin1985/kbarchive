  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience the following symptoms:

- When you start your computer, you may receive a message that states that one
  or more services did not start.

- If other users try to access your computer over the network, they may not be
  able to locate your computer.

- The following event ID message may be logged in the System log in Microsoft
  Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 7022
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: Server service hung on startup.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if the Spooler service tries to start before the Server
service. This issue may occur if you installed either the Lexmark International
Markvision (LexBce) service or the Hewlett-Packard JetAdmin port monitoring
software on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, edit the registry to make the Spooler service dependant on
the Server service. If you do so, the Spooler service does not start until the
Server service is running.

To create this dependency:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. Locate and click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Spooler

4. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

5. Type "DependOnService" (without the quotation marks) in the Value Name box.

6. Click REG_MULTI_SZ in the Data Type box, and then click OK.

7. Type "LanmanServer" (without the quotation marks) in the Data box, and then
  click OK.

8. Click Exit on the Registry menu to quit Registry Editor.

9. Restart your computer.
