The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience a problem when you install Internet Explorer by using the
Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) with the User Rights Deployment
component. The installation may not work if both of the following conditions
exist:

- A non-administrator user logs on to the computer to complete the Internet
  Explorer installation.

- The initial installation was started by an administrator.

When the non-administrator logs on, the following two error messages are
generated:

  

- Windows Update: The previous installation of an application has not been
  completed.

- Logon with an administrator account to complete the installation.

If the non-administrator closes these error message dialog boxes, the
non-administrator is immediately logged off the computer. The non-administrator
cannot then log back on until an administrator logs on to the computer to
complete the Internet Explorer installation.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused if MSI 2.0 is installed on the client computer before
the IEAK User Rights Deployment installation started.
