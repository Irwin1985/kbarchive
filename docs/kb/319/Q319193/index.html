1. Video Card Issues
--------------------

Compatibility problems with several video cards have been addressed in this
release.

If you've experienced problems with Train Simulator, install the update, then run
the Train Simulator Troubleshooter.

To start the Troubleshooter:

1. Go to the folder where you installed Train Simulator and double-click
  Launcher.exe.

  or

  On the taskbar, click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Microsoft
  Games, point to Train Simulator, then click Train Simulator Troubleshooter.

2. In the Troubleshooter, click Change Video Driver.

  The profiler checks for your video drivers.

3. Click OK in the Select Driver dialog box.

4. Click Play Train Simulator.

2. Marias Pass Refueling
------------------------

The fuel filler area on the Dash 9 and GP38-2 has been increased for easier
refueling at Whitefish Yard. The depot will supply 1,000 gallons of fuel, enough
diesel to complete the run.

3. Coupler Functionality 
------------------------

Front couplers on steam and diesel locomotives are now functional.

4. Winter Textures
------------------

Winter texture issues for the Hisatsu route have been resolved. If you install
the Hisatsu route after you install this update, you should reinstall this
update.

5. Night Textures
-----------------

Night texture issues on the Odakyu route have been resolved. The missing texture
could cause Train Simulator to quit to the desktop in some rare circumstances.
If you install the Tokyo - Hakone route after you install this update, you
should reinstall this update.

6. Orient-Express Golsdorf 380 Refueling
----------------------------------------

The fuel filling area on the Golsdorf 380 tender has been increased for easier
refueling at the coal and water facilities.

7. Editing Tools
----------------

The conv3ds.exe and MakeAce.exe utilities have been updated, as has their
documentation. These tools allow you to create new objects, including
locomotives.

The MakeAceWin.exe utility is a new Windows version of MakeAce.exe. You can use
either the DOS (MakeAce.exe) or Windows (MakeAceWin.exe) version for converting
bitmaps and textures into .ace files.

The updated utilities and documentation are installed in the Train
Simulator/Utils folder.

If you have not installed the TechDocs from Microsoft Train Simulator Disc 1, you
should do that before creating new shapes and textures for use in Microsoft
Train Simulator. To install the TechDocs, insert Microsoft Train Simulator Disc
1 into the CD-ROM drive and exit the Setup program. Using Windows Explorer, open
the disc, then navigate to the TechDocs folder. Double-click the TechDocs.zip
folder, which will extract the TechDocs to your hard disk.

If you want to keep all the TechDocs in one place, you can move the updated .doc
files from the Utils folder to the TechDocs folder on your hard disk after you
install this Update.

8. Re-installing Train Simulator
--------------------------------

If you re-install Train Simulator after you install this update, you should
reinstall the update to ensure that you have the latest files. Likewise, if you
do not have the Hisatsu route or the Tokyo - Hakone route installed, and install
it in the future, you should reinstall this update to ensure that you have all
the textures.
