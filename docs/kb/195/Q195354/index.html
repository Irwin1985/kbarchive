IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server's Host Print Server provides a Bypass GDI option for 3270 print
sessions that is used to indicate whether the host print data is transparent or
not. If this option is selected, all print data received through this 3270 print
session will be treated as transparent data, and will be passed directly to the
physical printer without modification. The Bypass GDI option has no effect for
LU3 print sessions. LU3 print jobs that contain transparent data such as printer
control codes (for example, HP PCL commands) or other pre-rendered print data
will fail to print, or will print incorrectly even if the Bypass GDI option is
enabled.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Print Server was not designed to allow the Bypass GDI option to

  function with LU3 print sessions since LU3 print jobs were not intended for

use with transparent print data. IBM originally intended LU3 printing to be used
for basic 3270 printing. IBM developed LU1 (SCS) printing to allow for more
complex print jobs including transparent print data.


RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, 4.0, and 4.0 Service
Pack 1. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

After applying the update, Bypass GDI is supported for LU3 print sessions if the
print session is also configured to use a PDT (Printer Definition Table) file.
In addition to applying the update, the following registry entry needs to be
added:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services \SnaPrint\Parameters
  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
  readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

     Value Name: BypassGDIForLU3
     Data Type:  REG_SZ
     Value:      Yes

     NOTE: Value can be set to anything (for example, Yes, On, and so on).
     As long as this parameter exists, the Bypass GDI option will be
     enabled for LU3 print sessions.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

The following Knowledge Base article discusses an update that is included in SNA
Server 3.0 SP3 and SNA Server 4.0 SP1 that allows the Host Print Server to pass
EBCDIC X'27' characters for LU3 print sessions.

  Q180150 LU3 Print Job Fails If Data Includes X'27' Control Codes

This capability was added to provide limited transparent section printing for LU3
sessions. The update for this issue required setting a registry parameter called
LetHex27Pass to allow EBCDIC X'27' characters to pass through to the printer.
However, the update described in this article removes support for the
LetHex27Pass registry entry since the print server has been updated to support
Bypass GDI for LU3 sessions. Enabling the BypassGDIForLU3 registry entry and
applying this update will allow EBCDIC X'27' characters to pass through print
server for LU3 sessions.
