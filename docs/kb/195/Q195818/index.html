-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade SNA Server (version 3.0 or 4.0) to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
4, any SNA user configured to use data encryption will be unable to establish a
session through the server when connecting from the following client platforms:

- Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or earlier (running the SNA 3.0 or 4.0 Windows
  NT, SNA Windows 9x or SNA Windows 3.x client software)

- Windows 98 or Windows 95 (running the SNA 3.0 or 4.0 Windows 9x client
  software)

- Windows 3.x (running the SNA 3.0 or 4.0 Windows 3.x client software).

SNA Windows NT clients that are upgraded to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 will be
able to connect to an SNA Server which has also been upgraded to Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4.

Likewise, if an SNA Windows NT client computer is upgraded to Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4, the SNA client user (when configured to use data encryption)
will be unable to establish a session through SNA Server if the server is
running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or earlier.

The following symptoms will occur when clients experience this problem:

- The SNA Windows NT or Windows 3.x 3270 applet displays the following error on
  startup, and fails to display a 3270 session list within the Session
  Configuration dialog box. ERROR - Reading SNA Server Configuration

- The SNA Windows NT or Windows 3.x 5250 applet displays the following error
  when attempting to open a session, and will fail to retrieve Remote APPC LU
  aliases within the Session Configuration dialog box: WIN5250 SNA Server has
  been deactivated. Contact System Administrator [F003][010000F0] -or- The
  Remote LU name specified for this session is invalid [0001] [0000001B]

- The SNA Windows NT client logs Event 705 to the Windows NT Application Event
  log: Event ID: 705 Source: SNA 3270 Emulator (or) SNA APPC Application
  Description: Logon Failed. EXPLANATION Connection request failed due to data
  security Access denied -- required data encryption -- Error Code: 43

- The SNA Windows 95 3270 applet displays the LU name in the session
  configuration dialog box, but stops responding (hangs) with a blank screen
  when attempting to connect to the session.

- When the SNA Windows 95 client fails to connect, the SNA Server logs Event
  717 to the Windows NT Application Event log: Event ID: 717 Source: SNA Base
  Service Description: Client-Server Connection Disconnected. EXPLANATION
  Security Error - unable to decode security messages. Error Code = 0x8009030f

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) NTLM security package modifies
the implementation of the encryption context options for applications which use
the InitializeSecurityContext() API. This causes SNA Server (and SNA Windows NT
and Windows 9x clients) to build encrypted messages differently when running on
Windows NT 4.0 SP4 than for prior Windows NT versions. This causes
interoperability problems between SNA clients and servers that are running on
different versions of Windows NT when encryption is enabled for an SNA user.


RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack




SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the use of SNA Server client-server
encryption until SNA Server, SNA client, and/or Windows NT software can be
upgraded within the network.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article when running on a mixture of Windows NT 4.0 SP4 and
prior Windows NT versions. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0
Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following implementation decisions must be made to fully resolve this issue
and support client encryption with mixed SNA Server, SNA client, and Windows NT
versions:

- If SNA Servers are to be upgraded to Windows NT 4.0 SP4, before any SNA
  clients are upgraded to Windows NT 4.0 SP4, the SNA Server update should be
  applied to the servers first, to preserve connectivity for back-level clients
  (including SNA Windows 9x and Windows 3.x clients which are not running on
  Windows NT).

- If SNA Windows NT (or SNA Windows 9x) clients are to be upgraded to Windows
  NT 4.0 SP4, before the SNA Servers are upgraded to Windows NT 4.0 SP4, the
  SNA client update should be applied to the clients, to preserve connectivity
  to back-level servers.

- Applying the SNA update simultaneously to all SNA Servers and SNA clients
  preserves interoperability regardless of Windows NT versions being used.

The following tables summarize interoperability between various combinations of
SNA Server, SNA client, and Windows NT software.

Old SNA CLIENT or Old SNA Server software = SNA 3.0 (including Service Packs
1-3), SNA 4.0 (including Service Pack 1)

New SNA Client or New SNA Server = SNA 3.0 (post-Service Pack 3), SNA 4.0
(post-Service Pack 1)
