-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 has the ability to set up to 350 multiple
Lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP) Referral servers for LDAP clients.

This ability can be useful if you have other organizations or foreign systems
that you wish LDAP clients to be able to search for information on and can be
centrally controlled on one server through the Admin.exe program in Exchange
Server 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an LDAP client requests information, the Microsoft Exchange Server computer
returns the referrals to other servers that are within the scope of the search,
in addition to any entries that match the information requested.

For example, if a client searches on server A for the phone number for John
Baker, but John Baker is in server B of another organization, server A queries
the referral server server B to retrieve the information for the client.

You can use the Referrals property page to specify the server outside of your
organization that an LDAP client connects to for information.

To set up a LDAP Referral Server, perform the following steps:

1. Start Admin.exe and connect to the Server that LDAP Clients will connect to.

  Example: Server1.Org1.com or Server1

2. Go to the Protocols object beneath the configuration container and select the
  LDAP(Directory) Site Defaults.

3. In properties, select the Referrals Tab and click on New.

4. In the Server Name put the DNS Entry for the referral server.

  For Example: Server2.Org2.com

5. In the Directory Name put the base directory name(Specified in RFC1779) of
  the referral.

  For Example: ou=Site2,o=Org2,c=us

6. Leave the Port at 389 for LDAP

  NOTE: This port should be open if a firewall or proxy is used to connect to
  the other server.

7. Leave the SSL Box unchecked unless your connection to the other server occurs
  using a Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) port.

8. You can add up to 350 Referral Servers in the list.

9. Highlight the Referral Server you want be the default and click on the
  Default Referral Button

After the steps above have been completed, configure an LDAP client by performing
the following steps:

1. Start Outlook Express and configure a Directory Service. On the Tools menu,
  click Accounts, click Directory Service, click Add, and then click Directory
  Service.

2. In the Internet Directory (LDAP) server, put the name of the server that
  clients will access.

  For Example (from step 1 above), Server1.Org1.com or Server1

  NOTE: The client should be able to ping the local server above before they can
  connect and referred to another server. For Example, Ping Server1.

3. If Anonymous access is enabled on the LDAP Protocol, then make sure the "My
  LDAP server requires me to log on" option is not selected.

4. Click Next, and say click "yes" to check e-mail addresses using this
  directory service.

5. Click Next, and choose a Friendly name for this directory service name.

  For Example: Exchange Organization

6. After this has been completed, click on Address Book, and then click Find.

7. To search for users on the referral server(s), select the Exchange
  Organization from the Drop Down list, and type their name or wildcard.

For Example: Typing the beginning of a name or letter such as "J" or "Jo" without
the quotes will display all the names in the Referral Server(s) that begin with
"J" or "Jo" such as Joe, Joan, John, and so forth.

For additional information on setting up Outlook 98 clients to use LDAP, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184212 OL98: (CW) How to Install and Use the LDAP Service

NOTE: Outlook Express may also be used as an LDAP Client to search referral
servers.
