SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the types of section breaks available in Word and their
uses. When you start a document, there are no section breaks because the entire
document consists of one section. A section break is the point at which you end
one section and begin another because you want some aspect of page formatting to
change. You can divide a document into any number of sections and format each
section the way you want. Throughout this article, keep in mind that a section
break acts as an embedded code that stores or maintains the properties of the
section above it.

For tips about using section breaks, refer to the "More Information" section of
this article.

Section/Page properties include the following settings:

  Page Orientation (Portrait/Landscape)
  Margins
  Columns
  Line Numbering
  Vertical Alignment
  Headers &amp; Footers
  Page Numbering
  Paper Size
  Paper Source

It is recommended that when you are working with section breaks that you turn on
the Show/Hide information by:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

2. Under Nonprinting Characters, select the All check box.

3. Click OK.

Using Section Breaks
--------------------

To create a new section, click the Break command on the Insert menu. In Normal
view, Word displays a double dotted line and the words End of Section (Type of
Section Break) to indicate a section break and its type.

The line is not printed. There are several types of section breaks to choose
from. The breaks and their purposes are described as follows.

  Type           Characteristics
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Next Page      Word breaks the page at the section break. The new
                 section starts on the next page.

                 Use this section break if you want to apply different
                 page numbers, headers and footers, orientation,
                 vertical alignment, or paper size to the sections in
                 the document.

  Continuous     Word inserts a section break and begins the new section
                 on the same page. If the two sections have different
                 settings for page size or orientation, the new section
                 begins a new page even if you select Continuous.

                 Use this section break if you want to have different
                 column formatting or margins on the same page. If there
                 are multiple columns in the previous section, Word
                 balances the columns above the section break and then
                 fills out the page with the new section.

  Odd Page       Word begins the new section on the next odd-numbered
                 page. This section break is often used for chapters that
                 begin on odd-numbered pages.

                 NOTE: If the section break falls on an odd-numbered
                 page, Word leaves the intervening even-numbered page
                 blank.

  Even Page      Similar to Odd Page, but Word begins the new section on
                 the next even-numbered page.

To Insert a Section Break
-------------------------

1. Click at the point where you want to start a new section.

2. On the Insert menu, click Break.

3. Under Section Breaks, select the option that describes what type of section
  break you want, as described above.

4. Click OK.

Determining the Type of Section Break
-------------------------------------

In Word, the type of section break is shown on your screen, in parentheses, after
the words Section Break. This is not where the properties of that section break
are stored. The properties for the type of section break indicated on the screen
are stored in the next section break (which may have a different type of section
break indicated). If there is no additional section break in your document, the
properties for that section break are stored in the last paragraph mark of the
document. The section breaks act as an embedded code that stores or maintains
the properties of the section above it.

For example, if you have a one-page document and half-way down the page you
insert an Odd Page section break and farther into your document, on Page 1, you
insert a Next Page section break, in normal view, you see the following:

  Section Break (Odd Page)

  Section Break (Next Page)

If you place your insertion point above Section Break (Odd Page), the status bar
shows Page 1 Sec 1. To see the actual properties for the first section, on the
Format menu, click Document and then click the Layout tab. Under Section Start,
it indicates that the section is New Page. The settings for this section break
are stored in the section break below where your insertion point is located or
as shown on the screen, Section Break (Odd Page).

If you place your insertion point between Section Break (Odd Page) and Section
Break (Next Page), the status bar shows Page 3 Sec 2. To see the actual
properties for the second section, on the Format menu, click Document and then
click the Layout tab. Under Section Start, it indicates that the section is Odd
Page. The settings for this section break are stored in the section break below
where your insertion point is located or as shown on the screen, Section Break
(Next Page).

If you place your insertion point below Section Break (Next Page), the status bar
shows Page 4 Sec 3. To see the actual properties for the third section, on the
Format menu, click Document and then click the Layout tab. Under Section Start,
it indicates that the section is New Page. The settings for this section break
are stored in the last paragraph mark of the document (because there are no more
section breaks in the document).

NOTE: A section break indicated on your screen as Next Page is defined as New
Page on the Layout tab of the Document dialog box.

  entry for future use.
