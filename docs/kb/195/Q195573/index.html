The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When your document contains an address, Word may not properly identify the
address paragraphs and may not propose the correct address information in the
Address To box.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when you use one of the following commands:

- The Envelopes And Labels command on the Tools menu

  -or-

- The ToolsCreateEnvelope macro command

  -or-

- The ToolsCreateLabel macro command

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use these commands in an open document, Word searches the document for
an address, opens a dialog box with the proposed address, and allows you to
print the address on an envelope or label. When Word conducts an address search,
it uses the following rules:

1. Word searches for any paragraphs that you defined as bookmarks named
  "EnvelopeAddress" and "EnvelopeReturn."

2. Word searches for highlighted paragraphs that represent each line of the
  address.

  NOTE: This will not work in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows if your address
  lines end with line feeds rather than paragraph marks.

3. Word searches for a series of paragraphs meeting the following criteria:

  a. left-aligned

  b. only include a few words

  c. include three to five paragraphs in a row envelope address bookmark

  d. no formatting between paragraphs

If any of these conditions is not met, Word may return an unexpected result in
the Address To box.

NOTE: If you format an address as a single paragraph (for example, if you end
each line with a new line character or SHIFT+ENTER), Word may not find the
correct address information.

Note also that if the first line of the address is formatted with space before or
space after formatting, Word will not find the address. If you highlight the
address, Word will show only the first line. This is true for the Labels dialog
box as well as for the Envelope dialog box.

Some third-party information managers, such as PackRat (for Windows), store
addresses as one paragraph with line feeds (instead of carriage returns) at the
end of each address line. In this situation, Word may not find the three to five
consecutive paragraphs that satisfy its search algorithm. To work around this
problem, replace the line feeds with carriage returns.

If a single paragraph has more than 58 characters and spaces, Word may not find
the correct address information.
