-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Finnish Exchange Server 5.0 client and you try to attach a file
with a long file name, the file can not be opened. This occurs when you try to
attach files with file names of 12 or more characters and the file does not
reside on the local computer. Most often, the symptom occurs when the file is on
a UNIX or Novell server.

CAUSE
=====

Win32 API suggests that a truncated short file name appear in a separate field
when a long file name is being accessed from a server. The field for the
truncated short file name was empty in this case; therefore, the returned file
name was used as a short file name. This resulted in an inability to open the
file, because the name was actually a long file name.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following

later:

  Component: Exchange Client 5.0

  File Name     Version
  -------------------------
  Wmsui32.dll   5.0.1461.68


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

- Copy the file to your local hard disk, and then attach it to the message.

- Use an 8.3 file name on the server.

- Use the Exchange Server 4.0 client.

- Use the Outlook client.

client version 5.0.
