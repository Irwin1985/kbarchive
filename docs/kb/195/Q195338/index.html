-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0 SP5, 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You can drag and drop a file from a folder directly into a public folder without
attaching it to a post message through the Outlook client. This type of item is
called a FreeDoc. When some types of these FreeDoc files are viewed through the
Outlook Web Access client (OWA), the file may or may not open correctly.

The Microsoft Exchange Server Outlook Web Access component is not currently
designed to support this type of FreeDoc file, so you may see mixed results
depending on the type of FreeDoc you are trying to open. Some items such as
Microsoft Word documents or Microsoft Excel worksheets may open correctly, but
other attachments may not open successfully from the OWA client.

If you try to open an Adobe Acrobat PDF file or other FreeDocs, you may receive
an error message and the file may not open successfully. This is currently a
design limitation of the Outlook Web Access component.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use an Exchange or Outlook client to view the file,
or save it to disk before you attempt to open it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using the OWA client and you cannot open the FreeDoc from the public
folder directly, then try to save the file to your local computer and try to
open the file from the disk. If you cannot save the file to disk, you can try a
different browser or go to an Outlook client and save the file. Then you can
open the file with the correct application.

For example, if an Adobe Acrobat PDF file is used in this manner and you
double-click the file to open it, a new browser window will appear with a small
red, blue, and yellow icon in the top left corner. If you move your mouse
pointer over the top of this window, a pop-up Help message will appear prompting
you to click for more information. When you click on the window, it will open an
Error Locating Object Handler dialog box displaying the following message:

  There is no viewer available for the type of object you are trying to
  open. The following information is available about this object:

  Address of object:
  http://servername/exchange/forms/IPM/DOCUMENT/frmRoot.asp?index=
  0obj=000000001A447390AA6611CD9B

  Content type: application/octet-stream

  Possible location of viewer: Microsoft ActiveX Gallery

  Do you want to go to this location to download a viewer for this type of
  object?"

You can then select one of two options; Yes or No.
