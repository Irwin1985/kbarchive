-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Single sign-on can be manipulated to disclose the password on an SSCP-LU
session.

CAUSE
=====

The 3270 single sign-on feature relies on keyword substitution in the data
stream and is not completely secure. This optional feature should not be
deployed in environments requiring the maximum achievable security because there
is no way to guarantee that the host screen to which the keyword is directed
will not echo back the clear text password to the user as though it were
ordinary data.

The result is that an individual could potentially display the password by
walking up to an unattended terminal, pressing the PA1 key to get an SSCP
session, then type MS$SAMEP. The host will respond with an error message similar
to the following:

  &lt;password&gt; is not a defined command.

However, if you press the PA1 key to get into SSCP-LU mode, then type MS$SAMEP on
the SSCP session, SNA Server will replace the keyword, no matter how many
messages have gone before on the session. Normally, SNA Server is counting the
number of RUs since a Bind, and refuses to substitute the keyword with an actual
password if more than a particular number RUs have gone by. For most hosts, this
covers the logon sequence. The usual user experience is this:

- Log on with 3270 single sign-on.

- Get connected to an application (CICS,TSO...) and then type "MS$SAMEP"
  (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command line, SNA Server does not
  substitute in your password.

You then get a host error similar to the following:

  Unknown command, MS$SAMEP.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0 and 4.0
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The update for this issue insures that SNA Server does not perform password
keyword substitution for longer than 30 seconds (default) from the start of each
LU session. This is ample time for an automated script to log on to most host
applications. However, this should not be regarded as a complete solution to the
security problem.

This update also entails a change from prior releases of the product in behavior
of logon scripts containing MS$SAMEU and MS$SAMEP keywords. In the past, the
user could log off the host application but stay connected to the SSCP session
(or host session manager), then initiate a new host logon using such a script.
Now, the user will have to drop the LU session from the terminal emulator (or
other client application) and open a new client- server session to notify the
node to resume replacing keywords.

With the update, by default, the timer will be set to 30 seconds, but you can
reconfigure it in the registry using the new registry entry
3270SSOReplaceTimer.

1. If registry entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaServer
     \Parameters\3270SSOPostReplaceCount

  is defined, node counts this number of RUs (on PLU-SLU session only)

2. Else if registry entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaServer
     \Parameters\3270SSOReplaceTimer

  is defined, node uses its value (number of seconds)

3. Else, if neither is defined, node uses timer algorithm with default value of
  30.

As per the above algorithm, if both are defined, the count will be used rather
than the timer.
