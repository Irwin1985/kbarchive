SUMMARY
=======

OfnKing demonstrates how to use and customize the Explorer-style CFileDialog.
This is the new type of Open File common dialog box supported on Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition (Me), Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000.

OfnKing provides a custom template with controls added to the standard set. It
also shows how to hide and move the standard controls. In addition, OfnKing
demonstrates DDX/DDV and context-sensitive help support with controls on the
custom template.

Programmers often like to use the common file dialog box to obtain a folder name
or to include folder names with the list of retrieved selected files. OfnKing
demonstrates a quick use of the new SHBrowseForFolder function, which is the
recommended method for the former. As for the latter, as an advanced technique
of customization, OfnKing shows how to access the listview control on the common
dialog box and obtain a list of Display names of files as well as folders.

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.


The primary functionality of this sample rests in the CCustomFileDialog class,
defined in CustomFileDialog.cpp and CustomFileDialog.h. The custom file dialog
box is executed by either clicking CfileDialog, then clicking Go, or by clicking
Open on the File menu. Three options are available for choosing what customized
file dialog box will be shown: whether it has the Explorer style, whether it has
a Custom Template, and whether it allows the user to select multiple files.

The Custom Template version provides a few controls that allow the user to store
a list of file names and directories from several different directories. This
list comes directly from the listview control on the dialog box, and therefore
it is composed only of Display Names. Directory names should be accurate, but
file names could potentially be stripped of their extensions (this is based on
whether the user has chosen this option in the standard Explorer.)

Below is a listing of the techniques that OfnKing demonstrates:

Obtaining a List of Selected Files When Using Multi-Select
----------------------------------------------------------

At the end of CMainFrame::OnDoDialog is a for loop that uses the
GetStartPosition() and GetNextPathName() functions to iterate through the
multiple file selections and add the names to one of the list controls.
Unfortunately, in versions of MFC prior to 4.2, the GetNextPathName() function
made some incorrect assumptions. OfnKing provides a fixed version.

Adding to the Recent File List
------------------------------

The loop mentioned above also adds the filenames to the recent file list. This is
as easy as calling the CWinApp::AddToRecentFileList() function.

Selecting a directory
---------------------

The CMainFrame::OnDirectorySelect() function demonstrates selecting a directory.
It uses SHBrowseForFolder() to read in an initial directory for CFileDialog.
This directory is added to one of the panes in the status bar.

Providing a custom template for CFileDialog
-------------------------------------------

With the old-style common file dialog box (that is, non-Explorer), the template
used was the WHOLE file dialog box, with all of the standard controls. Now, with
Explorer dialog boxes, you provide only the controls you would like to add to
the dialog box. Your template is repositioned and resized to fit the standard
controls when the CFileDialog window is first created. Or, if you want precise
positioning of the standard controls, you can place a static control with an ID
of stc32 on your template to indicate where you want the standard controls to be
placed. This is the technique OfnKing uses.

Using DDX/DDV with Your Own Controls on CFileDialog
---------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the Class Wizard code is not complete when matching a custom
template to a CFileDialog object. By adding the missing Class Wizard comments,
Class Wizard lets you map control and value variables to your own controls and
read values into them.

See CCustomFileDialog::DoDataExchange().

Context-Sensitive Help Support
------------------------------

CCustomFileDialog::OnHelp() is called when the user clicks the standard Help
button on the common file dialog box.

CCustomFileDialog::OnContextMenu() is called when the user right-clicks one of
the custom controls, such as the select items button. This brings up a menu with
the "What's This?" item.

CCustomFileDialog::OnHelpInfo() is called when the WM_HELP message is generated
by clicking the ? on the caption bar.

All three of these options make quick use of the WinHelp command.

MakeHelp.bat was modified to map IDC_ to help context IDs, and the standard MFC
help support .rtf file was pared down to just a few entries.

Reading Directory Names from listview
-------------------------------------

The common file dialog box does not support selection of folders. That is, It is
not possible to retrieve the name of a selected folder nor will the common file
dialog box return folder names in the OPENFILENAME structure on closing.
However, in some cases, it might be handy to get selected folder names as well.
One example: a file archival and compression utility might want to allow a user
to package up all of the files in one directory by just selecting that
directory.

As a demonstration of customization techniques, OfnKing shows how to access the
listview control on CfileDialog, and read through the list of Display names to
obtain a "complete" list of all selected files and directories. The main
functionality for this is in ReadListViewNames().

Because the list obtained consists of display names, the file names obtained may
not be complete. Currently, extensions are stripped for certain known file types
based on system preferences. However, folder names will probably not be altered.
The application of this information is left to the observer.

NOTE: This technique may break with future versions of the common dialog boxes.
However, because it just stops working, rather than crashing the program, if the
dialog box implementation changes, this method is relatively safe.

Additional Notes on the OfnKing Sample
--------------------------------------

The OfnKing sample was originally created using AppWizard, which generated a
skeleton application with a set of basic files. Most of the code in this sample
that represents a change to the original AppWizard code is marked with the
comments "// CHANGE":

The rest of the OfnKing sample contains a summary of what you will find in each
of the files that make up your OfnKing application:

CustomFileDialog.cpp
CustomFileDialog.h

  The implementation and header file for the CCustomFileDialog class, discussed
  above.

OfnKing.h

  This is the main header file for the application. It includes other
  Project-specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the COfnKingApp
  application class.

OfnKing.cpp

  This is the main application source file that contains the application class
  COfnKingApp.

OfnKing.rc

  This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the program
  uses; it includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored in the RES
  subdirectory. This file can be directly edited in Microsoft Developer Studio.

res\OfnKing.ico

  This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon. This icon is
  included by the main resource file OfnKing.rc.

res\OfnKing.rc2

  This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft Developer
  Studio. You should place all resources not editable by the resource editor in
  this file.

OfnKing.clw

  This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing classes
  or add new classes. ClassWizard also uses this file to store information
  needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data maps and to create
  prototype member functions.

For the Main Frame Window
-------------------------

MainFrm.h, MainFrm.cpp

  These files contain the frame class CMainFrame, which is derived from
  CMDIFrameWnd and controls all MDI frame features.

res\Toolbar.bmp

  This bitmap file is used to create tiled images for the toolbar. The initial
  toolbar and status bar are constructed in the CMainFrame class. Edit this
  toolbar bitmap along with the array in MainFrm.cpp to add more toolbar
  buttons.

AppWizard Creates One Document Type and One View
------------------------------------------------

OfnKingDoc.h, OfnKingDoc.cpp - the document

  These files contain your COfnKingDoc class. Edit these files to add your
  special document data and to implement file saving and loading (via
  COfnKingDoc::Serialize).

OfnKingView.h, OfnKingView.cpp - the view of the document

  These files contain your COfnKingView class. COfnKingView objects are used to
  view COfnKingDoc objects.

res\OfnKingDoc.ico

  This is an icon file, which is used as the icon for MDI child windows for the
  COfnKingDoc class. This icon is included by the main resource file
  OfnKing.rc.

Help Support
------------

MakeHelp.bat

  Use this batch file to create your application's Help file, OfnKing.hLP.

OfnKing.hpj

  This file is the Help Project file used by the Help compiler to create your
  application's Help file.

hlp\OfnKing.rtf

  This file contains the context-sensitive help topics for the dialog box.

Other Standard Files
--------------------

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp

  These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named
  OfnKing.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h

  This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs. Microsoft
  Developer Studio reads and updates this file.

Other Notes
-----------

If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is in a
language other than the operating system's current language, you need to copy
the corresponding localized resources Mfc40xxx.dll from the Microsoft Visual C++
CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory, and rename it to be Mfcloc.dll
("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation; for example, Mfc40deu.dll contains
resources translated to German). If you don't do this, some of the UI elements
of your application remain in the language of the operating system.
