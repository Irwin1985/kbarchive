The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add a Visual Basic project to Visual SourceSafe and check out a Visual
Basic form without checking out the project file (which has reference to a
component), a general protection fault might occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

In a development environment, users often need to check out the forms without
checking out the project file (.vbp). To work around this problem, after you
modify the forms, check in the forms and go to the Tools menu, click SourceSafe,
and then click Refresh File Status. In some circumstances you can remove the
read-only attribute of the .vbp, but this resolution should be used with care.

Otherwise, close the project and open it again. By doing this, the project is
re-loaded and the forms will be synchronized. Whenever you get the following
warning, close the project and open it again:

  Failed to reload the project. Please close this project from file menu and
  re-open it to get correct version of all files loaded into memory.

If you continue working on the project without re-loading, you will get
unexpected errors discussed in the MORE INFORMATION section.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Visual Basic you can add reference to components in a form by selecting the
Components from the Project menu. If you checkout a .frm file that contains a
ActiveX control without checking out the .vbp file, it will result in unexpected
errors depending on inputs you give. Before looking into a scenario, you have to
perform the following general steps:

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic, named 'Project1'.

2. Add a form named, Form1 to the project.

3. Under the Project menu, click Components and select the Microsoft Windows
  Common Controls 5.0 check box.

4. Click OK.

5. Add a ProgressBar to the form Form1.

6. Save the project and the form under C:\MyProjects.

7. Add this project to Visual SourceSafe under $/MyProjects.

Problem I
---------

1. Check in Form1.frm and Project1.vbp (if necessary).

2. Right-Click Form1.frm, and click "Check out..."

3. In your working directory you will find a Log file named Form1.log that
  contains the following:

  Line 2: Could not create reference: '{6B7E6392-850A-101B-AFC0-
  4210102A8DA7}#1.2#0'.

4. Right-click Form1.frm, and click Check In or Undo Checkout.

5. Right-click Project1.vbp, and click Check Out.

RESULT: the following error message appears:

  Failed to reload the project. Please close this project from file menu and
  re-open it to get correct version of all files loaded into memory.

Now if you check out Form1.frm by selecting going to the Tools menu, clicking
SourceSafe, and then clicking "Check out...", the following error message
appears:

  File Form1.frm could not be mapped to the SourceSafe project $/MyProjects
  Copy the file to 'C:\MyProjects

Following are two scenarios depending on the input you give for this dialog box.

Scenario 1
----------

If you click Yes or Yes to All in the dialog box of the error message, the
following prompt appears:

  File C:\MyProjects\Form1.frm Already exists. Overwrite?

Yes or Yes to All:

If you click Yes or Yes to All, another message appears:

  C:\MyProjects\Form1.frm not found. Click OK

  Failed to reload the project. Please close this project from file menu and
  re-open it to get correct version of all files loaded into memory.

Visual Basic commits a general protection fault and deletes the file, Form1.frm,
from C:\MyProjects and from the project, Project1.

To resolve this problem:

1. Open Visual Basic,

2. Open the Visual Basic project C:\MyProjects\Project1.vbp. The following error
  message appears:

  File not found 'C:\MyProjects\Form1.frm'--Continue Loading Project?

3. Click Yes.

4. Since Form1.frm has been removed from Project1, You can see only Project1 in
  the Project Window. Go to the Tools menu, click SourceSafe, and then click
  GET latest version.

5. Click Select All, and then click Advanced.

6. Click Replace in the Replace Writable box.

7. Select the Make Writable check box (if it is not already selected).

8. Click OK, and then click OK again.

NOTE: If you had set the "Get Latest Checked-in version of the file when opening
a VB project" to Yes (under the Tools menu, click SourceSafe, and then click
Options to see the Options dialog box), Visual Basic will automatically get the
latest version when opening the project.

NO or No to All:

If you click NO or No to All, the following error message appears:

  Failed to reload the project. Please close this project from file menu and
  re-open it to get correct version of all files loaded into memory.

Visual Basic commits a general protection fault, but it does not delete the
File.frm from the local directory or from the project Project1.

Steps to resolve this problem:

1. Open Visual Basic.

2. Open the Visual Basic project from this location:

  C:\MyProjects\Project1.vbp

3. You might see one of the following message boxes, depending on what you have
  set under the Replace writable files (under the Tools menu, click SourceSafe,
  click Options, click Advanced, and then click Local files to see what you
  have set for Replace writable files):

  File C:\MyProjects\Form1.frm has been checked out, replace?

  File C:\MyProjects\Project1.vbp has been checked out, replace?

4. Click Replace in both dialog boxes.

NOTE: If you are using Visual Basic 6.0, there is no need for any resolution
because it will not corrupt your project.

Scenario 2
----------

NO or No to All:

If you click NO or No to All, the following error message appears:

  File Form1.frm could not be mapped to the SourceSafe project $/MyProjects

  Copy the file to 'C:\MyProjects

It will prompt the following error message:

  Failed to reload the project. Please close this project from file menu and
  re-open it to get correct version of all files loaded into memory.

Steps to resolve this problem:

1. Open Visual Basic.

2. Open the Visual Basic project from this location:

  C:\MyProjects\Project1.vbp

3. You might see one of the following message boxes, depending on what you have
  set under the Replace writable files (under the Tools menu, click SourceSafe,
  click Options, click Advanced, and then click Local files to see what you
  have set for Replace writable files):

  File C:\MyProjects\Form1.frm has been checked out, replace?

  File C:\MyProjects\Project1.vbp has been checked out, replace?

4. Click Replace in both dialog boxes.

NOTE: If you are using Visual Basic 6.0, there is no need for any resolution
because it will not corrupt your project.

Problem II
----------

1. Check in Form1.frm and Project1.vbp (if necessary).

2. Right-click Form1.frm and click "Check Out..."

3. In your working directory, find a .log file named Form1.log that contains the
  following:

  Line 2: Could not create reference: '{6B7E6392-850A-101B-AFC0-
  4210102A8DA7}#1.2#0'.

4. Right-click Form1.frm, and click Check In or Undo Checkout.

5. Right-click Project1.vbp, and click Check Out.

6. Click Select All, and then click OK.

RESULT: The following error message appears:

  File Form1.frm could not be mapped to the SourceSafe project $/MyProject Copy
  the file to 'C:\MyProjects

The following two scenarios might occur depending on the input you give.

Scenario 1
----------

If you click Yes or Yes to All in the dialog box of the error message, a dialog
box with the following message appears:

  File C:\MyProjects\Form1.frm Already exists. Overwrite?

Yes or Yes to All:

If you click Yes or Yes to All, another message appears:

  File 'C:\MyProjects\Form1.frm not found.' Click 'Ok'.

Visual Basic deletes the file, Form1.frm, from C:\MyProjects and from the
project, Project1.

Steps to resolve this problem:

1. In Visual SourceSafe, go to the Tools menu, click SourceSafe, and then click
  Get Latest Version.

2. Click Select All, and then click Advanced.

3. Click Replace in the Replace Writables box.

4. Select the Make Writable check box (if necessary).

If you click NO or No to All, you have made the right choice because you will not
give any error and the project will be synchronized.

NOTE: These problems occur only with forms that have an ActiveX control in them.
If you check out a form that does not have an ActiveX control, even though the
project has a reference to an ActiveX Component, it will not produce any
problems.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic, named Project1.

2. Add a form named, Form1 to the project.

3. Under the Project menu, click Components and select the Microsoft Windows
  Common Controls 5.0 check box.

4. Click OK.

5. Save the project and the form under C:\MyProjects.

6. Add this project to Visual SourceSafe under $/MyProjects.

7. Right-click Form1.frm, and click Check Out.

RESULT: Log files are not created in C:\MyProjects and no errors occur.
