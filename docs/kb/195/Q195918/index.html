The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An organization's intersite directory replication that has previously been
running without problems may start to fail to keep up with the changes made to
it's (the organization's) directory.

This can be caused by a Directory Replication bridgehead server being unable to
cope with the sheer volume of replication messages that it is having to send and
receive. This is likely to be because the schedule set on the organization's
Directory Replication Connectors is too demanding for the intersite replication
topology and messaging infrastructure trying to support it.

The Intersite Directory Replication Schedule
--------------------------------------------

Each Directory Replication Connector can be scheduled. The default for this
schedule is once every three hours. Administrators can make this schedule more
(or less) frequent, up to four times an hour.

The schedule controls when and how often the intersite replication connector
sends out update requests to the destination directory replication connector.

When making the decision about how often directory replication should take place,
Administrators must consider the potential load put on the organization's
Directory Replication bridgehead servers and the messaging infrastructure.

NOTE: When setting the activation schedule, if the detail view is set to '1
Hour', selecting a one-hour time block, will activate the connector four times,
if you only want to activate the connector once an hour you must use the 15
minute detail view.

How Intersite Directory Replication Works
-----------------------------------------

Below are the minimum set of events seen when a directory replication connector
is activated (as according to the schedule) and the diagnostic logging category
'Replication' (on the Directory Service object) is turned to Maximum (on both
adjacent directory bridgehead servers).

The requesting bridgehead connector for each context will log the following:

  1068 - Ask for updates for naming context (either site or
         configuration)
  1100 -&gt; Message submitted
  1058 - Completed successfully

For each request message, the responding bridgehead server will log the
following:

  1099 &lt;- Message received from requesting directory
  1070 - The context to get, from the starting USN
  1071 - The number of objects retrieved, and entries up to the USN
  1101 -&gt; Message submitted back to the requesting connector

Finally, the requesting bridgehead server will log the following for each
received message:

  1099 &lt;- Message received back from the remote Directory

This entire set of events will be seen twice (once for the configuration naming
context and once for the site naming context) for each site listed as an
'Inbound site' on the requesting directory replication connector's Sites tab.

NOTE: Every message sent out by the requesting bridgehead server will result in a
reply from the remote bridgehead server.

Maximum Objects Sent per Request
--------------------------------

A maximum of 512 objects will be sent back to a requesting bridgehead server in
any one response message. If the remote directory bridgehead server has more
than 512 objects to send, it will send an additional message indicating that it
has more objects. Subsequently, the requesting bridgehead server, when ready,
will issue a request for the next set of objects. This prevents the requesting
bridgehead server from becoming overloaded (that is, when doing a 'refresh all
items in directory' for example).

The Number of Directory Replication Messages a Day in the Organization
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To work out the minimum number of messages intersite directory replication will
generate in your organization on a typical day, you can apply the simple
formula:

  N = number of sites participating in intersite directory replication

  M = (N-1) * 2 = number of replication messages sent out (for both naming
  contexts)

  F = The number of times each connector is active a day (24 / 3 by default =
  8)

  2 = factor for every request must get a reply

  N sites * (M * F * 2) = Intersite Replication Messages per day

  For example, using the default schedule:

  10 sites * (18 * 8 * 2) = 2880 messages a day 20 sites * (38 * 8 * 2) = 12160
  messages a day 30 sites * (58 * 8 * 2) = 27840 messages a day

NOTE: Additional replication messages will be generated for the 'address book
views' naming context, but these are a relatively small number and their
quantity is not effected by the directory replication schedule set.

CAUSE
=====

Directory replication will slow up significantly if the Directory Replication
Connector becomes active (as according to the schedule) and the replies from the
remote bridgehead server have not been processed from the previous cycle.

In this situation, the connector must presume that the replies that have not been
processed will not be forthcoming. Thus, the connector will request the same
updates (plus any other which have happened) from the remote bridgehead server.

It is possible that in a large organization where an aggressive schedule for
intersite replication has been set, these messages may be getting held up in the
directory service mailbox on the directory bridgehead server.

NOTE: It might be reasonable for this to happen in organizations that have
implemented the widely adopted hub and spoke directory replication topology,
where central hub server(s) are responsible for passing directory updates
between the spokes.

The process of taking the messages from the directory service's inbox and giving
them to the Directory Replication Agent is performed on a single thread in the
Directory service (DSAMAIN). The messages in the inbox must also be sorted
(TABLE_SORT_ASCEND) on the client submit time (PR_CLIENT_SUBMIT_TIME), this
becomes a computationally expensive operation as messages build up.

To see the number of messages waiting to be processed by the Directory
Replication Agent, view the "Total no. Items" column for the Directory Service
on the mailbox resources page of the Private Information Store object in the
Exchange Server Administrator program.

If you believe messages are building up in this mailbox you might want to observe
what the Directory Service is doing. To do this using Performance Monitor, add
the following counter:

  Object: Thread
  Counter: % Processor Time
  Instance: All the instances for DSAMAIN (use shift key to select)

If the directory service is failing to keep up with the demand, you will notice a
single thread consuming the majority of Processor Time (between 50 percent and
90 percent), whilst the remaining threads are using less than 5 percent. The
busy thread is responsible for passing the messages from the Directory Service
inbox to the Directory Replication Agent while keeping the inbox sorted on
'client submit time'.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

- Reduce the replication schedule for ALL replication connectors on the
  directory bridgehead servers adjacent to (connected to) the backlogged
  bridgehead server. (Microsoft strongly recommends that the schedule is NEVER
  more regular than the default: once every 3 hours).

  -AND-

- Reduce the replication schedule on ALL replication connectors on the
  backlogged server. (Microsoft strongly recommends that the schedule is NEVER
  more regular than the default: once every 3 hours).

  -AND/OR-

- Move some of the directory replication connectors off the backlogged server
  to another Exchange Server computer in the site.

  NOTE: If the third workaround is to be adopted, then it must be understood
  that a full refresh of all replicated contexts is automatically triggered
  (both ways). This is likely to compound the problem if the first and second
  workarounds are not applied first.

  NOTE: The third workaround is preferable to removing a directory replication
  connector. If the directory replication connector is removed, the adjacent
  connector must also be removed. Before a replication connector can be
  re-added, a Knowledge Consistency Check must be successfully completed on
  both directories. This will delete the objects that had been replicated
  between the two sites.

  -AND/OR-

- If the backlog in the Directory Service mailbox has become far too large
  (10,000 or more messages) it maybe necessary to remove these messages to give
  the DRA a chance to catch up. This can be done using one of the following two
  options:

  a. If the private information store on this computer has no other mailboxes
     on it other than the Directory Service and the System Attendant mailbox,
     you can rename the Priv.edb file:

     1. Stop the MSExchangeIS.

     2. Rename [Drive]:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Priv.edb to
        [Drive]:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Priv.old

     3. Start the MSExchangeIS. A new Priv.edb will be created when the IS
        starts, the mailbox for the directory service will be created when the
        directory service starts.

  b. If you know the Exchange service account user name and password, you can
     use an Exchange/Outlook client to log on to the Directory service mailbox
     and remove the messages from the Inbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is likely that this problem will be initially triggered by extra- ordinary
behavior; either in the number of Directory Replication messages generated over
a period of time (such as adding sites to the Exchange Server organization), or
a failure in the messaging infrastructure supporting the intersite replication
(such as Message Transfer Agent downtime).

After a Directory service mailbox has a backlog of messages (which it has to keep
sorted on client submit time), it will become increasingly difficult for it to
pass messages to the Directory Replication Agent. If none of the above
resolutions are adopted quickly, the remote bridgehead server connectors will
continue to send their requests into the Directory service inbox, compounding
the problem.

Real world experience has shown that after a Directory Service mailbox grows to
exceed more that 1,500+ replication messages, it will never be able to recover
until at least one of the above resolutions are applied.

published on the August 1998 TechNet CD.
