SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Hitchhiker's Guide to Visual Basic and SQL
Server, Sixth Edition," ISBN 1-57231-848-1.

The following topics are covered:

- Back Cover: VBSQL as Visual Basic/SQL

- Tip to be Added to Chapter 30

- Page 64: Search Event Procedure Produces Error After First Search

- Page 80: The note on the side of the page is missing text

- Page 631: ADO Find method incorrectly described

- Page 722: Heading On Table Is Incorrect

MORE INFORMATION
================

Back Cover: VBSQL as Visual Basic/SQL
-------------------------------------

In the second bulleted list entry on the left and in the third entry under
"Included on CD-ROM!" what now is spelled out as "Visual Basic/SQL" should be
"VBSQL."


Tip to be Added to Chapter 30
-----------------------------

The author requested that the following tip be added to Chapter 30.

  Tip: Don't expect ADO or any of the interfaces to return after "n" seconds
  (based on your connection timeout setting) if the LAN is down. These
  connection routines assume a working connection. Most of the LAN protocols
  wait for about 90 seconds before giving up trying to send bits into the
  ether.


Page 64: Search Event Procedure Produces Error After First Search
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On page 64, under "Coding the SearchButton_Click event procedure", the ADO code
sample will successfully search the pubs database. However, if you try to
perform additional searches during the current connection, the following error
will be displayed when you click the Search button:

  Run-time error '3705'
  Operation is not allowed when the object is open.

This error occurs because the Open method on the Recordset object is called while
the Recordset object is currently open. One way to eliminate this error is to
check the state of the Recordset object before calling the Open method. The
following code change in the SearchButton_Click() procedure will eliminate the
problem.

Change:

  Private Sub SearchButton_Click()
  Cmd(0) = "%" &amp; TitleWanted &amp; "%"
  Rs.Open Cmd, , adOpenStatic
  If Rs.EOF = False Then
      ShowRecord
  Else&lt;BR/&gt;
      MsgBox "No records found. Choose another title to search for."
  End If
  End Sub

To:

  Private Sub SearchButton_Click()
  Cmd(0) = "%" &amp; TitleWanted &amp; "%"
  If Rs.State = adStateOpen Then
      Rs.Close
  End If
  Rs.Open Cmd, , adOpenStatic
  If Rs.EOF = False Then
      ShowRecord
  Else
      MsgBox "No records found. Choose another title to search for."
  End If
  End Sub


Page 80: The note on the side of the page is missing text
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 80: The note on the side of the page is incomplete.

Replacement text will be posted as soon as it is available.


Page 631: ADO Find method incorrectly described
-----------------------------------------------

On page 631, the ADO Find method is incorrectly described as returning a Boolean
data type. The Find method does not return a value, but actually sets the
recordset position. As indicated in the ADO documentation, if the find criteria
is met, the recordset position is set on the found record; otherwise, the
position is set on the end of the recordset.

On page 631, the Criteria argument does not specify all of the comparison
operators. The comparison operators should include:
&gt;, &lt;, =, &gt;=, &lt;=, &lt;&gt;, LIKE
Steps to correct page 631.

1. The Find syntax after the first paragraph should be changed: Find(Criteria,
  SkipRecords, SearchDirection, Start)

2. The paragraph after Table 29-34 should be replaced with the following:
  "When the Find method is executed and the Criteria argument is satisfied, the
  recordset position is set to the found record. If the Criteria argument is
  not satified, the recordset position is set to the end of the recordset."

3. The second paragraph after Table 29-34 should be replaced with the
  following:
  "The comparison operator in criteria can be &gt; (greater than), &lt; (less
  than), = (equal), &gt;= (greater than or equal), &lt;= (less than or equal),
  &lt;&gt; (not equal), or LIKE (pattern matching)."


Page 722: Heading On Table Is Incorrect
---------------------------------------

Page 722, Table 31-4, heading 1:
Change: "RDO/ADO"
To: "RDO/DAO"
