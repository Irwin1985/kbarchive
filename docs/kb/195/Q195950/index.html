SUMMARY
=======

A common issue that is encountered with Terminal Server is that most
applications written to date were not written with Terminal Server in mind. In
other words, these applications are not natively multiuser. This is not to say
that these applications were poorly written, it just illustrates that most
applications were written to accommodate a single user running them at one time.
Listed below are some of the reasons an application may fail in a multiuser
environment, such as Terminal Server:

- An application writes user specific information to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, thus
  making this information global for all users who use this application.

- An application writes user specific information only to the installer's
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER, thus making this information available only to the
  installer.

- An application uses a single .ini file stored in the Windows directory for
  user-specific settings.

- An application adds menu shortcuts only to the installer's menu, rather than
  adding these to the ALL USERS profile.

- An application may fail when multiple users try to access the same file at
  the same time, resulting in a sharing violation.

To work around problems such as these, Terminal Server uses application
compatibility scripts. These scripts are essentially batch files that address
scenarios such as the ones previously mentioned. Microsoft includes several
application compatibility scripts with Terminal Server, located in
%SystemRoot%\Application Compatibility Scripts. However, keep in mind that these
scripts are examples, and may need to be modified by an administrator for
certain environments.

One important concept to understand before implementing these scripts is
ROOTDRIVE. To illustrate this idea, consider a fictional word processing
application, called ApplicationA:

When UserA installs ApplicationA on a Windows NT Workstation, it adds an entry in
the registry for the path to UserA's documents. To do this, the installation
program queries for the value of %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%. The value returned is
entered into the registry, and when a user clicks File and clicks Open inside
ApplicationA, the browser window that opens defaults to X:\UserA. This is
UserA's home directory, specified in User Manager as Connect X:
\\Server\Share\UserA.

When an administrator installs ApplicationA on Terminal Server, the same entry
for the path to his or her documents is entered. When 30 different users run
ApplicationA, an administrator is not going to want them all to save their
documents to the same location. There needs to be a unique location for all
users to store their files.

The logical place to store a user's personal files is in his or her home
directory. By default, a user's home directory is:

  %SystemRoot%\Profiles\%USERNAME%

This value is referred to as %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%. If Terminal Server is
installed to drive C in the default directory \WTSRV, when a user (UserA) logs
on who does not have a Home Directory specified in User Manager, his or her home
directory will be C:\Wtsrv\Profiles\UserA. This can be seen by typing SET at a
command prompt:

  HOMEDRIVE=C:
  HOMEPATH=\WTSRV\PROFILES\UserA

When a user who has a Home Directory or Terminal Server Home Directory specified
in User Manager (Connect X: \\Server\Share\UserA) logs on, the following
information is seen when typing SET at a command prompt:

  HOMEDRIVE=X:
  HOMEPATH=\UserA

Although this is the logical place to store a user's files, there needs to be a
way to address this unique path for all users in the registry. The registry
entry for the User's documents path in ApplicationA is:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CompanyA\ApplicationA\DefaultPath

The value of the path cannot be set to %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%. Likewise, the value
cannot be X:\%USERNAME%. ApplicationA does not understand either of these
entries. To work around this issue, ROOTDRIVE is used.

The first time an application compatibility script is run, Rootdrv2.cmd is run,
and the person installing the application is presented with the following
information:

     REM
     REM   Before running this application compatibility script, you must
     REM   designate a drive letter to be mapped to each user's home
     REM   directory.  Update the "Set RootDrive" statement at the end of
     REM   this file to indicate the desired drive letter.  If you have
     REM   no preference, the drive W: is suggested.  For example:
     REM
     REM            Set RootDrive=W:
     REM
     REM   Note: Make sure there are no spaces after the drive letter and
     REM   colon.
     REM
     REM   When you have completed this task, save this file and exit
     REM   NotePad to continue running the application compatibility script.
     REM

     Set RootDrive=

The installer is required to select a drive letter. Any drive letter may be
chosen, but it is important that it not be the drive letter specified in User
Manager for either the Home Directory or Terminal Server Home Directory (in this
example, X was used for UserA's home directory). Furthermore, the installer
should not choose a drive letter that is used in a logon script. In this
scenario, the person installing ApplicationA decides to use the suggested drive
letter W:.

The application compatibility script that was originally run is now called, and
all appropriate changes contained within the script are implemented. In this
case, the value of

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CompanyA\ApplicationA\DefaultPath

is now set to W:\, because this is the drive letter chosen to be ROOTDRIVE. The
easiest way to think of this is ROOTDRIVE = %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%. When UserA
logs in, his or her drive W = \\Server\Share\UserA. When UserB logs in, his or
her drive W = C:\WTSRV\PROFILES\UserB, because he or she does not have a home
directory specified in User Manager. When UserA starts ApplicationA, he or she
stores all of his or her documents in drive W, as does UserB. Both users'
documents, however, are in different places, which is the original issue that
needed to be addressed.

ROOTDRIVE is connected by using the Usrlogon.cmd script. This script is run each
time a user logs on to the Terminal Server. The script is called from the
following location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion
  \Winlogon\Appsetup

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

Listed below is the portion of Usrlogon.cmd that connects ROOTDRIVE:

     Rem
     Rem Map the User's Home Directory to a Drive Letter
     Rem

     Net Use %RootDrive% /D &gt;NUL: 2&gt;&amp;1
     Subst %RootDrive% /d &gt;NUL: 2&gt;&amp;1
     Subst %RootDrive% %HomeDrive%%HomePath%

The first line is a NET USE statement that deletes any drive letter that
currently exists that is using the drive letter that was chosen for ROOTDRIVE.
The second line is a SUBST command with a /d switch that deletes any substituted
drive you have that has the same letter as the drive letter that was chosen for
ROOTDRIVE. Finally, the third line runs the SUBST command for
%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% with the drive letter that was chosen for ROOTDRIVE.

As illustrated, ROOTDRIVE is an important feature of Windows NT Server version
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. Because of the fact that most applications written
to date were not written with a multiuser environment such as Terminal Server in
mind, some issues can be addressed by using application compatibility scripts in
conjunction with ROOTDRIVE.
