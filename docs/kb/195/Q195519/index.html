The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the steps to recover when the drive containing the
information store or directory service transaction log files fails because of
hardware problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Information Store Transaction Logs Lost
---------------------------------------

Following are the steps if the drive containing the information store transaction
log files is damaged and all data is lost. These steps assume that the database
files are on a separate drive from the transaction log files.

1. In Control Panel, Services, set the Exchange Server System Attendant service
  to Disabled to prevent it from starting up.

2. Replace the faulty drive with a new drive.

3. Create a logical drive with the same name as before and format it.

4. Recreate the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directory on the new drive.

5. Backup the Priv.edb and Pub.edb on the database drive.

6. Restore the last online backup of the information store.

7. In Control Panel, Services, enable the System Attendant service.

8. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Services.

At this stage, the information store will start, and will only contain data up to
the time of the last backup, because the transaction logs containing the data
generated since the last backup have been lost.

Recovering Data Generated Since the Last Online Backup
------------------------------------------------------

In order to try and extract data from the Priv.edb and Pub.edb files present at
the time of the failure, use the following steps.

NOTE: The steps below may or may not work, depending on the state of the database
files.

1. Install Exchange Server on a recovery server with the same Organization and
  Site names as the production server.

2. Create a new site, and DO NOT join the existing site.

3. Move out all files from the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata directory.

4. Copy the Priv.edb and Pub.edb files saved from the production server.

5. Repair the databases if necessary, and start the information store.

6. Run the DS/IS consistency adjuster

7. Run ExMerge.exe to merge all data between the last backup and the time of the
  failure, from the recovery server into the production server.

ExMerge.exe (Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Merge Program) is available on the
Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, Second Edition, as well as from Microsoft
Product Support Services.

Directory Service Transaction Logs Lost
---------------------------------------

Following are the steps if the drive containing the directory service transaction
log files is damaged beyond recovery. These steps assume that the database files
are on a separate drive from the transaction log files.

1. In Control Panel, Services, set the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant
  service to Disabled to prevent it from starting up.

2. Replace the faulty drive with a new drive.

3. Create a logical drive with the same name as before and format it.

4. Recreate the Exchsrvr\Dsadata directory.

5. Backup Dir.edb on the database drive.

6. Restore the last online backup of the directory service.

7. In Control Panel, Services, enable the System Attendant service.

8. Start the Microsoft Exchange Services.

Once the directory service starts up, it will contact the other servers in the
site, and backfill any data generated since the last backup.
