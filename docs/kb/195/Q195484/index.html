SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Insert Address button or the Schedule+ contact list as a mail
merge data source, the entries in the contact list are not sorted
alphabetically.

WORKAROUND
==========

To sort the Schedule+ contact list, use either of the following methods.

NOTE: Before running these methods, you need to already have created entries in
the Schedule+ contact list.

Method 1: Use the Insert Address Button in Word
-----------------------------------------------

1. Start Microsoft Schedule+.

2. In Schedule+, point to Export on the File menu, and then click Text.

  This starts the Text Export Wizard.

3. Click to select Contact List, and then click Next.

4. Click to select the character to use between fields (comma is the default)
  and click to select the character to use to surround each field (quotation
  marks are the default). Click Next.

5. In the next dialog box of the wizard, two questions appear. Use the following
  defaults, and then click Next:

      Do you want to export text          Select No.
      containing carriage returns and     (No is the default).
      line feeds as a single line?

      Do you want to export the field     Select Yes.
      names on the first line?            (Yes is the default).

6. Click Add All to select all the fields from the contact list to export, and
  then click Next.

  NOTE: If you do not click Add All and only export certain fields, you may lose
  some information when you import this file back into Schedule+.

7. Use the file name suggested by Schedule+; the default should be
  c:\&lt;Windows&gt;\Desktop\Export.csv. Click Finish. Schedule+ exports the
  contact list as a text file.

8. Start Word and open the exported file.

9. Sort the Contact Entries.
  a. On the Table menu, click Sort.

  b. In the Sort Text dialog box, click Options. Under Separate Fields At,
     click to select Commas, and then click OK.

  c. In the Sort Text dialog box, click to select My List Has Header Row.

  d. In the Sort By list, click to select the field to sort the text by.

     For example, if you want to sort all the entries by the last name, click to
     select Last Name.

  e. Click OK to begin the sort.

10. After the entries are sorted, save the file with the same name and extension
  and then close the file.

  NOTE: Save the file in the Text Only (*.txt) format. Do not save the file as
  a Word Document.

11. Switch to Schedule+. Click the Contacts tab. Select all of the Contact
  entries and delete them. The existing contact list has to be deleted before
  you can import the newly sorted contact list to Schedule+; you need to
  delete the existing list to avoid creating duplicate entries.

12. On the File menu, point to Import, and then click Text. This starts the Text
  Import Wizard.

13. Ensure that the exported file name appears in the File Name box. Click
  Browse to locate the file if necessary, and then click Next.

14. At the "Is the first line a list of field names?" prompt, click Yes (the
  default is Yes), and then click Next.

15. Click to select the character used between fields (comma is the default) and
  click to select the character used to surround each field (quotation marks
  are the default). Click Next.

  NOTE: In this step, you must select the same characters that you selected in
  step 4 when you exported the file.

16. Click Contact List under "Select the type of data in the file," and then
  click Next.

17. Select a type for the fields. The wizard lists the fields from the first
  line of the import file. To the right of each field is "IGNORE THIS FIELD."
  Select the first "IGNORE THIS FIELD" and a drop- down list appears. In the
  drop-down list, select the proper field name for this field. Repeat this
  step for each of the fields listed, and then click Finish. Schedule+ now
  imports the sorted file.

18. Quit and restart Word and Schedule+ for these changes to take effect.

Method 2: Use the Schedule+ Contact List as a Mail Merge Data Source
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To sort the contact list in a Word mail merge, follow these steps:

1. Open or create your Word mail merge main document.

2. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge. Click Get Data, and then click Use
  Address Book.

3. In the Use Address Book dialog box, click to select Schedule+ Contact List,
  and then click OK.

4. Click Merge. In the Merge dialog box, click Query Options. Click the Sort
  Records tab. Click to select the field that you want to sort the data source
  by, and then click OK.

5. Perform the rest of the merge as usual.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Outlook 97.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Outlook may not have been installed when you ran Setup for Microsoft
Office 97 for Windows. The Setup program asks if you want to retain Schedule+ or
to install Microsoft Outlook. If you retain Schedule+, Microsoft Outlook is not
installed on your computer. You need to run Setup again to install Microsoft
Outlook.

You can use the contact list from Microsoft Schedule+ versions 7.0 and 7.0a with
Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

You also can use the Microsoft Outlook 97 contact list with Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows.
