SUMMARY
=======

The global lock count mechanism has been changed in the Windows version 3.x
protected modes (that is, standard mode and enhanced mode). The GlobalLock
function only affects the lock count of discardable objects and the default data
segment (DGROUP); movable objects are not affected. Thus, repeated calling of
GlobalLock() and GlobalFlags() on a GMEM_MOVEABLE object does not show any
changes to its lock count.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are reasons and explanations concerning this design change:

1. In real mode, GlobalLock() fixes the segment:offset of a global memory
  object. It also increases the lock count, as reported by GlobalFlags().

2. In protected mode, the far pointer returned by GlobalLock() is a
  selector:offset, not a segment:offset. Because the selector value does not
  change, GlobalLock() does not actually fix the memory object in the physical
  address space. Thus, the GlobalLock function in protected mode does not
  change the lock count, unless the object is discardable or is a default data
  segment.

  In the case of a discardable object, the lock count is meaningful, because
  Windows needs to know when the object can be discarded (which is when its
  lock count is zero).

3. However, some applications have used the GlobalLock() lock count as a
  "reference count" [that is, as an indication of how many times GlobalLock()
  was called]. If the lock count for an object goes to zero, these applications
  might consider the object a candidate for being manually discarded, perhaps
  after copying the data to disk.

  Unfortunately, this use of GlobalLock() as a reference count keeper does not
  work in protected mode. Applications that symmetrically pair calls to
  GlobalLock() with calls to GlobalUnlock() do not need to know the lock count,
  and therefore, are unaffected by this change in behavior.

4. How does an application keep track of reference counts now, given that the
  GlobalLock() approach does not work for nondiscardable objects in protected
  mode? The application should really keep track of reference counts itself,
  which should not be hard to do because the application in need of this
  functionality will have a table of global handles anyway.

  However, if the application cannot be modified to maintain its own reference
  counts, then there is a new Windows function, called GlobalFix(), that will
  accomplish this functionality. GlobalFix() performs the following
  functionality:

  a. It fixes the object in the protected mode linear space.

  b. It increments the "lock count", as returned by the GlobalFlags function.

5. The following includes more information about GlobalFlags(). In real mode, it
  returns the GlobalLock() lock count. In protected mode, if the object is
  discardable, GlobalFlags() also returns the GlobalLock() lock count. In
  protected mode, if the object is nondiscardable, GlobalFlags() returns the
  GlobalFix() reference count. In other words, GlobalFlags() always returns the
  lock/fix count. However, in protected mode, the GlobalLock() and
  GlobalUnLock() APIs do not affect the count, only the GlobalFix() and
  GlobalUnFix() APIs do.

  NOTE: In real mode, the GlobalFlags() lock count actually indicates the sum of
  GlobalLock()'s and GlobalFix()'es. Therefore, if the programmer is calling
  GlobalLock() and GlobalFix() in pairs, then the GlobalFlags() lock count
  actually is twice the logical reference count, if in real mode.

6. If the application needs to keep track of reference counts, and the
  programmer wants Windows to do the work for them, then the programmer must
  accompany every call to GlobalLock() with a call to GlobalFix(). This way the
  programmer will be able to depend on the validity of the GlobalFlag()
  lock/reference count. However, using the GlobalFix() API just to keep track
  of the reference count is overkill, if that is all the programmer wants it to
  do. Remember, GlobalFix() also fixes the object in the protected mode linear
  address space. The price the programmer pays for having Windows keep track of
  the reference count (by using the GlobalFix()) is the following:

  a. Every time the GlobalLock() or GlobalUnLock() API is called, the
     programmer must also call either the GlobalFix() or GlobalUnFix().

  And, much worse:

  b. The programmer establishes sandbars in the linear address space.

  An application should either keep track of reference counts on its own or
  always pair GlobalLock() calls with matching GlobalUnlock() calls; the use of
  the GlobalFix() API should be avoided.

  Very few applications should need to fix global objects in linear space;
  therefore, few applications should need to use the GlobalFix function.

7. If the programmer needs to unconditionally unlock and free a global memory
  object of any type, then code similar to the following can be used:

          /* 1.  Make it discardable if necessary. */ 
          if (GlobalFlags shows that it is nondiscardable)
              GlobalRealloc (GMEM_MODIFY it to be discardable);

          /* 2. Remove any lock counts that might be on it. */ 
          while (GlobalUnlock != 0) /* keep unlocking it */ 
              ;

          /* 3. Free it. */ 

  GlobalFree()
