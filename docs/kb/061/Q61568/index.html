SUMMARY
=======

DosQNmPipeSemState() returns information in the form of PIPESEMSTATE structures.
In earlier releases, these structures were named "npss". The following are
frequently asked questions involving these structures:

1. Q. How much space do you have to pass to DosQNmPipeSemState() to hold the
  PIPESEMSTATE structures returned?

  a. You can set the variable "pipes" to the number of pipes associated with
     the semaphore you pass to DosQNmPipeSemState(), and then use the following
     statement to calculate the buffer size:

  USHORT PipeInfoSize=((3*pipes)+1)*sizeof(PIPESEMSTATE);

2. Q. In what order does DosQNmPipeSemState() return the PIPESEMSTATE
  structures?

  a. An application cannot safely make any assumptions about the order
     returned, because the order is not specified. Since the order is not
     specified, the order may change; therefore, do not rely on any order that
     may appear in the current releases of OS/2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

More detailed information regarding the above questions is as follows:

1. [How much space do you have to pass to DosQNmPipeSemState() to hold the
  PIPESEMSTATE structures returned?]

  OS/2 does not allocate any space to hold PIPESEMSTATE structures. Each time
  you call DosQNmPipeSemState(), OS/2 looks at each named pipe currently
  associated with the semaphore you passed to DosQNmPipeSemState(), and builds
  the PIPESEMSTATE structures in the buffer you passed to
  DosQNmPipeSemState().

  In other words, each time you call DosQNmPipeSemState(), OS/2 builds the
  PIPESEMSTATE structures "on the fly" into the buffer you pass.

  If the buffer you pass to DosQNmPipeSemState() is not big enough to hold all
  the PIPESEMSTATE structures that OS/2 might have returned, OS/2 just stops
  building PIPESEMSTATE structures into your buffer, and returns the ones it
  was able to build before the buffer filled up.

  Although you can check the DosQNmPipeSemState() return code to see whether the
  buffer you passed was too small, the only practical approach to use is to
  pass DosQNmPipeSemState() a buffer you know in advance will be large enough
  to hold all of the structures.

  The reason for this is that if the buffer is too small, no PIPESEMSTATE
  structures may have been returned at all for some of the named pipes
  associated with the semaphore.

  If the return code from DosQNmPipeSemState() states that the buffer was too
  small, you cannot call DosQNmPipeSemState() again with the same size buffer
  to get the rest of the PIPESEMSTATE structures that would not fit in the
  buffer on the previous call. You can, of course, make as many calls as you
  want; however, subsequent calls do not get "the rest of the PIPESEMSTATE
  structures"; subsequent calls build complete new lists of PIPESEMSTATE
  structures.

  Trying to get "the rest of the PIPESEMSTATE structures" will cause
  DosQNmPipeSemState() to again build PIPESEMSTATE structures on the fly into
  the buffer, and will probably again return no PIPESEMSTATE structures at all
  for the same named pipes associated with the semaphore for which it returned
  no PIPESEMSTATE structures the first time you called DosQNmPipeSemState().

  This is because DosQNmPipeSemState() builds PIPESEMSTATE structures into the
  buffer on the fly, and DosQNmPipeSemState() keeps no records of what named
  pipes were previously successfully queried.

  Therefore, it is fine to call again if the return code states that the buffer
  was too small; however, remember that the second call will behave as if the
  first call had not been made.

  For some other OS/2 APIs, a practical approach to use is to make the call with
  a buffer you know is too small, and have the API return to you how much data
  was available (total). You then can allocate a buffer of that size, and make
  the call again. This approach allows you to allocate a buffer not one byte
  larger than is needed for those other APIs. This approach, however, does not
  work for DosQNmPipeSemState(), because DosQNmPipeSemState() gives no
  indication of how much data is available.

  Fortunately, the approach mentioned above as "the only practical approach" for
  DosQNmPipeSemState() is simple, but not costly, for most applications.

  Allocating a buffer you know in advance is large enough costs about 18 bytes
  per pipe associated with the semaphore, because the PIPESEMSTATE structures
  are only 6 bytes long, and you need to allocate three of them per pipe.

  As mentioned above, set the variable "pipes" to the number of pipes associated
  with the semaphore you pass to DosQNmPipeSemState(), then use the following
  statement to calculate the buffer size:

  USHORT PipeInfoSize=((3*pipes)+1)*sizeof(PIPESEMSTATE);

  This allocates space for three PIPESEMSTATE structures per pipe associated
  with the semaphore, plus space for one PIPESEMSTATE structure for the
  NPSS_EOI (end of information) structure that is always returned at the end of
  the buffer.

  The three PIPESEMSTATES structures per pipe must be allocated because at most,
  DosQNmPipeSemState() will return for each pipe associated with the semaphore
  one NPSS_RDATA, one NPSS_WSPACE, and one NPSS_CLOSE PIPESEMSTATE structure.

  NPSS_RDATA, NPSS_WSPACE, and NPSS_CLOSE are defined in BSEDOS.H. The following
  is an extract from BSEDOS.H for your convenience:

        #define NPSS_EOI         0 /* End Of Information    */ 
        #define NPSS_RDATA       1 /* read data available   */ 
        #define NPSS_WSPACE      2 /* write space available */ 
        #define NPSS_CLOSE       3 /* pipe in CLOSING state */ 

  For some applications, it might be possible to get by with a little less than
  ((3*pipes)+1)*sizeof(PIPESEMSTATE) because you know at a certain point that
  there cannot be any data to read in a certain pipe, or there cannot be any
  write space available, or the pipe cannot be closing.

  However, please remember that you save only 6 bytes per PIPESEMSTATE structure
  you do not allocate. In most cases, saving only 6 bytes is not worth the risk
  that the buffer you pass will be too small.

  It is not recommended that you attempt to save 5 bytes by only allocating 1
  byte in the buffer for the NPSS_EOI structure instead of the full 6. This may
  work in some releases of OS/2; however, the specified behavior is that the
  NPSS_EOI structure is a PIPESEMSTATE structure. Therefore, you should
  allocate the same space for it as you would for the other structures.

  To summarize the information for question 1: the recommended approach is to
  use the following statement to calculate the buffer size:

  USHORT PipeInfoSize=((3*pipes)+1)*sizeof(PIPESEMSTATE);

  It is not recommended that you try to get by with less, because the risks
  outweigh the number of bytes you might save.

2. [In what order does DosQNmPipeSemState() return the PIPESEMSTATE
  structures?]

  There is no specific order in which DosQNmPipeSemState() must return the
  PIPESEMSTATE structures in the buffer. Therefore, the application should not
  make any assumptions about the order of these structures.

  The current releases of OS/2 return the PIPESEMSTATE structures in the
  following order:

  NPSS_CLOSE (optional)
  NPSS_WSPACE (optional)
  NPSS_RDATA (optional)

  The NPSS_CLOSE structure comes first for a given pipe, if the pipe is closing;
  followed by the NPSS_WSPACE structure if there is write space available for
  that same given pipe; followed by the NPSS_RDATA structure, if that same
  given pipe has any read data available. Then, more PIPESEMSTATE structures
  follow in the same order for any other pipes associated with the semaphore.

  It is not safe to assume that this type of ordering scheme will continue to be
  used in all future releases of OS/2. An application should process the
  PIPESEMSTATE structures returned in the buffer in such a way that any order
  in which the PIPESEMSTATE structures are needed is guaranteed by the way the
  buffer is processed.

  For example, suppose you want to see any NPSS_CLOSE structures first. You then
  can record the fact that a pipe is closing, so you will know, when later
  processing the NPSS_RDATA structure, that the pipe is closing; therefore,
  trying to write to it will not work. Similarly, you might want to see any
  NPSS_WSPACE structures before the NPSS_RDATA structures, so you need to know
  ahead of time how much can be written into the pipe in response to the
  NPSS_RDATA structures.

  Please note that the sample ordering in the preceding paragraph seems to be
  one of the most practical orderings, and also happens to be the ordering that
  current releases of OS/2 seem to provide. Nevertheless, rather than relying
  on the fact that current releases of OS/2 seem to provide exactly that order,
  if that is the order you need, the code should be written so that order will
  happen even if OS/2 changes in the future.

  To attain this ordering, loop twice through the buffer returned. In the first
  loop, look for and record any NPSS_WSPACE and/or NPSS_CLOSE structures. Then,
  in the second loop, look for and process any NPSS_RDATA structures.

  Guaranteeing this order in your code costs an extra loop, and a place to
  record for each pipe whether it is closing and how much write space is
  available. For applications where DosQNmPipeSemState() returns extremely long
  lists of PIPESEMSTATE structures, a different approach can be used. For
  example, you might loop through the buffer returned just once, recording the
  NPSS_RDATA structures along with the NPSS_WSPACE and/or NPSS_CLOSE
  structures. Then in the second loop, loop through the array of pipes (instead
  of a second loop through the buffer).

  To summarize the answer to Question 2: You should not rely on the order in
  which current releases of OS/2 happen to return the PIPESEMSTATE structures.
  Your code should be written (as in the example below) to explicitly process
  the PIPESEMSTATE structures in the order your applications require.

      // Your application might not need this first resetting loop. In
     //  fact, this first resetting loop may be wrong for some
     //  applications.
     for (i = 0; i &lt; pipes; i++) {
       hPipes[i].usWriteSpace = 0;
       hPipes[i].bClosing     = FALSE;
       }
     for (pInfo = PipeInfo; NPSS_EOI != pInfo-&gt;fStatus; pInfo++) {
       if      (NPSS_WSPACE == pInfo-&gt;fStatus)
         hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].usWriteSpace = pInfo-&gt;usAvail;
       else if (NPSS_CLOSE  == pInfo-&gt;fStatus)
         hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].bClosing     = TRUE;
       }
     for (pInfo = PipeInfo; NPSS_EOI != pInfo-&gt;fStatus; pInfo++) {
       if (NPSS_RDATA==pInfo-&gt;fStatus) {
        hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].pData=malloc(pInfo-&gt;usAvail);

         rc=DosRead(hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].hP,hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].pData
                   ,pInfo-&gt;usAvail,&amp;uReadBytes);
         if (0!=rc)
           printf("\n\rRead error: rc=%d",rc);
         else {
           printf("\n\rJust read: %s",hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].pData);
           if      (hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].bClosing) {
             printf("\n\rCan't write, pipe's closed");
             }
           else if (hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].usWriteSpace &lt;= 0) {
             printf("\n\rCan't write, no space available");
             }
           else {
             // For this example, ignore the possibility that some
             //  write space might not be enough.
             // For this example, just write back the message received.
             rc=DosWrite(hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].hP
                        ,hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].pData
                        ,(strlen(hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].pData)+1)
                        ,&amp;uWriteBytes);
             if (0!=rc)
                printf("\n\rWrite error: rc=%d",rc);
             }
           }
         free(hPipes[pInfo-&gt;usKey].pData);
         }
       }
