SUMMARY
=======

There are three methods for determining a computer's BIOS manufacturer, version
number, or date. The first method is to reboot or power up the computer; the
second and third methods is to use the Debug program in MS- DOS or PC-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method 1
--------

The easiest way to determine a computer's BIOS manufacturer and version number is
to reboot the computer or turn the computer's power off, then back on again.
Most IBM-compatible computers display their BIOS manufacturer and version number
when rebooting. The display might appear similar to the following:

  Phoenix 80386 ROM BIOS PLUS Version 1.10 A01
  Copyright (c) 1985-1988 Phoenix Technologies Ltd.
  All Rights Reserved

Some computers do not display their BIOS manufacturer and version number during a
soft reboot (pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys). If the BIOS version does not
appear when rebooting, try turning the computer off, and then on again.

Method 2
--------

Some computers do not display any information about their BIOS during a reboot,
or they may not display the exact information you (or the technician or
engineer) require. In such cases, this information can be obtained by using the
Debug program.

Debug is a program shipped with MS-DOS and PC-DOS that allows you to examine and
modify memory.

To start Debug, type "debug" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER at the
command prompt. Debug displays a minus sign or dash (-), informing you that it
is ready for your commands.

To quit Debug, press "q" at the dash prompt. This returns you to MS-DOS or
PC-DOS.

The computer's ROM BIOS is stored at location F000:0000 through F000:FFFF.
Copyright messages are commonly stored at locations F000:E000, F000:C000, and
F000:0000.

The command to display values stored in memory is the "D" command. Press D
followed by an address in memory, and Debug displays 128 bytes starting at that
address. To examine an address (for example, F000:E000), type "D F000:E000"
(without the quotation marks) at the Debug prompt. To examine a different memory
location, replace the "F000:E000" with the appropriate address. The results may
appear similar to the following:

-D F000:E000
F000:E000 43 4F 50 59 52 49 47 48-54 20 28 43 29 20 31 39 COPYRIGHT (C) 19

F000:E060 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF-FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF ................
F000:E070 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF-FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF ................

Another method of determining the computer's ROM BIOS manufacturer and version is
to search for the word "version." To accomplish this, use the Debug search
command, "S".

The "S" command requires the following parameters:

1. The starting address of the search.

2. The letter "L" followed by the length of the search.

3. The text being searched for enclosed in quotation marks.

The search text is case sensitive; searching for "version" does not find
"Version."

To search for the word "version" in the computer's ROM BIOS area, enter the
following Debug command:

  " S F000:0 L FFFF "ersion"" (without the quotation marks)

Because the "version" could begin with or without a capital letter, enter it
without the letter "v". If Debug locates the string, it displays the string's
memory address for you, as shown below:

  -S F000:0 L FFFF "ersion"
  F000:172C

To display the version number, begin displaying an address a little ahead. In
this example, display F000:1700:

-D F000:1700
F000:1700 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 43 4F 50 59 52 49 47 .........COPYRIG

Some computers, most notably computers from IBM and Compaq, do not have version
numbers stored in their ROM BIOS. However, most computers do store the date the
BIOS was written near address F000:FFE0. To display the BIOS date, enter the
command "D F000:FFE0". You should see a display similar to the following:

-D F000:FFE0
F000:FFE0 20 00 28 00 48 36 50 20-30 33 43 4F 4D 50 41 51  .(.H6P 03COMPAQ
F000:FFF0 EA 2C 83 00 F0 30 31 2F-32 34 2F 39 30 20 FC A3 .,...01/24/90 ..

Again, to quit Debug, press "q" at the dash prompt.

Method 3
--------

On most computers, you can use the Debug program to obtain your BIOS's date.

To start Debug, type "debug" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER at the
command prompt. Debug displays a minus sign or dash (-), informing you that it
is ready for your commands.

At a command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after each line:

  " debug
  FFFF:5" (without the quotation marks)

Information similar to the following information is displayed:

FFFF:0     30 35 2F-32 39 2F 39 37 00 FC           05/29/97..

Note that the BIOS's date is displayed on the right.

To quit Debug, press "q" at the dash prompt. This returns you to MS-DOS or
PC-DOS.
