The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are 2 approaches to redistributing DAO 3.5 with your Visual C++ 5.0
application:

- You can redistribute the DAO Setup located in the VC\REDIST\DAO directory.

  -or-

- You can follow the steps in the Daosetup.rtf installed with the DAO SDK.

Note that the information in the "Installing DAO on Another Machine" topic for
the DAO SDK is incorrect and the information should be ignored.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Redistributing the DAO Setup
----------------------------

On the Visual C++ 5.0 CD, under \DEVSTUDIO\VC\REDIST\DAO\DISK1\, there is a DAO
Setup program that can be redistributed. This setup program prompts the user for
information about which components to install. You can run the setup program
with a '-s' option that silently runs the DAO Setup without putting information
on the screen.

Here are a few important notes:

- If you run the program with the -s option, all of the DAO components will be
  installed (DAO core components, ODBC Direct, and ISAMs).

- If ODBCDirect is selected or you chose the '-s' option, you must have ODBC
  3.0 currently installed on the system.

- To register DAO and use DAO, you must have Oleaut32.dll version 2.20.4049 or
  later as well as Stdole2.tlb installed into your System directory. If you try
  to run the setup program with the "-s" option and you do not have version
  2.20.4049 or later, the setup program fails. To get these newer versions of
  the files, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q180071 FILE: Msvbvm50.exe Installs Visual Basic 5.0 Run-Time Files

Installing the DAO components with Your Own Setup Program
---------------------------------------------------------

Below is the information from the Daosetup.rtf file installed into the DAO SDK
directory.

NOTE: The documentation fails to mention that you must copy the Oleaut32.dll and
Stdole2.tlb files from the \devstudio\vc\redist directory on the Visual C++ 5.0
CD into the Windows system directory. You must register Oleaut32.dll.

This document describes the steps required to create a setup program that
successfully installs DAO and its related files. It is recommended that you use
InstallShield Express that ships with Visual C++ 5.0 along with the information
in this document to create your setup.

Proper setup of DAO is very important. Because DAO is a shared component that
only exists in one location on a machine, all applications using DAO may stop
working if DAO setup is not done correctly.

1. Introduction

  To distribute an application that uses DAO, you must install the
  redistributable portions of DAO. Depending on whether your application uses
  the Microsoft Jet Engine or ODBCDirect workspaces, you must also install
  either the redistributable portions of the Microsoft Jet Database Engine, the
  redistributable portions of the Remote Database Objects (RDO), or both.

  DAO, Microsoft Jet, and RDO require a more complex installation procedure than
  simply copying files into a directory. An application cannot have its own
  "private" copy of an OLE Automation server (such as DAO) in an application
  directory. The server is registered by OLE, and all users use the same DLL.

2. Files

  DAO and DAO's ODBCDirect each require a core set of files. Microsoft Jet also
  has a core and a second optional set that provides the ability to access
  other data formats.

  Whether your application uses ODBCDirect or the Microsoft Jet Engine to access
  data determines whether you should install the Microsoft Jet Engine or
  ODBCDirect files.

  Only the files described in this section can be distributed with your
  application to other users. You cannot distribute other files, such as .hlp
  files or DAO header (.h) files.

  NOTE: The DAO directory and System32 directory are explained in section 3.2.

  a. DAO

     DAO is comprised of the following core files (these files must be installed
     for DAO to function):

     File         Description          Installed   Registered  Directory
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     DAO350.DLL    DAO version 3.5      Shared        Yes       DAO
     DAO2535.TLB   Type Library         Companion     No        DAO
                                        to DAO350.DLL
     MSJTER35.DLL  Microsoft Jet        System        No        System32
                   (and DAO) error
                   message DLL
     MSJINT35.DLL  Localized Microsoft  System        No        System32
                   Jet (and DAO) error
                   strings
     MSVCRT40.DLL  C Runtime DLL        System        No        System32
   

  b. Microsoft Jet Engine

     1. Core Jet files
        Microsoft Jet is comprised of the following core files. These files are
        sufficient to access version 3.0 .MDB databases and ODBC data sources
        (in conjunction with an installed ODBC driver) when installed with
        DAO.

     File         Description          Installed   Registered  Directory
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     MSJET35.DLL  Microsoft Jet engine  System         Yes     System32
                  (version 3.5)
     MSRD2X35.DLL MDB files from       Companion       Yes     System32
                  Microsoft Access     to MSJET35.DLL
                  2.0, Visual Basic
                  3.0 or earlier
     MSJTER35.DLL Microsoft Jet (and   System          No      System32
                  DAO) error message
                  DLL
     MSJINT35.DLL Localized Microsoft  System          No      System32
                  Jet (and DAO) error
                  strings
     VBAJET32.DLL VBA-Microsoft Jet    System          No      System32
                  Expression service
     VBAR332.DLL  VBA Runtime          System          No      System32
   

     2. Optional files
        The following optional files provide access to other data formats.
        Install the DLLs that correspond to the file format you need to
        support, or if you need replication support.

     Module        Description         Installed   Registered  Directory
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     MSREPL35.DLL  Microsoft Jet       System      No          System32
                   Replication
     MSXBSE35.DLL  Xbase formats       System      Yes         System32
     MSPDOX35.DLL  Paradox formats     System      Yes         System32
     MSTEXT35.DLL  Text files          System      Yes         System32
     MSEXCL35.DLL  Spreadsheet files   System      Yes         System32
     MSLTUS35.DLL  Lotus formats       System      Yes         System32
     MSEXCH35.DLL  Exchange formats    System      Yes         System32
      

  c. ODBCDirect

     Install the following files for supporting ODBCDirect functionality. DAO
     uses RDO to handle it's ODBCDirect functionality. For this reason you may
     recognize these files as the core RDO files.

     File          Description          Installed   Registered  Directory
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
     
     MSRDO20.dll  Remote Database       Shared          Yes     System32
                  Objects 2.0
     RDOCURS.dll  Batch Client Cursor   Companion       No*     System32
                  Library               to MSRDO20.DLL
   

  * Rdocurs.dll is not a COM server (it doesn't export DllRegisterServer) so it
  is not registered. The Daosetup.rtf is incorrect and Regsrv32.exe should not
  be run against Rdocurs.dll.

3. Installation
  The following sections provide information on using the installation
  procedure.

  a. Check if files are in use.
     The first step in the installation procedure is to see if programs that are
     using any files you may be installing are running. If they are you may
     need to abort the installation and request the user to close other
     applications before installing DAO.

  b. Copy the files.
     Copy all files listed as DAO files (except the Dao350.dll and Dao2535.tlb),
     and all Microsoft Jet Engine core files (and application specific optional
     files) or ODBCDirect files (depending upon the needs of your application)
     to the system (system32 for Windows NT) directory (referred to in the
     charts above as the System32 directory). Per usual DLL standards, you need
     to copy with version checking to make sure a newer version of the file is
     not overwritten by your installation. All the DAO files contain
     appropriate version resources.

     Use the following procedure to copy Dao350.dll and Dao2535.tlb:

     1. For Windows NT (earlier version than 4.0), the DAO files always go into
        &lt;windows&gt;\MSAPPS\DAO. For example, c:\winnt35\msapps\DAO. For
        Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, the DAO directory is approximately
        c:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DAO. The exact location
        varies if the user has a non-English version of Windows 95, which must
        read the location from the registry. Locate the following node in the
        registry:

           HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
      

        and retrieve the value of the key named CommonFilesDir.

     2. If this registry key does not exist, then create it and set the value
        to:

           \Program Files\Common Files
      

        Make sure to use the correct drive letter.

     3. After you have the value of the key, which will typically be:

           c:\Program Files\Common Files
      

        then append "\Microsoft Shared\DAO" and use that as the destination
        location for the Dao350.dll and Dao2535.tlb.

     4. Copy Dao350.dll and Dao2535.tlb to this directory using version
        checking. This is the Directory referred to in the charts above as the
        DAO directory.

  c. Register the DLLs.
     After you copy all of the DLLs, you need to register them. You do this by
     calling the DLLRegisterServer entry point on each DLL if it exists. Note
     that because DAO requires Microsoft Jet before it can successfully
     register, the order of copying files given previously is important.

     Your setup program should use Regsvr32.exe or an equivalent call to execute
     the DLLRegisterServer within the following dlls (if they have been
     installed by step 3b): Dao350.dll, Msjet35.dll, Msrd2x35.dll,
     Msexcl35.dll, Mspdox35.dll, Msxbse35.dll, Msltus35.dll, Mstext35.dll,
     Msexch35.dll, Msrdo20.dll.

     Following are some special considerations you should keep in mind:

      - Dao350.dll needs to have Msvcrt40.dll and other required files on the
        computer before it can register. If DAO fails to register, check the
        version of MSVCRT40.DLL. Problems are typically seen under Windows 95
        where the version should be 4.10.6038 (about 319K file).

      - Msrdo20.dll needs to have ODBC installed before it will register. Use
        the ODBC Installation program to install ODBC.

      - Msexch35.dll needs to have MAPI installed on your system before it can
        register.

  d. Update the file reference counts.
     Because DAO is shared by many programs, a count is kept of how many times
     the DLL has been installed. This allows uninstall programs to remove the
     file only when no other program needs it. This is the same for the
     Msrdo20.dll. The other files are never removed from the system.

     1. Under the following location, search for a key with the same name as
        the file you've installed:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SharedDlls\ 
      

     2. If the key exists, increment its value by one (it is a dword). If the
        key does not exist, you need to create a key that is the name of the
        file (including path) of type dword and give it a value of 1. A typical
        entry would be:

        \\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\DAO
           \\DAO350.DLL"=dword:00000001
      

        (This example is in the export format used by regedit; you would only
        use single backslashes when creating the key.)

        Make sure you reference count both the Msrdo20.dll and the Dao350.dll.

4. Uninstall
  To conform with Windows 95 guidelines, programs must be able to uninstall
  themselves and remove any files and registry entries they create. Many setup
  toolkits, such as the provided InstallShield toolkit, provide this as
  "built-in" functionality. It is beyond the scope of this document to provide
  all the details of Windows 95 installation requirements, but here are the
  basic steps required to uninstall DAO. Note that only the shared components
  and their companion files will be removed. The installed system files will
  never be removed.

  The Dao350.dll and Dao2535.tlb will be removed only if the value of
  Dao350.dll's reference count key is 1. Otherwise the count is decremented and
  the file left in place. For example:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SharedDlls\
  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DAO\DAO350.DLL"

  Before removing Dao350.dll, you need to call its entry point
  DLLUnregisterServer so that it can remove its entries from the registry. You
  can do this by using Regsvr32.exe with the -u option.

  The same rules apply for the Msrdo20.dll and it's companion file of
  Rdocurs.dll.
