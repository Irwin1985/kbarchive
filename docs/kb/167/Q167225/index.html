The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With Visual Basic 5.0 and higher Enterprise edition, you have the ability to
connect to an Oracle database through a DSN-Less connection, execute a stored
procedure using parameters, and get return values from that stored procedure.
The example in this article illustrates all of this functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The example in this article is a simple Visual Basic project that creates a
DSN-Less connection against an Oracle database and executes a stored procedure.
When working with Oracle and the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle, there are
some settings that are different than working with Microsoft SQL Server. These
differences occur because you are using a different ODBC driver.

The Visual Basic 5.0 and higher Enterprise edition includes RDO 2.0 and the
Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle. Both of these need to be installed in order to
run the example project in this article.

NOTE: The ODBC driver from Oracle does not support the entire RDO 2.0 feature set
(including the calling of stored procedures and binding return values).

The following example was created against an Oracle 7.3 database through a
SQL*Net 2.3 connection. All of the following code (including the stored
procedure) should work fine with Oracle 7.2. But, the Microsoft ODBC Driver for
Oracle Help file states that it only supports SQL*Net 2.3

There are two objects that need to be created on the Oracle database; a table
(rdooracle) and a stored procedure (rdoinsert). Following are the data
definition language (DDL) scripts to create these objects:

- RDOORACLE: This is just a two-column table with the first column set as the
  primary key:

        CREATE TABLE rdooracle (
                  item_number    NUMBER(3) PRIMARY KEY,
                  depot_number   NUMBER(3));

- RDOINSERT: This procedure accepts a single numeric input parameter and
  returns a single numeric output parameter. The input parameter is first used
  by an input statement then it is divided by 2 and set as the output
  parameter:

        CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE rdoinsert
           (insnum IN NUMBER, outnum OUT NUMBER)
        IS
        BEGIN
        INSERT INTO rdooracle
           (Item_Number, Depot_Number)
        VALUES
           (insnum, 16);
        outnum := insnum/2;
        END;

NOTE: You must use Procedures that have output parameters and not Functions when
working with Oracle and RDO placeholder parameters.

The above scripts can be run from SQL*Plus or from within the Visual Database
Tools Add-In in the Visual Basic 5.0 Enterprise edition. Once these objects have
been created, you can create the Visual Basic project that will use them.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

This example project uses a simple form to send a bind parameter to the RDOINSERT
stored procedure and then return the output parameter from that procedure. Here
are the steps to create the project:

1. Open a new project in Visual Basic 5.0 Enterprise edition. Form1 is created
  by default.

2. Place the following controls on the form:

     Control     Name     Text/Caption
     ---------------------------------
     Button      cmdCheck  Check
     Button      cmdSend   Send
     Text Box    txtInput
     Label       lblInput  Input:

3. From the Tools menu, select the Options item. Click the Default Full Module
  View option and then click OK. This will allow you to view all of the code
  for this project.

4. Paste the following code into your code window:

        Option Explicit
        Dim Cn As rdoConnection
        Dim En As rdoEnvironment
        Dim CPw As rdoQuery
        Dim Rs As rdoResultset
        Dim Conn As String
        Dim QSQL As String
        Dim Response As String
        Dim Prompt As String

        Private Sub cmdCheck_Click()

            QSQL = "Select Item_Number, Depot_Number From rdooracle Where " _
            &amp; "item_number =" &amp; txtInput.Text
            Set Rs = Cn.OpenResultset(QSQL, rdOpenStatic, , rdExecDirect)

            Prompt = "Item_Number = " &amp; Rs(0) &amp; ".  Depot_Number = " _
            &amp; Rs(1) &amp; "."

            Response = MsgBox(Prompt, , "Query Results")

            Rs.Close

        End Sub

        Private Sub cmdSend_Click()

            CPw(0) = Val(txtInput.Text)
            CPw.Execute

            Prompt = "Return value from stored procedure is " &amp; CPw(1) &amp; "."
            Response = MsgBox(Prompt, , "Stored Procedure Result")

        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()

            Conn = "UID=;PWD=;driver={Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle};" _
                 &amp; "CONNECTSTRING=MyOracle;"

            Set En = rdoEnvironments(0)
            Set Cn = En.OpenConnection("", rdDriverPrompt, False, Conn)
            QSQL = "{call rdoinsert(?,?)}"
            Set CPw = Cn.CreateQuery("", QSQL)

        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)

            En.Close

        End Sub

5. Run the project.

When you enter a number in the text box, txtInput, and click the "Send" button,
the Oracle stored procedure, RDOINSERT, is called. The number you entered in the
text box is used as the input parameter for the procedure. The output parameter
is used in a message box that is called after the stored procedure has completed
processing. With your original value still in the text box, click the "Check"
button. This creates a simple read-only resultset that is displayed in another
message box.

Following is a detailed explanation of the code used in this demonstration
project:

The Form_Load event contains the code that creates the DSN-Less connection. It
also contains the code that creates the query that calls the stored procedure:

      Private Sub Form_Load()

         Conn = "UID=;PWD=;driver={Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle};" _
              &amp; "CONNECTSTRING=MyOracle;"

         Set En = rdoEnvironments(0)
         Set Cn = En.OpenConnection("", rdDriverPrompt, False, Conn)
         QSQL = "{call rdoinsert(?,?)}"
         Set CPw = Cn.CreateQuery("", QSQL)

     End Sub

Note that you are not using the rdPreparedStatement object. This object has been
replaced by the rdoQuery object. This is new for RDO 2.0. Also, with RDO 2.0,
you do not need to explicitly create a connection object as is done in this
project. You can create a stand-alone query object that is not specifically
associated with a connection. To learn more about this functionality, look up
the rdoQuery Object in the Visual Basic 5.0 Enterprise edition Help file.

The connect string used to open a connection to an Oracle database (or any
database) is very dependent upon the underlying ODBC driver. Even though similar
parameters are used by most ODBC drivers (UID, PWD, etc.), the connect string
used here will work only with the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle:

  Conn = "UID=;PWD=;driver={Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle};" _
              &amp; "CONNECTSTRING=MyOracle;"

The most important part of this connect string is the "CONNECTSTRING" keyword. It
is used only by the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle. For Microsoft SQL Server
6.5, you use the keyword "SERVER." The string assigned to CONNECTSTRING is the
Database Alias that you set up in SQL*Net. This is the only difference in the
connect string when connecting to an Oracle database. All of the other
parameters operate as described in the Help file (under rdoConnection Object)
for Visual Basic 5.0 Enterprise edition. As stated in the Help file, for a
connection, you do not specify a DSN in the connect string.

Also in the Form_Load event is the code that creates the query object that calls
the stored procedure:

     QSQL = "{call rdoinsert(?,?)}"
     Set CPw = Cn.CreateQuery("", QSQL)

With Oracle, you cannot specify a return value for a stored procedure call as you
can with Microsoft SQL Server 6.5; you must use stored procedures that have
output parameters as noted earlier in this article. The parameter placeholders
in the QSQL string are denoted by a "?" and referenced in the order they in
which they appear in the string. For more information on the use of parameter
placeholders in the rdoQuery object, refer to the rdoParameter object in the
Visual Basic 5.0 Enterprise edition Help file.

The remainder of the project is fairly straight-forward and well-documented in
both the online Help file and Books Online, both of which come with Visual Basic
5.0. The RDO issues critical to working with Oracle, the connect string, and the
calling of stored procedures have been detailed in this project. For more
information on these issues, please consult your Oracle SQL*Net 2.3
documentation, the Help file for the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle, and your
Oracle 7 server documentation.
