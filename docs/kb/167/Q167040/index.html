SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a copy of the Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
Performance Update for Microsoft Windows NT Server and Workstation version 4.0
Release Notes. The PPTP Performance Update has been replaced by the PPTP
Performance and Security Upgrade for WinNT 4.0. For your convenience, the
English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted to the following
Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you install Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) Performance Update for
    Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server and Workstation Release Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please use this document to address questions which may arise during the
installation of this PPTP Update for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server and
Workstation.

Information on Installation
---------------------------

Microsoft has released a PPTP Performance Update for the Windows NT Workstation
and Server version 4.0. We have made refinements to current Windows PPTP client
and server communication technologies that significantly improve the performance
of secure PPTP connections via the Internet.

This update should be applied to both Windows NT 4.0 Servers and Workstations.
You must have Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0 installed before applying this
update. Windows NT 4.0 Servers running Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS)
must first apply this Windows NT PPTP Update followed by the RRAS Hotfix 2.0.
For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q168469
  TITLE : RRAS Upgrade for WinNT Server 4.0 Hotfix Pack 2.0 Release Notes

This update is packaged in an auto-install format. Copy the Update to a temporary
directory, and double-click the executable name or type the executable name
"pptpfixi.exe" for x86 or "pptpfixa.exe" for alpha (without quotation marks) at
a command prompt to install.

The files can also be extracted from the Update without installing them. To do
this, copy the Update to a temporary directory, and type pptpfixi/x or
pptpfixa/x at a command prompt. After extracting the files, the Update can be
installed by typing hotfix at a command prompt.

To uninstall this update, type "HOTFIX -Y" (without the quotation marks) from the
directory you copied the files to.

Output of "HOTFIX -?":

  HOTFIX [-y] [-f] [-n] [-z] [-q] [-m] [-l]
     -y Perform uninstall (only with -m or -q)
     -f Force apps closed at shutdown
     -n Do not create uninstall directory
     -z Do not reboot when update completes
     -q Quiet or Unattended mode with no user interface
     -m Unattended mode with user interface
     -l List installed hotfixes

RAS Servers that terminate compulsory PPTP connections from an FEP (Front End
Processor) must disable historyless compression/encryption in order for legacy
Windows 95 clients to receive data properly. An FEP is a dial-up server which
can create a PPTP tunnel on behalf of its dial-up clients. This feature is
available from several Access Server vendors, including Compaq (Microcom),
Ascend, and 3com.

The value to set in the registry to enable/disable historyless
encryption/compression is:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NdisWan
\Parameters

  Historyless: REG_DWORD: 0 - Disabled
               REG_DWORD: 1 - Enabled [default]

New Features Added in this Update:

PPTP Performance Issues Addressed in this Update:

- A new historyless mode for encryption and compression over PPTP connections
  has been enabled in this update. This new mode solves performance problems
  encountered using PPTP in high latency networks or networks that experience
  significant packet loss. This upgrade is fully compatible with legacy PPTP
  systems. However, in order to negotiate historyless mode, both the PPTP
  client and server must support it. If either client or server refuses the new
  mode, normal MPPE compression and encryption will be negotiated. To
  experience the full benefit of the PPTP performance update, this Update must
  be installed on both Windows NT clients and servers.



- The default PPTP receive window size was increased to 16.

- The window between the NDISWAN driver and the PPTP driver was increased.

- The PPTP frame size defaults to 1400 bytes to avoid packet fragmentation.
  This was fixed in an earlier hotfix, and is also included in this update. It
  is documented at:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q162/2/30.asp

Other Issues Addressed in this Update
-------------------------------------

Remote Access Service and PPTP Issues:

- PPTP server responsiveness has been improved during the time period right
  after termination of multiple PPTP connections.

- Corrected a problem in the PPTP server in which an improperly configured
  "start session" in the packet header could disable a PPTP server. It is
  documented at

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q179/1/07.asp

- Improved integrity of session encryption in MPPE by removing predictability
  of successive packet following an encryption or compression reset.

- Corrected a user interface issue where, under certain situations, a RAS/PPTP
  server could allow a client to connect with no data encryption even though
  the administrator was under the impression that the server was configured to
  require data encryption. It is documented at:

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q177/6/70.asp

- Updated MSCHAP to disable sending the LM hash when client set to "require"
  128-bit encryption.

Other Windows NT Issues Addressed in this Update:

- This release includes an enhancement to TCP/IP which will improve the
  performance of TCP-based applications over high latency networks, such as the
  Internet.
