SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to record a macro using the Previous Row or Next Row buttons
(in the Table Cell Height And Width dialog box), you do not receive the results
you expect when you play back the macro.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when either of the following conditions is true when you
record the macro:

- The macro was recorded using the Previous Row command and the insertion point
  was in the first row of the table.

-or-

- The macro was recorded using the Next Row command and the insertion point was
  in the last row of the table.

When you run the recorded macro it does not wrap to the beginning or end of the
table as it does when you perform these actions manually.

To work around this problem, edit the recorded macro.

In Visual Basic for Applications, there are several methods which can be used to
move the insertion point. Shown below are suggested methods that can be used to
effectively wrap the insertion point to the first or last row of the current
table in a document.

Using the Previous Row command
------------------------------

Look for the following command line if you recorded a macro that uses the
Previous Row command

     Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=-1

and change the command line to the following:

     ' Make sure the insertion point is within a table.
     If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) Then
        ' If at top of table,
        If Selection.Rows(1).Index = 1 Then
           ' Wrap to bottom of table.
           Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=Selection.Tables(1).Rows.Count
        Else
           ' Otherwise, move up one row.
           Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=-1
        End If
     End If

Using the Next Row command
--------------------------

Look for the following command line if you recorded a macro that uses the Next
Row command

     Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=1

and change the command line to the following:

       ' Make sure the insertion point is within a table.
     If Selection.Information(wdWithInTable) Then
        ' If at bottom of table,
        If Selection.Rows(1).Index = Selection.Tables(1).Rows.Count Then
           ' Wrap to top of table.
           Selection.StartOf wdTable, wdMove
        Else
           ' Otherwise, move down one row.
           Selection.Move Unit:=wdRow, Count:=1
        End If
     End If
