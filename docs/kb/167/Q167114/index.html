-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the past, the Package Command Manager (PCM) has been installed as a service
(Pcmsvc32.exe) on Systems Management Server logon servers, but only as an
application (Pcmwin32.exe) on Systems Management Server Windows NT clients.
Because the client version runs as an application, packages that are run from
PCM are run in the security context of the currently logged-on user.

You can now install PCM as a service on any computer running Windows NT
Workstation or Windows NT Server stand-alone (Intel or Alpha) that is a member
of a Windows NT Server domain and is a Systems Management Server 1.2 client. In
addition to the new Pcmsvc.exe file, the Pcmwin32.exe file has been changed and
will need to be replaced on the client computers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PCM service requires a user account that has:

- Administrator privileges on the client computer.

- Domain user authority to read a PCM instruction file on the Systems
  Management Server logon server and to run a setup program in the package
  directory on the Systems Management Server distribution server.

Because it works through a user account with administrative privileges, the PCM
service can perform tasks that the PCM application cannot. For example, it can
install files into secured directories or make changes to secured registry
keys.

You can download installation instructions and file updates on the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt

On the Web site, select "Download &amp; Trial", then "PCM as a Service."

The PCM as a service update can also be downloaded from the Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/servers

Click Download to download the Pcmupdte.exe file to your computer. In addition to
the files necessary for running PCM as a service, this self- extracting
executable file also contains an Install.doc file that contains comprehensive
information about how to install and use PCM as a service on client computers
that are running Windows NT.
