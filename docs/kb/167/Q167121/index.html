SUMMARY
=======

COMCTLZP.EXE is a compressed file that contains an updated version of
Comctl32.ocx and its supporting files for Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51 with
Service Pack 5, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000. Version 5.00.3828 fixes a
couple of problems with the versions 5.00.3714 and 5.00.3422. The updated
version is also available through the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1.

For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q170365 INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

If you own Visual Basic 4.0 or the Office Developer Edition 97 the update is
available as a separate download.

NOTE: You do not need this file if you already have a later (higher) version on
your system. Newer versions of Comctl32.ocx come with the later versions of the
products listed at the begining of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  comctlzp.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95upg/update/1/w97/EN-US/comctlzp.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To install the new version of COMCTL32.OCX, download COMCTLZP.EXE. This is a
self-extracting zip file that will extract two files when executed. The first
file is README.TXT which contains instructions very similar to this article. The
second file is COMCTL32.EXE. This file is a setup program that will install
COMCTL32.OCX and supporting files on Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51 with Service
Pack 5, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000.

Before executing COMCTL32.EXE, you must have the following versions of the
Automation system files on your system:

+-------------------------------------+
| Filename     | Version              | 
+-------------------------------------+
| OLEAUT32.DLL | 2.20.4054 or greater | 
+-------------------------------------+
| COMCAT.DLL   | 4.71 or greater      | 
+-------------------------------------+
| OLEPRO32.DLL | 5.00.4055 or greater | 
+-------------------------------------+
| ASYCFILT.DLL | 2.20.4056 or greater | 
+-------------------------------------+
| STDOLE2.TLB  | 2.20.4054 or greater | 
+-------------------------------------+

If you do not have these files, you must first download and install them as
documented in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q180071 FILE: Msvbvm50.exe Installs Visual Basic 5.0 Run-Time Files


If you have Office 97, Visual Basic 5.0, Visual Studio 97, Internet Explorer 3.0,
or Visual C++ 5.0, you should already have these Automation system files.

Once you are sure you have the correct Automation system files on your computer,
you can install COMCTL32.OCX by executing COMCTL32.EXE. This will install the
following files:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Filename     | Version   | Description                                       | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| COMCTL32.OCX | 5.00.3828 | Updated ActiveX control                           | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| COMCTL32.DEP | 5.00.3828 | Dependency info for Visual Basic 5.0 Setup Wizard | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| MSSTKPRP.DL  | 5.00.3714 | Design-Time Stock Property Pages                  | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The setup program does not install a license to use COMCTL32.OCX for development.
You must already have a license installed on your system by one of the products
listed in the applies to section above in order to COMCTL32.OCX for
development.

Version 5.00.3828 of COMCTL32.OCX fixes two specific problems in version
5.00.3714 of the control. For more information, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q167122 FIX: FindItem Method of ListView Incorrectly Returns an Error

  Q167123 FIX: COMCTL32.OCX is Binary Incompatible with Previous Version

The Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Kit was not designed to distribute version 5.00.3828
of COMCTL32.OCX. For COMCTL32.OCX to be deployed correctly the Automation System
Files must be deployed also. To update the Automation system Files, install
MSVBVM50.EXE before you install the setup program created by the Visual Basic
4.0 Setup Wizard. Visual Basic 4.0 developers may also want to update the
SWDEPEND.INI entries for COMCTL32.OCX to remove any unnecessary dependencies for
the new control. This prevents the Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard from
distributing unnecessary files.
