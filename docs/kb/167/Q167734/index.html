SUMMARY
=======

The MFC browser library (MFC.BSC) that ships with Visual C++ is incomplete. The
browser cannot find some symbols in MFC (for example, References to
CDC::m_hDC).

There are two self-extracting files included in this article. They both contain
Mfc.bsc files.

Mfcbsc1.exe contains Mfc.bsc file created with Devstudio installed under the root
directory of a drive. If you have installed Devstudio under the root directory
of a drive, then download this file.

Mfcbsc2.exe contains Mfc.bsc file created with Devstudio installed under Program
Files directory. If you chose the default directory while installing Devstudio,
then download this file.

If you have installed Devstudio in a path that does not match any of the above
two, then download any one of the files and put it in the
&lt;Drive&gt;:\&lt;Devstudio directory path&gt;\vc\mfc\src directory. When you
open the browse file and search for a symbol, the browser will not be able to
find the sources. However, it will prompt you for the path and from then on it
should be able to find the sources. This happens every time you open the browse
file.

Copy the .exe to the &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;Devstudio directory path&gt;\vc\mfc\src
and execute it. It should extract mfc.bsc file in that directory.

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  MFCbsc1.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc50pro/file1/2/WIN98/EN-US/MFCbsc1.exe)

  MFCbsc2.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/VC50pro/file2/2/Win98/EN-US/MFCbsc2.exe)

Release Date: June 30, 2000

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Alternatively, you can rebuild the MFC browser library (MFC.BSC) on your
machine. First you must have the MFC source files installed.

Follow this procedure:

1. Verify that you have around 400 megabytes of free disk space on the drive
  where Visual C++ is installed. This much space is required to build the
  browse information. 358 megabytes is used by the .SBR files. The .SBR files
  can be freed once the browser database has been built. Temp files require the
  additional space. Temp files are automatically deleted.

2. From a Command Prompt, run the Vcvars32.Bat which should be in the
  &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;DevStudio directory path&gt;\vc\bin to set the proper
  environment variables. Change to the &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;Devstudio directory
  path&gt;\Vc\Mfc\Src directory, and build the browse information by running
  the nmake on the makefile as follows:

  nmake browseonly=1 no_pch=1 no_pdb=1 dll=2

  This creates NafxeWD.bsc file and a subdirectory called $DLLD.W with .SBR
  files.

3. Provided you do not plan to rebuild the browse database frequently, remove
  all files in the $DLLD.W directory, and then remove the directory itself. The
  intermediate .SBR files occupy roughly 358 megabytes of disk space and are
  not required to use the browser.

4. You can rename the new browse file to Mfc.bsc from NafxeWD.bsc.

To use the browser file, start Visual C++, and click Open on the File menu.
Choose the .BSC file that you just created. Click Tools, and then click Source
Browser. The Browser window appears and you can look up any of the MFC functions
or data variables.
