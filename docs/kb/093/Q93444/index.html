SUMMARY
=======

The performance of Microsoft LAN Manager networks using TCP/IP can often be
increased significantly by carefully tuning several stack parameters:

- tcpsegmentsize (the maximum size of a single TCP segment)

- tcpwindowsize (the amount of data a receiving TCP stack can buffer)

- nbsessions (the maximum number of NetBIOS sessions available)

- tcpconnections (the maximum number of TCP connections available)

For optimum performance, tcpsegmentsize should be the size of the MTU (maximum
transfer unit) the media can handle, minus all headers up through the IP layer.
LAN Manager TCP/IP allows sizes of 1450 bytes or less to be assigned to this
parameter.

Also for optimum performance, tcpwindowsize should typically be as large as
possible, in increments of tcpsegmentsize. Increasing tcpwindowsize, however,
requires more memory, which can be a problem under MS-DOS. The TCP driver must
load into a single 64K segment of memory. The driver must be able to buffer
"tcpwindowsize" bytes of data on EACH tcpconnection, so the tcpwindowsize and
tcpconnections values must be balanced against each other to achieve the best
overall performance and connectivity.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Microsoft LAN Manager TCP/IP workstation connects to a resource on a
server, a TCP connection is established to the server unless one already exists.
Next, a NetBIOS session is established over that TCP connection. If a second
resource on the same server is requested, the SAME NetBIOS session and TCP
connection are used, and activity for both resources is multiplexed over that
single session and connection. However, any connections made using the Microsoft
TCP/IP utilities for LAN Manager to other resources use one TCP connection
each.

So, tuning can be reduced to a simple process:

1. Determine the number of TCP connections needed on your workstation.

2. Set nbsessions and TCPUTILS.INI parameters as appropriate.

3. Use the table below to choose the largest possible tcpwindowsize.

Example
-------

A "net use" command on the client shows:

Status      Local name     Remote name

OK          D:             \\server1\shareD
OK          E:             \\server1\shareE
OK          F:             \\server2\shareF
OK          G:             \\server2\shareG
OK          H:             \\server3\shareH
OK          I:             \\server3\shareI
OK          LPT1           \\server1\laser
OK          LPT2           \\server1\lineprint

Notice there are sessions to three servers, using three nbsessions, and three
tcpconnections. In addition, assume you have the Microsoft TCP/IP Utilities for
LAN Manager installed, and you use one telnet session and three sockets. By
default, the value of nbsessions is 6, which allows some headroom for sessions
to more LAN Manager servers.

The formula used internally for tcpconnections is:

  tcpconnections = nbsessions + 1 + [nsessions + numsockets]

Nsessions and numsockets exist only if the utilities are installed, and examining
the TCPUTILS.INI file reveals their default values to be 2 and 8, respectively.
(In LAN Manager 2.2, the value for numsockets is scheduled to change to 4).

So, if you are using LAN Manager version 2.1a or earlier, the default
tcpconnections are 6 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 17. You only need one telnet connection and
three sockets, so you should first reduce those parameters in TCPUTILS.INI.
After the reduction, you are left with 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 11 tcpconnections. The
table below shows that you can support a tcpwindowsize of no more than 2900
bytes on an MS-DOS client.

tcpconnections  tcpwindowsize  tcpsegmentsize
 6 or less         5800           1450
 7 - 8             4350           1450
 9 - 11            2900           1450  &lt;-- Optimum configuration
12 - 22            1450           1450      for 11 tcpconnections

You can add these parameters to the PROTOCOL.INI file in the [TCPIP_XIF] section.
You should also modify the MS OS/2 server for versions 2.1 and 2.1a. In
PROTOCOL.INI, set:

tcpsegmentsize=1450   (the same as for the clients)
tcpwindowsize=4350    (MS OS/2 normally has plenty of memory for this)

Microsoft no longer recommends setting the tcpconnections value in PROTOCOL.INI,
and may remove the parameter in a future version. For the best results, adjust
the parameters that are used to calculate tcpconnections and allow it to adjust
internally.

Note that if you don't have the utilities installed and aren't using sockets or
telnet, tcpconnections calculates to 6 + 1 = 7, so you would select a
tcpwindowsize of 4350 from the above table.

NOTE: If your network adapter card is incapable of handling a tcpwindowsize burst
of frames, it may drop one or more of them. If this occurs, performance will
degrade seriously. Some older cards may be able to buffer only one incoming
frame at a time.

The tcpwindowsize should be as large as possible within the memory constraints of
the systems involved. On MS OS/2, tcpwindowsize should work at 4350 in all
cases, and this will be the new default in LAN Manager 2.2. Performance gains
will be most significant on high-delay networks such as those found in many WAN
environments.
