1.0  General Notes
------------------

There are many settings in the SYSTEM.INI file that affect the way
Windows for Workgroups works. You can change these settings to correct
most problems you might have while using Windows for Workgroups and
other networks. See the SYSINI.WRI online document for information
about changing the following SYSTEM.INI settings:

  [Boot]
  Network.drv=
  SecondNet.drv=

  [Standard]
  Int28Filter=
  NetHeapSize=

  [386Enh]
  AllVMsExclusive=
  EMMExclude=
  FileSysChange=
  InDOSPolling=
  Int28Critical=
  NetAsyncFallback=
  NetAsyncTimeout=
  NetDMASize=
  NetHeapSize=
  Network=
  ReflectDOSInt2A=
  SecondNet=
  TimerCriticalSection=
  Transport=
  TokenRingSearch=
  V86ModeLANAs=
  UniqueDOSPSP=

  [network]
  Exclude=
  LANAs=

The Windows for Workgroups Setup program places the following lines in
your SYSTEM.INI file that are required for Windows for Workgroups to
run correctly. Do not remove any of the following entries:

  [boot]
  network.drv=wfwnet.drv

  [386Enh]
  network=vnetbios.386,vnetsup.386,vredir.386,vserver.386,vbrowse.386,
  vwc.386

If you have upgraded over a previous version of Windows 3.0 or 3.1
with an installed network, Setup may leave entries that may be
unnecessary, causing performance problems or incorrect network
behavior.  If you experience network problems and have any of these
lines in your SYSTEM.INI file (or WIN.INI file), try removing the
lines to see if the problem can be corrected.

In the SYSTEM.INI file:

  [386Enh]
  INDOSPolling=TRUE
  EMMExclude=D800-DFFF (or other memory range)
  TimerCriticalSection=5000 (or other value)
  UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
  PSPIncrement=5
  NetHeapSize=76 (or other value)
  NetAsynchTimeout=50
  NetAsynchFallback=true
  PerVMFiles=0
  OverlappedIO=off
  device=baninst.386
  device=vvinesd.386
  device=decnet.386
  device=decnb.386
  device=lantasti.386
  device=vnetware.386
  device=vipx.386
  device=lanman10.386

In the WIN.INI file:

  load=winpopup.exe
  load=nwpopup.exe

  [ports]
  LPT1.DOS=
  LPT2.DOS=
  LPT3.DOS=

Many protocols and other networks require the TimerCriticalSection
line in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set to a
value of 10000 or greater. For more information, see the SYSINI.WRI
online document.

The default value for the NetHeapSize line in the [Standard] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file is 8K. Although some applications require this
value, in most cases you can decrease the value to 4K in order to
increase the amount of memory available to your applications. A few
applications require the value to be 4K.

If you want to change your network configuration, use Control Panel to
make the changes.

Some network adapters require the ExcludeHighRegion (or EMMExclude)
line in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to be set to the
memory range used by the adapter. For more information, see your
network-adapter documentation and the SYSINI.WRI online document.

These cards may also require an x= option on the EMM386 command line
in your CONFIG.SYS file. For more information, see Chapter 11,
"Managing Memory and Performance," in the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups User's Guide. If you are using 386Max, QEMM, or another
memory manager, see your memory-manager documentation to find out
whether you need to exclude this area.

The Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit for the Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups Operating System Version 3.1 contains additional
information about setting up and configuring Windows for Workgroups
for use with other networks and information for system administrators.
This kit provides complete technical information about Windows for
Workgroups for the support professional. It includes a technical
reference manual and a disk containing helpful utilities, system-
resource viewers, drivers, and accessories.

To order the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit within the United
States, call (800) 642-7676.

To order outside the United States, dial the phone number for your
area. You can find this number on the International Subsidiary card.

If you are running a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups from a
network drive, make sure both your personal Windows directory and the
shared network directory are included on the path command line in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To run a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups, you
must start the network before starting Windows for Workgroups. (When
you start the network before you start Windows for Workgroups, about
100K less conventional memory is available.)

If you used setup /n to set up a shared copy of Windows for
Workgroups, and you specified a network directory for your personal
Windows directory, you cannot start the network (real-mode redirector)
before starting Windows for Workgroups unless you first copy your
SYSTEM.INI file to the directory on your hard disk where NET.EXE is
located. NET.EXE should be located in the root directory of your
startup drive.

If you receive sharing violations while running a shared copy of
Windows for Workgroups, make sure that all of the files in the shared
network directory are marked as read-only.

Windows Print Manager spools print jobs to the location specified by
the MS-DOS environment variable TEMP. If TEMP is not set, Print
Manager will use the root of drive C. The TEMP variable may be set by
placing a set temp= statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or network
login script. For example, to spool to the network directory
C:\WINDOWS\TEMP, you would use the statement set temp=c:\windows\temp.
Each user must have a personal TEMP directory.

2.0  Using Novell NetWare
-------------------------

For information about setting up Novell NetWare support in Windows for
Workgroups, see Appendix B, "Using Windows for Workgroups with Other
Networks," in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups User's Guide.

Windows for Workgroups includes the following NetWare files:

  NETX.COM (version 3.26)
  MSIPX.SYS
  MSIPX.COM

Windows for Workgroups uses NDIS network-adapter drivers. ODI network-
adapter drivers are not supported.

In addition:

When you set up NetWare support in Windows for Workgroups, the value
of the LASTDRIVE command in your CONFIG.SYS file is set to P (unless
the command already exists and has a value less than P). When you
restart your computer, your login directory is drive Q. If you have
any NetWare login scripts, make sure they reference the correct drive
letter for your login directory.

When the LASTDRIVE command is set to P, you can use letters from A to
P to connect to other Windows for Workgroups computers or Microsoft
LAN Manager servers. Letters after P are reserved for connecting to
Novell NetWare servers.

Do not try to log in, log out, attach, or detach a Novell server from
MS-DOS Prompt within Windows. You should log in before starting
Windows for Workgroups and attach or detach servers by using File
Manager or Print Manager.

If you are using a token-ring network and the driver on your Novell
server does not support source routing (for example, IBM token-ring
drivers prior to version 2.4), remove the ROUTE.COM statement from
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

If you have problems connecting to a Novell server, make sure the
Adapter Media Type setting in Control Panel matches your Novell
NetWare software configuration. For more information, see Chapter 6,
"Troubleshooting," in the "Getting Started" manual.

By default, NetWare allows you access to only 40 files at a time. When
you are running applications with Windows, you can exceed this limit
rather quickly. If so, you might see unexpected error messages. To
increase the file access limit, add the following line to your
SHELL.CFG file:

  file handles = 60

You should also add the following to your CONFIG.SYS file:

  files = 60

If you get unusable output when printing to a NetWare server (such as
incorrect fonts, garbled text, invalid page breaks, or blank lines),
you may need to edit your print-job configuration. Try using the
NetWare PRINTCON utility to set the Auto Endcap and Enable Timeout
options to No.

If you run Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode, swapping to a
drive on a NetWare 286 server might make starting Windows for
Workgroups take up to a minute. For information about controlling the
location of your swap file, see Chapter 11, "Managing Memory and
Performance," in the "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups User's Guide."

A NetWare file server does not include the directory entries dot (.)
and double dot (..) as MS-DOS does. However, the NetWare shell
(version 3.01 or higher) can emulate these entries when applications
attempt to list the files in a directory. If you have problems listing
files or deleting directories, turning on the Show Dots feature will
help. Add the following line to your SHELL.CFG file:

  show dots = on

Turning on Show Dots will cause problems with earlier versions of some
80286-based NetWare utilities, such as BINDFIX.EXE and MAKEUSER.EXE.
Make sure you upgrade these utilities if you upgrade your NetWare
shell. For more information, contact your Novell dealer.

Redirected drives can look different in Windows for Workgroups from
the way they did without Windows for Workgroups. For example, a device
mapped as FileServerName/Volume:Directory will appear in Windows as
FileServerName/Volume:\, showing the root of the file server's shared
volume rather than the subdirectory. You can correct this with the MAP
ROOT entry, as explained in the following information.

In some cases, Windows-based applications may change the default
directory on a drive. This might cause problems if, for example, your
path includes the current directory on a network drive (that is, your
path includes a drive letter without a specific directory, such as z:
instead of z:\system).

You can prevent this problem by using MAP.EXE and LOGIN.EXE versions
3.0 and later to set up false roots, or by choosing the MAP ROOT
function when mapping a connection in File Manager. This feature
simulates the MS-DOS SUBST command, which sets the root of a given
drive to a directory designated by the user instead of to the true
root of the volume.

For example, suppose you normally mapped drive F to the HOME\TERRI
directory on the SERVER\SYS volume, and then included F: in your path.
You would do this by including the following command in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by typing the command before starting Windows:

  map f:=server\sys:home\terri

The default directory on drive F would then be HOME\TERRI. To prevent
Windows from changing this, you would replace the command above with
the following:

  map root f:=server\sys:home\terri

This command would make the directory HOME\TERRI appear to be the root
of drive F.

If Windows for Workgroups is running in 386 enhanced mode, you can
adjust the way Windows handles your network drive mappings by using
the Network option in Control Panel.

Usually, when you quit Windows for Workgroups, all of your drive
mappings are restored to the way they were before you started Windows
for Workgroups, and all changes you made while running Windows are
lost. If you clear the Restore Drives option in the settings dialog
box for NetWare, the mappings you made in Windows for Workgroups will
remain when you quit.

Typically, each instance of MS-DOS Prompt you start from Windows for
Workgroups has its own set of drive mappings. Changes you make in one
instance do not affect another. If you set the NWShareHandles option,
drive mappings will instead be global, and changes to the mappings or
the current drive made in one instance of MS-DOS Prompt will affect
all other applications. If you are running a NetWare 286 server,
setting NWShareHandles increases the number of workstations that can
be connected to the server before the server runs out of available
connections.

See the Help available in the Network dialog box in Control Panel for
more information on these options.

If you have applications or files that use extended characters (ASCII
characters above 128) and you have problems viewing or using them, try
adding the following line to your SHELL.CFG file:

  special uppercase = on

When connecting or disconnecting network resources from File Manager,
Print Manager, or Control Panel, pay attention to the state of the
Permanent check box. If this option is selected when you make a
connection, the connection is automatically made each time you restart
Windows for Workgroups. To stop reconnecting, disconnect with the
Permanent check box selected. If the option is not selected when you
disconnect, the connection is removed for the current Windows session
but is reconnected when you restart Windows for Workgroups.

If you want to use IPX-based applications with Windows for Workgroups
running in standard mode, you must be sure to load the TBMI2.COM
memory-resident program before starting Windows for Workgroups.

This file is included on the Windows for Workgroups Setup disks. You
can use the MS-DOS expand command to copy it to your hard disk if it
is not already there.

If you were running Novell NetBIOS before you set up Windows for
Workgroups, the Setup program attempts to remove it when you set up
Windows for Workgroups. The following procedure describes how to
install Novell NetBIOS after you have set up Windows for Workgroups.

Note: This example assumes that you have one network adapter running
Microsoft NetBEUI. For information about the settings used in this
example and how to change them, see the SYSINI.WRI online document.

To install Novell NetBIOS after you have set up Windows for
Workgroups:

1. Add the following line to the [network] section of your SYSTEM.INI
  file:

     exclude=0

2. Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI
  file:

     V86ModeLANAs=0

3. If you plan to start the network before you start Windows (run the
  real-mode network), this line should read as follows:

     V86ModeLANAs=0,1

  You should also add the following line to the [network] section of
  your SYSTEM.INI file:

     LANAs=0,1

  You should also add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     net start netbeui

This line should come after the NET START command and after the line
that loads NETBIOS.EXE, but before any other network commands.

4. In your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, make sure that the line that loads
  NETBIOS.EXE comes after the initial NET START command and after the
  MSIPX and NETX commands but before any other commands that load
  components of the Windows for Workgroups networking software (for
  example, commands such as NET START NETBEUI or NET LOGON).

After Windows for Workgroups is installed, applications that use named
pipes to communicate with NetWare servers may no longer work
correctly. Applications that use named pipes to communicate with
Microsoft LAN Manager servers will work with Windows for Workgroups.

Many network applications that use named pipes can also be configured
to use another method of communicating on the network, such as IPX or
SPX. Contact your network-application vendor for additional details.
