The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run MemMaker and you have MS-DOS installed on a drive other than your
startup (boot) drive (which is usually drive C), MemMaker creates a directory on
the C drive that has the same name as the directory that MemMaker was run from
and copies the following files to that directory:

  MEMMAKER.EXE
  MEMMAKER.HLP
  MEMMAKER.INF
  EMM386.EXE
  HIMEM.SYS
  CHKSTATE.SYS
  SIZER.EXE

During the optimization process, it also creates MEMMAKER.STS.

NOTE: The original startup drive may not be drive C if you have a program such as
Stacker from STAC Electronics.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If MemMaker is run from the D:\MSDOS.622 directory, it creates a C:\MSDOS.622
directory, copies the files listed above to that directory, and changes the
DEVICE= statements in the CONFIG.SYS file to point to drive C to ensure that the
files are found when MemMaker restarts the system. MemMaker copies these files
to the startup drive because MemMaker moves the device= statements for HIMEM.SYS
and EMM386.EXE to the top of the CONFIG.SYS file. Because these files are then
loaded before any devices that might perform drive swapping, MemMaker must be
sure it can find the files it needs to optimize your system's memory.

MemMaker does not remove these files after it has completed its optimization. To
remove these changes, edit the CONFIG.SYS file and make sure the device= lines
for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE point to the drive that contains your full MS-DOS
directory. You can then safely delete the directory on drive C created by
MemMaker.

Using SUBST
-----------

If you have a C:\DOS directory but use the SUBST command to remap the directory
to another drive letter such as R: and place the MS-DOS directory into the PATH
as R:\, MemMaker does not create a C:\DOS directory. Instead, MemMaker creates a
C:\MEMMAKER directory and copies the above files into the new directory.
MemMaker displays a message that it is copying files to the startup drive.
MemMaker also leaves the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE lines in the CONFIG.SYS file
pointing to the C:\MEMMAKER directory. The old CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
are in the C:\MEMMAKER directory.

NOTE: Using the SUBST command to map directories to unused single drive letters
saves space in the PATH statement, which is limited to 128 characters. This
works on drives that are uncompressed, as well as on drives compressed with
DoubleSpace.
