-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
- Microsoft WinLogin, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To install Microsoft WinLogin with Windows for Workgroups, you must follow the
procedures in this article for all computers that will be running the WinLogin
application.

NOTE: These procedures only work with a Windows for Workgroups network or
Microsoft LAN Manager network, as they can connect through the MS-DOS level
before starting Windows for Workgroups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Make the following changes for each computer that will be running Windows for
Workgroups and WinLogin:

1. From your Windows for Workgroups Disk 3 (either 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch disks),
  expand a copy of the MSNET.DR_ file and place this file in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
  directory.

  Type the following command at the MS-DOS command prompt to expand the file:

  expand x:\MSNET.DR_ c:\windows\system\msnet.drv

  where x is the floppy drive that contains the MSNET.DR_ file.

2. In the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, change the following line:

       NETWORK.DRV=WFWNET.DRV

  to:

       NETWORK.DRV=MSNET.DRV

3. In the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, comment out the following
  line:

        NETWORK=VNETBIOS.386,VNETSUP.386,VREDIR.386,VSERVER.386,
        VBROWSE.386,VWC.386

  by placing a semicolon (;) as the first character, as follows:

        ;NETWORK=VNETBIOS.386,VNETSUP.386,VREDIR.386,VSERVER.386,
        VBROWSE.386,VWC.386

4. Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

  NETWORK=*VNETBIOS,*DOSNET

5. (Optional) To keep the WinLogin application transparent to users, you may
  want to add the following as the last line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  net start enhanced

  This starts the MS-DOS redirector without any intervention from the user, and
  after the computer is started, the user needs to type a user name and
  password only. The user can then start Windows for Workgroups (along with the
  WinLogin application).

6. To install the WinLogin Client Software, you must first log in at the MS-DOS
  level and connect to the server\share locations where WinLogin is installed
  before you start Windows for Workgroups.

7. Start Windows for Workgroups. You will receive an error message stating that
  you do not have network connections because you are using the MSNET.DRV
  driver.

8. Start File Manager. You will not have Network options; however, you will see
  the network drives that you connected to before starting.

9. Install the Client software from either a disk drive or network drive.

Once the software is installed, you must do one of the following to have all
Windows for Workgroups functionality returned:

- Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the users directory and remove the remarks from
  steps 2, 3, and 4 above.

  -or-

- Using the INI Editor, add to the WinLogin database the lines in SYSTEM.INI
  that reflect Windows for Workgroups entries (steps 2, 3, and 4 above).

Once the changes have been made, you have full functionality of both WinLogin and
Windows for Workgroups. You can share resources as well as connect to shared
resources.

It is not necessary to create a persistent connection to the server containing
the WinLogin database because the WinLogin application can connect and
disconnect as necessary.
