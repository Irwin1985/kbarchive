SUMMARY
=======

LOGSHOW is a utility that displays information about disk adapters, disk drives,
CD-ROM drives, and tape drives installed on the system. LOGSHOW resides in the
C:\OS2\SUPPORT directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The general format of an error log entry displayed by LOGSHOW is as follows:

  devnam cccc mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss - meaning of code
         additional information

The following are the standard error log entry displays:

devnam 000a mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss-Informational:Real ESDI inquiry data follows:
           00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 GENERIC ESDI DISK TYPEnn

        Where       Is
        ------      --

        devnam      Normally DEVINQ, which is the temporary device name
                    used while the device is being configured

        mm          The disk type code specified during setup of the PC

        Where       Is
        -----       --

        devnam      The name of the physical disk drive that has just
                    been configured

        ggggg       Sector size in bytes

        hhhhhhhhh   The number of sectors on the physical volume

        iiiiii      The number of cylinders in the physical volume

        jjjj        The number of data heads accessing the physical
                    volume

        kkkk        The number of sectors per track

        llll        Flags, in hex, that show how the geometry data was
                    generated:

           0x8000      Apparent geometry was already set by the time that
                       the TSD first gained control.

           0x4000      Actual geometry was already set by the time that
                       the TSD first gained control

           0x2000      Actual geometry was set from the apparent geometry
                       by the TSD because the actual geometry was null

           0x1000      Apparent geometry was set from the ROM data (INT 13
                       function 8) by the TSD

           0x0800      Apparent geometry was set from the BPB in the
                       primary partition boot record by the TSD

           0x0400      Media BPB was initialized by the TSD

           0x0200      Recommended BPB was initialized by the TSD

           0x0100      Recommended BPB was set from the BPB in the primary
                       partition boot record by the TSD

           0x0080      Geometry set from ROM by BID

           0x0040      Geometry set from internal disk characteristics
                       table by BID

           0x0020      Geometry set using values determined through auto-
                       configuration by BID

           0x0010      Geometry set using values from INT 41 or INT 46 by
                       BID

           0x0008      Apparent and actual geometry set by BID

        mmmmm       The cylinder number from which write precompensation
                    is to be used

        nnn         The cluster size

        ppppp       The number of reserved sectors

        qqq         The number of FATs

        rrrrr       The number of directory entries

        sssss       The number of sectors in the partition, if less than
                    65,536 sectors

        tt          The media descriptor, in hex

        uuuuu       The number of sectors used by each FAT

        vvvvv       The number of sectors per track

        wwwww       The number of heads

        xxxxxxxxx   The number of hidden sectors

        yyyyyyyyy   The number of sectors in the partition, if more than
                    65,535 sectors
