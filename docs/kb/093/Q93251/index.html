SUMMARY
=======

WinLUA Overview
---------------

WinLUA defines a standard and consistent API for the 16 and 32-bit versions of
the Microsoft Windows graphical environment. It encompasses a set of
Windows-specific asyncronous notification methods designed to allow the
programmer to take advantage of the message-driven nature of the Windows
graphical environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  WinLua.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/file98/3.1/W31/EN-US/WinLua.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

This API has been designed and specified to provide a standard to which
application developers can program and network software vendors can conform.
These API details constitute documentation for application software developers
and a specification for network software vendors.

Network software that conforms to either the WinLUA RUI or WinLUA SLI
specification will be considered "WinLUA compliant." To be WinLUA compliant, a
vendor must implement 100 percent of the WinLUA RUI or WinLUA SLI specification.
Suppliers of such interfaces shall be referred to as "WinLUA suppliers."

Applications that are capable of exploiting any WinLUA implementation will be
considered as having a "WinLUA interface" and will be referred to as "WinLUA
applications."

While WinLUA is one of the WinSNA APIs to be standardized for the Windows
environment; it is beyond the scope of this document to deal with other SNA
(Systems Network Architecture) APIs.

Microsoft Windows Graphical Environment and Windows-Specific Extensions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This API has been designed for ALL implementations and versions of the Windows
environment from and including version 3.0. It thus provides for WinLUA
implementations and WinLUA applications in both 16 and 32-bit operating
environments.

WinLUA makes provisions for multithreaded Windows-based processes. A process
contains one or more threads of execution. In the Win16 non- multithreaded
world, a task corresponds to a process with a single thread. All references to
threads in this document refer to actual "threads" in multithreaded Windows
environments. In non-multithreaded environments (such as version 3.0), use of
the term thread refers to a Windows process.

The extensions to the Windows environment included in WinLUA are provided for
maximum programming compatibility and optimum application performance.
