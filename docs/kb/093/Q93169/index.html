- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Setup detects certain networks and allows
for specific IRQ and I/O address settings for individual network interface cards
(NICs). Setup does not accept any settings other than those it provides. This
behavior can be a problem if you are using a network card that allows an IRQ or
I/O address setting other than those provided by Windows for Workgroups. This
article includes procedures that may help you work around such problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the IRQ or I/O address for a single installation:

1. During Windows for Workgroups Setup, install the appropriate network card and
  select any of the available settings.

2. Open the PROTOCOL.INI file in an ASCII text editor, such as Microsoft Windows
  Notepad.

3. Locate the network card section for your card. Section headings appear as
  follows:

  [netcardname]

  where "netcardname" is a unique identifier for your network card. (For
  example, the heading for an Intel EtherExpress 16 is [ms$ee16], and the
  heading for an NE 1000 compatible card is [ms$ne1clone].) If you are not sure
  what the identifier for your card is, check the [netcard] section of the
  NETWORK.INF file. This section contains a list of supported network cards and
  their corresponding identifiers.

4. Once you locate the [netcard] section, find two lines similar to the
  following:

  IRQ=
  IOADDRESS=

  Note: The exact wording of these lines varies from card to card.

5. Change these lines to reflect the settings that your network card is actually
  using. The IRQ value must be a valid number between 0 and 15. The IOADDRESS
  value must be a valid hexadecimal I/O address or must take the form 0xNNN,
  where "NNN" is the address, (for example, IOADDRESS=0x300).

6. Save these changes, then reboot your computer.

  Note: If you regenerate the PROTOCOL.INI file by reinstalling Windows or by
  removing and then reinstalling the network card in the Network dialog box of
  Control Panel, these changes are lost.

To change the IRQ or I/O address for multiple installations:

Note: The changes below affect all subsequent installations of Windows for
Workgroups that have the specified network card. Be sure to make a backup of the
NETWORK.INF file before you make any changes to it.

1. Open the NETWORK.INF file in a ASCII text editor, such as Microsoft Windows
  Notepad.

2. Locate the [netcard_protocol] section for your network card. These sections
  generally have the following form:

  [netcardname_nif] or [netcardname_xif]

  where "netcardname" is a unique identifier for your network card.

3. Once you locate the [netcard_protocol] section for your card, find the
  following two lines:

        io=&lt;description,type,range,default,flags&gt;
        irq=&lt;description,type,range,default,flags&gt;

  where "type" is the parameter type, "range" is the range of values for the
  parameter, and "default" is the default value or the parameter.

  Note: Some fields may be missing in the actual statements. The following is an
  example:

  irq=IRQ,,text,"3,4,5,9",3
  io=IOADDRESS,,hex,"0x280,0x3f0,0x10","0x300"

  The following table describes the common type, range, and default values:

     Type    Range                Default   Definition
     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     Static  Default              N/A       The value cannot be changed
     Text    "Value, value,..."   Yes       List of text values
     Int     "First, last, step"  Yes       Integer range
     Hex     "First, last, step"  Yes       Integer range in hexadecimal

4. The values for the I/O address or the IRQ can then be modified by changing
  the values inside a text list or the first, last, or step values of an
  integer or hexadecimal range. For example

  irq=IRQ,,text,"3,4,5,9",3 can be changed to include irq 7.
  irq=IRQ,,text,"3,4,5,7,9",3

  io=IOADDRESS,,hex,"0x280,0x3f0,0x10","0x300" can be changed to include I/O
  address 200h by lowering the first value as follows:

  io=IOADDRESS,,hex,"0x200,0x3f0,0x10","0x300"

  Note: The default value following the range MUST be a value in the range.

5. Save the changes to the NETWORK.INF file. The Setup program then displays the
  setting that you added as a selection in the appropriate box.

For more information, refer to Chapters 5 and 6 of the "Windows for Workgroups
Resource Kit" manual.
