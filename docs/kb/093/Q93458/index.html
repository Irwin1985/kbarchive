1.0  Running Windows for Workgroups with an Operating System Other
    Than MS-DOS
------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and MS-DOS work together as an
integrated system. They were designed together and extensively tested
together on a wide variety of computers and hardware configurations.
Running Windows for Workgroups on an operating system other than
MS-DOS could cause unexpected results or poor performance.

2.0  Preventing Stack Overflow
------------------------------

Stacks are temporary data structures that MS-DOS and applications use
for processing hardware events. If, while setting up Windows for
Workgroups, the Setup program detects hardware or software that
require a certain stack size, Setup places the following command line
in your CONFIG.SYS file:

  stacks=9,256

This should be sufficient most of the time. However, if you receive
the "Internal Stack Overflow" message when Windows for Workgroups is
running in 386 enhanced mode, or if your system fails for no apparent
reason when Windows for Workgroups is running in standard mode
(especially if you are setting up or moving the mouse), first try
increasing the second number on the stacks= command line (for example,
256). If that doesn't work, try increasing the first number (for
example, 9). For more information about the stacks setting and
modifying the CONFIG.SYS file, see your MS-DOS documentation.

3.0  Using 32-Bit Disk Access
-----------------------------

By default, 32-bit disk access is turned off to prevent disk errors on
some battery-powered portable computers. However, 32-bit disk access
may run correctly with some battery-powered portable computers, such
as the Zenith MasterSport SL. If you want to try using 32-bit disk
access, select the Use 32-bit Disk Access check box in the expanded
Virtual Memory dialog box (choose the 386 Enhanced option in Control
Panel). For more information, see Chapter 11, "Managing Memory and
Performance," in the "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups User's Guide."

Caution: Before you use 32-bit disk access on a battery-powered
portable computer, it is highly recommended that you back up your hard
disk. Because 32-bit disk access has not been fully tested on all
battery-powered systems, you may receive disk errors while using it.

4.0  Using Memory Managers and Vshare
-------------------------------------

This section describes problems you may encounter while using memory
managers and the VSHARE.386 file-sharing/file-locking program with
Windows for Workgroups.

4.1  Solving Memory Conflicts by Using MONOUMB.386 or MONOUMB2.386
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter the following message when starting Windows for
Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode, your display driver may be accessing
the monochrome address range (B000-B7FF), which prevents the memory
manager from using this range for upper memory blocks:

"Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment B000. Exclude
this address space by using the syntax of your memory manager. For
more information, see the README.WRI file. Type WIN /S to start
Windows for Workgroups in standard mode and choose the Read Me icon."

To solve this problem, try installing MONOUMB2.386 on your system.
MONOUMB2.386 is a device driver provided with Windows for Workgroups
that allows certain memory managers to use the monochrome address
range for upper memory blocks even if your display driver is accessing
this range.

To install MONOUMB2.386:

1. Copy and expand the MONOUMB2.38_ file that is on your Windows for
  Workgroups disk to your Windows SYSTEM directory by typing the
  following at the MS-DOS prompt:

     expand  a:\monoumb2.38_  c:\windows\system\monoumb2.386

2. Add the following setting to the [386Enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI
  file:

     device=monoumb2.386

3.  Start Windows for Workgroups.

Note: MONOUMB2.386 may not work with some memory managers, such as
EMM386.EXE. In this case, you can try using MONOUMB.386. 

You can also exclude the address region B000-B7FF. This specifies that
the memory manager should not try to use this address range for upper
memory blocks. For information about excluding specific address
ranges, see the following topic.

4.2  Solving Memory Conflicts by Excluding an Address Range
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter the following message when starting Windows for
Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode, and the address specified is not
B000, you must exclude the address range:

  Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment xxxx. Exclude
  this address space by using the syntax of your memory manager. For
  more information, see the README.WRI file. Type WIN /S to start
  Windows for Workgroups in standard mode and choose the Read Me icon.

If the address specified is B000, you can try using MONOUMB2.386 or
MONOUMB.386, as described in the preceding topic.

The method you use to exclude an address range depends on the memory
manager you are using. For example, if you are using EMM386.EXE, you
need to remove the I=xxxxx option from the device=emm386.exe command
line in your CONFIG.SYS file, where xxxxx is the address range
starting at the address specified in the error message.

If you are using QEMM, you need to include the X= option on the
device=qemm386.sys command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example,
to exclude the address range C000-C7FF, you would specify the
following:

  device=qemm386.sys  X=C000-C7FF

For more information about modifying your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation. For more information about installing and
configuring EMM386.EXE, see Chapter 11, "Managing Memory and
Performance," in the "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups User's Guide."
For information about installing and configuring other memory
managers, see the documentation provided with your memory manager.

4.3  Using 386MAX
-----------------

If you are running 386MAX with Windows for Workgroups, note the
following:

- Do not use options that limit the EMS swap region in the upper memory
  area. If you include exclude= options on the 386max or bluemax command
  line or in the .PRO file (usually called 386MAX.PRO), make sure that
  the address range specified does not extend beyond A000.

  For example, exclude=1800-A000 is acceptable, but exclude=1800-B800 is
  not. If the address range specified by using the exclude= option
  extends beyond A000, Windows for Workgroups may not run properly in
  386 enhanced mode. If you must exclude an address range above A000,
  use the RAM= option instead. For more information about this and other
  options, see your 386MAX documentation.

- Do not use the 386MAX parameter EXT=0. This parameter may cause
  Windows to fail during Setup. After setting up, if Windows is running
  in standard mode, this parameter causes your system to lock up when
  you quit Windows.

- Do not load SMARTDrive when QCache is running.

  Note: The 386MAX setup program does not detect SMARTDrive version 4.0
  and may recommend that you install QCache.

- If you update an earlier version of 386MAX to version 6.0, the 386MAX
  version 6.0 setup program may not remove the LOAD=WINDOWS.LOD line
  from your .PRO file. You can remove this line manually. It is not
  needed and removing it will free up a small amount of memory.

- If for some reason you remove the net start command line from your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT, Windows may lock up during startup.

4.4  Turning on Sharing Popup with Vshare
-----------------------------------------

VSHARE.386 is a file-sharing and file-locking program that is used
when running Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode. With VSHARE,
when a file-sharing violation occurs, you see an "Access denied"
message, instead of the "Sharing violation on drive..." message used
in versions of Windows that do not include networking.

Some MS-DOS-based applications may need the sharing-violation message.
If you need to turn on this message, add the following line to the
[386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

  EnableSharingPopups=TRUE

For more information about modifying the SYSTEM.INI file, see the
SYSINI.WRI online document.

5.0  Using Advanced Power Management (APM)
------------------------------------------

Windows for Workgroups includes support for Advanced Power Management
(APM). This enables Windows to extend battery life, display power-
status information, and work together with the suspend features of
battery-powered personal computers. To find out if your computer
supports APM, contact your computer manufacturer.

To install APM on your system:

1. Quit Windows for Workgroups.

2. Run Windows for Workgroups Setup and select one of the following
  system types:

     MS-DOS System with APM
     Intel 386SL Based System with APM

  Select "Intel 386SL Based System with APM" if your computer has an
  Intel 386SL processor and supports the SL Enhanced Options for APM.
  Otherwise, select "MS-DOS System with APM."

3. Restart Windows for Workgroups.

  A Power icon appears in the Control Panel window.

4. Choose the Power icon to configure power-management settings.

For more information about the settings, choose the Help button or
press F1 while using the Power Management dialog box.

6.0  Using SMARTDrive Version 4.0
---------------------------------

This section describes some solutions to problems that you might
encounter when using SMARTDrive version 4.0 (provided with Windows for
Workgroups) together with specific applications or hardware.

6.1  Accessing Floppy Disk Drives on Older COMPAQ DESKPROS
----------------------------------------------------------

On some COMPAQ DESKPRO 386/16 and 386/20 computers, you might
experience problems accessing floppy disk drives when SMARTDrive
version 4.0 is installed. To work around the problem, you can try one
of the following solutions:

- Place the SMARTDrive buffer into low memory by adding the following
  option to the smartdrv command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     smartdrv  /L

- Disable the caching on floppy disk drives by adding the following
  options to the smartdrv command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     smartdrv  a-  b-

For more information about these options, see Chapter 11, "Managing
Memory and Performance," in the "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
User's Guide."

6.2  Using SMARTDrive with Double Buffering
-------------------------------------------

Most expanded-memory emulators attempt to optimize SMARTDrive by
configuring it to load into upper memory blocks (UMBs). This will
cause problems if you are running Windows for Workgroups in 386
enhanced mode with double buffering. If you need to use double
buffering with SMARTDrive, make sure that SMARTDrive is configured in
the CONFIG.SYS file to load into low memory. The command line should
look like this:

  device=smartdrv.exe  /double_buffer

This problem applies only to the smartdrv command line in the
CONFIG.SYS file. It does not apply to the references to SMARTDrive in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For more information about using double
buffering with SMARTDrive, see Chapter 11, "Managing Memory and
Performance," in the "Microsoft Windows for Workgroups User's Guide."

6.3  Using SMARTDrive with Norton Utilities Version 6.0 Disk Monitor
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not use the Disk Protect feature in Norton Utilities Version 6.0
Disk Monitor with SMARTDrive version 4.0. If you try to write to the
protected drive, you will encounter an error and your system will
fail. If you want to write to and cache a protected drive, add the
drive letter to the smartdrv command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
For example, if drive D is a protected drive, you would add the
following:

  smartdrv  d

Or you can use the Norton cache program instead when using Disk
Monitor.

6.4  Using SMARTDrive with SuperStor Disk-Compression Utility
-------------------------------------------------------------

Do not use the Create Mountable Drive, Mount, and Dismount features of
SuperStor after SMARTDrive is loaded. You must configure your
SuperStor partitions before loading SMARTDrive. Windows for Workgroups
Setup places the smartdrv command line first in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file includes "mount" configuration
commands, make sure that the smartdrv command line follows the
SuperStor configuration command lines.

Also, you will receive read-write errors if you use SMARTDrive to
cache a SuperStor compressed drive. To prevent SMARTDrive from caching
the compressed drive, you must include the drive letter- option on the
smartdrv command line.

For example, if drive C is the uncompressed drive, and drives E and F
are the compressed SuperStor drives, you would include the following
command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  smartdrv  e-  f-

6.5  Using SMARTDrive with Copy-Protected Games and Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------

When using SMARTDrive, you may encounter problems starting a copy-
protected application that requires you to place the master disk in
the floppy disk drive. To solve this problem, you need to disable
caching on the floppy disk drive by using the drive letter- option
when you load SMARTDrive. For example, if you load SMARTDrive from
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and are using drive A, you need to include the
following command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  smartdrv  a-
