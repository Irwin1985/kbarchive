SUMMARY
=======

ChildMnu.exe demonstrates one way to embed a pop-up window with menus in a child
window to simulate a child window with menus.Child windows by design do not have
menus; however, some applications may require such child windows.

Child windows were not designed to have menus but under certain circumstances an
application may require a child window with menus. Below are the steps to
simulate a child window with menus:

1. Create the child for a main window using standard methods.

2. Create a pop-up window without a caption or border. The pop-up window should
  take up the entire client area of the child window.

3. Moving: Set the child window as the parent of the pop-up window using
  SetParent(). This method clips the pop-up window to the child's client and
  moves the pop-up window relative to the child window when the child moves.

4. Sizing: If the child window has sizing borders, then the pop-up window must
  be adjusted as the child is sized.

  Correct sizing of the pop-up window can be accomplished by processing the
  child window's WM_SIZE message. When the child window receives a WM_SIZE
  message, the child's new client area is calculated and the pop-up window is
  adjusted.

5. Activation: Child windows are not activated by design. When the user clicks
  the pop-up window, activation is taken away from the main window and is given
  to the pop-up window. To simulate the main window's activation, the pop-up's
  window procedure, upon receiving a WM_ACTIVATE message, posts a WM_NCACTIVATE
  message to the main window.

  Note: This step causes flashing because the caption is repainted when going
  back and forth between the pop-up window and the main window. Unfortunately,
  there is no sure way to accomplish the change of caption's activation.

Other Considerations
--------------------

Maximizing: When a child window is maximized, it uses the screen's maximum size.
To have the child window act similar to an MDI child, two messages need to be
processed; WM_SIZE in the main parent's window procedure and WM_GETMINMAXINFO in
the child's window procedure.

WM_SIZE of the child's parent window procedure checks for SIZE_MAXIMIZE and
SIZE_RESTORE. Then, if the child window is maximized, call ShowWindow() with
SW_MAXIMIZED. This method adjusts the child window's size to the new size of the
parent's client area.

On WM_GETMINMAXINFO of the child's window procedure, calculate the size of the
parent's client area. Use the newly calculated size and set the ptMaxSize
variable of the MINMAXINFO structure. This ensures that the child is always
fully contained within its parent client area when maximized.
