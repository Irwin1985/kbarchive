-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange information store database may experience one of the
following symptoms during normal operation:

During an offline defragmentation (ESEUTIL /D) of the database, the process stops
with JET error

  -1601(JET_errRecordNotFound)

or

  -1603(JET_errNoCurrentRecord)

.

In 5.5 SP1 during an offline defragmentation (ESEUTIL /D), the process may stop
with JET error

  -1526 (JET_errLVCorrupted)

.

During normal operation, you may get a

  -1069 error (JET_errVersionStoreOutOfMemory)

in the application log.

  Event ID: 1101
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Error
  Category: Background Cleanup
  Description:
  Error 0xfffffbd3 occurred on message &lt;Message ID&gt; during a background
  cleanup.

If you run the consistency checker (ESEUTIL /G &lt;db&gt; /V /X piped to a text
file), it reports ERROR: corrupted LV(number) (lid changed without root), and/or
ERROR: orphaned LV(lid, size, refcount). An orphaned LV is a non-corrupting
error.

In 5.5 SP1, ESEUTIL /G /V /X may stop with the following JET Error -1206
(JET_errDatabaseCorrupted).


With Diagnostic Logging turned up to general on the Information Store you may
receive the following Application Event Log: During normal operation, you may
get a -1069 error (JET_errVersionStoreOutOfMemory) in the application log.

  Event ID: 195
  Source: ESE97
  Type: Information
  Category: General
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((322) ) Internal trace: lv.cxx@395

The information store service (Store.exe) may access violate during normal
operation when it encounters corrupt data.


The information store process is using 100 percent of the CPU time all consumed
by one thread (there are occasions when up to three threads are affected). You
can view this by following these steps:

1. Start the Windows NT Performance Monitor.

2. On the Edit menu, click Add To Chart.

3. In the Object list, click Thread.

4. In the Instance list, select all values that contain "store".

5. Click Add.


CAUSE
=====

When the Exchange database engine inserts a record into the binary tree
(b-tree), it may find a record with the same primary key that is marked for
deletion. Because the node is just marked for deletion and has not been
physically deleted yet, the Exchange database engine "undeletes" the node and
changes its data to that of the new record. Because the Exchange database engine
is changing the data associated with the record, the Exchange database engine
may be changing the record's size. If the record becomes too big for the page,
the Exchange database engine has to perform a b-tree split. During the split,
the Exchange database engine must release the latch on the pages in the tree and
then re-latch them when the split is completed. In rare circumstances where the
information store cleanup thread comes along in the small delta where the pages
were unlatched, the information store cleanup thread may remove the page marked
for deletion. When the Exchange database engine tries to re-latch the pages, it
does not know the record has been removed. As a result, the information store
either stops responding (uses 100 percent processor time in one or more threads)
or corrupts the data.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the fix described below. The Exchange database engine has been fixed to
detect whether the page has been removed and to take appropriate action if it
has.

If you have already experienced the corruption symptoms of this problem, you can
perform the following steps to repair the corruption with NO loss of data and no
need to run ISINTEG -fix (as long as there is no other corruption in the
database).

NOTE: Only run ESEUTIL /P after you have performed the steps to find LV problems
in your database, which are outlined in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

Run the consistency checker (ESEUTIL /G &lt;db&gt; /V /X piped to a text file);
it reports:

  corrupted LV(number) (lid changed without root),

and/or

  orphaned LV(lid, size, refcount).

An orphaned LV is a non-corrupting error.

Corrupted and Orphaned LVs Reported:

If both corrupted and orpaned LVs are reported, then you must follow these
steps:

1. Make sure the new Ese.dll file described below is in place (\winnt\system32).

2. Stop the information store service.

3. Run ESEUTIL /P &lt;dbswitch&gt; /X to repair the corruption.

4. Perform an offline defragmentation of the database (ESEUTIL /D &lt;db&gt;).

5. Restart the information store service.

6. Perform a full online backup of the information store service to be sure you
  have the repaired version of the database backed up.

Orphaned LVs Reported:

If only orphaned LVs are reported by ESEUTIL /G &lt;db&gt; /V /X, and no
corrupted LVs are reported, you can remove the errors by performing an offline
defragmentation of the database (ESEUTIL /D &lt;db&gt;).

Corrupted LVs Reported:

If corrupted LVs are reported you must:

1. Make sure the new Ese.dll file described below is in place (\winnt\system32).

2. Stop the information store service.

3. Run ESEUTIL /P &lt;dbswitch&gt; /X to repair the corruption.

4. Restart the information store service.

5. Perform a FULL online backup of the information store service to be sure you
  have the repaired version of the database backed up.

NOTE: be sure to have current backups of your databases prior to running any
utilities or upgrades on them.

If you have not experienced any of these symptoms but want to be proactive and
prevent this corruption from occurring, make sure the Ese.dll file is in place
(\winnt\system32) and restart the information store service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K



This fix is currently available at the following location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg5.5/PostRTM/ESE-FIX/

MORE INFORMATION
================

High CPU use or a stoppage of the information store occurs if there are exactly
two nodes on the page being split. This is because the Exchange database engine
tries to split one record on a page, which is not possible.

Data corruption occurs if there are more than two nodes on the page being split.
This is because Exchange database engine replaces the node immediately after the
one it intended to insert to.
