-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After an inventory scan is performed, Microsoft Office 97 for Windows does not
appear as an installed package for clients, even though Office is installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Package Definition File (PDF) provided with both Standard and Professional
editions of Office 97 for Windows and Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) defines
Package Inventory properties for Office. When a Systems Management Server client
runs the Systems Management Server Inventory Agent, it scans the local drives
for files that match the criteria defined in the Package Inventory properties.
The PDFs supplied with Office 97 and 97 SR-1 check for the Mso97.dll and
Off97spec.ini files.

The Systems Management Server Client Inventory Agent uses the following
definition to check for these files:

- MSO97.DLL

  -and-

- OFF97SPEC.INI CRC=0 226 1548

NOTE: The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for OFF97SPEC may be different based on
the version of Office 97 (Standard or Professional).

The detection rule specifies 'AND' rather than 'OR', therefore, the package is
not detected. This is because these two files are not located in the same
directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods (as appropriate to your situation) to work
around the problem.

Change the Package Inventory Properties
---------------------------------------

If you already have an existing Package for Office 97 that was created in Systems
Management Server, change the Package Inventory properties using these steps:

1. Start the Systems Management Server Administrator program.

2. Open the Packages window.

3. Open the Package for Office 97 (Standard or Professional).

4. Click the Inventory button.

5. Select the line in the Inventory properties that contains 'AND' and then
  click the Toggle button. This changes 'AND' to 'OR'.

6. Allow time for the Package properties to be replicated to logon servers and
  subsites before you attempt a new software inventory.

Change the PDF
--------------

If you have not yet created a package for Office 97, change the detection rule in
the PDF from 'AND' to 'OR'. Perform the following steps:

1. Locate the file in your Office 97 source.

2. Open the file in a text editor such as Notepad.

3. Search for the string "Detection Rule Part 2=AND" (without the quotation
  marks).

4. Change 'AND' to 'OR'.

5. Save the file.

6. Import the file into a new package.

Use a Newer PDF
---------------

Use the newer version of the PDF for Office 97 which is included in Systems
Management Server Service Pack 2 or later. The newer PDF corrects this problem
by removing the Mso97.dll file from the inventory criteria.
