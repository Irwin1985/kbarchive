-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages are not delivered or received across the Microsoft Server Connector for
Lotus CC-Mail (CCMC). There may not be any errors in the application event log.

If a message is sent to the Lotus cc:Mail environment, with Maximum logging level
set for the categories Outbound and General, the only Event ID logged is:

  Event ID: 11001
  The following message was sent from Microsoft Exchange to Lotus cc:Mail,
  From: USER at EXCHANGESITE
  Date: 2/10/98 11:28
  To: CCMailPO1 User1 at CCMAILPO1

Normally, Event ID 11001 is followed by Event ID 67 and/or 58 (examples below):

  Event ID: 58
  Lotus cc:Mail IMPORT from file *.ccm completed successfully.

  Event ID: 67
  Lotus cc:Mail EXPORT to file msg65F9.ccm completed successfully.

If a directory synchronization (dirsync) interval occurs, the only application
Event ID is:

  Event ID: 14001
  Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail directory synchronization
  has started.
  Now exporting Lotus cc:Mail directory entries, mailing lists, and
  bulletin board titles.

Normally, at the normal conclusion of the dirsync process, an Event ID 14031 is
logged:

  Event ID: 14031
  Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail directory synchronization
  has finished.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server was installed in a directory that exceeds eight
characters in length (for example, C:\ExchSrvr55). When the Microsoft CCMC is
configured to use the MS-DOS based Import.exe and Export.exe utilities (provided
by Lotus cc:Mail), these utilities fail to operate if they are provided a path
that exceeds the MS-DOS 8.3 naming convention.

Exchange Server provides the path to the Export.ini file (for example,
C:\ExchSrvr55\CCMCData\Export.ini) and the MS-DOS utilities fail to locate the
INI file necessary for normal operation.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install Exchange Server to a directory that does not exceed eight characters in
length.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the CCMC only passes short-path names to the Lotus cc:Mail
export/import utilities.

Lotus cc:Mail is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
