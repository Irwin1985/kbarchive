Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The errors described in the "Summary" section of this article are the result of
the Visual Basic 5.0 installation program failing to install the control
properly. This problem arises during the installation of Visual Basic 5.0 when
the installation program detects that a component is already on the system. In
this case, the installation program will not install the component properly for
use in the Visual Basic 5.0 design environment.

Components can already be on the system due to the installation of other
applications, including Visual Basic applications, which have already installed
these same components.

What Vbcmpfix Does
------------------

Vbcmpfix is designed to make sure that the controls and components included with
Visual Basic 5.0 are installed properly. Vbcmpfix will detect and fix the
install problems for the following editions of Visual Basic 5.0:

- Visual Basic 5.0 Enterprise Edition

- Visual Basic 5.0 Professional Edition

- Visual Basic 5.0 Learning Edition

- Visual Basic 5.0 Control Creation Edition

Vbcmpfix does not require any Service Packs installed to use, however upgrading
to the latest Service Pack is always recommended. The latest service pack is
available at:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/

List Of Components Vbcmpfix Will Fix
------------------------------------

Depending upon which edition of Visual Basic 5.0 you have installed, Vbcmpfix
will fix your installation so that controls and components that come with VB5
work in the VB5 design environment. Vbcmpfix.exe works ONLY with the components

having problems with, or fix problems with any controls in the \Tools\Controls

How To Use
----------

Vbcmpfix is very simple to use. Run the self extracting Vbc.exe program, which
will extract two files:

  Vbcmpfix.exe
  ReadMe.txt

Double-click Vbcmpfix.exe from the Windows Explorer, or run it from the command
line.

When Vbcmpfix launches, it will automatically detect which version of Visual
Basic you have installed on your system. If you do not have Visual Basic
installed, it will not allow you continue.

After it detects your version of Visual Basic, you can "Fix Install" or "Quit."
Choosing "Fix Install" will update your system so that the controls and
components that come with your edition of Visual Basic will work. The controls
and components that are fixed is dependent upon the edition of Visual basic 5.0
you have installed.

After you have done this, close the utility and reboot your system. After
rebooting, launch Visual Basic 5 and try using any controls with which you were
having problems.

Known Issues
------------

Users of Internet Explorer 4.x might notice that their desktop can produce odd
behavior after running Vbcmpfix.exe. Bitmaps might become black and/or colors
will be strange. Rebooting will solve this problem.

If you still cannot use controls after running Vbcmpfix.exe, please contact
Microsoft Visual Basic Technical Support. Re-run Vbcmpfix.exe and write down the
build number of the utility (given in the about box), and have that handy in
case they ask for it. Vbcmpfix will not work on systems that have certain
security settings, and Microsoft Visual Basic Technical Support will assist you
in resolving this problem.

If you install Visual Basic on a network, sometimes security settings will carry
over, and your system will not let Vbcmpfix.exe to run correctly.
