SUMMARY
=======

Novell's NetWare Directory Services (NDS) support has been added to SNA Server
3.0 Service Pack 1. This feature allows SNA Server to create and publish useful
information about its existence into the NDS Tree. The information that is
registered can be queried by NDS-enabled SNA Server clients to resolve sponsor
connections. The requirement to run in native bindery mode (or emulated bindery
mode in NetWare 4.x) has been removed. However, all servers and clients in a
domain must support NDS to take advantage of this enhancement. If they cannot
support it, they must be configured to run in bindery mode.

This article explains the behavior of Microsoft SNA Server and Microsoft SNA
clients when configured to support NDS. This article does not attempt to explore
all the details of NDS but can be used to provide a foundation to successfully
troubleshoot connectivity-related issues when configured in NDS mode.

Overview
--------

Prior versions of SNA Server were limited to NetWare bindery-based participation
only. At startup time, all SNA Server computers broadcast their subdomain name
and computer name using SAP type 0x444. Sometime later, a client requests an
initial SNA session (3270 or APPC). The client first sends out an SAP query
packet in an effort to locate a bindery-based server. The intent is to query the
bindery for a list of registered SNA Server computers that can be used to create
the sponsor connection. After the client receives a response, it attaches to one
server and enumerates all SNA Server computers in the bindery. The client then
selects at random one of the names from this list of SNA Server computers and
attempts to get a LAN connection with one of the SNA Server computers. The SNA
Server computer responds with a list of all SNA Server computers that are
available to get a 3270 or APPC session with. This special connection is called
the "Sponsor Connection". Finally, the SNA Server client attempts to connect to
each SNA Server computer in the list until a server is found that can service
the 3270 or APPC request.

When SNA Server is configured to support NDS, much of same "logic" mentioned
above is used to resolve an SNA Server sponsor connection as well. The SNA
Server creates an SNA Server object into the tree using NDS function calls, and
the client workstation formulates an NDS-based query operation to locate the SNA
Server or subdomain name.

NDS Security and Operational Requirements
-----------------------------------------

The NDS schema is extended to create a new class definition called Microsoft SNA
Server. The new class is derived from an existing base class called Server. This
particular class identifies entities that manage one or more resources and
provide access to those resources through a communication protocol.

When SNA Server is first started, Snabase authenticates using the credentials
provided in the IPX Directory Properties of SNA Server. From this point, it
checks for the existence of the Microsoft SNA Server class. If the class does
not exist (meaning there have been no prior installations of SNA Server into the
NDS tree), the class will be created. A schema modification such as this
requires the trustee (Snabase user account in this case) to have, at a minimum,
Write rights to the Access Control List (ACL) of the directory's [ROOT] object.
After the class definition has been defined and the NDS base schema has been
updated with the new extension, no further attempts are made to create the
Microsoft SNA Server class from *any* subsequent SNA Server installations that
are configured to use this particular Tree. At this point, the Write rights to
the [ROOT] object can be removed if you want.

NOTE: Extensions to the default schema are not typically backed up by third-
party tape backup providers in an NDS environment, although the objects created
with these extensions are. Therefore, after disaster recovery has been
performed, Snabase may not find the Microsoft SNA Server class registered within
NDS and must recreate it. NetWare administrative personnel who have removed the
Write rights to the [ROOT] for Snabase user account must reassign these. Failure
to do so results in an incomplete restoration.


After the class has been defined, Snabase must create the Microsoft SNA Server
object in the context specified in the SNA Server configuration. The object will
have the same name as the Windows NT computer name from which SNA Server is
running. To create this object, Snabase needs Create and Delete Object rights to
the Organizational Unit (OU) from where the SNA Server object will be created.
There are numerous ways to provide these rights in an NDS environment (for
example, inheritance, security equivalency, trustee assignment, and so on). See
your NetWare administrator for details. After the object is created, it becomes
security equivalent to the [PUBLIC] object. The [PUBLIC] object is granted
Browse object rights by default to the [ROOT], which allows clients to browse
the tree without authenticating to NDS. So SNA client workstations do not
necessarily have to be authenticated to NetWare in order to resolve the SNA
sponsor connection, if the default settings for [PUBLIC] have not been changed.


The Windows NT computer name becomes the name of the newly created SNA object,
which can be viewed by using the NWAdmin utility provided by Novell. An
administrator can use this utility to determine whether SNA Server has
successfully registered with NDS as well. When SNA Server is administratively
taken down, Snabase removes the object from the tree using the NDS Remove Entry
function.


IPX/SPX based workstations that are currently using NDS are typically configured
with either Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks or Novell's Client32
implementation, depending on the client's operating system. See Table 1 below
for details concerning the various connectivity combinations that are supported
for SNA Server.

Windows 3.x                               NDS is supported with the
                                         latest Novell Win3.x client.

Table 1.

SNA client workstations that are configured to support NDS through Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks client or Novell's Client/32 client can locate SNA
Server computers either by machine name (remote) or by subdomain name (local).
In either case, the client resolves the location of the context specified within
the SNA configuration program by performing NDS query operations. From this
point, all objects of type Microsoft SNA Server are queried and sent to the
client workstation.

By default, NDS grants the [PUBLIC] object Browse object rights to the [ROOT]
object. If this has not been changed, SNA client workstations do not have to be
logged into NetWare to query for a sponsor connection.

How to Configure SNA Server to Use NDS
--------------------------------------

SNA Server can be configured to support NDS via the SNA Server Manager
application. The following are the prerequisites and steps that can be used to
accomplish this task:

1. Select the Properties for the SNA Server by right-clicking the icon.

2. Enable IPX/SPX as a Network Transport under the Server Configuration tab.
  *NOTE: IPX/SPX must be loaded prior to this step.

3. Under the IPX Directory Services tab, select the NetWare Directory Services
  (NetWare 4.x) radio control and configure the properties as described below:
  a. NDS Logon Name

     The NDS Logon Name is shaded (you cannot modify it from this dialog box).
     The name used is the Windows NT account name under which SnaBase is
     running.

  b. Password

     Type your Windows NT password for the account name in the NDS Logon Name
     box. The password entered here does *not* necessarily have to match the
     password defined in Windows NT.

  c. Verify Password

     Type your password again to verify.

  d. Context Name
      - Leave this box blank to accept the default value defined in Gateway
        Services for Novell service (GWNW).

        -or-

      - Type a Context Name. You must know the correct Context Name.

        NOTE: This is the location where the SNA Server object will be created.
        See your Novell system administrator for a Context Name other than the
        default name.

  e. Tree Name
      - Leave this field blank to accept the default value defined in GWNW.

        -or-

      - Type a Tree Name. You must know the correct Tree Name

        NOTE: This is the Tree your SNA Server object will be registered in. See
        your Novell system administrator for a name other than the default
        name.
