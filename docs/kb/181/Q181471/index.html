IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes various methods for resetting user options and registry
settings in Microsoft Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two basic kinds of options that the user can define in Word. The first
kind affects the way the program operates. The information for this kind of
option is usually stored in the Windows registry. The second kind of option
affects the formatting or appearance of one or more documents. The information
for this option is stored in templates or documents.

When you troubleshoot odd behavior in the program or in a document, first
eliminate the possibility that the problem is caused by a combination of options
and formatting. If the behavior occurs in multiple documents, it may be useful
to reset the user settings to the "factory" defaults either temporally or
permanently. To do this, use one of the methods listed in the following table.

  Method                                                   Result
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Hold SHIFT to prevent automatic macros from starting.    Temporary

  Start Word with the /a switch.                           Temporary

  Rename the Normal template.                              Temporary or
                                                           Permanent

  Edit or delete registry entries.                         Permanent

Holding the Shift Key
---------------------

Word reserves special names for macros that you can create to automatically alter
the way Word behaves. These are called "auto" macros. The auto macros in
Microsoft Word are listed in the following table.

  Macro      Storage location                Automatically Runs
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  AutoExec   In the Normal template          When Word is started
             or in a global add-in

  AutoNew    In a template                   When a new document that is
                                             based on the template is
                                             created

  AutoOpen   In document or template         When a document that is
                                             based on the template or that
                                             contains the macro is opened

  AutoClose  In document or template         When a document that is
                                             based on the template or that
                                             contains the macro is closed

  AutoExit   In the Normal template          When Word is quit
             or a global add-in

Word recognizes a macro with a name that begins with "Auto" as a macro that
automatically runs when the situation to which it applies occurs. You can
prevent an auto macro from running by holding down the SHIFT key while
performing the action that causes the macro to run.

Starting Word Using /A
----------------------

Starting Word by using /a on a command line causes Word to use the default
settings for all options and prevents add-ins from being loaded.

The /a switch allows you to start Word without loading the following components:

- The global template (Normal.dot)

- Any add-in templates in the Startup folder

- Any add-in libraries (.wll files)

- User settings stored in the Data key in the Windows registry.

NOTE: When you start Word with the /a switch, changes you make in Word that
affect any of these components are not written to the hard disk when you quit
Word, and the changes are lost.

For the following example, assume that Word is located in the C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder.

To start Word 97 by using /a, follow these steps:

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please see your product documentation
to complete these steps.

1. Click Run on the Start menu.

2. In the Run dialog box, click Browse.

3. Use the Look In box to locate Winword.exe, and then select it. Then click
  Open. This step fills in the Open box in the Run dialog box.

4. In the Open box, move the insertion point after Winword.exe.

  NOTE: The path to the Winword.exe in the Run dialog box is enclosed in
  quotation marks. Be sure to move the insertion point to the right of the
  closing quotation mark.

5. Type a space, and then type "/a" (without the quotation marks).

  The statement in the Open box should resemble the following:

  "C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT OFFICE\OFFICE\WINWORD.EXE" /A

If starting the program with the /a switch corrects the problem, use the
following methods to further isolate the problem.

Renaming the Normal Template
----------------------------

To prevent formatting, AutoText, and macros that are stored in the Normal
template (Normal.dot) from affecting behavior of the program and documents that
are opened, rename Normal.dot. Renaming allows you to quickly determine whether
the Normal template is causing the problem or behavior.

NOTE: Renaming the Normal.dot template resets several options back to the default
settings, including custom styles, custom toolbars, macros, and AutoText
entries. For this reason, Microsoft strongly recommends that you rename the
Normal.dot file.

Certain kinds of configurations may create more than one Normal.dot file. These
situations include cases in which multiple versions of Word are running on the
same computer or cases in which several workstation installations exist on the
same computer. In these situations, be sure to rename the correct copy of
Normal.dot.

To rename the Normal.dot file, follow these steps:

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please see your product documentation
to complete these steps.

1. Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

2. On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Find, and click Files or
  Folders.

3. In the Named box, type "Normal.dot" (without the quotation marks).

4. In the Look In box, select your local hard disk drive (or an alternate user
  template location if you are running Word from a network server).

5. Click Find Now to search for the file.

6. For each occurrence of Normal.dot that appears in the Find dialog box,
  right-click the file. Click Rename on the shortcut menu. Type a new file
  name, such as OldNormal.dot or Normal-1.dot and press ENTER.

7. Quit the find dialog box and restart Word normally (without using the /a
  switch).

If Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. In this case, the
problem is a damaged Normal.dot template. You may need to change a few settings
to restore your favorite options. If the Normal.dot file you renamed contains
customizations, such as styles, macros, or AutoText entries that cannot be
easily recreated, you may be able to copy those customizations from the old
Normal.dot file to the new Normal.dot file by using the Organizer.

For more information about using the Organizer, click the Office Assistant, type
"using the Organizer," click Search, and then click "Use settings from another
document or template."

Deleting Registry Entries
-------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Deleting the Data Key:
----------------------

NOTE: Deleting the Data key resets several options back to the default settings,
including the File menu most recently used file list, and many settings you
customize in the Options dialog boxes.

Most common options (click Options on the Tools menu) are stored in the Data key.
One troubleshooting step is to delete the Data key. Word rebuilds this Data key
by using the default settings the next time the program is started.

To delete the Data key, follow these steps:

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please see your product documentation
to complete these steps.

1. Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

2. On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button and click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and click OK.

4. Locate the following key by double-clicking the appropriate folders.

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Data

5. With the Data folder selected (on the left), click Delete on the Edit menu to
  delete the key.

6. Click Yes when you are prompted to confirm the deletion.

7. Quit the registry editor and restart Word normally (without using the /a
  switch).

If Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. The problem is a damaged
Data key. You may need to change a few settings to restore your favorite
options.

To edit or delete other registry entries:

Use the preceding steps but substitute the correct registry key in step 4, and
then use Modify or Delete in step 5.

NOTE: Some keys are automatically rebuilt when you run Word. To rebuild other
keys, you must reinstall the program by using the /y switch on the command line
to recreate the correct entry. For more information see the following section.

USING SETUP /Y
--------------

The /y switch prevents Setup from copying files. Setup proceeds normally,
including setting registry entries; however, it does not copy any files to the
computer. Use this switch to restore registry entry values or to track down
process problems without copying files.

This switch may be used when running Microsoft Office 97 Setup in maintenance
mode, for example:

  \setup.exe /y

Where Settings Are Stored in the Registry
-----------------------------------------

Word 97 stores all of its settings in the Windows registry; Word 97 no longer
stores information in an *.ini file or in the Winword.opt file as do Word 2.x
and 6.x.


This section lists the settings in the registry that pertain to Word 97. The
locations are organized into the following sections:

- Main locations of Word settings

- Settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

- Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common

- Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MS Setup (ACME)

- Settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools

- Miscellaneous settings

- Using the RegOptions macro

Main Locations of Word Settings
-------------------------------

Most settings in Word are stored in the following key:

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

Changes made to this HKEY_CURRENT_USER key are mirrored in the following key:

  
  HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

The difference between the two locations is that first one applies only to the
current user of the system while the other one is the default for all users.
However, Word entries are the same for both; so, any change made to one is
automatically reflected in the other.

NOTE: For the remainder of this section, all references to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER
key apply also to the HKEY_USERS key except where noted.

Settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word
----------------------------------------------------------------

The settings that you may need to examine during troubleshooting are located in
this key. The Data key and the Options key are the most frequently changed
areas.

Data Key
--------

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Data

The Word 97 for Windows equivalent to the Word 6.x Winword.opt file is the Data
key. This key contains binary information for most recently used lists,
including the most recently used file list and the most recently used address
book list. It also contains the same information that is stored in the
Winword.opt file in Word for Windows 6.x, such as Track Changes settings
(Revision settings in Word 6.x) and Edit settings.

Default Save Key
----------------

  
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Default Save

This key sets the default format for saving documents. You can change the default
format Word 97 uses by changing the Save Word Files As setting in Word. To
locate this option in Word, click Options on the Tools menu, and then click the
Save tab.

Options Key
-----------
