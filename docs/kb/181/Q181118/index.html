-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Package Command Manager (PCM) service, Pcmsvc32.exe, was designed to run on
secured Windows NT Workstation computers where the local user does not have
rights required to install software, write to the registry, or modify the system
files. Users on workstations where PCM is installed as a service should not be
members of the local Administrators group for the client workstation computer.

The PCM service requires a user account that has:

- Administrator privileges on the client computer.

- Domain user authority to read a PCM instruction file on the Systems
  Management Server logon server and to run a setup program in the package
  directory on the Systems Management Server distribution server.

This article describes security considerations for setting up the PCM service
user account in a domain. This article assumes that you have familiarity with
the PCM service installation instructions and a good understanding of Windows NT
domain concepts.

Choosing the Right Security Model for Your Environment
------------------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, the less secure the environment, the easier it is to
administer, in terms of deployment and password changes. For example, if a
single PCM service account is used across all Windows NT clients, a single
Rservice.ini file can be used for the deployment of the PCM service across the
entire enterprise. Similarly, a single password change and re-run of RSERVICE
can update the account on all Windows NT clients. The risk with this level of
security is that any user who knows the PCM service account and password can
effectively have local Administrator rights on all Windows NT computers that
have the PCM service installed.

The Rservice that is included with Service Pack 4 can automatically generate an
account name based on the machine name and service executable file name, and
gives the account a unique, random password. This option will be most
appropriate to use in master domain models where machine accounts reside in
resource domains. In a large single domain architecture, this may not be a
feasible solution.

Because the Domain Administrators group is added to the local Administrators
group when a Windows NT Workstation computer joins a domain, it is possible to
make the PCM service account a Domain Administrator to satisfy the user account
requirements. However, Microsoft Technical Support does not recommend granting
the PCM service account membership in the Domain Administrators group, because
it provides little or no security to the domain where the account resides,
including all the Windows NT workstations and servers that are part of that
domain. When an account is specified in the Rservice.ini file, it is
automatically added to the workstation's local Administrators group. There is no
reason why the PCM service should have Domain Administrator rights.

A secure environment requires more complex administration. In the most secure
scenario, it is possible to set up an individual PCM service account for each
Windows NT client that runs the PCM service. The drawback is that under this
configuration, individual user accounts and Rservice.ini files must be manually
created. Additionally, password changes would also need to be done on an
individual basis.

The Windows NT Security Account Manager (SAM) database does have a size
limitation, so you may need to use one or more resource domains to store a large
number of per-workstation service accounts. The maximum SAM size for Windows NT
Server 4.0 is 40 MB. SAM objects include users, groups, incoming trusts, and
machine accounts. The SAM must reside in non-paged pool memory for reasonable
authentication response times, so SAM size is a primary factor when determining
RAM requirements for the primary and all backup domain controllers.

Problems will occur if the SAM is too large for the hardware and software
environment. For example, User and User group enumerations and SAM replications
may take significantly longer, sessions may be dropped, and/or policies or logon
scripts may not apply or run. Additionally, the browse list has a 64-KB limit,
which limits the number of machine and user accounts browseable in the domain to
between 2,000 and 3,000, depending on the description field. Adding more RAM to
(or distributing the load among) more domain controllers will relieve some of
these problems. With a large SAM database, if you have several domain
controllers or slow links, it may be necessary to tune the NETLOGON registry
parameters to allow synchronization to occur.


Most environments will find a middle ground in these two extremes of security. To
further increase security without much additional work, individuals with very
sensitive data can be given individual PCM accounts, while other individuals
could share a PCM account in groups of 10 to 50. It is possible, for example, to
create one PCM service user account, and consequently one Rservice.ini file, for
every 10, 20, or 50 computers. For example, suppose there are 1,000 target
Windows NT client computers that you need to install the PCM service on. You can
create account security in groups of 50 clients, so only 20 Rservice.ini files
and user accounts will need to be created and maintained instead of 1,000. By
doing this, only the computers sharing the same account and password are at risk
if the password becomes compromised. The other groups of computers remain
secure.

Additional Security Concerns
----------------------------

If users of workstations running the PCM service are able to replace the
Pcmsvc32.exe file with their own service applications, they would then be able
to run any application they wanted in the security context specified for that
service. For example, if an account with Domain Administrator privileges was
used, the substituted application could grant the user's regular user account
full Domain Administrator privileges. To maintain security, the directory
containing Pcmsvc32.exe, as designated in the Rservice.ini file, must be
carefully protected, and users must not have administrative access to their
computers when running services with domain privileged accounts. You can use
RSERVICE to periodically scan each computer's service executable file, compare
it to the master copy, and report any deviations.

Creating Users and Granting Rights
----------------------------------

It is possible to use User Manager for Domains to remotely add the PCM service
account to the local Administrators group on a computer running Windows NT
Workstation. To do this, click Select Domain on the User menu, and type the name
of the remote workstation (instead of a domain name). If you are logged on as a
domain administrator, it is also possible to do this from a command line, by
using the Addusers.exe utility from the Windows NT Resource Kit, as in the
following example;

  Command Line: ADDUSERS \\RemoteComputer /C FILE.TXT
  File.TXT Contents:          [Local]
  Administrators,Members can fully administer the
  computer/domain,DOMAIN1\PCMUSER,
