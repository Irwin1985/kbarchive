-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Systems Management Server (SMS) attempts to process some MIF files that are
generated by SMS Hardware Inventory, the SMS_Executive service may cause the
computer to run slowly or to stop responding (hang). This may be caused by an
incorrectly formatted MIF file. Rather than stopping the processing cycle and
moving the MIF file to the Badmifs folder, the Dataldr thread of the
SMS_Executive service hangs and ultimately causes the SMS_Executive process to
hang. Attempts to stop the SMS_Executive service do not work; the only way to
stop the process is to use Kill.exe or to reboot the server. The MIF file is
ultimately moved to the Badmifs folder, but this does not stop the problem from
reoccurring with newly submitted MIF files.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by the inability of Dataldr to process a MIF file that has
not been properly formatted. When Dataldr attempts to parse the MIF file, the
file may be truncated before all of the information is written. When Dataldr
attempts to process the MIF file it enters a loop, trying to fully parse the
file. This then causes the SMS_Executive process to steadily consume CPU
resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
