The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A vulnerability exists in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 and
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 that can enable a malicious user
to run (execute) operating system commands on an affected Web server. This gives
the malicious user the ability to modify Web pages, add, change, or delete
files, reformat the hard disk, or take other actions (such as uploading any code
to the server and running it).

Best practices, if followed, can make it difficult or impossible for an attacker
to exploit the vulnerability. Even if an attacker successfully exploits it, the
vulnerability does not grant the attacker administrative control over the
server. Instead, the vulnerability grants the attacker privileges that are
normally reserved for a user who can log on to the server interactively.
Nevertheless, even these privileges can enable a malicious user to cause
widespread damage and allow a point from which the malicious user can launch
additional attacks in the hope of gaining additional privileges.

Mitigating Factors:

- This vulnerability does not provide a way for the attacker to learn the
  folder structure on the server. As a result, if the operating system is
  installed on a separate drive from the Web root or in non-standard folders,
  it can prevent an attacker from locating programs of interest.

- This vulnerability does not provide administrative access to the server. If
  you followed the recommendations in the IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0 security
  checklists, sensitive programs are moved to folders that only the
  administrator can access, and non-administrative access to server resources
  is severely restricted.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because of an error in the functionality that
processes requests to run programs that are housed on the server. A superfluous
decoding operation could give an attacker the opportunity to bypass security
checks and escape the server's virtual folder structure, thereby enabling the
attacker to run operating system commands on the server.
