- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice significant response differences when you browse to a Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) site and use different client or server certificates.

CAUSE
=====

IIS is attempting to contact and download various certificate extensions as part
of the SSL negotiation process. This usually involves Certificate Revocation
List (CRL) checking, which is disabled by default in IIS 4.0 but enabled by
default in IIS 5.0. For information on how to change the default values for CRL
checking, search the IIS online product documentation (located at
http://&lt;IISComputerName&gt;/iishelp) for the "CertCheckMode" keyword.

RESOLUTION
==========

First, make sure that the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) root certificate is
installed on the client. For additional information on how to do this, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q297681 Error Message: This Security Certificate Was Issued by a Company that
  You Have Not Chosen to Trust

Next, contact the CA that is responsible for issuing the certificate and have the
CA change the certificate extensions to reflect a faster protocol or download
location. For a Microsoft Certificate Authority that is running on Microsoft
Windows 2000, this is done through a policy module.

To change the default policy module, follow these steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). To do this, click Programs on
  the Start menu, click Administrative Tools, and then click Certificate
  Authority.

2. Right-click the Certificate Authority (CA) MMC snap-in and click Properties.

3. On the Policy Module tab, click Configure and click the X 509 Extensions tab.

The changes above will be reflected in all subsequently issued certificates.
NOTE: Existing certificates cannot be changed!

NOTE: You may also have to perform the previous steps on intermediate CAs.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the CA that issued your certificate cannot change the certificate extensions
to reflect a faster protocol or download location (because the certificate was
issued by a third party such as Verisign), fix any network or name resolution
problems that may be preventing IIS from downloading files (usually .crl or .crt
files) from the servers that are listed in the certificate's extensions.

To troubleshoot this, copy the URLs from the certificate's extensions and paste
them into the browser on the IIS server, then use the Microsoft Network Monitor
or the Wfetch.exe utility to identify any name resolution or network latency
issues as the browser attempts to contact and download the extension files.

For additional information on the Wfetch.exe utility, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q284285 How to Use Wfetch.exe to Troubleshoot HTTP Connections

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

View the certificate's certification path and note the extension details for
each certificate in the path. The differences in response time are related to
these extensions.

For example, view the CRL Distribution Point (CDP) extension details. If IIS is
using client certificates, it attempts to locate and download a CRL from each
certificate in the path, starting with the first CDP in the list and moving
downward.

For example, a CDP that is using an LDAP protocol and pulling the CRL from a LDAP
folder may take longer than a CDP that is using an HTTP protocol and pulling the
CRL from the local IIS server by using an HTTP GET command.

The following is a sample CDP extension:

NOTE: IIS starts from the first CDP and works downward.

  [1]CRL Distribution Point
       Distribution Point Name:
            Full Name:

                URL=http://Caserver.domain.com/CertEnroll/CArootCertifiateName.crl

  [2]CRL Distribution Point
       Distribution Point Name:
            Full Name:

                URL=ldap:///CN=LDAPCAserver.domain.com,CN=CDP,CN=Configuration,
                DC=com?certificateRevocationList?base?objectclass=cRLDistributionPoint

  [3]CRL Distribution Point
       Distribution Point Name:
            Full Name:

                URL=file://\\Caserver.domain.com\CertEnroll\CArootCertifiateName.crl

TheAuthority Information Access (AIA) extension also starts from the first CDP
and works downward.

The following is a sample AIA extension:

  [1]Authority Info Access
       Access Method=Certification Authority Issuer(1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2)
       Alternative Name:

           URL=http://CAserverName.domain.com/CertEnroll/CAserverName_CArootCertifiateName.crt

  [2]Authority Info Access
       Access Method=Certification Authority Issuer(1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2)
       Alternative Name:

           URL=file://\\CAserverName.domain.com\CertEnroll\CAserverName_CArootCertifiateName.crt
