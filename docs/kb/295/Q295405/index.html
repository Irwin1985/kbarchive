SUMMARY
=======

Network Monitor is a utility that ships with Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and
with Microsoft Systems Management Server. With Network Monitor, you can capture
and observe network traffic patterns and problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set up a capture, you can filter frames and view data details presented
in three panes: the Summary pane, the Detail pane, and the Hex pane. The
following steps describe how to create a capture for the purpose of monitoring
activity related to the XMLHTTP and ServerXMLHTTP HTTP objects in the Microsoft
XML parser.

Three computers are used in this example:

- The DataServer computer contains the XML file. In this example, Network
  Monitor is running on the DataServer computer.

- The WebServer computer runs the ASP application that uses the ServerXMLHTTP
  object to request the XML data.

- The IEClient computer runs the browser that requests the ASP page.

How to Run Network Monitor:

To run Network Monitor, follow these steps:

1. To open Network Monitor, on the Start menu, point to Programs, click
  Administrative Tools, click Network Analysis Tools, and then click Network
  Monitor. Note that Network Monitor is not installed on Microsoft Windows 2000
  by default. If your start menu does not contain this option, you may need to
  add it by using Windows 2000 Setup.

2. To select the network interface on which the capture will run, on the Network
  Monitor Capture menu, click Networks. Expand Local Computer to see the
  available network interfaces on which you can capture data. One interface
  exists for each network adapter in the computer, with one additional
  interface for a dial-up connection. The dial-up connection has its Dial-up
  connection property set to True. Select the interface that connects to the
  network that you want to monitor and click OK.

3. On the Network Monitor Capture menu, click Buffer Settings. The default
  buffer size is 1 MB. However, one drawback of having a small buffer size is
  that if the data that you are trying to capture is unpredictable, the buffer
  may wrap around before you can stop the trace, causing you to lose the data
  that you need. You can increase the buffer size to provide more time to stop
  the trace. You might need to change the size to 10-20 MB, depending on the
  data that is being monitored.

4. In general, you should filter addresses before you capture the trace to
  ensure a smaller trace file size. To set up a capture filter, first obtain
  the IP address of the WebServer and IEClient. To do this, from a command
  prompt, type "Ipconfig.exe" (without the quotation marks).

NOTE: On a Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows
Millennium Edition (Me) computer, type "Winipcfg.exe" (without the quotation
marks) at a command prompt.

NOTE: You should note the client IP address each time you start a capture,
because this address can change.

To add these addresses to the Network Monitor address database, follow these
steps:

  a. On the Capture menu, click Filter. In the Capture Filter dialog box, under
     (Address Pairs), double-click INCLUDE *ANY &lt;--&gt; *ANY.

  b. Click Edit Addresses and click Add. Type a friendly name for the WebServer
     computer, and for Type select IP. Type the IP address and click OK. Repeat
     this process for the IEClient computer.

  c. Because the DataServer computer is running Network Monitor, there is
     already an entry in the address database that uses the computer name.
     Double-click the computer name, change the name to DataServer, and click
     OK.

  d. Click Close to return to the Address Expression dialog box.

5. In the Address Expression dialog box, choose the stations and traffic
  direction for the filter. For this example, create two criteria to filter on.
  Criterion 1 allows traffic between the WebServer and IEClient computers to be
  included in the capture, and criterion 2 allows traffic between the WebServer
  and DataServer computers.

To set up the filter criteria, follow these steps:

  a. To set up filter criterion 1, in the left pane select IEClient, click the
     double-headed arrow (&lt;--&gt;), and in the right pane select WebServer.

  b. Click OK and make sure that the filter has been created under (Address
     Pairs).

  c. Double-click (Address Pairs) to add criterion 2.

  d. In the left pane, select WebServer, click the double-headed arrow
     (&lt;--&gt;), and in the right pane select DataServer.

  e. Click OK.

The filter criteria shown under Address Pairs are as follows:

INCLUDE WebServer(IP) &lt;--&gt; DataServer(IP)
INCLUDE IEClient (IP) &lt;--&gt; WebServer(IP)

  f. Click OK to close the Capture Filter dialog box.

How to Capture the Data:

To capture the data, follow these steps:

1. On the Capture menu, click Start. Note that the trace is now running, but
  that no data has been captured yet because nothing has met the filter
  criteria.

2. On the IEClient computer, browse to the ASP page that is located on the
  WebServer computer.

3. After the Web site has loaded in the browser, switch back to Network Monitor.
  On the Capture menu, click Stop.

How to View the Data:

To view the data, follow these steps:

1. On the Capture menu, click Display Captured Data.

2. Double-click a frame that you want to view. This causes the Detail (middle)
  and Hex (bottom) panes for that frame to be displayed. Note that when a
  section is selected in the Detail pane, it causes the hex data for this
  section to be selected in the Hex pane, along with the ASCII translation.

3. In the Detail pane, double-click the HTTP section of the frame to expand it.
  The hex and ASCII HTTP data are selected in the Hex pane.

4. Continue to drill down, selecting any fields under the HTTP frame that you
  want to view.

Steps to Reproduce Example Scenario:

1. On the WebServer computer, paste the following code into a file and name the
  file Xmlsxh.asp:

  &lt;%
    Dim xmlSXH
     Set xmlSXH = Server.CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.3.0")
     xmlSXH.Open "GET", "http://machinename/VirtualDirectory/sample.xml", false
     xmlSXH.send 
     Response.Write xmlSXH.responseXML.xml	
    Set xmlSXH = Nothing
  %&gt;

2. On the DataServer computer, paste the following code into a file and name the
  file Sample.xml:

  &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
  &lt;kukus&gt;
  	&lt;kuku&gt;	kuku	&lt;/kuku&gt;
  &lt;/kukus&gt;

3. On the IEClient computer, use Internet Explorer to call Xmlsxh.asp from the
  WebServer computer. The URL will resemble the following:
  "http://machinename/VirtualFolder/Xmlsxh.asp" (without the quotation marks)
