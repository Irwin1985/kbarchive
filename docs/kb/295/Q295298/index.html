SUMMARY
=======

This article briefly describes what occurs when a certificate request is
submitted to Certificate Services 2.0 through the Certificate Services Web pages
and what happens when you check your pending request on the Certificate Services
Web pages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Certificate Authority (CA) has a policy of not issuing certificates
automatically, when your browser submits a request for a certificate, the
following page is displayed:

  Certificate Pending
  Your certificate request has been received. However, you must wait for an
  administrator to issue the certificate you requested.
  Please return to this web site in a day or two to retrieve your certificate.
  Note: You must return with this web browser within 10 days to retrieve your
  certificate

When you generate a request and submit it to Certificate Services 2.0 through the
Web pages, the server places a cookie on your computer. The server uses this
cookie to look up the pending requests that you made when you return to check
the status of your pending requests.

When you return to http://computer_name/certsrv and select Check on a Pending
Request, a page displaying the pending requests appears and you select the
request from the list.

If the server reports that there are no pending requests, one of the following
may be the problem:

- The Certsrv page is being accessed by using a different URL than the one that
  was used to submit the request. For example, the request was submitted by
  using http://Computer_Name/Certsrv, and you are trying to view the pending
  requests by using http://IP_Address/Certsrv.

- The client browser has cookies disabled.

- The server is unable to retrieve the cookie that is stored on the client
  computer.

- The cookie that is returned by the client is corrupt.

- The cookie has expired.

- The right bracket (]) delimiter was not found in the cookie list.

The following code can be used to see which cookies the server stores on the
client.

Place the code on the server and browse to the page that contains the code with
the Web browser to look at the cookies that are on the browser from that server.
If this code does not produce the installed cookie, try restarting the IIS
service on the server to refresh any related components that pertain to the
cookie retrieval process.

  &lt;% @ Language="VBScript"%&gt;
  &lt;%
  	  
  	   Dim ArrReq 
  'Store the request information in an array.
  	   ArrReq=Request.Cookies("Requests")

  'Check if there are any requests.
       	   if ""= ArrReq then
       	
          	Response.write "No Cookies Found" &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;"
          
       	   else
             	   
  		Response.Write "The Cookies Stored are " &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;"
  			
  'Split the string into individual cookies.

                  Dim ArrCookies

                  ArrCookies = Split(ArrReq,"]")

                  Response.Write Ubound(ArrReq) &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;" 
  	         
    	        Dim counter
  'Split the cookies one by one appending the ']' which got removed by the Split command above.	
  	        For counter=0 to UBOUND(ArrCookies)-1
  	  	    Response.Write ArrCookies(counter) &amp; "]" &amp; "&lt;BR&gt;"	  		
  	        Next
  			
  	   End If
