-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4 (SP4), the Internet Mail
Service queues may back up, and the information store cannot be shut down
properly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a thread deadlock. This problem is very similar
to the issue that is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q279798 XADM: Information Store Service Hangs After You Apply Service Pack 4

However, this problem was detected later, so version 5.5.2654.29 of Store.exe
(which was released in response to the isssue that is described in Q279798) does
not contain the fix for the deadlock that is described in this article.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information Store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2654.94 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this fix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can affect any Exchange Server 5.5 computer that uses IMAIL
conversion for Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP), Post Office Protocol 3
(POP3), and Internet Message Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) functionality, or any
connector that is based on the Exchange Development Kit (EDK), which uses
IMAIL.

You may first notice this problem on Internet Mail gateway servers. The Internet
Mail Service seems to stop processing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail.
Normal troubleshooting procedures suggest that you restart the Internet Mail
Service or Information Store service. When you attempt to stop the service,
either the Internet Mail Service or Information Store service stops responding
(hangs) and will not restart until you restart the server.
