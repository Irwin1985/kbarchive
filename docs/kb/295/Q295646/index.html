SUMMARY
=======

Because Microsoft Excel is such a powerful data analysis tool, Visual Basic and
VBA application developers often want to bring data into an Excel worksheet for
analysis purposes. This article describes the ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)
approach to this programming task, using Microsoft Jet-specific syntax for
certain SQL commands.

This article describes programming solutions and does not describe Excel's
menu-driven data import capabilities (through the Open option on the File menu)
or the use of Microsoft Query (from the Get External Data option on the Data
menu).

For additional information about complementary programming solutions that make
use of Excel Automation instead of SQL commands, click the article number below

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the examples that follow, cnSrc represents an open ADO connection to the
Northwind sample Jet database using the Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider.

How to Copy
-----------

You can use the SELECT INTO statement to copy data from any data source that Jet
can read into any data destination, creating a new table (or, in the case of
Excel, a new worksheet) on the fly. Do not use the dollar sign syntax, for
example [Sheet1$], when you refer to a sheet name as your destination. The
destination workbook can exist or not exist; however, the destination sheet must
not yet exist.

There are three ways to write the copy command that copies the entire Customers
table from the Microsoft Access Northwind database into a new sheet in an Excel
workbook. Each syntax requires a single SQL statement and creates column
headings in the first row of the destination worksheet.

- The following example uses the SELECT INTO syntax:

  Dim strSQL As String
  strSQL = "SELECT * INTO [Excel 8.0;Database=" &amp; App.Path &amp; _ 
      "\book1.xls].[Sheet1] FROM Customers"
  cnSrc.Execute strSQL

- The following example uses the SELECT INTO ... IN syntax:

  strSQL = "SELECT * INTO [Sheet1] IN '' [Excel 8.0;Database=" &amp; App.Path &amp; _
      "\book1.xls] FROM Customers"

  where the bracketed destination database information is preceded by an empty
  pair of single quotes for the type argument (the "Excel 8.0" portion), which
  is included within the brackets when you use this syntax.

- The following example uses the alternate syntax for the IN clause:

  strSQL = "SELECT * INTO [Sheet1] IN '" &amp; App.Path &amp; _
      "\book1.xls' 'Excel 8.0;' FROM Customers"

  where the type argument is now listed separately after the destination file
  path.

How to Append
-------------

You can use the INSERT INTO ... IN statement to append data from any data source
that Jet can read into any data destination. Both the destination workbook and
worksheet must exist. Now that you are referring to an existing worksheet, you
must use the standard dollar sign syntax, for example, [Sheet1$], when you refer
to a sheet name as your destination. In addition, the column headings must
already be present; in other words, this statement can only be used to append to
an existing table.

There are two ways to write the append command that copies the entire Customers
table from the Northwind database into an existing Excel worksheet, which
already has the appropriate column headings.

- The following example uses the SELECT INTO ... IN syntax:

  strSQL = "INSERT INTO [Sheet1$] IN '' [Excel 8.0;Database=" &amp; App.Path &amp; _
      "\book1.xls] SELECT * FROM Customers"

  where the bracketed destination database information is again preceded by an
  empty pair of quotes for the type argument, which is now included within the
  brackets.

- The following example uses the alternate syntax for the IN clause:

  strSQL = "INSERT INTO [Sheet1$] IN '" &amp; App.Path &amp; _
      "\book1.xls' 'Excel 8.0;' SELECT * FROM Customers"

Starting with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6, MDAC no longer
contains the following Jet components:

- Microsoft Jet
- Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider
- ODBC Desktop Database Drivers

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q239114 ACC2000: Updated Version of Microsoft Jet 4.0 Available in Download
  Center

The "MDAC 2.5 Stack and Windows File Protection" white paper contains a full list
of the components that are shipped with MDAC 2.5, along with a discussion of
Windows File Protection. Refer to this white paper for more information about
the Jet dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are included in MDAC 2.5, which are
no longer a part of MDAC 2.6.
