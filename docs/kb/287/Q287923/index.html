  minimum system requirements for MechWarrior 4 (8 megabytes (MB) of video
  random access memory (RAM)).

- The video driver that is installed on your computer is outdated.

- You are running the game in a different screen resolution setting than your
  desktop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Check Screen Resolution

3. On the Settings tab, note what is listed under Screen Resolution (Screen
  Area) and Colors.

  accept the changes. Restart your system if necessary.

Resolve IRQ Conflict
--------------------

Contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire about how to disable or use a
different IRQ for the device that shares the IRQ channel with the video
adapter.

To determine if your video adapter shares an IRQ channel with another device, use
the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

1. Click Start, point to Run, type "msinfo32" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. Click Hardware.

3. Click IRQs or Conflicts/Sharing.

Update Video Adapter Driver
