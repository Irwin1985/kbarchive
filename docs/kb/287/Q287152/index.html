NOTE: The Intel 810 chip set dynamically allocates video memory up to 11 MB, as
needed. You cannot adjust the amount of video memory that is allocated. The
Intel 810 chip set is not fully compatible with the latest Microsoft games
because of the memory allocation structure.

When you play Microsoft MechWarrior 4, you may experience one of the following
symptoms:

- Poor video performance in the game.

- Poor game performance (choppy game play).

Verify Video Adapter Memory:

Use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to determine the amount of video memory installed
on your video adapter. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\program files\directx\setup\dxdiag.exe" (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Microsoft
  Windows is installed.

3. Click the Display or Display 1 tab.

4. Note the amount of video memory on the Approx. Total Memory line under
  Device, and then click Exit.

  If less than 8 megabytes (MB) of video memory are installed on your video
  adapter, install additional video memory on your video adapter, or install a
  video adapter with more video memory.
