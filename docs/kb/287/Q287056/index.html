SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate users from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange Server 5.5, the following
error messages are logged:

  

  Date            11/24/01                Event ID        1027
  Time            12:14:44 PM             Source          MSExchangeMig
  User            N/A                     Type            Error		
  Computer        XXXXX03                 Category        None

  -and-

  cc:Mail - Export program returned an invalid Message size of '0'. Account
  'One, User' did not migrate successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the cc:Mail Export program incorrectly writes spaces
to some messages where size should be written.
