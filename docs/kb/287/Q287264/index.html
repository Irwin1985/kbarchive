SYMPTOMS
========

When you log off a computer that is running Windows NT Workstation or Server 4.0
and Lotus Notes 4.5.2, the Monitor service, which is installed from the Resource
Kit as part of the Data Logging service, unexpectedly stops running but produces
no error message. This occurs whether you start the Monitor service manually or
by using the Schedule service.

You may also encounter the following application event log entries:

  Event ID: 1008
  Source: Perflib
  Type: Error
  Description: The Open Procedure for service "notestat" in DLL
  "d:\notes\server\nnotes.dll" failed. Performance data for this service will
  not be available. Status code returned is DWORD 0.

  Event ID 1999
  Source: n
  Type: Informational
  Description: The description for Event ID ( 1999 ) in Source ( n ) could not
  be found. It contains the following insertion string(s): .

  Event ID 2003
  Source: n
  Type: Error
  Description: The description for Event ID ( 2003 ) in Source ( n ) could not
  be found. It contains the following insertion string(s): .

  Event ID 1900
  Source: n
  Type: Information
  Description: The description for Event ID ( 1900 ) in Source ( n ) could not
  be found. It contains the following insertion string(s): .

When you log on again, the Monitor service is no longer running, and you must
manually restart it.

If Compaq Insight Agent is installed on the computer, you may also encounter the
following application event log entry:

  Event ID 4097 Source: DrWatson Type: Information Description: The
  application, exe\cpqmgmt.DBG, generated an application error The error
  occurred on 2/12/1998 @ 9:39:57.531 The exception generated was c0000005 at
  address 02267ec0 (nosymbols)

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, remove Lotus Notes, delete the registry entry for the
Lotus Notes Monitor Agent, and then reinstall Lotus Notes without choosing the
Notes Monitor Agent installation option:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Remove Lotus Notes.

2. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\notestat

4. On the Edit menu, click Delete.

5. Quit Registry Editor.

6. Reinstall Lotus Notes. During the installation, do not click the Notes
  Monitor Agent installation option.

These steps also resolve the Compaq Insight Agent "Dr. Watson" error message.

If this does not resolve events 1900 and 1999, make this additional change in the
registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Notestat\Performance

3. Double-click Reg_sz to open the key.

4. Change the value Nnotes.dll to xxnnotes.dll, and then click OK.

5. Quit Registry Editor.
