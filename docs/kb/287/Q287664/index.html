The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The W32.FunLove.4099 virus can attack the Windows NT file security system and
infects the Ntoskrnl.exe file. This virus can give all users full access to each
file, regardless of its protection, when the computer is booted with the
modified kernel file. This allows a guest account to read and modify all files,
including files that are typically accessible only by administrators.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The W32.FunLove.4099 virus infects a computer when a user runs a program that is
infected with the virus. If an administrative user runs an infected program, the
virus immediately gains access to that computer and attempts to install itself
as a service on the computer.

For the W32.FunLove.4099 virus to succeed in the attack, it needs administrative
rights on a computer that is running Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation
during the initial infiltration, which occurs when an infected program is ran by
an administrative user on the computer. After the administrator or someone with
equivalent rights logs on, the W32.FunLove.4099 virus has the opportunity to
patch the Ntoskrnl.exe file (this is the Windows NT kernel file that is located
in the Winnt\System32 folder).

The virus modifies two bytes in a security function named SeAccessCheck that is
part of Ntoskrnl.exe. Therefore, the virus can give full access to all users for
every file, regardless of the file's protection, when the computer is booted
with the modified kernel. This means that a guest can obtain administrative
access to files on the computer. This poses a security risk because the virus
can spread, regardless of the actual access restrictions on the particular
computer.

After the virus has infected the computer, no data can be considered protected
from any user until after the virus has been removed from the computer.
