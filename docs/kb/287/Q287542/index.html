-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running a SLI (Session Level Interface) application on the SNA
Server/Host Integration Server 2000 versions listed at the beginning of this
article, the SLI application may fail unexpectedly when an outstanding SLI_SEND
verb completes with the following return code:

  Primary_rc = LUA_PARAMETER_CHECK (0x0001)
  Secondary_rc = LUA_REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING (0x00000019)

This problem does not occur on SNA Server versions prior to 4.0 Service Pack 2.

CAUSE
=====

The SLI library is not saving the lua_data_length value specified in an SLI_SEND
when sending non-function management data ( FMD) messages.


RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+-------------------------------------+
| File name    | Date       | Time    | 
+-------------------------------------+
| Winsli32.dll | 02/07/2001 | 11:30AM | 
+-------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, and 4.0 SP4 and Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following annotated SNA Server logical unit application (LUA) API trace
(CLIAPIx.ATF) statements show an example of the problem described in this
article.

NOTE: Please refer to the LUA Programmer's Guide in the SNA Server or Host
Integration Server 2000 SDK for details on the format of the following SLI and
Request Unit Interface (RUI) verbs.

RUI   00000000                                &lt;....            &gt;

The SLI_SEND has correctly set the lua_data_length (denoted by ^^^^ in the trace
above) to 4 bytes (0400) for the IBM Sense Code of 08130000 that the application
is trying to send to the host. However, the subsequent RUI_WRITE has a
lua_data_length of 0 (also denoted by ^^^^).

The message being sent by the application is a negative response (-RSP) and is a
data flow control (DFC) message, which is determined by the response header (RH)
(denoted by ****) set by the application. Since this is a -RSP, the
lua_data_length in the RUI_WRITE should be at least 4 bytes. Because it is 0
(zero) in this case, the LUA_REQUIRED_FIELD_MISSING error is returned to the
application.
