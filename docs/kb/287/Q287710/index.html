SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to remotely control a workstation in Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0, you may be prompted to supply valid logon credentials to make the
connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remotely control a workstation, the following items must be configured
correctly for the user account of the person who is attempting to take remote
control:

- The user account must be added to the Permitted Viewers list in the SMS
  Administrator Console. Alternately, remote control also succeeds if the user
  is a member of the Local Administrators group on the computer on which the
  user is attempting to use remote control. In addition to adding individual
  users to the list of permitted viewers, you can grant rights to remote
  control by adding global groups to the list of permitted viewers.

  NOTE: In some cases, if you include the domain name in front of the global
  group, you may be prompted for permissions.

- The user account must have access to Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM),
  to access the collection that contains the target computer. Access to WBEM is
  generally granted by including the user in the SMSAdmins local group on the
  SMS site server. If you do not want to add the user as part of the SMSAdmins
  local group, you can grant access to WBEM by using WBEMPERM (in Microsoft
  Windows NT 4.0) or the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Control
  Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in (in Microsoft Windows 2000).

  NOTE: If you add a user to the SMSAdmins local group, it does not indicate
  that the user has full administrative rights to SMS. Full administrative
  rights are granted by using the security manager in the SMS Administrator
  Console. The only function of the SMSAdmins local group is to provide access
  to WBEM.

- The user account must have appropriate rights (to collections, and so on) in
  the SMS Security Manager.
