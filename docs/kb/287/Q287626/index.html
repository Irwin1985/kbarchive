IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a client account is locked out, multiple logon failures in the Microsoft
Windows NT Security Event log are registered on license metering servers.

CAUSE
=====

The license metering client uses the currently logged on user account to
authenticate and connect to the license metering server to copy log files. If
that user's account is disabled, locked out, or otherwise invalid, the license
metering client attempts hundreds of logon attempts on the license metering
server, and this creates very large security log files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The retry algorithm can be changed (through the addition of two registry keys) to
specify the number of retries and the time limit between retries. You would need
to make this setting on each of the client computers, and you could do so by
using an SMS Installer script. To manually add these registry keys, use the
following steps on each client:

1. Use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components\License
  Metering\Properties

2. Add the number of times to retry a logon by adding the following new value to
  the preceding registry key:

  Value name: PipeRetries
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Data: Type the number of times to retry.

3. Add the time between retries (in milliseconds) by adding the following new
  value to the preceding registry key:

  Value name: PipeRetryInterval
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Data: Type the time between retries in milliseconds.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.
