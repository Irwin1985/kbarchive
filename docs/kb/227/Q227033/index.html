-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This article describes potential problems that can occur when Systems Management
Server (SMS) version 2.0 is deployed in a domain that has the account lockout
policy enabled. The default setting for account lockout is to lock the account
after five incorrect logon attempts with an incorrect password and to unlock the
account after waiting one half hour.

If the Client Connection account (SMSClient_&lt;SiteCode&gt;) password is changed
in User Manager for Domains, the account is locked out. The SMS 2.0 clients
store the password for this account locally and attempt to use the old password
until the client is updated with the new password. The client updates the local
copy of the password when the install process is run by running Smsls.bat or
Smsman.exe.

Until every client has run the installation process and updated the password, the
SMSClient_&lt;SiteCode&gt; account is locked out shortly after it is re-enabled.
If the client cannot connect to the Client Access Point (CAP), it tries every
hour. The client never becomes aware of the new passwords until it runs the
install process. After 60 days without being able to contact the CAP, the client
uninstalls itself.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent lockouts from occurring, create at least one additional Client
Connection account and have every SMS 2.0 client run the install process. This
updates the client with the new account information and allows new clients to
have access to the CAP. The SMSClient_&lt;SiteCode&gt; account continues to be
locked out until every client is updated. Administrators can leave this account
locked out or delete it from User Manager for Domains as well as the SMS 2.0
interface. Clients that have not been updated continue to use the wrong password
for the SMSClient_&lt;SiteCode&gt; account, continuing to lock it out if it is
not deleted, but do not lock out the new Client Connection account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
