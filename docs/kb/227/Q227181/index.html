SUMMARY
=======

The installation behavior of the Microsoft Windows Installer can be configured
by an administrator using the Group Policy Editor (GPE) and the Active
Directory.

There are also several user and machine policies that can be configured on a
local computer. This article describes user polices and then the machine
policies.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

User polices can be configured in the local registry and are located under the
following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

The following list contains values for these entries:

Value Name: AlwaysInstallElevated
Value Data Types: REG_DWORD
Description: If this value is set to "1" and the corresponding machine value is
also set, the Installer always installs with elevated privileges. Otherwise, the
Installer uses elevated privileges to install managed applications and uses the
current user's privilege level for non-managed applications.

Value Name: SearchOrder
Value Data Types: REG_SZ
Description: Order in which the Installer searches the three different types of
sources:

"n" - network
"m" - media (CD-ROM or DVD)
"u" - URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

For example, a value of "nmu" instructs the Installer to search network sources
first, media sources second, and URL sources last. Leaving out a letter removes
the corresponding volume type from the search. Default order in absence of this
value is network first, then media followed by URL.

Value Name: DisableBrowse
Value Data Types: REG_DWORD
Description: If this value exists and is set to "1", users are forbidden from
browsing to locate installer sources. Also, the "Use feature from:" combo box
for direct input is locked the "Browse..." button is disabled. See the source
resiliency topic in the Windows Installer SDK for more details on source
browsing.

Value Name: TransformsAtSource
Value Data Types: REG_DWORD
Description: If this value exists and is set to "1"; the Installer searches for
transform files in the root of any network sources in the source list for the
product. By default, transforms are stored in the Application Data folder of a
user's profile.

Value Name: DisableRollback
Value Data Types: REG_DWORD
Description: If this value is set to "1", the Installer will not store rollback
files during installation, disabling installation rollback. By default, rollback
is enabled. Administrators are advised to not use this policy unless it is
absolutely essential.

Machine polices can be configured under the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

Value Name: AlwaysInstallElevated
Value Data Types: REG_DWORD
Description: If this value is set to "1" and the corresponding user value is also
set, the Installer always installs with elevated privileges. Otherwise, the
Installer uses elevated privileges to install managed applications and uses the
current user's privilege level for non-managed applications

Value Name: DisableMSI
Value Data Types: REG_DWORD
Description: If this value exists and is set to "2", the Installer is always
disabled for all applications. If this value is set to "1", the Installer is
disabled for non-managed applications but is still enabled for managed
applications. If this value is set to "0', any other number, or is absent, the
Installer is always enabled.

Value Name: Logging
Value Data Types: REG_SZ
Description: This policy is used only if logging has not been enabled by the "/L"
command line option or MsiEnableLog. If policy is set in this case, a log file
is created in the temp directory with the random name: MSI*.LOG. Specify the
logging mode by setting the policy value to a string of characters. Use the same
characters to specify logging mode policy as used by the '/L' command line
option. See Command Line Options. Note that you cannot use "+" and "*" for the
policy.

Value Name: DisablePatch
Value Data Types: REG_DWORD
Description: If this value is set to "1" the Installer does not apply patches.
This policy can be used to provide security in environments where patching must
be restricted.

More information about local polices and the Windows Installer can be found in
the Windows 2000 Software Development Kit (SDK).
