RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time                 Size    File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  01/05/99  06:34p               122,961 Msir2jp.dll   (Alpha)
  01/05/99  06:34p             1,218,388 Msir2jp.lex   (Alpha)

  01/05/99  06:33p                86,097 Msir2jp.dll   (i386)
  01/05/99  06:33p             1,218,388 Msir2jp.lex   (i386)

These files replace the Nlgwbrkr.dll file.

NOTE: You must run the following command from a command prompt after installing
the fix:

  Regsvr32 /s MSIR2JP.DLL



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Index Server version 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Index Server has the ability to search text in multiple languages. The
Wordbreaker is part of the technology that allows Index Server to do that.

This problem does not occur with the version of the Japanese Wordbreaker feature
included in Index Server 2.0.

The Japanese Wordbreaker version 1.0 was packaged in a DLL named Nlgwbrkr.dll.
The fix for this problem is to replace the Wordbreaker version 1.0 with the
Wordbreaker version 2.0. The Wordbreaker 2.0 is packaged in a DLL named
Msir2jp.dll and has an associated data file named Msir2p.lex. Register the DLL
with Regsvr32 to handle the file name differences.
