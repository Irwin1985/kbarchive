SUMMARY
=======

Updated hardware abstraction layers (HAL) have been released by Compaq to
enhance compatibility for Windows NT 4.0 on Compaq/DIGITAL Alpha-based hardware
platforms. The following changes have been made to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6
to support the new Alpha HALs released by Compaq:

- Enable Galaxy Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) 5.0 support for Tsunami chip set
  platforms.
- Add Tsunami chip set Hardware Access List to Windows NT 4.0.
- Enable TL to issue an IPL17 when needed.
- Fix debug target's hangs when baud rates are mismatched.
- Add support for System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) 2.1.
- Add file to allow SX to build without warnings.
- Add support to write to FRU EEPROM for Clipper platforms.
- Add required serviceability changes.
- Fix 16-bit sound card distortion.
- Enable Remove command to use only the common header file.
- Disable/enable system interrupt.
- PALs have been updated to fix a problem where stopping a service traps with
  KiPanicException on Alpha. This is fixed by making the PAL not attempt to
  SYSRET in priviledged PAL mode. The process can still stop, but not take the
  system with it.

The updated HALs include the Revision G HAL released by Compaq.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interfaces directly between the
operating system and the computer hardware. Although the operating system code
remains the same from platform to platform, a HAL must be designed for each type
of computer hardware.

For information about the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) and HAL on your
computer, click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, click
Windows NT Diagnostics, and then click the System tab.

For more information about the HALs released by Compaq, please visit the
