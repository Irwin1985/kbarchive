The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view documents or e-mail messages created on Microsoft Windows 98/95
client computers and stored on an IBM AS/400-based computer that is using an
Integrated PC Server (IPCS) adapter to run Windows NT, your documents or e-mail
messages may have time discrepancies of 1-2 hours between the document creation
or modification time on a client workstation and the same time values recorded
on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Daylight Savings Time has altered the time. IPCS
adapters do not contain a system clock, but instead depend on time information
provided by the AS/400-based computer. AS/400-based computers and the OS/400
operating system do not automatically adjust for Daylight Savings Time.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, at the beginning and ending of Daylight Savings
Time reset the AS/400 Local Time Offset from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) by
modifying the value of the "QUTCOFFSET" registry setting on the AS/400-based
computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

The system administrator of the AS/400-based computer must manually adjust the
System Registry to reset the current "Time Offset" on the computer from GMT.
Note that GMT is also known as Universal Time Code (UTC). For example, during
Eastern Standard Time (EST), local clocks are set 5 hours earlier than GMT.
However, because GMT is not adjusted for Daylight Savings Time, servers in the
Eastern time zone must be adjusted by an additional hour during the period known
as Eastern Daylight Time. Because of this, the "normal" offset of minus 5 hours
for the Eastern Time Zone should be adjusted to minus 6 hours during Daylight
Savings Time.

This adjustment is processed automatically at the beginning and end of Daylight
Savings Time with Windows 98/95-based workstations and Windows NT-based
workstations and servers. However, on AS/400-based computers, the system
administrator must modify the AS/400 "QUTCOFFSET" registry setting at the
beginning and end of Daylight Savings Time. If the administrator does not make
these adjustments on the AS/400-based computer, date and time stamps on
documents and e-mail messages are displayed with different values, depending on
whether they are viewed from the server or the workstation. For information
about how to modify this registry setting, please contact IBM technical
support.

If the "Adjust For Daylight Savings" feature is not enabled on the Windows
98/95-based or Windows NT-based computer, the time variance is 1 hour. If the
"Adjust For Daylight Savings" feature is enabled on the Windows 98/95-based or
Windows NT-based computer, the time variance is 2 hours.
