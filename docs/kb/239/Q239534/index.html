Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Data Loader cannot process a MIF when the year in a MIF is above 2030.

You may see the following compilation error in the Dataldr.log file:

  Compilation failed~Time has incorrect format or illegal values. Could not
  convert file:
  d:\SMS\site.srv\dataload.box\deltamif.col\PROCESS\X00000000.MIF
  Cannot process MIF X00000000.MIF, moving it to BADMIFS

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the maximum Year value for a MIF date attribute is
hardcoded to 2030. The error is generally seen when software inventory reports a
file which has a date stamp greater than 2030.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date      Time    Size    File name   Platform
  -----------------------------------------------
  06/26/99  01:00a  535,632 BASE.DLL    (x86)
  06/26/99  01:00a  750,352 BASE.DLL    (Alpha)

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

We have extended the date to 2035 which is the documented operational range of
Systems Management Server 1.2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example is a piece of MIF with a bad date (year = 2031):

  Type = Date Value = "20311011051024.000000+000"
