The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When a usercontrol has any top level menus where the NegotiateMenus property is
non-zero, resources drain slowly when the focus is set to and from the
usercontrol. The problem occurs in both the Visual Basic Design Environment
(IDE) and as an EXE.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic destroys the UserControl's main menu, but does not destroy all of
the submenus under the main menu when the UserControl loses input focus.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest service pack for
Visual Studio 6.0.

For additional information about Visual Studio service packs, click the article
numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That a Visual Studio Service Pack Is Installed

You can download the latest Visual Studio service pack from the following
Microsoft Web site:

  Visual Studio Product Updates
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates.asp)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce and Work Around the Problem:

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.
  The NegotiateMenus property of Form1 is set to True by default.

2. On the Project menu, click Add User Control to add UserControl1 to the
  project.

3. Add a CommandButton and a CheckBox control to UserControl1.

4. Create a menu with several items and sub items on UserControl1. Set the
  NegotiatePosition property of each top level menu item to 1-Left.

5. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of UserControl1:

  Option Explicit
  '
  '
  ' Demonstrates how to free menu resources orphaned by a UserControl.

  ' Zero-based array and one-based counter
  ' of cached UserControl submenus

  Private m_ahMenus() As Long
  Private m_nMenus As Integer

  Private Declare Function GetMenu Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long) As Long
  Private Declare Function GetSubMenu Lib "user32" (ByVal hMenu As Long, _
     ByVal nPos As Long) As Long
  Private Declare Function GetMenuItemCount Lib "user32" _
     (ByVal hMenu As Long) As Long
  Private Declare Function IsMenu Lib "user32" (ByVal hMenu As Long) As Long
  Private Declare Function DestroyMenu Lib "user32" (ByVal hMenu As Long) _
     As Long

  Private Declare Function GetParent Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long) As Long

  Private Sub UserControl_EnterFocus()
     ' the UserControl's main menu has been created and has
     ' replaced the form's main menu before any control on the
     ' UserControl gains input focus.

     If Check1.Value And (m_nMenus = 0) Then
        Call LoadMenus(GetMenu(GetParent(UserControl.hwnd))) ' Form1.hwnd))
        Debug.Print "UserControl submenus loaded: " &amp; m_nMenus
     End If
  End Sub

  Private Sub UserControl_ExitFocus()
     ' the UserControl's main menu has been destroyed, and has
     ' replaced been by the form's main menu. *But* all submenus
     ' under UserControl's main menu have not been destroyed.

     If m_nMenus Then
        Debug.Print "UserControl submenus destroyed: " &amp; DestroyMenus
     End If
  End Sub

  Private Sub UserControl_Initialize()
     Check1.Caption = "Workaround"
     BorderStyle = 1
  End Sub

  Private Sub Check1_Click()
     If (Check1.Value = vbChecked) And (m_nMenus = 0) Then
        Call LoadMenus(GetMenu(GetParent(UserControl.hwnd)))
        Debug.Print "UserControl submenus loaded: " &amp; m_nMenus
     ElseIf (Check1.Value = vbUnchecked) And m_nMenus Then
        Erase m_ahMenus ' Clear the module level variables
        m_nMenus = 0
        Debug.Print "No UserControl submenus will be destroyed"
     End If
  End Sub

  ' Pass the UserControl's top level menu on first call

  Private Sub LoadMenus(hMenu As Long)
     Dim nItems As Integer
     Dim i As Integer
     Dim hSubmenu As Long
     
     nItems = GetMenuItemCount(hMenu)

     For i = 0 To nItems - 1
        hSubmenu = GetSubMenu(hMenu, i)

        If IsMenu(hSubmenu) Then
           ReDim Preserve m_ahMenus(m_nMenus)
           m_ahMenus(m_nMenus) = hSubmenu
           m_nMenus = m_nMenus + 1
        End If

        Call LoadMenus(hSubmenu) ' recurse through sub menu
     Next
  End Sub

  Private Function DestroyMenus() As Integer
     Dim i As Integer
     Dim n As Integer

     For i = m_nMenus - 1 To 0 Step -1
        If IsMenu(m_ahMenus(i)) Then
           ' Will destroy all submenus under the current submenu, toggle the
           ' For expression comments above to destroy individual submenus.
           Call DestroyMenu(m_ahMenus(i))
           n = n + 1
        End If
     Next

    ' Clear the mod level variables
     Erase m_ahMenus
     m_nMenus = 0

     DestroyMenus = n

  End Function

6. Close all of UserControl1's open windows.

7. Add a CommandButton and a UserControl1 to Form1. UserControl11 is created by
  default.

8. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Private Sub Form_Click()
     Dim i As Integer
     For i = 1 To 2000
        UserControl11.SetFocus
        DoEvents ' IMPORTANT:  Allows SetFocus to complete before proceeding
        Command1.SetFocus
        DoEvents
        Me.Caption = i
     Next i
  End Sub

9. Save your project.

10. On Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me, start the Resource Meter. The
  Windows NT or Windows 2000 Task Manager does not provide the same level of
  functionality.

11. Run the project, and click on the form. Under Win9x, the Resource Meter
  shows a steady decline in User and System resources.

12. Click the form again. On most systems, you observe problems with
  menu-related functionality such as Copy, Paste, and the Start menu. You may
  also see changes to fonts and icons used by the system.

13. Click the Stop button. You may receive an Out of Memory dialog, which you
  can dismiss. Terminate the Visual Basic IDE and observe that the resources
  are released.

14. Restart the Visual Basic IDE. Reload and run your project.

15. Select the checkbox labeled Workaround and click the form. The Resource
  Meter shows no decline in resources.
