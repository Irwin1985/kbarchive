-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a Microsoft Exchange Server to join an existing Microsoft
Exchange Site that has any or all of the following connectors installed:

  Linkage 3.2 PROFS
  SNADS
  NOTES

you may receive the following error messages:

  Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
  An error occurred while processing an e-mail address. To view details of
  the error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer
  on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.
  Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
  ID no. c1030b37

  Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
  Email addresses for address type 'SNADS' were bot generated because an
  error occurred. To view details of the error, see the application event
  log in the Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server
  computer.

CAUSE
=====

When encountering like addresses, the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant will
try to create a unique proxy address. It will only try 20 times to generate this
unique proxy address. When it encounters more than 20 like addresses, it fails
to create a unique proxy address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
versions 4.0 and 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To install this fix:

1. If it exists in the exchsrvr\address\profs directory, rename IBMPXGEN.DLL to
  IBMPXGEN.OLD.

2. If it exists in the exchsrvr\address\snads directory, rename IBMPXGEN.DLL to
  IBMPXGEN.OLD.

3. If it exists in the exchsrvr\address\notes directory, rename NTSPXGEN.DLL to
  NTSPXGEN.OLD.

4. Copy the new IBMPXGEN.DLL to the \exchsrvr\address\profs directory and the
  \exchsrvr\address\snads directory.

5. Copy the new NTSPXGEN.DLL to the \exchsrvr\address\notes directory.

6. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in RAW mode,

  Admin.exe /raw

7. Expand the appropriate Site that this Exchange Server belongs to.

8. In the Configuration Container, expand the Addressing container.

9. Expand the E-mail Address Generators container.

10. Select the appropriate email address generator object. This could be the
  Linkage PROFS Address Generator, the Linkage SNADS Address Generator, or the
  Linkage NOTES Address Generator.

11. From the File menu, click Raw Properties.

12. Once the RAW properties dialog opens, select the File-Version attribute from
  the Object attributes list box.

13. Click the Editor command button.

14. If this is a Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0, select the File Version
  editor type. Enter 5.5.1960.8 (periods denote what should be entered in each
  box presented).

15. If this is a Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0, change the HEX number
  displayed to 0800A80705000500.

16. Click OK in whichever editor box you are using.

17. Click the SET command button.

18. Click OK on the RAW Properties dialog box.

Making this change on one Server in each Site in sufficient. Newer proxy
generator DLLs are automatically replicated around to Servers with older
versions. This is done by checking the Directory entry for each email address
generator. After making the change to the first Server you will need to allow
time for the directory entry to replicate to all the Servers in the Site.

By design this change should NOT require the Directory or System Attendant
services to be re-started. However, if the proxy DLL was loaded in memory at the
time this change occured, it is possible that a restart of these services will
be necessary.
