The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

A message from a Microsoft Exchange user to a recipient on a remote X.400 system
may be routed to a local recipient. This can happen if the address of the local
recipient and the recipient on the remote X.400 system are similar. For example,
if the local recipient has the following X.400 address:

  C=US;A=PTT;P=COMPANY;S=USER1

and the remote X.400 recipient has the following address:

  C=US;A=PTT;S=USER1

Note that the remote address matches the address of the local recipient, except
that there is no Private Management Domain (P=...) defined. Both addresses are
syntactically correct and valid.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 uses a slightly different algorithm for
address resolution. Even if the "Allow fuzzy proxy search" registry key is
disabled, Exchange Server still uses a fuzzy algorithm in certain cases.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, apply the fix referenced below. You will also need to
create a new entry in the Windows NT registry. To do this:

1. Start the Windows NT Registry Editor.

2. Go to the following subkey:

  \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\
  Parameters

3. Create the following new registry value:

  Allow fuzzy proxy search

  Set this value to 2. This case-sensitive registry value is a DWORD type value.

If this registry value does not exist in the registry, the Microsoft Exchange
Server message transfer agent (MTA) assumes a value of 1 for this setting and
enables fuzzy proxy searches.

This value has three possible settings:

- Allow fuzzy proxy search=0. Restricted fuzzy proxy searches are allowed. A
  unique match on the Surname and the Given Name or an exact match is allowed.

- Allow fuzzy proxy search=1. Full fuzzy proxy searches are allowed.

- Allow fuzzy proxy search=2. No fuzzy proxy searches are allowed at all, only
  an exact match is allowed.

REFERENCES
==========

Server, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Activity

NOTE: Be aware that the registry settings are different for Exchange Server
version 4.0.
