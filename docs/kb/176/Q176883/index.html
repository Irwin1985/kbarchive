-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows 95 
- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click a graphic file in Windows Explorer, the graphic is opened
in Internet Explorer 4.0, instead of the graphic program that you were
previously using.

For example, when you double-click a graphic file, the graphic should open in
Photo Editor.

NOTE: This problem occurs after you install Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and
affects the following graphic file types:

- Graphics interchange format (GIF) (*.gif)

- Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) File Interchange Format (*.jpg)

- Portable Network Graphics (*.png)

- Photo CD Image (*.pcd)

- PC Paintbrush (*.pcx)

- Targa (*.tga)

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design. When you install Microsoft Internet Explorer
4.0, the associations of some registered graphic file types are changed to
Internet Explorer (IEXPLORE).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

Method 1: Rerun Office/Word Setup
---------------------------------

You can re-register Word (and all Office programs, if you run Office Setup) by
running Setup with the /y switch using the following steps:

1. Insert the Word or Office CD into the CD drive.

  If you installed Word or Office from floppy disks insert the Setup Disk 1 in
  the floppy disk drive of your computer.

2. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Setup.exe /Y

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the drive that contains the CD or Setup
  Disk 1.

4. Click OK.

5. Click Reinstall.

When the setup is complete, restart Windows. The file types of your graphics
should now be associated with Photo Editor, just as they were before you
installed Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.

For additional information about setup switches, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q132374 OFF: How to Display Help on Running Setup Program with Switches


Method 2: Manually Change the Graphic File Type Associations
------------------------------------------------------------

You can re-associate each of the graphic file types to any graphics editor. To
re-associate your graphic files to Microsoft Photo Editor, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the Start button and then click Explore.

2. In Windows Explorer, on the View menu, click Folder Options (Options if you
  are using Windows NT).

3. Click the File Types tab.

4. Under Registered File Types, select the graphic file type you want to change,
  and then click Edit.

5. In the Edit File Type dialog box, under Actions, click Open, and then click
  the Edit button. In the "Editing action for type: &lt;file type&gt;" dialog
  box, in the "Application used to perform action" box, type the path (or use
  the Browse button) to the graphics program that you want to use to open this
  type of graphic file, followed by a "%1" (you must include the quotation
  marks), and then click OK.

  For example:

  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\PhotoEd.exe" "%1"

  NOTE: The Use DDE check box is not selected.

6. In the Edit File Type dialog box, under Actions, click Print, and then click
  the Edit button. In the "Editing action for type: &lt;file type&gt;" dialog
  box, in the "Application used to perform action" box, type the path (or use
  the Browse button) to your graphics program you want to use to open this type
  of graphic file, followed by /p "%1" (you must include the quotation marks),
  and then click OK.

  For example:

  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\PhotoEd.exe" /p "%1"

  NOTE: The Use DDE check box is not selected.

7. In the Edit File Type dialog box, under Actions, click Printto, and then
  click the Edit button. In the "Editing action for type: &lt;file type&gt;"
  dialog box, in the "Application used to perform action" box, type the path
  (or use the Browse button) to your graphic application you want to use to
  open this type of graphic file, followed by /pt "%1" "%2" "%3" "%4" (you must
  include the quotation marks), and then click OK.

  For example:

  "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\PhotoEd.exe" /pt "%1"
  "%2" "%3" "%4"

  NOTE: The Use DDE check box is not selected.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 for each graphic file type for which you want to change the
  association.

9. Click OK to close the Folder Options dialog box.

Now when you double-click your graphic files, the graphic will open in Photo
Editor.
