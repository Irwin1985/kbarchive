-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Flight Simulator 98, you may experience one or more of the
following symptoms:

- The joystick behaves erratically.

- The joystick does not respond.

- The rudder or throttle does not respond.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following troubleshooting methods in the order in
which they are listed. As you complete each troubleshooting method, start Flight
Simulator 98 and test if the issue is resolved.

Verify That Your Operating System Supports Your Game Controller
---------------------------------------------------------------

To provide game port support in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, you must install
Service Pack 3 (SP3) or later. Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 SP3 or later supports
most analog game controllers. However, it does not support digital game
controllers.

Microsoft Windows 2000 supports all SideWinder game controllers. You must use the
Microsoft SideWinder Game Controller software 3.x or later.

Microsoft Windows 95/98 supports both analog and digital game controllers. For
best performance, verify that latest version of the device drivers for your game
controller are installed in your computer.

The following table shows operating system compatibility for Microsoft SideWinder
game controllers:

                                    Windows NT
                                    4.0 with SP3
  Game Controller                   or later       Windows 95/98
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  SideWinder standard               Yes            Yes
  SideWinder 3DPro                  Analog only    Yes
  SideWinder Game Pad               No             Yes
  SideWinder Precision Pro          No             Yes
  SideWinder Force Feedback Pro     No             Yes
  SideWinder FreeStyle Pro          No             Yes
  SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel   No             Yes

Confirm the Game Controller Connection to the Game Port
-------------------------------------------------------

Verify that the game controller is connected directly to the game port on your
computer. Daisy-chained game controllers or game port adapters can interfere
with communication between the game port and the game controller. Windows NT 4.0
does not support daisy-chained game controllers or game port adapters.

Disable the SideWinder Game Device Profiler
-------------------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder game controller, disable the SideWinder Game Device
Profiler or the SideWinder Game Controller software. To do this, right-click the
Game Device Profiler icon or the Game Controller Software icon in the status
area on the taskbar, and then click Unload.

Calibrate the Game Controller
-----------------------------

If you use a digital Microsoft SideWinder game controller with version 2.0 or
later of the Microsoft SideWinder Game Device software or the Microsoft
SideWinder Game Controller software, the software calibrates the game controller
automatically.

To use version 2.0 of the Microsoft SideWinder Game Device software to test the
calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, and then click OK.

4. Close Control Panel.

To use version 3.0 of the Microsoft SideWinder Game Controller software to test
the calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the General tab, click the game controller you want to test in the Game
  Controllers box, and then click Properties.

4. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, click OK, and then click OK again.

5. Close Control Panel.

If you use an analog game controller, or if you use a Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro
or a Microsoft SideWinder game pad with version 1.5 of the SideWinder Game
Device software, follow these steps to calibrate the game controller:

NOTE: No calibration option is available in version 1.5 of the SideWinder Game
Device software unless you install Flight Simulator 98 with DirectX 5.0.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Select the gaming device you want to calibrate in the Controller column, and
  then click Properties.

4. Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
  the game controller. If you use a SideWinder 3D Pro with version 1.0 of the
  SideWinder software, when you are prompted to press a button on the
  controller, press a button on the joystick, not on the joystick base.

  NOTE: Because of differences between analog game controllers, you may notice a
  certain amount of deviation between the graphic display for the joystick
  position and the actual joystick movement. This is normal and does not affect
  you game controller calibration.

5. When you receive the "You have successfully calibrated your device" message,
  click Finish.

6. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your game controller, and then
  click OK.

7. Close Control Panel.

If you cannot calibrate your game controller, or if your game controller does not
function properly when you test it, Windows may be unable to communicate
properly with the game controller. If this is true, contact the manufacturer of
your game controller for information about how to configure the device correctly
in Windows. You may also need to obtain and install the latest version of the
device drivers.

If you calibrate and test the game controller successfully, start Flight
Simulator 98 to test the game controller in the game. If the issue continues to
occur, calibrate the device in Flight Simulator 98. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 98.

2. On the Options menu, click Custom Controls.

3. Verify that the Enable Joystick check box is selected, and then click
  Calibrate.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate your game controller.

Reset Default Actions
---------------------

To reset the default actions assigned to the game controller, follow these
steps:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 98.

2. On the Options menu, click Custom Controls.

3. Click the Assignments tab.

4. Under the Game Device column, click any command to select it.

5. Click Reset Defaults, and then click Yes.

6. To check if the default actions are selected for your 4-axis game controller,
  verify that the game device settings for the control axes in the game match
  the settings in the following table:

     Action          Game Device
     ---------------------------

     Ailerons axis   Axis 01
     Elevator axis   Axis 02
     Rudder axis     Axis 04
     Throttle axis   Axis 03


  If the default actions are not selected, repeat steps 4-5, or follow the steps
  in the "Manually Assign Actions" method to assign the default actions
  manually.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Rebuild the Fltsim98.cfg File
-----------------------------

To rebuild the Fltsim98.cfg file, press and hold down CTRL+SHIFT as you start
Flight Simulator 98 and start a new flight. Continue to hold down CTRL+SHIFT
until you are in the cockpit view.

NOTE: When you rebuild the Fltsim98.cfg file, some of your joystick settings may
change.

If your game controller is installed properly and the Devices.cfg file contains
the default settings for your game controller, Flight Simulator 98 adds the
appropriate entries for your game controller to the Fltsim98.cfg file.

The Devices.cfg file contains the following joystick headings:

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use a Logitech Warrior joystick, connect it to the game port. Do not
connect it to the serial port. The Logitech Warrior does not function properly
with DirectX version 5.0 when it is connected to a serial port.

Because the Logitech Warrior is not listed in the Devices.cfg file, Flight
Simulator 98 may not assign any actions to the buttons on the joystick or may
configure it as a generic joystick.
