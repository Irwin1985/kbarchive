SYMPTOMS
========

WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested by
Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been taken from
unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS
ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this information "as is" without

purpose.

When you try to close a table (.dbf) file located on a CD-ROM that is not marked
as read-only and also contains international characters, you may receive this
error:

  Not enough diskspace.

In Visual FoxPro for Macintosh the program may fail with the following message:

  The application Visual FoxPro for Macintosh has unexpectedly quit, because an
  error of type 3 occurred. You should save your work in other open
  applications and restart the computer.

CAUSE
=====

The table is located on a CD-ROM and the file is not marked as read-only.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the NOUPDATE clause to the USE command that opens the table.

NOTE: Selecting the "Open As Read-Only" check box adds the NOUPDATE clause to the
USE command that is then executed.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Burn a custom CD-ROM to include a table file that meets the following
  conditions:

   - Table contains either a character field with international extended
     characters (such as an umlaut) or contains a standard memo field with
     international extended characters.

   - Table codepage is marked as 0, which means that the table was saved
     without a codepage tag.

     NOTE: FoxPro program Cpzero.prg will cause this error to occur.

   - Table is burned onto a CD-ROM without having its file attribute marked as
     read only.

     NOTE: Most CD-ROM software sets the read-only attribute by default and
     there may not be an option to change this behavior.

2. Add the following environment settings in the Config.fpw:

        CODEPAGE = AUTO    &amp;&amp; Without this setting problem will not occur.
        EXCLUSIVE = ON

3. Open the table.

4. An informational dialog is displayed entitled "Code Page" that contains the
  following message:

  File &lt;filename.dbf&gt; is not marked with a code page. Please select the
  code page it was created in.

  By default the Platform option button is set to All and the Code Page list box
  is set to 1252 - Windows ANSI. Click the Select button.

5. Close the table with the following FoxPro command:

        USE

  The error message below is displayed:

  Not enough diskspace.

NOTE: This same test can be performed on a write-protected floppy disk. However,
the error message is worded differently depending on the operating system being
used.

On Windows NT 4.0 the following error messages appear, but on Windows 95 only the
second error message appears.

  

  Vfp.exe -  Write Protect Error
  The disk cannot be written to because it is write protected. Please
  Remove the write protection from the volume in Drive A:



     [Abort]  [Retry]  [Ignore]

Selection of the [Abort] or [Ignore] button generates the error dialog box:

  

     Microsoft Visual FoxPro
     Error writing to file.

        [OK] [Help]
