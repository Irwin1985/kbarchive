SUMMARY
=======

In general, there is no one maximum size limit for an MMF.

MMF Size Limit Recommendation
-----------------------------

The considerations that must be taken into account when determining the maximum
recommended size are wide and varied. Therefore, there can be no one
recommendation for every environment. Therefore, using experience as the basis
for our recommendation, the following recommendation is being offered. Base size
limit of MMF file should not exceed 30 MB. This figure should be further reduced
based upon the following variables.

Local-Based or Server-Based MMF File:

- Local-based files do not use the network for opens and closes and, therefore,
  have less corruption because of networking issues. Server based files have
  greater chances for bad opens and closes, network traffic, and so on.

- Generally we find that the hardware on local computers (hard disk drive and
  controller) is often a much lower quality than that on the server. Using
  these two items as a consideration.

Additional Considerations:

- Network Traffic

   - If you have a busy network, with lots of network traffic.

   - How many routers, hubs, and so on do users go through to access their MMF?

   - How many users are on the same network server computer?

   - Is there a RAID box or are we simply using a server and hard drive?

   - How much activity does this server have?

   - What is the usage of this server?

   - What is the quality of the hardware in the server itself?

   - Is this server computer on the HCL (for Windows NT)?

- Postoffice

   - How many users are on this postoffice?

   - Is this a busy postoffice (send and receive over 1,000 messages per day)?

   - How many postoffices are on the same server computer?

Using the above variables, we find the average size recommendations to be between
15 MB and 25 MB.
