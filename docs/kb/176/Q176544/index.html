-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a Define Query Results format and you use attributes that
contain apostrophes, you may receive the following error message:

  Couldn't Save the Query Result Format

Or when you try to create a new Query Result format using the Systems Management
Server Administrator program, you may receive the following error message:

  Cannot save Query Result format

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when an invalid character, such as an apostrophe (')
is used in any of the fields other than the Description field during MIF form
creation. These fields become the table names within the SMS database. The only
character, other than actual letters and numbers, that SQL Server allows for
inclusion in table names is the underscore character (_).

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date     Time        Size      File name
  ----------------------------------------

  1/9/98   7:00pm      376,912   Base3.dll

NOTE: This fix applies to Systems Management Server 1.2 only.


NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Use the MIF Generator to re-create the .xnf file. Do not use any illegal
  characters.

2. Ensure that all existing copies of the old .xnf file are replaced with the
  newly created .xnf file. For additional information, please see the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q131614 Propagating MIF Entry Forms (XNF files) to SMS Clients

3. Delete the corresponding .mif and .sev files from all clients in the
  Ms\Sms\Noidmifs directory.

4. Open the Systems Management Server Database Manager. On the Tools menu, click
  Delete Group Classes.

5. Select Personal Computer and click OK.

6. Select the group representing the offending MIF information and click OK to
  delete this group from the database.

7. Have the clients re-enter any of the fields and save the new MIF.

8. Have the clients log on again or otherwise run the Smsls.bat file to take
  inventory and send the new MIF information to the server.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
