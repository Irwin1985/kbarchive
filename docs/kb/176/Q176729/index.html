-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Menu pads, also known as Menu titles, that do not have a submenu associated with
them, will not work with a single mouse click when used in FoxPro with Macintosh
OS 8. These menu pads require a double-click.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a change to the Macintosh operating system with OS 8.
The system now has sticky menus that stay down when a menu title is clicked.
Previously, the menu would not stay down when the title was clicked.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use submenus with all menu titles (menu pads).

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DEFINE PAD command is used to create menu titles on menu bars. If there is
not a menu associated with the menu title, the ON SELECTION PAD command is used
to specify a command that executes when the menu title is selected.
Alternatively, if a menu title has a menu associated with it, the ON PAD command
is used to activate the popup and its bars that make up the menu. Both menu
scenarios are illustrated in the sample program below in the Steps to Reproduce
Behavior section.

Generating a menu created in the Menu Designer produced the code used in the
sample program. The code was copied from the .mpr file created when the menu was
generated. The randomly generated names for the menu titles were changed to p1
and p2. The menu title that uses the ON SELECTION PAD command requires the
double-click for its command to execute, which has Hello as the prompt.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Type the following code into a new program file and then run the program
  file:

        SET SYSMENU TO
        SET SYSMENU AUTOMATIC

        DEFINE PAD p1 OF _MSYSMENU PROMPT "Hello" COLOR SCHEME 3 ;
                KEY ALT+H, ""
        DEFINE PAD p2 OF _MSYSMENU PROMPT "Get Back To Normal" ;
                COLOR SCHEME 3 KEY ALT+G, ""
        ON SELECTION PAD p1 OF _MSYSMENU WAIT WINDOW "Hello"
        ON PAD p2 OF _MSYSMENU ACTIVATE POPUP getbackton

        DEFINE POPUP getbackton MARGIN RELATIVE SHADOW COLOR SCHEME 4
        DEFINE BAR 1 OF getbackton PROMPT "Red"
        DEFINE BAR 2 OF getbackton PROMPT "Blue"
        DEFINE BAR 3 OF getbackton PROMPT "Quit"
        ON SELECTION BAR 1 OF getbackton WAIT WINDOW "Red"
        ON SELECTION BAR 2 OF getbackton WAIT WINDOW "Blue"
        ON SELECTION BAR 3 OF getbackton SET SYSMENU TO DEFAULT

  The program should display a menu with a Hello pad and a "Get Back To Normal"
  pad.

2. Click the Hello pad and release the mouse button. If you are running FoxPro
  under OS 8, the menu pad will highlight. If you click the menu pad again, a
  WAIT WINDOW with "Hello" appears. With the Macintosh operating systems
  earlier than OS 8, the WAIT WINDOW "Hello" appears with the first click of
  the menu pad.

3. Try the "Get Back To Normal" menu pad. When the menu pad is clicked, the
  drop-down menu appears. Once the menu is down, the commands on the menu can
  be selected. With the Macintosh operating systems earlier than OS 8, the menu
  does not stay down when the mouse button is released. Select the Quit command
  to get the FoxPro menu back.
