MORE INFORMATION
================

Problems Fixed by Flight Shop Converter 98
------------------------------------------

Flight Shop Converter 98 fixes the following problems in Flight Simulator 98:

- Multiplayer system allows host to remove other players from a session.

- Multiplayer system properly displays user names containing extended
  characters.

- Multiplayer system can transmit and receive visual data from converted Flight
  Shop aircraft.

- The slaved ADF gauge in the Bell 206 JetRanger III helicopter now works
  correctly.

- The control position indicator in the Cessna 182RG now moves in a fashion
  consistent with the other aircraft in the product.

- The ILS system reception volume is adjusted to allow you to intercept the
  glideslope from farther below without losing the signal.

- The VOR reception volumes have been adjusted for more realistic tail-off
  curves. This change should alleviate problems receiving Low or Terminal class
  VORs at high altitudes.

- The Cessna 182S autopilot no longer automatically engages the wing leveler
  when it is activated from the panel's radio stack.

- A potential General Protection Fault (GP Fault) error message when you shut
  down Flight Simulator while an Adventure or Lesson is running is corrected.

- Fix to Fltsim98.cfg file creation and parsing. This fixes the support for the
  NT361 control module from NT Systems, Inc.

- The visual system now correctly avoids texturing scenery of the Rolling Hills
  seed type.

- The instrument panel system now correctly colors the panel when the panel
  starts in night mode.

- The adventure system problem related to the order of commands in the
  adventure source code is corrected. This problem occurs when you adjust the
  autopilot parameters to be consistent with prior versions.

- The adventure system problems related to the following APLC functions are
  corrected:

  SET_POSITION - was ignoring the 3rd parameter (Altitude)
  WEATHER_CHAR - was ignoring the 4th parameter (Speed)
  VISIBILITY - was not handling values between 0 and 1 correctly

- The problem in the ATIS window when the system is using large fonts is fixed.

- The problem in the sound system related to playing crash sounds is fixed.

- The problem with the mouse pointer not disappearing on 3DFX based boards when
  you use Mouse As Yoke Mode is fixed.

- The internal scenery buffer is increased from 256K to 512K and fixes problems
  with London scenery (and some third-party scenery).

- The display on the Fuel Quantity Gauge is changed to allow for aircraft with
  more than 100,000 gallons capacity. If the amount is below 100,000 gallons,
  the display shows 2 large digits and 1 small digit - this is a xx.x * 1000
  display. If the amount is above 100,000 gallons, then the display shows 3
  large digits - this is a xxx * 1000 display.

- To use the EGT gauge on the reciprocating engine panels, make sure the
  Mixture Control check box is selected on the Engine tab in the Aircraft
  Settings dialog box.

- The behavior of engine controls is changed (throttle, starters, etc.) on
  multi-engine panels so that they no longer change the selected engine that is
  controlled by the joystick or keyboard. For example, if you have selected the
  Adjust All Engines option on the Engine tab of the Aircraft Settings dialog
  box, dragging engine 2 throttle does not affect the ability of the joystick
  or keyboard throttle control to move all of them.
