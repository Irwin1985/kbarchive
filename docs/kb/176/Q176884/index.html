-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Queries in Visual FoxPro that compare integer fields in the WHERE clause of a
SQL Select statement between two or more tables may not return all matching
records. This problem occurs when the collation sequence is set to anything but
Machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround to this problem depends on which version of Visual FoxPro is
being used. Four workarounds are listed below:

- Use the SET COLLATE command prior to running the query to set the collation
  sequence to Machine. This works in all versions of Visual FoxPro.

- Create an index on the integer fields before running the query. The program
  in the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section can be modified to accomplish
  this. All records will then be returned.

  Follow each of the two CREATE CURSOR commands in the sample program with a
  command to create an index on the integer field. A sample follows:

  CREATE CURSOR t1 (in1 i)
        INDEX ON in1 TAG in1
        CREATE CURSOR t2 (in2 i)
        INDEX ON in2 TAG in2

- Use numeric, float, or double type fields without decimal places instead of
  integer fields although this may affect query performance. You will need to
  test query speed if query performance is a concern. This workaround works in
  all versions of Visual FoxPro.

- If you are using Visual FoxPro 5.0 or later, use the LEFT or RIGHT JOIN
  syntax to join the tables rather than the WHERE clause.

  For example, using the code from the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section
  below, you can use the following queries to produce the correct results. Keep
  in mind that the cursors created in the program below are stripped down with
  only an integer field in each. The SELECT statements below may produce very
  different results on real data although they produce identical results on the
  test data:

  SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.in1=t2.in2 INTO CURSOR t3

        SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.in1=t2.in2 INTO CURSOR t3

Either statement above can replace the following line in the sample program
below:

  SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE in1=in2 INTO CURSOR t3

- Unfortunately, the INNER JOIN syntax has the same problem as the SQL Select
  statement with the WHERE clause.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SET COLLATE command, according to the Visual FoxPro Online Help file,
"Specifies a collation sequence for character fields in subsequent indexing and
sorting operations." The command should not have any affect on numeric or
integer type fields or their comparison.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code in a program file in Visual FoxPro:

  CLEAR ALL
        CLEAR

        ** Store the current collation sequence to the variable yyy.

        yyy=SET("collate")

        ** Setting collate to General, a collation sequence that illustrates
        ** the problem.

        SET COLLATE TO "General"

        ** Create two cursors with one integer field in each

        CREATE CURSOR t1 (in1 i)
        CREATE CURSOR t2 (in2 i)

        ** Populate each cursor with 1000 records, inserting the loop counter
        ** into the integer field.

        FOR x=1 TO 1000
        INSERT INTO t1 (in1) VALUES(x)
        INSERT INTO t2 (in2) VALUES(x)
        ENDFOR

        ** The SELECT statement to join the two tables.

        SELECT * FROM t1,t2 WHERE in1=in2 INTO CURSOR t3

        ** Checking  _Tally to see how many records the query returned.

        WAIT WINDOW STR(_Tally)+" records returned by the query"

        ** Start of loop to determine what records are missing.

        x=0
        SCAN
        x=x+1
        IF NOT in1=x
        WAIT WINDOW "Missing integer"+ STR(x)
        x=in1
        ENDIF
        ENDSCAN

        ** Set collate back to its original setting

        SET COLLATE TO yyy

2. The following table shows which records, out of the 1,000 in the test tables
  created above, are missing with the different collation settings and the
  platform (Windows vs. Macintosh):

     Collation Sequence     Platform           Missing Records
     ------------------     --------           ---------------
     Dutch,  General

     Slovak                 Kamenicky (Czech)
                            MS-DOS	       19, 275, 531, 787, 1043

     General, Iceland       Icelandic MS-DOS  19, 275, 531, 787, 1043

     Greek                  Greek MS-DOS      19, 275, 531, 787, 1043

     Greek                  Greek Windows     23, 279, 535, 791, 1047

     Russian                Russian MS-DOS    19, 275, 531, 787, 1043

     Russian                Russian Windows   22, 278, 534, 787, 1043

     Polish                 Mazovia (Polish)
                            MS-DOS            17, 273, 529, 785, 1041

  NOTE: The Iceland collation sequence is not available in Visual FoxPro for the
  Macintosh.

3. Change the command SET COLLATE TO "General" to SET COLLATE TO "Machine" in
  the program above and note that no records are missing. One thousand records
  are returned from the query.

There is a pattern to the missing records. For the problematic collation
sequences on the Windows platform, if the missing numbers are converted to
hexadecimal, they all end in 11. This pattern continues into at least the next
1,000 records (2,000 total). On the Macintosh platform, the missing numbers,
when converted to hexadecimal all end in 18. However, as an exception to the
pattern, hexadecimal 518 or decimal 1304, does not turn up missing when the
number of records in the test tables is 2,000.

The Unique collation sequence's pattern is also different. Here the missing
numbers all end in E when converted to hexadecimal. If the number of records
used is increased to 2,000, hexadecimal numbers 42E (decimal 1070) and 52E
(decimal 1326) are not missing.

The problem described in this article is similar to another problem that was
fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0a that was related to character fields not integer
fields.
