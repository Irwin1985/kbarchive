SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message that contains an attachment over a 1984 X.400 connection
to a foreign message transfer agent (MTA) that uses Boldon James manifest
encoding, the attachment name may not appear in the message when it is received.
The attachment itself is transferred successfully, but the attachment's name,
date, and time are not. When you receive a message over this connection, the
attachment name may be changed to Att.dat or a similar generic name.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Microsoft Exchange Server does not create Boldon James manifests for
attachments. When you send a message that contains an attachment over an X.400
connection that uses this type of encoding, information about the attachment is
not encoded into a manifest. Therefore, the foreign MTA does not receive this
information.

In addition, by default, Microsoft Exchange Server does not decode and apply
attachment information in Boldon James manifests when receiving messages from
foreign MTAs. As a result, attachment names may be changed to generic names such
as Att.dat.

STATUS
======

This is a design limitation of the 1984 X.400 specification that Boldon James
manifest encoding is designed to overcome. Although the creation and decoding of
manifests are not officially supported by the X.400 specification, Microsoft has
enhanced the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 MTA to support this feature.

This feature is included in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 1984 X.400 specification provides poor support for encoding attachment
information, resulting in multiple proprietary attachment encoding schemes.
Boldon James manifest encoding is a method of encoding attachments in which an
additional attachment, referred to as a manifest, is included with the message.
The manifest provides information about the original attachment, including the
attachment name.
