1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING BOOKSHELF '95
------------------------------------------------

To install and run Bookshelf '95 you will need at least the following minimum
configuration:

- A Color Macintosh II or higher, Color Classic, or Color Powerbook

- System 7.0 or later

- At least 4 MB of random-access memory (RAM) (6 to 8 MB recommended)

- At least 2.5 MB of available hard disk space

- A CD-ROM drive or access to the CD-ROM via a network connection

In order to use Bookshelf '95, you must install the application and its
supporting files on your hard disk. The Setup program on the CD- ROM installs
the Bookshelf program to a new folder and adds any necessary files and resources
to the System folder on your hard disk.

-------------

2. MEMORY USE
-------------

Bookshelf '95 needs a relatively large amount of your computer's system memory
(RAM) to display pictures and play sounds. It should run on systems with 4 MB of
RAM and at least 2.2 MB (2248 K) available for Bookshelf. Most users will not
have problems, but if you have only 4 MB of memory and your system software uses
a large portion of your RAM, you may need to adjust memory usage to make
Bookshelf '95 run properly. To do this:

- Run only one application at a time. If other applications are running, close
  them before re-launching Bookshelf '95.

- Check the amount of memory being used by your system software.

  To do this:
  1. Return to the desktop and select the Apple menu.

  2. Choose the first menu item, "About This Macintosh..."

  3. The "Largest Unused Block" needs to be greater than 2200 K to run
     Bookshelf '95.

  4. If the only item listed in the About This Macintosh dialog is System
     Software, and the Largest Unused Block is less than 2200 K, you need to
     reduce the amount of memory consumed by your system software. Refer to
     your Macintosh documentation to do this, but some general suggestions
     follow:

- Open the Memory Control Panel and check the Disk Cache setting. To make the
  greatest amount of memory available, set the cache to 32K.

- Large numbers of fonts and sounds consume system memory. Removing those that
  you aren't using will free up more memory. Do NOT, however, remove the
  following fonts: Arial, Symbol, Bookshelf Symbol 1, 2, and 3.

- Third party system extensions such as screen savers, fax software, desktop
  pictures, menu-modifying utilities and other system enhancements increase the
  amount of memory consumed by your system. Removing some or all of these
  extensions will increase the amount of memory available to applications. Be
  sure that you save anything you remove from your System Folder in a separate
  folder on your disk so that you can replace it later.

NOTE: Be sure to restart your Macintosh after making any of these changes to your
system.

--------------

3. PERFORMANCE
--------------

If Bookshelf '95 seems to run slowly, interrupts sounds or film clips, does not
play sounds at all, or does not allow you to enlarge images, here are the main
things to check:

- If you are running on a Macintosh with low memory, you may experience
  performance problems such as slow video playback, loss of audio in Bookshelf
  '95, or other slowing of Bookshelf '95. Please refer to Section 2 of this
  ReadMe document (MEMORY USE) for suggestions on how to solve memory problems.

- If you are using a slow CD-ROM drive, it may not be able to supply
  information to the Macintosh at the speed required by the software. There is
  no work around for this problem. If you suspect a problem with your CD-ROM
  drive, ensure that it is properly terminated and that its software is
  properly installed. For more information on SCSI termination, read your
  Macintosh or CD-ROM drive documentation, or ask your Apple dealer.

---------------------------------------

4. COLOR CONFIGURATION AND SCREEN SIZES
---------------------------------------

Bookshelf '95 requires that your monitor display 256 or more colors.

Bookshelf '95 will run in 16-bit mode (thousands of colors) and 24-bit mode
(millions of colors). These video modes improve the appearance of Bookshelf's
photos and film clips; however, using 16-bit or 24-bit video may alter
Bookshelf's performance or reduce the amount of memory available to Bookshelf.
If you see low memory messages when running in thousands or millions of colors,
you can increase the memory available to Bookshelf by switching to 256 colors To
do this, select the Apple menu, choose Control Panels, then choose Monitors. In
the Monitors dialog box, choose 256 then close the dialog.

-----------------

5. SOUND PROBLEMS
-----------------

If there is no sound at all, first make sure that the sound level on your
Macintosh is set correctly. To set the sound level, select the Apple menu,
choose Control Panels, then choose Sound. In the Sound dialog box, experiment
with the speaker volume setting until you get a comfortable sound level. Setting
the sound level to maximum may cause sound distortion.

If your Macintosh is using Virtual Memory, you may find that sounds are
interrupted. For best sound performance, turn off Virtual Memory. To do this,
select the Apple menu, choose Control Panels, then choose Memory. Choose the
Virtual Memory Off option, then restart the computer.

In low memory situations, you may find that sounds will not load or play. If you
cannot get a sound to play and are sure that your sound control panel is set
correctly, or you are receiving error messages when attempting to play sounds,
you may need to allocate more memory for Bookshelf. Please refer to Section 2 of
this ReadMe document (MEMORY USE) for suggestions on how to solve memory
problems.

The sounds used in Bookshelf '95 are stored on the CD-ROM in a compressed format.
In order to play, the sound must be read from disk and decompressed. Older or
slower Macintoshes, such as the Macintosh LC III or the earlier Performa models,
may experience interruptions in audio playback.

When an audio clip plays on lower performance machines, the slider on the audio
controller is not updated as often as it is on higher performance machines. This
will give the slider's movement a "choppy" effect and the audio clip may finish
before the slider reaches the end of the play bar.

Macintosh computers have built-in speakers. These speakers vary in quality and
loudness depending on which Macintosh you have. The speaker quality has
generally improved in later models.

-----------------------------

6. QUICKTIME DISPLAY PROBLEMS
-----------------------------

There are two types of display problems associated with playing QuickTime[ASCII
153] movies in high resolution with thousands (16-bit) or millions (24-bit) of
colors:

- Playing larger QuickTime animations in millions of color may result in odd
  redraw behavior within the animation, where the QuickTime window only
  completely refreshes the screen every few seconds. To solve this problem,
  change your monitor setting to 256-colors. To change your monitors setting,
  select the Apple menu, choose Control Panels, then Monitors. In the Monitors
  dialog box, choose 256 colors.

- When playing QuickTime movies in millions of colors using a high screen
  resolution (832x624 or 1024x768), vertical white lines may appear in some
  video clips. To solve this problem, change your screen resolution to 640x480.
  To change your screen resolution, select the Apple menu, choose Control
  Panels, then Monitors. In the Monitors dialog box choose Options, then
  640x480.

In either case, turning off the QuickTime PowerPlug extension will also correct
these problems. To turn off the QuickTime PowerPlug, select the Apple menu,
choose Control Panels, then Extensions Manager. In the Extensions Manager dialog
box, turn off the QuickTime PowerPlug by clicking it to remove the check mark.

If your Control Panels menu does not list Extensions Manager, you can turn off
QuickTime PowerPlug by opening your Systems Folder, then the Extensions folder.
Drag the QuickTime PowerPlug to the Extensions (disabled) folder.

-----------------------------------

7. WHERE BOOKSHELF SETUP PUTS FILES
-----------------------------------

The Bookshelf Setup program creates folders and copies files to several
locations. When you install Bookshelf '95, the Setup program:

- Creates a folder on your hard disk called "Bookshelf '95" and copies the
  following to it:

     "Bookshelf '95" - the main Bookshelf application.

     "Bookshelf '95 ReadMe" - the document you are reading now.

     "Bookshelf Lexicon" - the file needed to run the automatic
                           spelling feature.

     "SimpleText" - a text editor that allows you to view the ReadMe
                    file.

     "Setup Folder" - the folder that contains files to setup &amp; remove
                      Bookshelf on your hard drive.

     "Microsoft System Information" - a folder with information about
                                      your application and system that
                                      you may need to know should you
                                      require assistance from
                                      Microsoft Product Support
                                      Services.

- Creates a folder called "Bookshelf '95 Preferences" in your System Folder:
  Preferences folder.

- Creates a folder called "Bookshelf '94 Preferences" in your System Folder:
  Preferences folder, which is created to enable Microsoft Works 4.0 to work
  together with Bookshelf '95. This folder will not be created if Bookshelf '94
  is already installed on your system.

- Copies QuickTime PowerPlug to your System Folder: Extensions folder. This is
  only necessary for PowerMac systems; it can be removed from other systems.

- Copies QuickTime 2.0, QuickTime Musical Instruments, and Sound Manager to the
  System Folder: Extensions folder (if needed). These are necessary to play
  video and sound.

- Copies Apple Multimedia Tuner to the System Folder: Extensions folder. This
  allows the multimedia in Bookshelf to run properly.

- Copies Sound Manager Sound control panel to the System Folder: Control Panels
  folder (if needed).

- Copies Times, Arial, Bookshelf Symbol, and Symbol fonts to System Folder. On
  System 7.0 and 7.0.1, these fonts are copied to the System suitcase. On
  System 7.1 or higher these fonts are copied to the Fonts folder.

----------------------

8. CUSTOM INSTALLATION
----------------------

For the majority of users, using the Complete Installation provided in the Setup
program is the best way to install Bookshelf '95.

You may wish to perform a custom installation if you are running System 7.0 or
7.0.1 and don't have the extra hard disk space needed for installation. (See
Section 1 for details.) You may also choose Custom Installation if you would
like to save hard disk space, though this will decrease Bookshelf's
performance.

Custom Installation allows you to install different options than those chosen by
Setup as optimal for your system.

To perform a custom installation of Bookshelf '95:

1. Double-click the "Bookshelf Setup" icon on the Bookshelf '95 CD-ROM.

2. Click the Custom Installation button in the Setup dialog box.

3. In the dialog box containing the Options list, select the items you wish to
  install by clicking the check boxes to add or remove the X, then choose
  Continue to complete the installation.

--------------------------

9. PRINTING FROM BOOKSHELF
--------------------------

Bookshelf '95 does not always print properly with LaserWriter version 7.x
drivers. Problems you may see when printing with these driver versions include:
media items print in black and white instead of grayscale despite proper printer
settings, and sections of text overlap other sections of text. To solve these
problems, we have provided the LaserWriter version 8.2.2 driver on the Bookshelf
'95 CD- ROM.

To install this driver on your system:

1. Open your System Folder and open your Extensions folder.

2. Open the LaserWriter 8.2.2 folder on the Bookshelf '95 CD-ROM.

3. Drag the "LaserWriter 8" file into your Extensions folder, then drag the
  Printer Descriptions folder into your Extensions folder.

4. If this folder already exists on your hard drive, drag the contents of the
  Printer Descriptions folder from the CD into the Printer Descriptions folder
  on your hard drive.

5. Once you have copied these files, select Chooser from the Apple menu.

6. Locate and select the LaserWriter 8 item in the upper-left box within the
  Chooser. You may need to scroll down to find this item.

7. Select your printer in the printer list box.

8. Select Setup, then click the Auto Setup button to have the driver select the
  correct Printer Description file for your printer.

When printing images from within Bookshelf articles on printers supporting only
black and white printing, black bars may appear on the right side of the printed
image. If your printer has a Grayscale option, switching from Black &amp; White
to Grayscale will correct this problem.

------------------

10. KNOWN PROBLEMS
------------------

- Your virus protection software issues warnings during Bookshelf installation.
  Some virus protection software may confuse the Setup program's necessary
  actions with behaviors associated with a virus, possibly disrupting the
  installation process. It is recommended that you disable any virus protection
  software before installing Bookshelf, then re-enable it after the
  installation.

- Some screen saver software may conflict with installation. Some screen
  savers, such as After Dark, are known to conflict with the installer. Turn
  off your screen saver using the Control Panel before installing Bookshelf.

- A dialog box warns that you have an incorrect version of QuickTime or Sound
  Manager installed. During installation, the Setup program checks the versions
  of QuickTime and Sound Manager present on your machine and, if necessary,
  replaces them with newer versions. However, the Setup cannot remove older
  versions if you have renamed them. For example, if you renamed an older
  version of QuickTime "My QuickTime," the Bookshelf Setup would install a
  newer version of QuickTime, but would fail to remove the older version. To
  fix this problem, manually remove the renamed version(s) of these system
  components and restart your Macintosh.

- Special or international characters are copied incorrectly to the Clipboard.
  As a custom bitmap font, the Bookshelf Symbol fonts do not map special or
  international characters correctly to the Macintosh character set. These
  characters appear as inappropriate or non-printing characters when copied to
  an application such as SimpleText. [Note: Special characters appear and print
  correctly in MS Reference fonts when printed from Bookshelf.]

- Failure to eject a non-Bookshelf disc. On some systems, when you launch
  Bookshelf '95 with a non-Bookshelf '95 disc in the CD-ROM drive, the drive
  will not eject that disc for you.

  To get around this problem:
  1. Eject the disc from the Finder by dragging it to the Trash.

  2. Insert the Bookshelf '95 disc into the CD-ROM drive.

- With both Bookshelf 1994 and Bookshelf '95 installed, Quickshelf may try to
  launch Bookshelf 1994, and display a message asking for the Bookshelf 1994
  CD. The actual problem is that the Bookshelf 1994 application is being
  launched instead of Bookshelf '95.

  Solutions:
   - Delete the Bookshelf 1994 application.

     -or-

   - If your Macintosh has multiple hard disks (or partitions) then move the
     Bookshelf 1994 folder (which contains the Bookshelf 1994 application) to
     the same hard disk as the Bookshelf '95 application.
