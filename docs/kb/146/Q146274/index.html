The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, on platform(s):

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to use the SNA Server Clients in MS-DOS and Windows 3.x with
Network Client 3.0 for MS-DOS. However, there are some limitations that affects
the SNA Server Client installation and configuration.


NOTE: The Network Client 3.0 files are located in the \Clients\MSClient directory
on the Windows NT Server compact disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following limitations exist when you use the SNA Server Client in MS- DOS
and Windows 3.x with Network Client 3.0:

- The SNA Server Client does not work if you install the IPX/SPX Compatible
  Transport (NWLink) protocol in Network Client 3.0.

- When you install the SNA Server Windows 3.x Client on a Network Client 3.0
  network operating system, the following error message appears:

  No Windows network Installed

  The SNA Server Client Setup looks for the LANMAN.INI and the NETAPI.DLL files
  when you use a DOS LAN Manager client. However, these two files do not exist
  for Network Client 3.0. To work around this problem, you must copy the
  NETAPI.DLL file from a DOS LAN Manager client installation to the Network
  Client 3.0 directory (usually C:\NET). For additional information on how the
  SNA Server Client determines the network operating system, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q128118 SNA Server Win3.x Client Setup Err Msg: No Windows network...

- The SNA Server Client communicates with the SNA Server using named pipes if
  you select Microsoft Networking as the Client/Server Protocol during Setup.
  However, Network Client 3.0 does not support asynchronous named pipes when
  the Client is running under Enhanced Mode Windows. Therefore, you must run
  Windows in standard mode if you want to communicate with the SNA Server. If
  you run Windows in enhanced mode and start the SNA Server Client, the
  following error message appears:

  SNA Server Error: 546
  Cannot establish connection with SNA Server.

- Network Client 3.0 supports the TCP/IP protocol. Both Network Client and SNA
  Server Client are Winsock compliant. To enable Sockets in Network Client 3.0,
  please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q128751 No "Advanced" button in Client TCP/IP Configuration Box

  Q142062 Unable to Run Win16 Sockets Application under Windows 3.1

  After you enable Sockets, you can configure the SNA Server Client to use
  TCP/IP as the Client/Server Protocol. This allows you to communicate with the
  SNA Server using TCP/IP Sockets instead of name pipes. As a result, you can
  run Windows in enhanced mode. You must configure the SNA Server Client as
  Remote even though you are logging on to the same domain as the SNA Server.
  The IP addresses of the SNA Server is required in the Primary and Backup
  Server fields. If you enter the name of the SNA Server in these fields, SNA
  Server Error 546 appears. If you configure the Client as Local, SNA Server
  Errors 546 and 629 appear.

As an alternative, you can use the DOS LAN Manager client. The limitations listed
above do not apply to the DOS LAN Manager client. The Setup files for the DOS
LAN Manager client is located in the \Clients\Lanman directory on the Windows NT
Server compact disc.
