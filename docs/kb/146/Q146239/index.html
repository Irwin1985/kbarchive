SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a copy of the information in the Admin.doc file included
with Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1 (part 2 of 3).

Note that this article reflects the text of a static document. Therefore, some of
the information in this article may be outdated. For example, as of May 20,
1996, Microsoft no longer maintains support forums on CompuServe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following section is for system administrators who want to install the
updates on:

Multiple computers running Windows 95 A Windows 95 network installation site from
which users can install Windows 95 A network site from which users are running
Windows 95

Notes to Administrators Instruct your users not to click Cancel during Setup, as
doing so can cause Setup to be incomplete. This may be true even though a
message is displayed stating that their system was updated successfully.

If your users do cancel Setup by mistake, they can run Setup again. Your users
might be prompted "Do you want to overwrite the file:" choosing "Yes To All"
will resolve the problem. During Update the Service Pack version of Net.exe is
also copied to Netpwl.exe. This file can be used if Net.exe is overwritten.
Net.exe may be overwritten by network setup while adding or removing network
components.

The Update installation program changes the version of Windows 95 to 4.00.950a.

Removing the update from a computer

All updates except the Password List Update will be removed. The newer Password
List Update must be preserved because the original Password List decryption
program cannot read the new password list. If you would like to uninstall the
Service Pack completely, you should reinstall Windows 95 from

your original upgrade disk over the existing Windows 95 installation.

Users should not attempt to cancel during the uninstall process. Otherwise they
might get a message stating uninstall has completed successfully when actually
uninstall has not completed. If your version of Windows 95 was installed by your
PC Manufacturer (OEM version) and the version shown in the System properties in
Control Panel is

version 4.0.950a, then your PC already has all the core Service Pack 1 files
installed by default. If you install the Service Pack 1 Updates over an OEM
version 4.0.950a, and then uninstall it, the uninstallation routine will remove
all the registry update entries (UPDxxxx) from the updates section. This does
not affect operation of the operating system, and the uninstall will just
replace the files with identical versions. These update

registry keys are not used by the operating system, just by the Update
Information Tool installed as part of the Service Pack and other updated files.
The system version will remain 4.00.950a.

To remove the update from a computer

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click the Install/Uninstall tab, select Windows 95 Service Pack 1, and then
  click Add/Remove.

4. Follow the instructions on your screen.

Updating Multiple Computers Running Windows 95 If your users are running Windows
95 from their hard disks (rather than from a network server), they can update
their computers by double-clicking the Update file. This section explains
several ways to make this file available to your users for easy installation.

There are two versions of the Update file, to provide you with the flexibility to
choose the amount of user interaction required to install the Update:

Setup.exe is located in the \Admin\Componts\Updates\Prompted folder. The user is
required to respond whether they would like to install the update. They also
will be reminded to restart the system after the update has been installed.

Sp1upd.exe is located in the \Admin\Componts\Updates\Silent folder. The user will
see the File Copy interface, but will not be prompted to restart the system. The
updates will take effect after restart.

Note If you are using a server-based setup, or if you are running a shared
installation of Windows 95 on a central server (for example, a remote IPL),

see "Updating Computers that Are Running Windows 95 from a Network Server" later
in this document.

To make it easy for your users to install the Service Pack updates You can use
one of the following methods:

Embed the Update file in an e-mail message that you send to your users. In the
message, instruct them to double-click it.

Copy the Update file from the Service Pack 1 CD to a publicly available folder on
your network server. Then, either you can: Embed a shortcut to the Update file
(on the server) in an e-mail message to

your users, and instruct them to double-click update file, or you can Instruct
your users to connect the folder where you copied the Update file and
double-click the file.

Instruct your users to connect directly to the network server and double- click
the Update file.

Use Microsoft Systems Management Server or another automation tool to distribute
and run the Update file. There is an SMS folder under \Admin\Tools to assist
with the process.

Incorporate the Update file into a network login script, so that when your users
log in to your network, their systems are automatically updated.

Use Apps.ini file and add/remove components. See the Microsoft Windows 95
Resource Kit, Chapter 22, for more information about installing applications.
There is also a sample Apps.ini file in the \Admin\Tools\Infgen\Addon\Extras
folder on the Service Pack CD.

Create a "Run Once" System Policy (Config.pol) on the login server that points to
the Update file you want to run. See the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit,
Chapter 15, for more information about system policies. You should note that the
update will attempt to run once each time a user logs in to the network until
the policy is changed.

Note If your site uses Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Mail shared folders, each
user must reconfigure Microsoft Exchange to use shared folders. For more
information, see the second procedure in "Updating a Single Computer" earlier in
this document.

For more information about the Microsoft Systems Management Server and other
automation tools, see the "Installation" chapter of the Microsoft Windows 95
Resource Kit.

Updating a Windows 95 Network Installation Site

This section explains how to update a Windows 95 network distribution point-a
network server from which users can install Windows 95. After you have updated
the distribution point, future installations of Windows 95 using that network
distribution point will include all the Windows95 Service Pack updates. (If your
site uses shared folders with Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Mail, any future
installations of Windows 95 with Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Mail will be
properly configured to use shared folders.)

To update a Windows 95 network installation site

1. Open the \Admin\Tools\Infinst folder.

2. Double-click the Infinst.exe file.

3. In the Server Path dialog box, type the path to your Windows 95 network
  installation site. Precede the path with two backslashes (\\). For example,
  if your Windows 95 installation site is on a server named Products in a
  shared subdirectory of the Windows directory, you would type:

  " \\Products\Public\Windows " (without the quotation marks)

4. In the Open dialog box, open the \Admin\Componts\Updates\Netsetup folder, and
  then double-click the Updates1.inf file. (Do not double-click the Mapisvc.inf
  file; doing so will cause Infinst.exe to fail.)

Note When machines are installed from the installation site, the users will not
be given the option to uninstall the Service Pack updates.

Updating Computers that Are Running Windows 95 from a Network Server

If your users are running Windows 95 from a network server rather than from

their hard disks, you must use the procedures in this section to update their
systems. (To use the procedures in this section, you must have run Netsetup to
create a Windows 95 distribution directory on the network.)

Note You should follow these instructions only if your users are running Windows

95 from a network server. If your users are running Windows 95 from their hard
disks, see "Updating Multiple Computers Running Windows 95" earlier in

this document.

You should not allow your users to install the Windows Service Pack 1 Updates
using Setup.exe or Sp1upd.exe. This may cause Net.exe to be renamed to
Netpwl.exe, which will prevent users from starting Windows 95.

The following procedure copies all of the Service Pack update files onto your
network server, and then updates your MSbatch.inf file to include the necessary
updates to the Windows 95 registry.

To update a Windows 95 sharepoint (from which users run Windows 95)

1. Have your users shut down their computers. If a user is running Windows 95
  from your network server during the update process, some files might not get
  updated.

2. Open the \Admin\Tools\Infinst folder.

3. Double-click the Infinst.exe file.

4. In the Server Path dialog box, type the path to the directory that contains
  your network installation of Windows 95. Precede the path with two
  backslashes (\\). For example, if your Windows 95 installation is on a server
  named Products in a shared subdirectory of the Windows directory, you would
  type:

  \\Products\Public\Windows

5. In the Open dialog box, open the \Admin\Componts\Updates\Netsetup folder, and
  then double-click the Updates1.inf file. (Do not double-click the Mapisvc.inf
  file; doing so will cause Infinst.exe to fail.)

After updating your Windows 95 network sharepoint, you need to update each user's
computer as well. To do this, have each user run the Sclntupd.exe file.
Sclntupd.exe updates the user's Windows 95 registry and copies Net.exe to their
startup drive. (Net.exe is required for network access when starting Windows 95
from the network.)

Note If your site uses Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Mail shared folders, each
user must reconfigure Microsoft Exchange to use shared folders. For more
information, see "Updating a Single Computer" earlier in this document.

For more information about the Microsoft Systems Management Server and other
automation tools, see the "Installation" chapter of the Microsoft Windows 95
Resource Kit.

Batch Setup Version 2.0

This section explains how to install Batch Setup version 2.0 and describes some
of the features in this version of Batch Setup. For more information about
creating scripts for Windows 95 Setup, see Chapter 5 of the Microsoft

Windows 95 Resource Kit.

To install Batch Setup version 2.0

1. On the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 CD, open the \Admin\Tools\Batch folder.

2. Double click Setup.exe, and then follow the instructions on your screen.

Batch Setup version 2.0 includes the following new features:

You can have Batch Setup scan your Windows 95 registry and create an .inf file
based on your current settings. For more information about which registry
settings Batch Setup can retrieve, search Batch Setup Help.

You can now specify which protocol to make the default from within the Batch
Setup program.

More settings are available to configure File and Print Services for Microsoft
Networks or File and Print Services for NetWare networks.

Administrators can now choose whether to disable the Netcard Resource Conflict
Resolution Wizard during setup. (This option is disabled by default.)

With one click, you can enable or disable all optional components in a single
area.

Batch Setup finds user-level security settings.

Locates client TCP/IP settings (for example, DNS servers).

INF Generator Tool

This section describes how to install the INF Generator Tool. The INF Generator
utility can be used to assist in preparing for automatic installation of Windows
95 in the corporate networking environment. Using this utility, you can specify
separate settings for the company, the department, and the individual user when
installing Windows95. This is especially useful when static TCP/IP configuration
settings are used rather

than automatic Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) configuration. For more
information, see Infgndoc.doc in the \Admin\Tools\Infgen folder.

To install the INF Generator Tool

1. Create a new folder on your hard disk (for example, named Infgen.)

2. Copy the following items from the \Admin\Tools\Infgen folder to the newly
  created folder:

     Infgen.exe

     Infgen2.exe

     Options.dat

     User.inf

     Addon folder and all its contents and subfolders

Windows NT Server Management Tools for Windows 95

Windows 95 Service Pack 1 provides a set of tools that system administrators can
use to manage Windows NT(tm) servers from a Windows 95 desktop. The set includes
the basic Windows NT Server tools (Server Manager, User Manager, and Event
Viewer). These tools run only with Windows

95 and can be used only in conjunction with Windows NT servers.

To install the NT Server Management Tools on a computer running Windows 95

1. Make sure drive C has at least 2.5 MB of free space.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs, and then click the
  Windows Setup tab.

3. Click Have Disk, and then specify the \Admin\Tools\Servmgmt folder.

4. Select the Windows NT Server Tools box.

5. Click Install. The Windows NT Server Tools will be copied to the C:\Srvtools
  directory.

6. If you anticipate running the Windows NT Server Tools from the Run dialog
  box, or from the MS-DOS(tm) command prompt, edit the Path= command in the
  Autoexec.bat file so that it includes the C:\Srvtools directory, and then
  restart your computer so that the new Path setting can take effect.

For information about using Windows NT Server Tools, see the Srvtools.txt
document, which is located in the \Admin\Tools\ServMgmt folder.

INF Installer Tool

The INF Installer tool, Infinst.exe, can be used to integrate .inf files and
related files from the various tools directories in the Admin directory

on the Windows 95 CD. This is an updated version from the one that shipped with
the Windows 95 CD or the Windows 95 Resource Kit and should be used instead of
the older version.

To install the INF Installer

Copy the Infinst.exe file to your hard disk from the \Admin\Tools\Infinst
folder.

Using the INF Installer

Infinst.exe is a tool that is used to add various external components, such

as MSNDS or MSDLC32, into a network installation of Windows 95 and (optionally )
force the installation of the components using a batch script. INFINST
accomplishes this by integrating the .inf files of the external components into
the network installation tree of Windows 95 and by

updating the MSbatch.inf file located in the root of the Server-based Setup

directory.

In addition to MSbatch.inf, INFINST also modifies the Layout.inf and Custom.inf
files in the Server-based Setup directory. This prevents the user from having to
make manual modifications in most instances and insures

that the installation of an external component is successful.

If the component being integrated is an application, an entry is added to the
[Optional Components] section of MSbatch.inf. If the component is a network
service, then the Services entry in the [Network] section of MSbatch.inf is
updated with the newly added service.

Consult Appendix D of the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit for information

about the entries in the batch INF setup scripts.

More Information The following example is a step-by-step procedure for using
Infinst.exe to

add an external component to a Server-based Setup of Windows 95:

1. Create a network installation of Windows 95, which is more commonly referred
  to as a Server-based setup. This can be accomplished by using the NETSETUP
  utility located on the Windows 95 CD in the Admin\Nettools\Netsetup
  directory. NETSETUP must be run before INFINST can be used. For more
  information about Server-based Setup, see the main Server-based Setup topic
  in the Windows 95 Resource Kit Help file (Win95rk.hlp).

2. Run Infinst.exe, located in the \Admin\Tools\Infinst subdirectory on the
  Windows 95 Service Pack CD.

3. Click the Set Path button and type the path to the location of the
  Server-based Setup directory created in step 1. This will tell INFINST where
  to copy the external component files, as well as the location of the
  MSbatch.inf file that needs to be modified.

4. Click the Install INF button and change to the location of the external
  component directory. For example, if you were installing MSDLC32, you would
  change to the location of the MSDLC32 files located on the Service Pack CD in
  the Admin\Componts\MSDLC32 subdirectory.

5. Select the appropriate INF file for the component being installed, and then
  click OK. Again using MSDLC32 as an example, the file to highlight would be
  Netdlc32.inf (Rename Netdlc32.sbs to Netdlc32.inf first). Clicking OK will
  copy and modify the necessary files to integrate MSDLC32 into a Server- based
  installation of Windows 95.

Note
Although MSDLC32 was used in the above example, you should still refer to the
documentation included with the MSDLC32 component for Server-based setup
information. The above information is only an example of using Infinst.exe and
might not contain all the necessary information for a successful automated
install.
