SUMMARY
=======

This article contains the Frequently Asked Questions for the Microsoft Windows
Internet Information Server (IIS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

QUESTION:

Am I required to type the header, "http://", for a Web file open request from the
client browsers that are included with the Microsoft Internet Information
Server?

ANSWER:

No. The default file open header, "http://", is used on the Microsoft Internet
Explorer client browsers. This means that on you can simply type in the
destination address, such as "www.microsoft.com", and the default web request
header, "http://", will be added automatically.

QUESTION:

Can I install the Microsoft Internet Information Server over the Microsoft
Windows NT FTP service?

ANSWER:

Microsoft recommends that you remove the installation of Microsoft Windows NT FTP
service before installing the Microsoft Internet Information Server FTP service.
For more information see Knowledge Base article Q142555.

QUESTION:

How can I test my installation of the Microsoft Internet Information Server

World Wide Web Service on my local LAN?

ANSWER:

The default installation of the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)

contains sample files that can be used to test the functionality of your IIS WWW
publication service.

- Ensure your computer has an active connection to your local LAN and that your
  name resolution is working properly.

- Make sure the WWW service is started by opening Microsoft Internet Service
  Manager and verifying State is "Running".

- Start the Microsoft Internet Explorer.

- Click on File, Open or use the File Open icon on the toolbar.

- Type in the Uniform Resource Location (URL) for the home directory of your
  new server. The URL will be "http://" followed by the NetBIOS name of your
  server. For example if your server is called, "myserver" you would type:

  http://myserver

- You should see a sample HTML page. If not you may be publishing from a
  previous installation directory. In that case use the full path to access the
  sample page such as:

  http://myserver/samples.

For more information see Knowledge Base article Q142556.

QUESTION:

Can I run the Microsoft Internet Information Server on the Windows NT Shell

Technology Preview?

ANSWER:

The Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 has not been thoroughly tested for
use on the Microsoft Windows NT Shell Technology Preview. Microsoft does not
recommend the use of the Internet Information Server 1.0

running on the Microsoft Windows NT Shell Technology Preview in a production
environment. For more information see Knowledge Base article Q142713.

QUESTION:

When I attempt an Anonymous HTTP connection to my Microsoft Internet Information
Server World Wide Web service my client browser receives the following error:

  HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (Logon failure: the user has not been granted

  the requested logon type at this computer. )

ANSWER:

Frequently this error means an that your anonymous user does not have local

logon rights. To resolve this problem:

- In the Microsoft Internet Service Manager open the WWW Service Properties.

- Verify the Anonymous Logon Username and Password.

- Verify that the username and password in the WWW Service Properties has an
  identical username and password used in User Manager.

- Run User Manager to verify the local logon rights for your designated
  anonymous user. -or-

- Run the Microsoft Internet Service Manager to change your anonymous logon
  user to an account that does have local logon rights. Verifying the same
  username and password as used in User Manager. For more information see
  Knowledge Base article Q142715.

QUESTION:

How can I add mime types to the Microsoft Internet Information Server?

ANSWER:

Mime types allow files to be opened by "helper" applications on web browser

clients, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. Currently, mime types for Internet
Information Server (IIS) must be added manually to the registry. Mime entries
can be added to the following registry location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\InetInfo\MimeMap

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk. Note that a helper application may
have to be configured on the client as well.

For more information see Knowledge Base article Q142558, and the Microsoft
Internet Information Server help file, INETMGR.HLP.

QUESTION:

Is UNICODE supported on the Microsoft Internet Information Server?

ANSWER:

UNICODE is not currently supported on the Microsoft Internet Information Server.

If you save an HTM file from Notepad or any other editor that supports Unicode
you may see strange characters on your browser when accessing that specific
page.

Be sure to select Save as, Save File as Type, Text Files (*.txt), when
editing/saving any HTM file for use on the Microsoft Internet Information Server
from Notepad. For more information see Knowledge Base article Q142605.

QUESTION:

When I use the Internet Explorer version 1.5 to access my IIS server I receive
the following error:

  Error: Authentication is required for this document. The server did
  not specify a supported authentication method."

How can I resolve this issue?

ANSWER:

A potential cause is that you have set the Password Authentication on the
Microsoft Internet Information Server to a level that is not supported on your
Internet Explorer client. The Windows NT Internet Explorer 1.5 Client currently
supports Anonymous and Basic Authentication. Install the Windows 95 Internet
Explorer 2.0 Client for Windows NT Challenge/Response Authentication. For more
information see Knowledge Base article Q142702.

QUESTION:

When I attempt to configure services in Internet Server Manager, the following
error message appears:

  The service has not been started.

ANSWER:

Stopped services cannot be configured in Internet Server Manager because
configuration is done through the server's RPC interface, which is only
available when the service is running. Start the service in question. If
configuration changes are made, choose Apply to make the new settings take
effect. For more information see Knowledge Base article Q140049.

QUESTION:

How can I use the Internet Explorer FTP client to PUT a file to an IIS server?

ANSWER:

You cannot find a PUT option in Internet Explorer. You can successfully download
files using the FTP option from Internet Explorer but you cannot upload files to
a remote FTP server. Internet Explorer, like many other Web

browsers, does not currently have FTP PUT capability. Use a standard FTP program
to write files to a remote FTP server. For more information see Knowledge Base
article Q142851.

QUESTION:

When I use my FTP browser client, I am unable to see virtual directories created
in Internet Server Manager for the FTP service even though I have permissions to
access the directory. How can I resolve this issue?

ANSWER:

Internet Information Server does not have this capability at this time. To
resolve this issue, discover the names of the directories on the FTP server

and use the change directory command (CD) to access these directories.

-or-

From a Microsoft Internet Explorer Client, use the alias name associated with the
virtual directory to gain access. For example:

  FTP://myserver/virdir

where "virdir" is the name of the alias assigned to an FTP virtual directory. For
more information see Knowledge Base article Q142853.

QUESTION:

Does the Microsoft Internet Information Server provide an Unattended Setup
option?

ANSWER:

Microsoft Internet Information Server does provides an option for unattended
setup mode. By using a small script, you can set up multiple information servers
quickly and easily. You can customize the unattended setup for several servers
or to provide a simple process for over-the- network installations for Internet
Explorer users. To customize the unattended setup, the file, UNATTEND.TXT,
(located on the Internet Server compact disc) must first be copied to your hard
drive and modified to meet your configuration requirements. The file contains
more specific instructions on what values are configurable. To start unattended
mode Setup, at the command prompt, first change to the directory containing
both

the SETUP.EXE and UNATTEND.TXT. Then, type:

  SETUP -B UNATTEND.TXT

For more information see Knowledge Base article Q142860.

QUESTION:

How can I create HTML documents to use on my Microsoft Internet Information

Server for WWW publications?

ANSWER:

HTML Documents for WWW servers can be written on any text editor as long as

you know the proper HTML syntax. However, HTML documents can be easily produced
using an HTML editor such as Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word. Internet
Assistant for Microsoft Word is available on www.microsoft.com. There are also
numerous shareware HTML editors available on the Internet. For more information
see Knowledge Base article Q143152.

QUESTION:

I cleared the Allow Anonymous Connection check box and disabled the use of the
guest account for FTP (as recommended in IIS setup). Now, any request to access
the FTP server from an Internet Explorer client results in the following error
message:

  The attempt to load 'ftp//servername' failed.

If I use a Command Prompt based client, I am able to login using a Windows NT
username and password. How can I resolve this issue?

ANSWER:

As a workaround the user should enter a URL similar to the following to access a
non-guest, non-anonymous IIS FTP server:

  FTP://username:password@myserver.com

where:

  "username" is the Windows NT user account name
  "password" is the NT password associated with the user account name
  "myserver.com" is the name of the NT server

WARNING: FTP usernames and passwords are sent across the network in clear text.
When the IIS administrator has cleared the Allow Anonymous Connection

check box or the Allow Only Anonymous Connections check box, Windows NT usernames
and passwords are sent to the server without encryption. These options are
enabled by default for security reasons.
