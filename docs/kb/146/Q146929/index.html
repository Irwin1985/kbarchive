-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A foreign message transfer agent (MTA), for example, the Olivetti MTA, may be
unable to correlate a read receipt (also known as a read notification [RN]) back
to the original message. For example, this may occur with a message sent from
Microsoft Exchange Server to a foreign MTA by means of a 1984 X.400 Connector.

CAUSE
=====

The read receipt sent by Microsoft Exchange Server does not include the ORName
within the reported IPMessageId if this ORName is part of the original message.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the foreign MTA allows it, configure the MTA to not include the ORName in the
IPMessageId.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service

MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the CITT's 1984 X series of recommendations (also known as the Red
Book), this behavior does not conform to the 1984 X.420 recommendations.
Recommendation X.420, p. 192,states that the IPMessageId is made up of the
following two components:

  ORNameOPTIONAL
  PrintableString

Even though the ORName is an optional part in the IPMessageId, it must be
included in the read receipt?s reported IPMessageId. The reported IPMessageId
must contain the IPMessageId as it was originally sent. Recommendation X.420,
4.2.2.3, Table6.X.420, page 203, concerning components of the interpersonal
messaging (IPM) status report user agent protocol data unit (SR-UAPDU), states:

  This is the same identifier conveyed in the IM-UAPDU [IP-message user agent
  protocol data unit] to which the report refers. Exchange does not include the
  ORName into the reported IPMessageId but only sends back the
  PrintableString.

For more information about SR-UAPDUs and read receipts, see the following
sections of the Red Book:

  SR-UAPDU: Rec X.420, 3.3, page 190
  Receipt Notification: Rec X.420, 4.2.2.3, page 202

The Olivetti MTA is manufactured by Olivetti, a vendor independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
