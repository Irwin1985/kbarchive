SUMMARY
=======

The Import text files require a specific format. The first line should contain
the header, followed by lines of data to import. The header defines the contents
of each field on the data line. The import file can contain an unlimited number
of data lines. This article describes the required header fields of an import
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first field in the header line contains the properties from the schema. The
schema is a collection of properties for objects in the directory. When you
create a recipient with directory import, the following fields are required:

Column Heading  Description                    Valid Values
--------------  -----------------------------  ----------------------

Obj-Class       The type or class of object    Mailbox = mailbox
               that is being created,         Distribution List = dl
               deleted or modified. This      Custom Recipient =
               must be the first field.        remote

Mode            A required field for           Create
               specifying if the object is    Delete
               to be created, deleted or      Modify
               modified. If this field is     Update
               used, it must be the second
               field. If this field is not
               used, then the default is
               Update. This means that the
               object will be created if it
               does not exist and modified
               if it does exist.

Directory Name  The unique directory name of
               the object to be created,
               deleted, or modified.

NOTE: The Home-Server attribute is required for mailbox objects and the e-mail
address attribute is required for remote objects.

All additional fields in the header are properties of the modified object. By
default, all fields are separated by commas, and each line ends with a carriage
return and a line feed. If a field contains a comma, the data must be in double
quotation marks (").

Some fields are multi-valued. For example, the distribution list object has a
member property which can have multiple members. In an import file, these
multiple members are included in the same field, separated by percent (%)
signs.

The first data line creates a distribution list with distribution lists as
members. You can also populate a distribution list with members that are not
created in the directory. If the members are created at a later time, they are
automatically added to the appropriate distribution list.

Import files are in .CSV or comma-separated format. This format is read by
database programs, such as Microsoft Access, or spreadsheet programs, such as
Microsoft Excel. You can use sorting features to minimize the effort of creating
and editing import files. For more information, see the Microsoft Exchange
Server Programmer's Guide.
