- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing one of the custom applications located in the Exchsrvr\Samples
directory on the Microsoft Exchange Server, a client will receive the following
error message when attempting to use one of these forms:

  Unable to open &lt;form name&gt; Form&lt;s&gt; because some files are missing
  on your machine. The Microsoft Forms Designer tool must be installed.

This error occurs even though a dialog box was displayed telling the client that
the form has been installed on the computer.


CAUSE
=====

When a form is installed on a client computer, only the main executable is
installed. Any supporting DLLs will need to be installed on the client computer
by running the Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer (EFD) Setup program.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two methods of installing the supporting DLLs without having to keep
the Microsoft Exchange EFD installed on the computer.

The first is to run the Microsoft Exchange EFD Setup program on the client
computer and then re-run Setup and choose Remove All. This will uninstall the
Microsoft Exchange EFD, however, the supporting DLLs will remain, as they are
considered shared components and are not removed.

To install the EFD run time for Outlook 2000:

1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click to open Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click to select Microsoft Office 2000 Premium, and then click Add/Remove
  features.

4. Click the plus sign next to Microsoft Outlook for Windows.

5. Click the down arrow next to Electronic Forms Designer runtime, and then
  click "Run from my computer".

6. Click Update Now.

The second method is to manually copy over the needed files from a computer that
has the Microsoft Exchange EFD installed. The necessary files are:

  Dao2516.dll
  Msajt200.dll
  Vaen21.olb
  Msjeterr.dll
  Vbajet.dll
  Msjetint.dll
  Vbdb16.dll

Copy these seven files into the &lt;winroot&gt;\System directory on Windows 95 or
Windows 3.x and to the &lt;winroot&gt;\System32 on Windows NT.

NOTE: Installing the 16-bit version of Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 will also place
these files on the client computer.

You will then need to run Regsvr.exe (located in the Support\EFDSetup directory
on the CD) with the following parameters to register the 16-bit Microsoft Jet
DAO Library:

  "REGSVR.EXE /S DA02516.DLL" (without the quotation marks)

STATUS
