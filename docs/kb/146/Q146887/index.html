-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following are recommended recovery options for Windows NT 4.0 computers with
Service Pack 3 installed:

- Run an Emergency Repair with an Emergency Repair Disk that was created after
  installing Service Pack 3

- Use the Uninstall feature available in the Update.exe in the Service Pack

- Run an Emergency Repair with the Repair folder on the boot drive

The following methods can be modified to repair an installation:

- Upgrade of Windows NT 4.0 over Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 installed.
  For example, when the system restarts after the text-mode portion of Setup is
  complete, choose the Upgrade option rather than the New or Repair options.

- Emergency Repair using an Emergency Repair Disk created prior to Service Pack
  3.

Due to changes in the Registry Security Hive, the Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll, and
Winlogon.exe have changed and previous versions of these files cannot access
Windows NT system security information. If pre-Service Pack 3 versions of these
files are present, you receive a stop screen with the stop code 0xC00000DF. (IE:
The specified domain name does not exist)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using an ERD Created After Installing the Service Pack
------------------------------------------------------

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 contains a modified Setup.log file that lets you
recover a Windows NT Server or Workstation installation after software failure.
If the system is in an unbootable state, you must use an Emergency Repair Disk
created after installing Service Pack 3 with the RDISK command. For more
information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q156328
  TITLE : Description of Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk

NOTE: To use the Emergency Repair Disk utility, you must have the updated version
of Setupdd.sys. The updated version is contained in Service Pack 2 (as well as
this Service Pack.) To update your version of Setupdd.sys, you must copy
Setupdd.sys from the Service Pack to your installation disk 2. This replaces the
previous version of Setupdd.sys with the updated version. For more information,
please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q168015
  TITLE : Files Not Replaced When Running Emergency Repair

Repairing the Windows NT installation using this disk recovers the system to a NO
SERVICE PACK installation.

This ensures recoverability for users where the system has become unstable after
the application of the Service Pack. If a Service Pack is required, it must be
reapplied when the Emergency Repair is completed and the system has rebooted.

This method should only be used if the system is in an unbootable state. The
following Service Pack 3 files remain after the system has been returned to a
basic Windows NT 4.0 state so that Windows NT can read and utilize the new
Security hives:

  Samlib.dll
  Samsrv.dll
  Winlogon.exe

Uninstalling the Service Pack
-----------------------------

If an administrator can log onto the computer and run an application, then rerun
the Service Pack Update utility and uninstall the Service Pack. This is always
the preferred method of recovery. When using the uninstall feature, the computer
is restored to the system configuration as it was directly before applying the
Service Pack. If the computer hangs during startup, this is not a viable
option.

Repairing the System Files and the System and Security Hives
------------------------------------------------------------

If the computer is unbootable and there is a pre-Service Pack 3 Emergency Repair
Disk, you must choose to repair the system files and the System and Security
hives. An alternative method is to use the Repair folder by running Emergency
Repair and selecting the option for no Emergency Repair Disk. If RDISK has not
been run after the application of Service Pack 3, you must choose to repair the
System and Security hives or follow the procedure outlined below in order to
alter the Setup.log file:

Modify the contents of the Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) by doing the following:

1. Remove the attributes from the Setup.log file by typing the following at the
  command prompt:

  "attrib -r -h -s a:\SETUP.LOG" (without the quotation marks)

2. Add the following lines under the [Files.WinNt] section of the Setup.log
  file:

  \Winnt\System32\Samsrv.dll = "samsrv.dll","30fde","\","nt40 repair
  disk","samsrv.dll"
  \Winnt\System32\Samlib.dll = "samlib.dll","18010","\","nt40 repair
  disk","samlib.dll"
  \Winnt\System32\Winlogon.exe = "winlogon.exe","2d0bb","\","nt40 repair
  disk","winlogon.exe"

  NOTE: \Winnt represents the folder where Windows NT is installed.

3. Copy Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll, and Winlogon.exe from the Windows NT 4.0 Service
  Pack 3 media to the root folder of the Emergency Repair Disk.

4. Restart your computer with the three Windows NT 4.0 Setup disks.

5. Select "R" to Repair your Windows NT installation.

6. Select "Verify Windows NT System Files" and continue.

7. If prompted to insert Windows NT setup disk 4, press ESC to continue with the
  Repair process.

8. After you replace Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll, and Winlogon.exe with the files
  from Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3, press F3 to exit Repair.

9. Reboot the computer and restart Windows NT.

"Upgrading" Windows NT 4.0 Over Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack
----------------------------------------------------------------

If the computer is unable to boot and the repair process fails or you do not have
an Emergency Repair Disk or a CD-ROM drive, you must perform an upgrade of
Windows NT 4.0 over Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. Please follow these steps to
do this:

1. Copy the i386 folder from the original Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the hard disk
  of the target system if FAT, or to a network share if NTFS. In this folder,
  rename the following files. Copy these same three files to the I386 directory
  from the Service Pack 3 source. The goal is for the upgrade to be done using
  these 3 files from Service Pack 3.

  Samsrv.dl_ to Samsrv.org
  Samlib.dl_ to Samlib.org
  Winlogon.ex_ to Winlogon.org

2. Choose the correct procedure below based on your file system:

   - If the file system is FAT and the i386 folder is on the local hard disk,
     perform the following steps:

     a. Boot to MS-DOS and run WINNT /B from the i386 folder.

     b. Choose the Upgrade option during the on the first boot into GUI mode.

   - If the install source location is remote and the local file system is FAT,
     you must either install Windows with networking enabled, or create an
     installation boot disk off the Windows NT Server CD-ROM, connect to the
     modified i386 folder, and then run WINNT /B.

   - If the file system is NTFS, you must create a parallel install in a new
     folder and then run WINNT32 /B from the modified i386 folder.

When the Samsrv.dll, Samlib.dll, and Winlogon.exe files do not match during
logon, users receive a stop screen with the stop code 0xC00000DF. This can be
seen after you upgrade Windows NT 4.0 over Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or if
the System and Security hives were not repaired when using an Emergency Repair
Disk created prior to the application of Service Pack 3. In order to repair
installations in this state, please see the following article(s) in the
