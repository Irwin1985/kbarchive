MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Practice Exam Answer Key Is Incorrect
---------------------------------------------

The questions in the Practice Exam do not link to the correct answers when you
press the Learn Now button. This affects both the individual copies of this
title as well as the Core Readiness Review set of books.

The book includes all of the questions contained on the CD. You can refer to the
book rather than the CD for the correct answers, or you can order a fixed
replacement CD by calling 1-800-MSPRESS.

A service pack that will correct this problem is also available from Self Test
Software. You can download Svcpk073.exe from the support link at:

http://www.selftestsoftware.com/shop/


Page 48: Answer To Question 70-073.02.01.002 Should Be D, Not B
---------------------------------------------------------------

Page 47, Question 70-073.02.01.002:

The question allows for additional memory. Therefore, the second group of ten
Windows 95 computers can be upgraded. This brings the total number of
upgradeable machines to 25.

Page 48:

Change Answer B to:
"Incorrect: More than fifteen computers meet the minimum hardware requirements
for a Windows NT Workstation installation, without purchasing any new hardware
besides memory."

Change Answer C to:
"Incorrect: More than twenty computers meet the minimum hardware requirements for
a Windows NT Workstation installation, without purchasing any new hardware
besides memory."

Change Answer D to:
"Correct: Twenty-five computers meet the minimum hardware requirements without
purchasing any new hardware besides memory. The first group of ten Windows NT
Workstation 3.51 computers meets the hardware requirements, the second group of
ten Window 95 computers meets the hardware requirements after the purchase of
additional memory, the third group of five Windows 95 computers meets the
hardware requirements, and the fourth group of five MS-DOS workstations does not
have a CD-ROM drive. Since the computers are not on a network, a network
installation cannot be performed for the computers without a CD-ROM drive."

Change Answer E to:
"Less than thirty computers meet the minimum hardware requirements for a Windows
NT Workstation installation. Five computers do not have a CD-ROM drive."


Pages 65 &amp; 66: 70-073.02.02.001, WINNT32 Should Be Used Instead Of WINNT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WINNT command is used to install Windows NT Workstation on a computer
currently running a 16-bit Windows operating system, such as Windows 3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups 3.1, MS-DOS, or Windows 95. Therefore, none of the
answers to question 70-073.02.02.001 are correct.

On pages 65, change Answer D from:
"D. You should install Windows NT Workstation 4.0 using WINNT32 /U and assign a
unique computer name to the 4.0 installation."

To:
"D. You should install Windows NT Workstation 4.0 using WINNT32 and assign a
unique computer name to the 4.0 installation."

On page 66, change the explanations for each answer:

Answer A from:
"A. Incorrect: While you should install Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively
using the WINNT command, you should not assign the computer name MYWORK. Since
both the Windows NT Workstation 3.51 installation and the Windows NT Workstation
4.0 installation are members of the same domain, they must have different
computer names."

To:
"A. Incorrect: You must install the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively
using the WINNT32 command, not the WINNT command. In addition, you should not
assign the computer name MYWORK. Since both the Windows NT Workstation 3.51
installation and the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 installation are members of the
same domain, they must have different computer names."

Answer B from:
"B. Incorrect: You must install the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively
using the WINNT command, not the WINNT32 /U (unattended setup) command. In
addition, you should not assign the computer name MYWORK. Since both the Windows
NT Workstation 3.51 installation and the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 installation
are members of the same domain, they must have different computer names."

To:
"B. Incorrect: You must install the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively
using the WINNT32 command, not the WINNT32 /U (unattended setup) command. In
addition, you should not assign the computer name MYWORK. Since both the Windows
NT Workstation 3.51 installation and the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 installation
are members of the same domain, they must have different computer names."

Answer C from:
"C. Correct: You must install the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively using
the WINNT command, and you must assign a unique computer name when both the
Windows NT Workstation 3.51 installation and the Windows NT Workstation 4.0
installation are members of the same domain."

To:
"C. Incorrect: You must install the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively
using the WINNT32 command. However, assigning a unique computer name when both
the Windows NT Workstation 3.51 installation and the Windows NT Workstation 4.0
installation are members of the same domain is correct."

Answer D from:
"D. Incorrect: You must install the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively
using the WINNT command, not the WINNT32 /U command. However, assigning a unique
computer name when both the Windows NT Workstation 3.51 installation and the
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 installation are members of the same domain is
correct."

To:
"D. Correct: You must install the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 interactively using
the WINNT32 command, and you must assign a unique computer name when both the
Windows NT Workstation 3.51 installation and the Windows NT Workstation 4.0
installation are members of the same domain."


Page 112: "D" Is Correct
------------------------

The correct answer is "D" but the wording for the correct answer is listed under
"B". The order of the answers needs to be changed so that the letters match up
with the correct text.

Corrected text should read:

Correct Answer: D

A. Incorrect: There is no way to convert an HPFS partition to FAT; the CONVERT
utility only converts an HPFS (or FAT) partition to NTFS. In addition, the WINNT
setup program is used to install Windows NT on a computer running Windows 95 or
MS-DOS. Since your computer is running Windows NT Workstation 3.51, you should
use the WINNT32 setup program.

B. Incorrect: There is no way to convert an HPFS partition to FAT; the CONVERT
utility only converts an HPFS (or FAT) partition to NTFS. However, since your
computer is running Windows NT Workstation 3.51, you should use the WINNT32
setup program.

C. Incorrect: Using the CONVERT utility to convert the partition to NTFS is the
correct way to convert the HPFS partition. However, the WINNT setup program is
used to install Windows NT on a computer running Windows 95 or MS-DOS. Since
your computer is running Windows NT Workstation 3.51, you should use the WINNT32
setup program.

D. Correct: Using the CONVERT utility to convert the partition to NTFS is the
correct way to convert the HPFS partition. Since your computer is running
Windows NT Workstation 3.51, you should use the WINNT32 setup program. To retain
desktop settings, configuration settings, and file system security attributes,
you must install Windows NT Workstation 4.0 in the same folder where Windows NT
3.51 was installed.


Page 164: Correct Answer Should Be C
------------------------------------

On page 164, the correct answer should be C. Change Answer C to read:

"C. Correct: While default user profiles are created when Windows NT Workstation
users log on for the first time, and you have created a logon script to
configure user network and printer connections for Windows 3.11 users, no steps
have been taken to prevent Windows NT Workstation and Windows 3.11 users from
changing their configurations."


Pages 165 &amp; 166: Typo In Question 70-073.03.02.006
--------------------------------------------------

Pages 165 and 166, Question 70-073.03.02.006, second paragraph:

Change:
"The required result is to configure the network environment for Windows NT
Workstation and Windows 3.1 clients each time they log on to the network."

To:
"The required result is to configure the network environment for Windows NT
Workstation and Windows 3.11 clients each time they log on to the network."


Page 166: Correct Answer Should Be B
------------------------------------

On page 166, the correct answer should B. Change Answer B to read:

"B. Correct: Default user profiles are created when Windows NT Workstation users
log on for the first time, a logon script is created to configure user network
and printer connections for Winodws 3.11 users, and profiles are configured to
prevent Windows NT Workstation users from changing their configurations."


Page 176: Correct Answer Should Be B
------------------------------------

On page 176, the correct answer should be B. Please modify answers A and B to
read as follows:

"A. Incorrect: The second optional result is not achieved. Because of the Read
permission assigned to the Everyone system group, users will not be able to
create new files in the \Bank folder after it is copied. In order to allow users
to create files in the folder, Add and Read permissions must be assigned to the
Everyone system group in order for users to create new files in the \Bank folder
after it is copied. The Full Control permission assigned to Creator Ownership
only ensures that you will be able to access and change files you have created
in the \Bank folder, it does not assign anyone any permission, such as Add, to
the \Bank folder.

B. Correct: Copying the \BANK folder to the \WEDGE folder on the server
automatically provides Full Control permission to the Everyone system group for
the \Wedge folder. Sharing the \BANK folder on the server and setting permission
so the Everyone system group has Read permission prevents other users from
changing files in the \BANK folder, but allows them to read the files. The
second optional result is not achieved, please see the explanation for answer
A."


Page 240: Explanation For Answer D Is Incorrect
-----------------------------------------------

On Page 240, the explanation for Answer D is incorrect.

Change:
"D. Incorrect: The default tree and context is only specified when setting up
Client Services for NetWare (CSNW). When running Gateway Service for NetWare
(GSNW), there is no need to specify the default tree and context."

To:
"D. Incorrect: A preferred server is specified in the Client Service for NetWare
dialog box when configuring Client Services for NetWare (CSNW). When running
Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW), the preferred server must be specified in
the Gateway Service for NetWare dialog box."


Pages 289 &amp; 299: Reference To Chapter 2 Should Be Changed To Chapter 8
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 289, first reference, first sentence:

Change:
"Microsoft Windows NT Technical Support Self-Paced Training Chapter 2..."

To:
"Microsoft Windows NT Technical Support Self-Paced Training Chapter 8..."

Page 299:

Change:
"The Microsoft Windows NT Technical Support volume of the Microsoft Windows NT
Technical Support Training kit Chapter 2..."

To:
"The Microsoft Windows NT Technical Support volume of the Microsoft Windows NT
Technical Support Training kit Chapter 8..."


Page 319: The Table Lists Disk Counters, Not Processor Counters
---------------------------------------------------------------

Page 319, first paragraph, last sentence:

Change:
"The most commonly used processor counters are:"

To:
"The most commonly used disk counters are:"


Page 336: Explanation For Answer D Is Incorrect
-----------------------------------------------

On page 336, the explanation for answer D is incorrect.

Change:
"D. Correct: One of the advantages of using a volume set is the ability to
combine free disk space from several areas, including different types of hard
disks. Since you have not combined the disks into one volume set, you have not
optimized performance for optimum throughput, which is the required result to
the problem."

To:
"D. Correct: One of the advantages of using a volume set is the ability to
combine free disk space from several areas, including different types of hard
disks. However, volume sets do not improve performance, so you have not
optimized performance for optimum throughput, which is the required result to
the problem."


Pages 409 and 410: Condition A Should be "share permission", Not "NTFS permission"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 409 and 410, under question 70-073.07.05.004,

Change:
"A. The NTFS permission on the \MKTG folder is set to Read Only."

To:
"A. The share permission on the \MKTG folder is set to Read Only."


Error Message: Tests Have Expired
---------------------------------

After the date 9/9/99, you may receive a message box stating the following:

  Tests Have Expired. Contact Customer Service.

Once you click OK, the test splash screen appears. You can start and run all
facets of the test without any error.

This error message is incorrect. The tests have not expired and you should be
able to perform them without error.
