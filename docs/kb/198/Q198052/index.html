-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running the Visual Basic 5.0 Setup Wizard, you receive the following
warning message:

  &lt; Project Name &gt; - Setup Wizard - Out of Date Dependencies
  The dependency file for the following component(s) is out of date.
  You should exit the wizard now and rebuild each of the dependency files for
  these components, using this wizard.

NOTE: You can choose to ignore this for now by clicking Next, but your setup and
application may not work correctly.

When running the Visual Basic 6.0 Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW), you
receive the following warning message:

  Out-of-Date Dependency Information
  The wizard found dependency information for the listed files, but the
  information is out of date. To proceed with the out-of-date information,
  click OK.

CAUSE
=====

Each component listed below the warning message has a dependency (.dep) file
that contains information about all the files required by that component.
However, the version number of the component as specified in the .dep file does
not match the version number of the component itself.

In other words, the .dep file was created for a different version of the
component, so the wizard is unable to determine which files the component
requires.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the indicated file comes from a third party, contact that party for the
updated .dep files.

If the indicated file is a Visual Basic component that you created, follow these
steps to create a .dep file:

1. Restart the Setup Wizard or PDW.

2. In the Setup Wizard, select the project file for this component, the Generate
  Dependency File Only option, and continue through all the steps to create the
  dependency file.

  -or-

  In the PDW, select the project file for this component, and choose the
  Dependency File option on the Package Type screen. Continue through all the
  steps to create the dependency file.

  NOTE: Save the .dep file in the same folder as the component file.

3. Restart the Setup Wizard or PDW and try the current project again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are unable to obtain a .dep file for the component(s) indicated in the
warning message, you can ignore the warning message in the following two cases:

- You are confident that no other files are required by the component.

-or-

- You know which files are required and can add them manually in the File
  Summary screen in the Setup Wizard or the Included Files screen in the PDW.

NOTE: Check the end-user license agreement and redistributable files list for
information about which files are redistributable. (In Visual Basic 5.0, check
the License.txt and Redist.txt files, both located in the "Program
files\DevStudio\VB" folder. In Visual Basic 6.0, check the Eula.txt file in the
"Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\Setup\1033" folder and the
Redist.txt file in the "Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio" folder.)

You can use a utility, such as Dependency Walker, to determine file dependencies.
However, it is important to note the following when using Dependency Walker:

- You do not need to distribute all the files listed as dependencies in the
  utility. Many of the listed files are operating system files. If you are
  unsure about which files to distribute, check the end-user license agreement
  (License.txt in 5.0, Eula.txt in 6.0) and Redist.txt files.

- The utility cannot determine dynamic module dependencies. For example, if
  Module A dynamically loads Module B via a LoadLibrary-type technique, Module
  B becomes a run-time dependency of Module A, but will not be listed in Module
  A's import table. Because Dependency Walker depends on information in the
  import table to determine dependencies, it will not detect that Module A is
  dependent upon Module B.

If you have Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 and installed the Win32 SDK Tools, you
can start Dependency Walker using the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Visual Studio
  6.0, and then point to Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Tools.

2. Click Depends.

If you do not have the Win32 SDK Tools installed, follow these steps to install
them:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

3. Click the Install/Uninstall tab, and then double-click Microsoft Visual
  Studio 6.0.

4. In the Setup dialog box, click Add/Remove.

5. In the Options list, select Tools (do not click the check box), and then
  click Change Option.

6. Click the Win32 SDK Tools check box to select it, and then click OK.

7. Click Continue.

If you have the standalone Visual Basic 6.0 product, you can find Dependency
Walker in the COMMON\TOOLS\VB\UNSUPPRT\DEPEND folder on Disk 1. If you do not
have Visual Studio 6.0 or Visual Basic 6.0, you can obtain Dependency Walker by
downloading the Platform SDK from the Microsoft Web site at the following
address:

  Microsoft Platform SDK:
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/portals/mainport.htm

The Dependency Walker, among other tools, is included with the Platform SDK under
the Tools\Platform SDK Tools in the installer. After installing the needed
portions of the SDK, you can find Depends.exe on the Start menu under Microsoft
Platform SDK\Tools\Depends. (The utility works on Microsoft Windows 95,
Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Millennium, Microsoft Windows NT, and
Microsoft Windows 2000.) The documentation for the utility is in Depends.hlp,
which can be found in \Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Bin.
