IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have the Domain Name System (DNS) service installed on your computer, one
or more of the following event error messages may appear in the event log:

   - Event 5501
  Source: DNS
  Description: DNS Server encountered bad packet from &lt;IP Address&gt;. Packet
  processing leads beyond packet length.

   - Event 5000
  Source: DNS
  Description: DNS Server is logging numerous run-time events. This is usually
  caused by the reception of bad or unexpected packets, or from problems with
  or excessive replication traffic. See previous event log entries for
  information about bad packet source. Now suppressing event logging for these
  events.

   - Event 9999
  Source: DNS
  Description: DNS Server has encountered numerous run-time events. These are
  usually caused by the reception of bad or unexpected packets, or from
  problems with or excessive replication traffic. The data is the number of
  suppressed events encountered in the last 15-minute interval.

CAUSE
=====

The occurrence of these event error messages does not necessarily indicate a
problem with the DNS service.

Event 5501 indicates that after sending a recursive query on behalf of a client,
DNS received a response with a fragmented flat set indicating that the answer
did not fit in one packet and that there is more data to follow. In versions of
Windows NT 4.0 earlier than Service Pack 4 (SP4), DNS incorrectly discards the
packet. Windows 2000 behaves correctly in this case.

Event 5000 indicates that DNS is not going to continue logging the warning events
that are filling up the event log.

Event 9999 indicates the number of events DNS blocked from being logged in Event
Viewer, and then the logging of those events starts again.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem in Windows NT 4.0, install SP4 or later.

To adjust the level of DNS logging in Event Viewer, use the registry key listed
below.

NOTE: In Windows NT 4.0, SP4 or later is required for this key to work.

Registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

Value: EventLogLevel

Type: REG_DWORD

Data values:

  0 - Event logging disabled
  1 - Only error events
  2 - Warning and error events
  4 - Information, warning, and error events

For example, if the data value is set to 1, no warning or information events are
logged.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.
