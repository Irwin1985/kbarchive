SUMMARY
=======

The file Ol98qfe.exe, which shipped on the client CD for Exchange 5.5 Service
Pack 1 in the En\Support\Update\Smime directory, is required in order to provide
full Key Management Server connectivity and S/MIME security. It also introduces
several protocol and usability fixes.

Below is a comprehensive list of fixes that are included in this self- extracting
file:

- There is a problem upgrading V1 Certificates to V2 and V3 Certificates
  automatically. The upgrade does not work automatically as expected.

- JPN: When you export or import a Digital ID, there is no option to select
  Internet Security (*.pfx,*.p12)" in "files of type" in the Import a Digital
  ID dialog box. This dialog box is on the Security tab when you click Options
  from the Tools menu.

- When a user is sending a message from V3 only to V1 only, you receive the
  following error message:

  TDXScodeFromHR failed with hr=0x80000057

  and an Out of Memory error.

- Outlook crashes before the V2 to V3 certificate renewal process finishes.

- Clicking Next or Previous causes items to shift when the taskbar is placed at
  left or top of the desktop screen.

- Help About was changed to include DataViz information.

- JPN: International Security/Charset:UTF-7 and 8 Signed/Encrypted messages are
  corrupted on Conversation Monitor System.

- The client fails to process the V3 renewal response correctly.

- When you switch from V1 to V3 and click the renew all button, you are not
  able to read V3 mail messages.

- Imported CRl is not getting picked up by the Outlook98 client.

- Recipients cannot read V3 encrypted message sent to many people.

- The Certificate Trust List signing certificate is getting added to the root
  store, causing the V3 certificate not to be trusted.

- After you install Olcsp128.exe, the Cryptography Service Provider fails to
  get registered in the registry.

- Revoking a user's V1 certificate and then switching the KMS server to V3 does
  not allow the user to enroll in V3 properly.
