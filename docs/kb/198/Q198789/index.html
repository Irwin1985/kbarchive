SUMMARY
=======

The InterOrg Synchronization tool is available in the Microsoft BackOffice
Resource Kit, Second Edition. Microsoft Product Support Services will use
commercially reasonable efforts in addressing all support problems. Please do
not confuse the InterOrg Synchronization tool with the InterOrg Replication
utility for public folders, which is available on the Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 2 compact disc.

This tool allows multiple Microsoft Exchange Server organizations to synchronize
the contents of their directories.

The connector works hierarchically, with a master service running in the master
organization, and multiple requestor services running in the branch
organizations. The Exchange Server computer of the master organization collects
and distributes all of the directory changes from the branch organizations.

The requestor service in each branch organization collects any changes that have
occurred in the directory of that organization and exports these changes to the
master service. At the same time, the requestor receives the updated directory
information from the master service. When the master agent receives updates from
a requestor, the master agent creates a new entry and assigns it an Update
Sequence Number (USN) that is greater than the USN for the last entry processed.
Each requestor stores the largest master USN that it has received, so it
requests only new entries to be posted to the global directory. The master and
requestor services communicate using the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service.
Therefore, you must have an SMTP infrastructure in place prior to configuring
this service.

Processing Events
-----------------

On a scheduled basis, the requestor service generates a mail message for the
master service. This message includes any changes that have been made to the
directory of the requestor organization, and the most recent (largest) master
USN of the requestor. Note that the requestor exports only the directory
information that is maintained on the General property page of an address book
entry. That is, the requestor service does not export the information available
in any of the custom attributes.

When the master receives a mail message from a requestor, it updates the master
database with the appropriate changes, and then sends a reply message to the
requestor. The message to the requestor contains all updates to the master
database that have a higher USN than the one that was sent by the requestor.
Although the master agent processes all requestor messages immediately, changes
may not replicate throughout the entire system for at least 24 hours.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The InterOrg Synchronization tool is available in the BackOffice Resource Kit,
Second Edition, under Administrative Tools.

For best results please download and use MDAC Drivers version 2.1.2.4202.3 from
the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=10730

These have been tested using the Latest InterOrg Synch Tool from Microsoft.

Requirements for Installing the InterOrg Synchronization Tool
-------------------------------------------------------------

Before you install the InterOrg Synchronization tool, you must make sure that
your server computers meet the following conditions:

- Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3 or higher is installed.

- Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 Service Pack 1 or higher is installed.

- Microsoft Exchange Client version 5.0 or Microsoft Outlook is installed.

- Two Exchange Server mailboxes have been created, one for the Master service
  and one for the Requestor service. Even if your server is only configured as
  a requestor, you need to create both mailboxes.

- The servers are configured to communicate using SMTP.

- You are logged on to Windows NT using the Exchange Server service account
  when you install the InterOrg Synchronization tool.

- You administer the InterOrg tool from the Exchange Server computer where the
  tool was originally installed.

- If there is a maximum mailbox size limit, you have increased it for the
  Master and Requestor mailboxes. For troubleshooting purposes, the master and
  requestor agents do not permanently erase the items in the Deleted Items and
  Sent Items folders.

Installing the InterOrg Synchronization Tool
--------------------------------------------

To install the InterOrg Synchronization tool, perform the following steps:

1. Log on to the computer running Windows NT Server using the Exchange Server
  service account.

2. Insert the BackOffice Resource Kit, Second Edition, Tools and Utilities
  compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.

3. On the Autorun page, click "Install InterOrg Synchronization tool".

4. In the Master Setup dialog box, specify the drive where you want to install
  the tool.

5. Choose whether or not to back up any files that are replaced.

6. Specify the Exchange Server master agent mailbox alias name.

7. Specify the requestor agent mailbox alias name.

Configuring the InterOrg Synchronization Tool
---------------------------------------------

To configure the InterOrg Synchronization tool, perform the following steps:

1. Configuring the Master and Requestor Mailboxes

  After you install the InterOrg Synchronization tool, you must configure the
  master and requestor mailboxes. To configure the mailboxes, perform the
  following steps:

  a. Use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to create two
     mailboxes in your site for the master and requestor agents. You should use
     Master and Requestor for the alias names.

  b. Verify that the Exchange Server service account has account permissions to
     the mailboxes.

  c. Shut down the server, and then restart it.

2. Configuring the Master and Requestor Services

  After installation is complete, you must configure the master and requestor
  services. To select the type of service that you want to configure, perform
  the following steps:

  a. Using the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Configuration
     container, and then click Add-Ins.

  b. Double-click InterOrg Synchronization Manager.

  c. In the Server Type properties page of the InterOrg Extension Properties
     dialog box, click to select the service that you want to configure. To
     configure a requestor service, click Requestor Exchange Server. To
     configure a master service, click Master Exchange Server. If you are
     configuring the Exchange Server computer for the master organization, you
     should configure both services.

  d. Click OK.

  e. In the Exchange Server Administrator window, press the F5 key to view the
     new add-in listings for the services you have selected. The master add-in
     is displayed as InterOrg Master Configuration.

  Note: When you configure the Exchange Server computer for the master
  organization, install both the master and requestor services.

3. Configuring the Master Service

  To configure the master service, perform the following steps:

  a. Using the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Configuration
     container, and then click Add-Ins.

  b. Double-click InterOrg Master Configuration.

  c. In the Master InterOrg Synchronization Properties dialog box, click the
     Configuration tab.

  d. In the Requestor E-mail Addresses box, type the e-mail addresses for all
     valid requestor agents. This prevents users from creating rogue requestor
     agents and participating in the InterOrg directory scheme illegitimately.
     These addresses should be the SMTP addresses of the requestor services,
     with one exception. The exception occurs if the master and requestor
     service are both installed on the same Exchange Server computer (as is the
     case for the master Exchange Server computer). In this case, instead of
     the SMTP address, you must provide the Exchange Server Distinguished Name
     (DN) of the requestor service. The DN resembles the following:

  /o=ORG2/ou=Site2/cn=Recipients/cn=REQUESTOR.

  e. In the E-mail Attachment box, type the maximum message size that the
     master server can generate. This is especially useful if there are message
     size limits on any of the requestor servers. Make sure that this number is
     configured for the lowest common denominator on the system.

4. Configuring a Requestor Service

  To configure a requestor service, perform the following steps:

  a. Using the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Configuration
     container, and then click Add-Ins.

  b. Double-click InterOrg Requestor Configuration.

  c. In the InterOrg Requestor Configuration Properties dialog box, there are
     three properties pages that you can configure: the Export Config
     properties page, the Import Config properties page, and the Schedule
     properties page.

  The Export Config Properties Page:

  The Export Config properties page contains the following sections:

   - The USN section displays the most recent Update Sequence Number. If you
     click Import All Recipients, it resets the Master USN to 0. This forces
     the master agent to send the requestor a complete list of names from its
     database. If you click Export All Recipients, it resets the Requestor USN
     to 0, forcing a complete export of all the requestor entries.

   - In the Exported Containers box, you can specify the containers that you
     want to export. The requestor agent can export multiple containers. In an
     Exchange Server organization with multiple sites, you need to select a
     container from each site. For each container that you want to export,
     click to select the type of contents that you want to export (Exchange
     Server mailboxes, distribution lists, and/or custom recipients).

   - If you want to append a text string to the display name of the users that
     are exported, click Append to Display Name, and then type the name to be
     appended in the text box.

   - By default, the InterOrg Synchronization tool always exports the primary
     SMTP address defined for the users. If you want to configure the InterOrg
     service to replace the domain portion of the user's primary SMTP address
     with other text, click Modify SMTP Address. This is useful in corporate
     scenarios where an SMTP mailer is used to change the SMTP From header to
     something else. For example, if the primary address is
     SMTP:User1@Org1.company.com. The SMTP mailer might change the From field
     to User1@Org1.com.Com.

   - The maximum MDB size option allows you to control how large a message
     generated by the requestor agent can be. If the size of the directory
     exceeds this number, the requestor breaks up the information into multiple
     messages.

   - In some cases, you may not want to export a particular recipient address.
     If so, you can use the Trust Level box to control the recipients that are
     exported. The InterOrg service exports all mailboxes with a trust level
     below or equal to the one number in this box.

  The Import Config Properties Page:

  The Import Config properties page of the Requestor InterOrg Synchronization
  dialog box allows you to configure information necessary for the import cycle
  of the process. It includes the following sections.

   - The Master Server Address box.

     As its name implies, the Master Server Address box contains the e-mail
     address of the master service. In most cases, this is be the SMTP address
     of the master server (for example, Master@MyCo.Com). However, if the
     master and requestor agents reside in the same Exchange Server
     organization (as is true of the master organization), you need to use the
     distinguished name address of the master (for example,
     /o=ORG1/ou=Site1/cn=Recipients/cn=MASTER). If the distinguished address is
     used, you need to select the EX address type instead of SMTP.

   - The Container for Importing box.

     In this box, specify the container that the requestor service uses to
     import the information it receives from the master agent. Note that the
     requestor agent uses a single Exchange Server site container for
     importing. It is HIGHLY recommended that you select a different container
     to import than the one you use for export.

   - The Domains to Import box.

     In this box, you can specify which SMTP domains are imported into your
     directory, or you can click Import All to accept all domains known to the
     master agent.

  The Schedule Properties Page:

  In the Schedule properties page you can specify how frequently the requestor
  agent processes updates. You can schedule the service to start processing any
  new changes on a daily basis. Or you can click Execute Now to start the
  process on demand, provided that you are logged on using the Exchange Server
  service account and password.

Configuring the InterOrg Service to Run on Windows NT
-----------------------------------------------------

The last step in configuring the InterOrg service is to configure it to run on
Windows NT.

To configure the InterOrg service to run on Windows NT, perform the following
steps:

1. In Control Panel, click Services.

2. In the Services dialog box, double-click InterOrg Synchronization.

3. In the Service properties page, to select the automatic startup type, click
  to select the Automatic check box, if it is not already selected.

4. Click This Account.

5. Log on using the user ID and password of the Exchange Server service
  account.

  Important: Any changes that you make to the service configuration after the
  service is running do not take effect until the service is restarted.
