SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the Drawing Objects and Picture Placeholders settings.
You can use these settings to control how quickly a document is displayed on
screen and how it is printed.

In some cases, adjusting these settings may help you troubleshoot problems such
as Clip Art or some other drawing object not printing, or your document
appearing slowly. These settings also allow you to print only the text of a
document that includes drawing objects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Drawing Objects Setting:

Use this setting to control how quickly documents that contain drawing objects
are printed or whether drawing objects are printed at all.

This setting affects objects in the drawing layer only; it does not affect any
object in the text layer of your document.

Accessing the Drawing Objects Setting
-------------------------------------

To access the Drawing Objects setting, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then select the Print tab.

2. Under Include With Document, click to select or clear the Drawing Objects
  check box.

What Happens When the Setting Is On (the Check Box Is Selected)
---------------------------------------------------------------

If this setting is turned on (selected), floating objects or any objects that you
insert into your document from the Drawing toolbar are visible in page layout
and print preview views. The objects are not visible in normal, outline, master
document, or online layout view. All objects are printed.

What Happens When the Setting Is Off (the Check Box Is Cleared)
---------------------------------------------------------------

If this setting is turned off (the check box is cleared), drawing objects are not
printed; therefore, the document should be printed faster.

The drawing objects are visible in page layout view, but they are not visible in
print preview, and they are not printed.

Picture Placeholders Setting:

Use this setting to control the speed at which you can scroll through or display
a document that contains graphics.

This setting does not affect objects in the drawing layers of your document,
except for pictures inside a text box.

Accessing the Picture Placeholders Setting
------------------------------------------

To access the Picture Placeholders setting, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then select the View tab.

2. Under Show, click to select or clear the Picture Placeholders check box.

What Happens When the Setting Is On (the Check Box Is Selected)
---------------------------------------------------------------

If this setting is turned on (selected), any picture in the text layer of your
document or inside a text box is displayed as an empty box when viewed in page
layout view. This speeds up scrolling through the document in page layout view.
In print preview and when you print the document, the picture is visible.

What Happens When the Setting Is Off (the Check Box Is Cleared)
---------------------------------------------------------------

If this setting is turned off (the check box is cleared), all pictures are
displayed and printed correctly; however, scrolling through the document may be
slower.
