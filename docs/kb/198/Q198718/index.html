IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Information on the client's remote control session can be viewed in Remctrl.log.
There is an additional ability to log all WUSER transaction information on the
client for remote transactions. This is called WUSER Logging.

WUSER logging is not turned on by default. This can be activated by a registry
or, in the case of 16-bit clients, an .ini file modification only.

NOTE: Once started, logging continues until the process is reversed and it is
turned off. Consequently, this will degrade the performance of the client-side
agent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
For true 32-bit clients, such as Windows NT using WUSER32 and Windows
95/98/Millennium Edition (Me) clients using WUSER32, find the registry key to
easily update the registry and create a text file on the desktop with any name
and a .reg extension. Enter the lines of text exactly as they appear below and
include a blank line at the bottom of the file. Save the file and then
double-click the file to merge the entries into the registry. To verify the
values have been entered correctly into the registry, click Start, click Run,
and then type "REGEDIT" (without the quotation marks):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components\Remote
  Control

Make a new Reg_SZ:EnableRemoteConnect with a value of 'NO'.

In this same key make another value:

  Reg_DWORD:LogToFile with a value of 0x1

Here the value of LogToFile should be formatted as REG_DWORD and set to 1. If the
key or value does not exist, create it. In the instance of LogToFile, case and
spacing are crucial. To verify the changes have taken effect, search for
Wuser32.log.

In the instance of 16-bit clients using WUSER, an entry of "LogToFile=1" will
have to be added to Smsrc16.ini, under [Client Components - Remote Control].
Stop, then restart WUSER, and search for the Wuser.log to verify. However, it is
important to note that that the next time Client Services performs a full
maintenance cycle, the addition to the .ini file of the 16-bit clients will be
purged. To prevent this, ensure that SMSMAN16 is not run on this machine while
you are logging. You can also do this by disabling logon scripts, although this
is a less attractive alternative.

Very detailed information is captured during the logging of each remote session
and it is therefore important to note that no passwords or encrypted information
is passed or logged. The customer should also be aware that the information
provided in the Wuser32.log or the Wuser.log is used specifically for the
troubleshooting of connection level and transaction problems.

The logs overwrite themselves with each stop and start cycle of WUSER32 or WUSER,
so if information from the log is required to be kept for troubleshooting, the
log must be copied and renamed to preserve the data. The registry entries for
the true 32-bit clients are dynamic; therefore, there is no need to stop and
restart WUSER32 for the changes to take effect. However, changes to the registry
in the Windows 95\98 client are static, and stopping and restarting the agent is
required for the changes to take effect.
