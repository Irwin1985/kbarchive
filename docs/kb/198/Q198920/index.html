The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Users are attempting to access their Exchange Server 4.0 mailboxes using Outlook
Web Access (OWA). OWA was a new feature introduced with Exchange Server 5.0;
therefore, it is not available for Exchange Server 4.0.

OWA may work in some read-only cases, but it is not tested or supported for
Exchange Server 4.0, only for Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OWA relies upon Collaborative Data Objects (CDO) technology that was not present
in Exchange Server 4.0. At that time, the technology was referred to as "Active
Messaging," which later became CDO in upgrades and a renaming of that
technology.

Although you may get some response from Exchange Server 4.0 when you attempt to
use OWA with that version, key objects needed for full functionality, such as
Send and Reply, are beyond the capabilities of 4.0. The users must have their
mailbox accounts upgraded or moved to Exchange Server 5.O or above to obtain
full OWA functionality.
