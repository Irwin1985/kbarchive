-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) clients may ignore the expiration time and date
of newly detected jobs for a workstation. For example, if a job is sent to
several workstations at 9:00 P.M. with an expiration of time of 4:00 A.M. the
following morning, computers that are turned off during this time initially find
out about the job after the expiration time and date. However, in this case, the
Package Command Manager (PCM) process on these clients still attempts to run the
job during the first evaluation cycle.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by inappropriate handling of newly available jobs during
the first evaluation performed by PCM.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.
