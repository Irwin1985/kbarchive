- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The readability statistics displayed after Word has completed checking the
grammar of your document may be incorrect, display zeros, or not display at all.

CAUSE
=====

The following are possible reasons for the readability statistics being
incorrect or not being displayed:

- The text being checked is a one-line paragraph with no punctuation mark at
  the end of the sentence.

  Resolution: Add punctuation to the end of the sentence before checking the
  spelling and grammar of your Word document.

  -or-

- You have formatted the text by selecting (no proofing) in the Language dialog
  box. When Word checks text formatted with the (no proofing) option selected,
  Word displays the following message:

  The spelling and grammar check is complete.
  Text set to (no proofing) was skipped. To find (no proofing) text, click
  Edit/Replace, click More, click Format, click Language and choose (no
  proofing).

  Word does not include the text formatted with the (no proofing) option in the
  readability statistics.

  Resolution: Format the skipped text with the language of the text in the
  remainder of your Word document.

  -or-

- If you've set up Microsoft Word to check the spelling and grammar of text in
  other languages, and a document contains text in multiple languages, Word
  displays readability statistics for the text formatted in the English (United
  States) language only.

  Resolution: There is no known resolution for this problem.

  -or-

- You have added a PAGE field to your Word document. This problem occurs
  whether you add the PAGE field by using Page Numbers on the Insert menu, by
  using Field on the Insert menu, or by typing the PAGE field manually (by
  pressing CTRL+F9 and typing "PAGE" (without the quotation marks)).


  Resolution: There is no known resolution for this problem.

  -or-

- You have added one or more comments to your Word document (on the Insert
  menu, click Comment).


  Resolution: There is no known resolution for this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Microsoft Word finishes checking spelling and grammar, it can display
information about the reading level of the document, including readability
scores based on the average number of syllables per word, and words per
sentence.

To show the readability statistics after checking spelling and grammar, turn on
the Show readability statistics option. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the Spelling &amp; Grammar tab, click to select the "Show readability
  statistics" check box.

3. Click OK.

For more information about readability statistics, click "Contents and Index" on
the Help menu, click the Index tab in Word Help, type the following text

  readability

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Display readability
statistics" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the
Office Assistant.
