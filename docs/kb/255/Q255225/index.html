-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Korean version of Outlook Web Access (OWA) and you try to create
or edit meeting requests that fall on February 29 of a leap year, you cannot
create or edit the meeting requests, and you may receive the following error
message:

  Microsoft Internet Explorer
  You must specify a valid date. Check your entries in this dialog box to make
  sure they represent a valid date.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the data-parsing code in Outlook Web Access does
not account for some special situations that occur if you use certain Asian
operating system versions.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Outlook Web Access version 5.5 service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date          Time      Size      File name     Language
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  2/21/2000     2:40 PM   8,949     Pick.asp      Language Neutral	
  2/21/2000     2:40 PM   30,760    FrmRoot.asp   Language Neutral



To apply this fix, rename the two files, Pick.asp and Frmroot.asp, and then copy
the new versions to the same folder. The default file locations are as follows:

- Webdata\&lt;language&gt;\Calendar\Pick.asp

- Webdata\&lt;language&gt;\Forms\Ipm\Schedule\Meeting\Request\FrmRoot.asp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
