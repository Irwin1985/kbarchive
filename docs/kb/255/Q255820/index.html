  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

In large Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 2000 domains that contain
many domain controllers and multiple sites with Windows NT Logon Discovery or
Windows NT Logon Installation enabled, there may be competition for control of
the domain during logon point updates. This can cause sites to be marked as
inactive (dead), which results in the uninstallation of the logon point
components for that site on all domain controllers. An indication of this
condition is the absence of a folder corresponding with the site code for the
site in the Smslogon\Sites folder on the domain controllers.

SMS_NT_Logon_Server_Manager (LSM) is a thread of SMS_Executive that handles the
creation and management of logon points for the site. Before Service Pack 2, LSM
was a single-threaded program so it could only update one domain controller at a
time.

In Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 and later, LSM is a
multithreaded program. Because of this change, the time it takes to complete a
logon server management cycle is reduced significantly. There is also a change
to the behavior of LSM as it relates to LSM marking the sites as inactive
(dead).

  Sites

MORE INFORMATION

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To change the number of threads assigned to LSM, use the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Max Concurrent Threads for Updating BDCs value in the following
  registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_NT_Logon_Server_Manager

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD.

4. Type the appropriate number of threads, and then click OK.

5. Quit Registry Editor.
