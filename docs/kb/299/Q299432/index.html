The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Cookies are not deleted for my site when the Passport user closes the browser
window.

CAUSE
=====

If cookies are not deleted when a Passport user closes the browser window, one
of the following may be the cause:

- The user has more than one window open to your site, or the site creates
  multiple window instances when users view it.

  Some Microsoft Internet Explorer versions earlier than 5.0 consider a browser
  session to be open as long as any browser window is open. Also, certain
  factors cause new browser windows to launch out of the same process as an
  already open process, and as part of propagating the session, various cookies
  or permissions may be propagated from the parent to the child. Because of
  this, the session can still be "live" after one or more browser windows have
  been closed, even if the remaining windows are no longer viewing a Passport
  site.

- The user has selected the Remember my Password or Keep Me Signed In option.

  If the user has selected the Remember my Password or Keep Me Signed In option,
  the domain-authority cookies become persistent cookies that are saved on the
  browser. Depending on your implementation, a saved password may mean that the
  participant cookies can be refreshed silently when the user returns to your
  site.
