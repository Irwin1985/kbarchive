-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses known issues with the Activities offered in Microsoft
Train Simulator. These issues are detailed in the "More Information" section of
this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Timer Is Not Updated for Loading Saved Activities
-------------------------------------------------

- If you save an Activity when the load or unload passengers timer is running,
  that timer is not updated in the driving aid the next time that you load the
  saved Activity. (However, you do still receive the signal to depart at the
  expected time.)

When Attempting to Explore-Route
--------------------------------

- Attempting to drive an Acela HHP-8 train on Tokyo-Hakone line starting in
  Hakone-Yumoto and heading towards Shinjuku. The train will reach an impass
  late in the first major (left) curve. You may also note the overhead
  powerlines are not physically supported by pylons or towers.

Royal Scot Rescue Activity
--------------------------

- In the "Royal Scot Rescue" Activity, it is crucial that the train is backed
  into Ribblehead siding 1 to register and enable the Activity to end. Back the
  train up as far as possible (to the buffer on this siding) to trigger the end
  of the Activity when you arrive with the Royal Scot's Consist in Dent.

Loading Activity During Derailment
----------------------------------

- If you attempt to load a saved Activity during a derailment, Train Simulator
  may stop responding or quit (crash).

Murder on the Orient Express
----------------------------

- To pick up the detective's assistant, the Goelsdorf 380 locomotive, not the
  Consist, must be near the center of platform 3 in Zirl.

Northeast Corridor Summer Express
---------------------------------

- The Edgewood station stop is very short. Using the Next Station display as a
  guide, come to a complete stop at exactly -0.01 miles to load and unload
  passengers.

- Be aware that there is a delay in waiting for the red light to change to
  green near milepost 43.5.

- Waiting points are all being reset to zero seconds.

Northeast Corridor Short Passenger Run
--------------------------------------

- When you start the Short Passenger Run on the Northeast Corridor, your train
  unexpectedly derails 2 minutes to 3 minutes into the activity. To workaround
  this issue, immediately after the activity begins increase to full throttle
  and hold your speed.

Tokyo-Hakone Route
------------------

- There are several stations in which the signals are placed so close to the
  platform that the train does not pass the signal completely when it stops.
  Rolling backwards at one of these stations causes the Activity to end with an
  "ignored red light" message. To resolve this issue, try to stop at the
  platforms in such a way that the end of the train passes the signal
  completely. (One example of this type of station is Umegaoka Station.)

Whitefish Switching Yard
------------------------

- The switch for the "West Rip" does not function as expected. To complete the
  activity, you must loop around the yard and open the switch from the other
  side.
