SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set up Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) on an Internet
Information Services (IIS) version 5.0 computer, using Certificate Server 2.0 as
the certificate provider.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. First, the Web server must make a certificate request. To do this, follow
  these steps:

  a. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
     Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

  b. Right-click the Web site on which you want to enable SSL, and click
     Properties.

  c. Click the Directory Security tab, and then click Server Certificate to
     start the Web Server Certificate Wizard.

  d. Click Next to start the wizard, and select Create a new certificate.

  e. Click Next, and select Prepare the request now, but send it later.

  f. Click Next, and give your certificate a name. You may want to match it
     with the name of the Web site. Now, select a bit length; the higher the
     bit length, the stronger the certificate encryption. Select Server Gated
     Cryptography if your users may be coming from countries with encryption
     restrictions.

  g. Click Next, and type your Organization and Organizational Unit. These
     values do not need to match any Active Directory entries.

  h. Click Next, and enter the common name. The common name must match the
     fully qualified domain name of the server as listed in DNS. For example,
     if the URL is https://www.mydomain.com/securedir, then the common name
     must be www.mydomain.com.

  i. Click Next, and type your country, state, and city or locality. Type the
     full name of your state here; do not abbreviate.

  j. Click Next, and select a location and file name to save your request to.

  k. Click Next twice, and then click Finish to close the wizard.

2. Process your request through Certificate Server. To do this, follow these
  steps:

  a. Browse to http://CAServerName/CertSrv, and select Request a certificate.

     NOTE: Do not use "localhost" as the server name. If you browse from the
     Certificate Server computer, use the computer name instead.

  b. Click Next and select Advanced request.

  c. Click Next and select Submit a certificate request using a base64 encoded
     PKCS #10 file or a renewal request using a base64 encoded PKCS #7 file.

  d. Click Next, and open the request file that you saved from the Web
     Certificate Wizard in Notepad. Paste the entire text of the file,
     including the BEGIN and END lines, into the Base64 Encoded Certificate
     Request text box.

  e. Click Submit. You may be presented with a Certificate Pending dialog box.
     If you are prompted for download, skip to step 2j.

  f. Close your browser. On the Certificate Server computer, open the
     Certification Authority MMC.

  g. Expand the tree underneath the server name, and select the Pending
     Requests folder. Right-click the certificate that you just submitted
     (scroll to the right for more information to determine which certificate
     is yours if there are several pending), click All Tasks, and then click
     Issue. You may now close the Certification Authority MMC.

  h. Open a new browser window, and browse to the URL that is listed in step a.
     Select Check on a pending certificate.

  i. Click Next, and select the request that you made earlier.

  j. Click Next, select DER encoded, and then click the Download CA certificate
     link. Save the certificate file to your Web server's local drive, and
     close your Web browser.

3. Now, finish processing the request within IIS to install the certificate to
  the server, and enable SSL.

  a. Open the Internet Information Services MMC, right-click the Web site on
     which you want to enable SSL, and click Properties.

  b. Click the Directory Security tab, then click Server Certificate.

  c. Click Next, and select Process the pending request and install the
     certificate.

  d. Click Next, and enter the path and file name of the certificate that you
     saved in the last section.

  e. Click Next twice, and then click Finish to complete the wizard.

  f. Click the Web Site tab, and make sure that the SSL Port text box is
     populated with the port you would like SSL to run on. The default (and
     recommended) port is 443.

  g. Click OK to close the Web site Properties dialog box.

You can now use SSL on your server. Test the setup by connecting to the Web
site's home page by using https instead of http. You have a valid connection if
the page comes up and a small lock appears in the status bar in the lower
right-hand corner of the browser.
