Microsoft MapPoint 2002 North America Release Notes
This document contains information about known issues with MapPoint 2002 and
other useful troubleshooting information. Please read this document before
installing MapPoint 2002.

I. Known Issues
II. Troubleshooting Setup
III. Troubleshooting Printing Problems
IV. Hardware Issues

I. Known Issues
---------------

If you want to install MapPoint 2001 after installing MapPoint 2002, choose a
different installation directory for MapPoint 2001. If you do not choose a
different installation directory for MapPoint 2001 after installing MapPoint
2002, neither application can start.

If you install MapPoint 2001 after installing MapPoint 2002, programs written
using the MapPoint 2002 object model may no longer work properly.

The Map.ObjectsFromPoint method sometimes creates an invalid FindResults object.
The count of the results is larger than the actual number of found items. When
using the Item method of the returned object, you should include error handling,
checking for Runtime error 5: Invalid procedure call or argument. You will still
be able to access the complete set of returned objects, but some nonexisting
items will return this error.

When creating territories within the MapPoint Control, be sure to explicitly save
map files by calling the Control's SaveMap, SaveMapAs or CloseMap methods. If
you close the Control or the application that hosts the Control without
explicitly saving a map with territories by using one of these methods, all
territory data may not be saved with the map. Another way to work around this
problem is to hide the territory pane before closing the Control by replacing it
with another pane, such as the Legend and Overview pane.

When using the Visual Basic Package and Deployment Wizard to create a custom
setup program for MapPoint on Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition, you
should use Visual Basic version 6.0 with Service Pack 4 or later. If you do not
use this version of Visual Basic, your setup program will not run properly.

Do not use the trial version of MapPoint to design or deploy applications.

There are known issues with floating objects not appearing on multiple monitors
after the monitors are switched. For example, if you have multiple monitors and
move a floating object, such as a toolbar, from one monitor to another, then
close the application, switch monitor positions in Control Panel, and start the
application again, you will no longer be able to see the toolbar on either
monitor. To work around this problem, restore the monitors to their original
positions.

MapPoint includes various geographies such as State/Province and ZIP
Code/Postcode to support Data Mapping and Territory functionality. These
geometries do not exist up to the same altitude for all countries; consequently,
it may be necessary to zoom in after completing a data map or while creating a
territory that spans countries.

If you are running Windows 98 First Edition or Windows NT Service Pack 6 with
Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1 or earlier, the Find feature of MapPoint
may not function. To work around this problem, upgrade to the most recent
version of comctl32.dll:

1. Insert the MapPoint Setup disc in your disc drive.

2. Browse to the \MSMap\redist\common\ folder.

3. Double-click 50comupd.exe.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

Installing Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater will also update this file.
You can install Internet Explorer version 5.0 from the MapPoint Setup disc:

1. Insert the MapPoint Setup disc into your disc drive.

2. Browse to the \OSP\1033\IE5\EN\ folder.

3. Double-click IE5SETUP.EXE.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

II. Troubleshooting Setup
-------------------------

Because MapPoint 2002 installs system files that might be shared with other
applications, you need to shut down all other applications (including anti-virus
software) before running Setup.

To start Setup for installing MapPoint 2002, insert the Setup disc in your disc
drive. After setup is complete, replace the Setup disc with the Run disc to run
the program.

If, after running Setup and restarting Windows, MapPoint does not run, the
problem is most likely related to system files used by some anti-virus software.
To resolve this problem, turn off your anti-virus software, uninstall MapPoint,
and then reinstall MapPoint.

If you need to reinstall MapPoint, on the Start menu, point to Settings, and then
click Control Panel. Double-click Add/Remove Programs, and double-click
Microsoft MapPoint 2002 North America in the list displayed; if you are running
Windows 2000, select Microsoft MapPoint 2002 North America in the list
displayed, then click Change.

To make MapPoint available through advertising on Windows 98 or Windows NT
operating systems the Office Service Pack must first be installed on client
machines. With the Setup disc in the client machine's X: drive, open a command
prompt window on a user's computer and type the following command

  X:\Setup.exe /jm \\machine\share\MapPoint\msmap\data.msi

where \\machine\share\MapPoint is the administrative installation location.
This will install the Office Service Pack to the client machine and advertise
MapPoint.

III. Troubleshooting Printing Problems
--------------------------------------

If you encounter problems when printing from MapPoint 2002, such as no printout
or partial printout, low print quality, or erratic text being printed, there are
several ways to correct the problem.

Check with the manufacturer of your printer to see if updated drivers are
available. The manufacturer's Web site is usually a good place to look for
updated drivers.

Changing your print quality may improve printouts from certain printers or in
certain memory configurations. To change your print quality, go to the File
menu, and click Print. Under Options, select one of the options in the Map
quality box. The print quality is still quite good in the lower resolution mode.
Even if your printer supports high-resolution printing, you may choose to use
the Draft option to speed up printing. You can also increase the margins so the
printed map is smaller and faster.

If your printer displays a message or error indicator, see your printer manual
for information about how to correct the problem.

If you receive an "out of memory" error message when printing, check your printer
settings in Control Panel. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click
Control Panel. Double-click Printers, and then right-click the icon for your
printer to view its properties. Verify that the amount of printer memory
installed in the printer matches the setting specified in Control Panel. If this
does not correct the problem, then try printing in a lower resolution mode by
changing the Map quality to Normal or Draft, or try increasing your page margins
or using portrait orientation so the printed map is smaller and can print
faster.

If the legend symbols are unclear on your printout, look for a "dithering"
setting in the Printer Properties dialog box. Setting dithering to None or Fine
gives better results than Coarse.

If you receive a message that no printers are installed and you have a printer
installed, make sure that one of the printers has been set as the default
printer.

IV. Hardware Issues
-------------------

MapPoint 2002 will run best with multi-disc changers if you run it from the same
drive to which it was installed. Also, if you want to listen to audio discs at
the same time, it is best to start MapPoint 2002 and then start your audio
disc.

The Plextor 6PLEX CD-ROM drive may cause "fail to read" messages. If you see this
message, you will need to upgrade your CD-ROM drive to an 8PLEX or other more
recent model.

If you use a Microsoft IntelliMouse and are running the Microsoft Windows 2000
operating system, the IntelliMouse wheel may not scroll correctly through
directions. To correct this behavior, on the Start menu, point to Settings, and
then click Control Panel. Double-click Display, click Effects, and clear the
"Use transition effects for menus and ToolTips" check box.

MapPoint will not run if your computer has an ATI 3D Rage Pro AGP 2X card running
display driver version 5.2.040.4.0.0 with display settings in True Color mode.
See the ATI Web site to install the recommended display driver. If you are
running Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 and you have an ATI or Matrox video
adapter installed in the computer, you may receive a "fatal exception" error
message and blue screen or unexpected computer restart when you use the search
or data mapping features.

To work around this problem on Microsoft Windows 2000, reduce the graphics
acceleration setting:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Advanced.

4. Click the Troubleshooting tab.

5. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider all the way to the left (the None
  position), and then click OK.

NOTE: If the issue continues to occur, reduce the Colors setting on the Settings
tab of the Display Properties dialog box to 256 Colors, and then click OK.

To work around this problem on Windows NT 4.0, reduce the color palette setting
to 256 colors:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. In the Color Palette box, click 256 Colors, and then click Test.

5. Click OK, and then click Yes.

6. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

NOTE: If reducing the color palette setting to 256 colors resolves this issue,
you can also attempt to increase the color palette setting to True Color (24
bit) or True Color (32 bit).
