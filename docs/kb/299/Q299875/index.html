-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet has opened up new ways for organizations to communicate, both
internally and externally. Better communication between employees, vendors, and
customers enables an organization to cut costs, bring products to market faster,
and build stronger customer relationships. This improved communication
requires--at times--transmitting sensitive information over the Internet and
intranets. It thus becomes imperative to be able to conduct private,
tamper-proof communication with known parties. To bring this about,
organizations can build a secure infrastructure based on public-key cryptography
by using digital certificates with technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL). This step-by-step guide discusses how to set up SSL on an Information
Services (IIS) version 5.0 computer.

Requirements
------------

The following items describe the recommended hardware, software, network
infrastructure, skills and knowledge, and service packs that you will need:

- Windows 2000 Server, Advanced Server, or Professional, with Internet
  Information Services (IIS) version 5.0 and Microsoft Certificate Server
  version 2.0 installed and configured.

If the computer that is hosting Certificate Server is not the same computer that
has IIS, you need a valid network or Internet connection to the server that is
hosting Certificate Server.

Create a Certificate Request
----------------------------

First, the Web server must make a certificate request. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
  Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). To do
  this, click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then
  click Internet Service Manager.

2. Double-click the server name so that you see all of the Web sites.

3. Right-click the Web site on which you want to install the certificate, and
  then click Properties.

4. Click the Directory Security tab, and then click Server Certificate under
  Secure Communications to start the Web Server Certificate Wizard.

5. Select Create a new certificate and click Next.

6. Select Prepare the request now, but send it later and click Next.

7. Click Next, and give your certificate a name. You may want to match it with
  the name of the Web site. Now, select a bit length; the higher the bit
  length, the stronger the certificate encryption. Select Server Gated
  Cryptography if your users may be coming from countries with encryption
  restrictions.

8. Type your organization name and the organizational unit (for example, MyWeb
  and Development Dept). Click Next.

9. Type either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the server name as the
  common name. If you are creating a certificate that will be used over the
  Internet, it is preferable to use a FQDN (for example, www.MyWeb.com). Click
  Next.

10. Enter your location information, and then click Next.

11. Type the path and file name to save the certificate information to, and
  click Next to continue.

  NOTE: If you type anything other than the default location and file name, be
  sure to note the name and location you choose, because you will have to
  access this file in later steps.

12. Verify the information that you have typed, and then click Next to complete
  the process and create the certificate request.

Submit a Certificate Request
----------------------------

The certificate request that you just created needs to be submitted to a
Certificate Authority (CA). This may be your own server with Certificate Server
2.0 installed on it or an online CA such as VeriSign. Contact the certificate
provider of your choice and determine the best level of certificate for your
needs. There are different methods of submitting your request. Contact the
Certificate Authority of your choice to request and receive your certificate.
You can create your own certificate with Certificate Server 2.0, but your
clients must implicitly trust you as the Certificate Authority. The steps below
assume that you are using Certificate Server 2.0 as the certificate provider.

1. Open a browser and browse to http://YourWebServerName/CertSrv/.

2. Select Request a Certificate and click Next.

3. Select Advanced Request and click Next.

4. Select Submit a Certificate Request using a Base64 and click Next.

5. In Microsoft Notepad, open the request document that you created in the
  "Create a Certificate Request" section.

6. Copy the contents of the document. The contents should resemble the
  following:

-----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

-----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-------

NOTE: If you save the document with the default name and location, it is located
at C:\Certreq.txt.

NOTE: Be sure to copy all of the content just as shown.

7. Paste the contents of the document into the Web form's Base64 Encoded
  Certificate Request text box.

8. Under Certificate Template, select Web Server, and then click Submit.

9. If Certificate Server is set to Always Issue the Certificate, you can access
  the certificate immediately. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Click Download CA Certificate (do not click Download CA Certificate path).

  b. When you are prompted, select Save this file to disk and save the
     certificate to your desktop or another location that you will remember.

You may now go directly to the "Install the Certificate and Set Up an SSL Web
Site" section.

Issue and Download a Certificate
--------------------------------

To issue a certificate in Certificate Server, follow these steps:

1. Open the CA MMC snap-in. To do this, click Start, point to Programs, point to
  Administrative Tools, and then click Certificate Authority.

2. Expand Certificate Authority and click the Pending Requests folder. Your
  pending certificate requests appear in the right pane.

3. Right-click the pending certificate request that you just submitted, select
  All Tasks, and then click Issue.

  NOTE: After you select Issue, the certificate is no longer displayed in this
  window and folder. It now resides in the Issued Certificate folder.

4. After you have issued (and authorized) the certificate, you can return to the
  Certificate Servers Web interface to select and download the certificate. To
  do this, follow these steps:

  a. Browse to http://YourWebServerName/CertSrv/.

  b. On the default page, select Check on a pending certificate and click Next.

  c. Select your pending certificate, then click Next to go to the download
     page.

  d. On the download page, click Download CA Certificate (do not click Download
     CA Certificate path).

  e. When you are prompted, select Save this file to disk and save the
     certificate to your desktop or another location that you will remember.

Install the Certificate and Set Up an SSL Web Site
--------------------------------------------------

To install the certificate, follow these steps:

1. Open the Internet Services Manager and expand the server name so that you can
  view the Web sites.

2. Right-click the Web site for which you created the certificate request and
  click Properties.

3. Click the Directory Security tab. Under Secure Communications, click Server
  Certificate. This starts the Certificate Installation Wizard. Click Next to
  continue.

4. Select Process the pending request and install the certificate and click
  Next.

5. Type the location of the certificate that you downloaded in the "Issue and
  Download a Certificate" section, then click Next. The Wizard displays the
  Certificate Summary. Verify that the information is correct, then click Next
  to continue.

6. Click Finish to complete the process.

Configure and Test the Certificate
----------------------------------

To configure and test the certificate, follow these steps:

1. On the Directory Security tab, under Secure Communications, note that there
  are now three available options. To set the Web site to require secure
  connections, click Edit. The Secure Communications dialog box appears.

2. Select Require Secure Channel (SSL) and click OK.

3. Click Apply and then OK to close the property sheet.

4. Browse to the site and verify that it works. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Access the site through HTTP by typing "http://localhost/Postinfo.html"
     (without the quotation marks) in the browser. You receive an error message
     that resembles the following:

  HTTP 403.4 - Forbidden: SSL required.

  b. Try to browse to the same Web page using a secured connection (HTTPS) by
     typing "https://localhost/postinfo.html" (without the quotation marks) in
     the browser. You may receive a security alert that states that the
     certificate is not from a trusted root CA. Click Yes to continue to the
     Web page. If the page appears, you have successfully installed your
     certificate.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- The use of SSL slows performance between HTTP servers and browsers.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q150031 Use of SSL Creates Performance Overhead for Browsers

- When you use Microsoft Visual InterDev version 6.0 to author Web sites with
  SSL, there are several issues and limitations to consider. For more
  information, see the following Knowledge Base article:

  Q238662 INFO: Using Visual InterDev and Secure Sockets Layer

- This article discusses server certificates only. A server certificate enables
  users to authenticate your server, check the validity of Web content, and
  establish a secure connection. If you also intend to authenticate users who
  browse to your Web site, you may consider using client certificates. A
  typical client certificate contains several items of information: the
  identity of the user, the identity of the certification authority, a public
  key that is used for establishing secure communications, and validation
  information, such as an expiration date and serial number.
