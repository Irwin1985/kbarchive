The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Passport, version 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A check mark does not appear next to my site's name when a user signs out of my
site.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the expire-cookie page does not specify the content
type correctly or there is a problem deleting the Passport cookies.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cookies may not be deleted from a site for one of several reasons. Test the
following items to isolate the cause of the issue:

- Does your cookie-delete page actually return an image?

- Does your cookie-delete page attempt to send any content other than the image
  to the client browser?

- Is the content type in the header being set to something other than
  "image/gif" or "image/jpeg"?

Your cookie-delete page should always return an image unless there is some reason
why the cookie-delete operation has failed or should fail. Your cookie-delete
page is called as an image source (not as a file include) when it is integrated
into the Passport network-wide sign-out page that is actually connected to when
a user clicks a Sign Out link. This page deletes cookies as served by all
Passport participant sites that the user signed in to during that session.

If you believe the problem is caused by a failure to delete the Passport cookies,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q299353 Passport Cookies Are Not Deleted When a User Signs Out
