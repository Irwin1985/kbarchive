SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Microsoft Train Simulator Troubleshooter to customize the Train
Simulator startup process in such a way as to resolve certain problems that you
may encounter when you attempt to start or play the game. This article discusses
this troubleshooter and the options available.

An update has been create to update Train Simulator Troubleshooter. To download
and install the update, browse to the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/trainsim

MORE INFORMATION
================

To start the Troubleshooter, click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft
Games, point to Train Simulator, and then click Train Simulator Troubleshooter.
Then, click Troubleshooting.

Note that you are offered a list of graphical issues that you may be
experiencing. Select the item in this list that matches your issue, and then
click OK. Now click Play Train Simulator.

The following is a list of these possible graphical issues, along with a brief
accompanying description of each issue.

- Smoke is displayed in block form

  This behavior occurs because the card incorrectly reports that it cannot mask
  z-writes. This behavior can also cause z-order issues with shadows and the
  objects that cast the shadows. The fix patches the caps so that the
  simulation engine "believes" that the card can mask z-writes.

- Text is displayed in block form

  This forces the pixel bias setting to cope with the problem described under
  the "Skip checking pixel bias behavior" issue. The symptoms can also be
  described as "Text display is blurred/distorted."

- Textures are distorted

  Some drivers incorrectly report the size of texture they can use (typically
  they report 512 x 512 or greater, when the actual limit is 256 x 256). This
  forces 256 x 256 textures in the game.

- Seams are visible in cab cockpits

  This is the same as the command line option /nofiltercab. This removes visible
  seams in the cab cockpits, which are caused by filtering artifacts at the
  edges of textures.

- Text is distorted or not displayed

  This works around some problems that result when calls to DirectDraw blit
  functions fail but do not return an error. This blit issue causes problems in
  the TrueType font-caching system in Train Simulator, which causes text to
  only partially or completely fail to display, or in text being rendered
  incorrectly.

- Skip texture size limit test

  Some code is run at startup to establish the maximum and minimum texture sizes
  that the card can handle by actually creating textures at each size. By
  selecting this box, you are able to skip this check just in case it causes
  problems on a particular card.

- Skip pixel behavior test

  Some code is run at startup to establish whether the card correctly implements
  texture mapping in the one pixel to one texel case; that is, it's an
  automated check to determine whether the "Text is blocky." By selecting this
  check box, you are able to skip this check just in case it causes problems on
  a particular card.

- Snow causes game to crash or does not display

  This works around problems with drivers either reporting that they can't do
  "guard band clipping" when they can, and/or drivers failing to implement D3D
  clipping correctly or implementing in a manner that causes the game to stop
  responding (hang). This option uses very simplistic clipping within the
  engine to work around these issues.

You can also use the Troubleshooter to reprofile your Sound and Video hardware
and drivers after you update or upgrade. To do this follow the steps below:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Train
  Simulator, and then click "Train Simulator Troubleshooter".

2. Click "Change Video Driver".

3. Click OK.

4. Click "Play Train Simulator".
