-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
- Microsoft Expedia Streets and Trips 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing, starting, or using Microsoft Streets and Trips, the
program may unexpectedly stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are issues with the Streets and Trips CD-ROM or
graphics-acceleration issues.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one or more of the following methods, as necessary, to determine the cause
of this behavior and to work around the issue.

Method 1: Reduce CD-ROM Caching and Prevent Read-Ahead
------------------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to reduce CD-ROM caching and prevent read-ahead activity:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click File System.

4. On the CD-ROM tab, note the current settings, and then move the "Supplemental
  cache size" slider to the Small position.

5. In the "Optimize access pattern for" box, click "No read-ahead".

6. Click OK, and then click Close.

7. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.

If these steps do not successfully resolve the issue, repeat the steps to restore
the settings to the original values noted in step 4, and then proceed to the
next method.

Method 2: Reduce Graphics Acceleration
--------------------------------------

Follow these steps to reduce graphics acceleration.

Microsoft Windows 98 and Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the "Hardware acceleration" slider one step to the left.

5. Click OK twice.

Microsoft Windows 2000:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Advanced.

4. On the Troubleshooting tab, move the "Hardware acceleration" slider one step
  to the left.

5. Click OK twice.

If reducing the graphics-acceleration level does not successfully resolve the
issue, repeat the steps again until you have tried reducing all
hardware-acceleration settings.

If reducing the graphics-acceleration level resolves the issue, contact your
video card manufacturer to inquire about how to obtain and install the latest
version of the video driver for your video adapter.

For information about how to contact your video card manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

To determine the manufacturer and model of your video adapter, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

  NOTE: In Windows 2000, click the Hardware tab, and then click Device Manager.

4. Click the plus sign (+) next to Display Adapters.

5. Under the Display Adapters branch, note the manufacturer and model of your
  video adapter.

6. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

For additional information about how to determine the version of the video driver
that is installed on your computer, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

If the behavior continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 3: Test CD-ROM for File Access
-------------------------------------

The Streets and Trips CD-ROM may have a scratch or other defect that prevents
access to the files. Follow these steps to determine whether any of the files on
the CD-ROM cannot be read:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "command" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

3. Type "xcopy drive &lt;letter&gt;:\*.* /s &gt; null" (without the quotation
  marks) (where &lt;letter&gt; is the drive letter of your computer's CD-ROM or
  DVD-ROM drive), and then press ENTER.

Depending on the speed of your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, these steps can take
several minutes to complete. If there are any files that cannot be read from the
CD-ROM, you will receive error messages indicating that the CD-ROM is damaged.
