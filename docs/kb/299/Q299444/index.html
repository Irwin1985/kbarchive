SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released a Security Rollup Package (SRP) for Windows NT 4.0 that
includes the functionality from all security patches released for Windows NT 4.0
since the release of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a)
(http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/SP6/allSP6.asp).
This small, comprehensive rollup of post-SP6a fixes provides an easier mechanism
for managing the rollout of security fixes. Applying the SRP does not change the
encryption level of your computer.

Compaq Array Controller Users: If you have installed the Compaq Array Controller
Driver (Cpqarray.sys) from the Compaq Web Site, Compaq FTP Site, or Compaq
SmartStart, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
regarding Compaq Array controllers and the Windows NT 4.0 SRP:

  Q305228 "STOP 0xA" Occurs After Applying Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup
  Package

Digital Signature Issue: If you are running Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2
(SP2) or Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and you access any secure
website (https://) that uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q305929 "This Certificate has an Invalid Digital Signature" Error Occurs
  After You Install the Windows NT 4.0 Security Rollup Package (SRP)

Microsoft IntelliPoint Users: If you use a version of Microsoft IntelliPoint
earlier than 2.2, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
before you install the SRP:

  Q305462 Mouse and Keyboard Stop Working After You Install the Windows NT 4.0
  Security Rollup Package

HP NTLock Users: If you use HP NTLock, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q311860 HP NTLOCK Services Fail to Start After Applying Windows NT 4.0
  Security Rollup Package (SRP)

If you add optional services, you must reapply the Windows NT 4.0 service pack
and then the SRP. For additional information, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q196269 When to Reinstall a Service Pack

If you need to add optional services, follow these steps:

1. Install all optional services and companion services. You will be prompted
  for the original Window NT 4.0 media.

2. After the files are installed from the original media, but before you restart
  your computer, reinstall Windows NT 4.0 SP6a. You must reinstall SP6a before
  you reinstall the SRP because the SRP requires SP6a.

3. Restart your computer.

4. Reinstall the SRP.

5. Restart your computer.

6. Install other post-SP6a hotfixes as necessary.

For additional information about how to install multiple hotfixes with only one
reboot, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q296861 Use QChain.exe to Install Multiple Hotfixes with One Reboot

7. Restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Patches are available from the following Microsoft Web site (if your language is
not listed, please check back):

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/critical/q299444/default.asp

NOTE: This patch requires Windows NT 4.0 SP6a
(http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/SP6/allSP6.asp).

Release Date: July 26, 2001

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. After it is posted, the file is housed on
secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: When you apply the Post-Windows NT 4.0 SP6a SRP (which includes the
security patch mentioned in bulletin MS01-026), be aware that the Post-Windows
NT 4.0 SP6a SRP may introduce new problems. To fix these new problems, install
the additional patches that are described in the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q299273 UPN Logon Option Does Not Work After You Apply Fix from MS01-026[iis]

  Q269430 Incorrect Error Message Double-Clicking Lock Icon in Secure
  Connection

Fixes Included in the SRP
-------------------------

The SRP includes all post-SP6a fixes that have been delivered via Microsoft
Security Bulletins
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/itsolutions/security/default.asp).
In addition, it also includes a small number of fixes that have not been
previously discussed. Because security bulletins are disruptive to customers'
normal maintenance procedures, Microsoft typically issues them only when a
security issue poses an immediate danger to your systems. Issues that do not
meet this standard are typically addressed through other delivery vehicles such
as service packs or, in this case, the SRP.
