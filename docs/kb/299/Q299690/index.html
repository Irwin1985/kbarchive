The following video adapters and chip sets have known video-related issues in
Train Simulator.

Known Video Issues
------------------

   - Although Train Simulator may work correctly with large or custom fonts,
  depending on monitor, desktop size, and screen resolution, it is recommended
  that you set your system's display settings to Small Fonts to maximize
  viewable space in Train Simulator dialog boxes.

- If you have a computer with 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM or less, and are using
  video cards with 16 MB or less, do not set the "World Objects Texture
  Quality" setting (in the Options dialog box) to greater than 2, or the game
  may stop responding (hang).

- The following resolutions are supported by most video cards and are available
  for selection (if supported): 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024.

- All resolutions provided by the video card at 640x480 resolution and greater
  are supported, in 16- and 32-bit color depths.

- Resolutions of 640x480 and less, or color depths other than 16- or 32-bit,
  are not supported.

- When you try to launch the game, you may receive the following error
  message:

  Unknown is causing an error in unknown. Unknown will now shut down.

   - The G100 lacks the needed features used by today's games. It does not have a
  3D setup engine like the G200 or G400. The only way you would be able to play
  today's games is through software mode. This is a hardware limitation. The
  G100 was designed for office work and not gaming. This is probably why you
  are seeing these errors.
