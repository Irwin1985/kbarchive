The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Service Pack 4, the DNS server begins logging Event 7062:

  DNS Server encountered a packet addresses to itself -- IP address w.x.y.z.
  The DNS server should never be sending a packet to itself. This situation
  usually indicates a configuration error.

  Check the following areas for possible self-send configuration errors:

  1) Forwarders list (DNS server should not forward to themselves).
  2) Master lists of secondary zones.
  3) Notify lists of primary zones.
  4) Delegations of subzones.

  Must not contain NS record for DNS server

  Example: -&gt; This DNS server dns1.microsoft.com is the primary for the zone
  microsoft.com. -&gt; You have delegated the zone bar.microsoft.com to
  bardns.bar.microsoft.com and are NOT running the bar.microsoft.com zone on
  this DNS (dns1.microsoft.com). Note, you should make this check (with
  nslookup of DNS manager) both on this DNS server and on the server(s) you
  delegated the subzone to. It is possible that the delegation was done
  correctly, but that the primary DNS for the subzone, has any incorrect NS
  record pointing back at this server. If this incorrect NS record is cached at
  this server, then the self-send could result. If found, the subzone DNS
  server admin should remove the offending NS record.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a configuration error or is the result of a delegation
of a domain (or subdomain) to a server for which there is no zone file (lame
delegation).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, check for the following conditions:

Forwarders:

DNS can be configured to forward off-site queries to designated servers. Be sure
that the DNS server is not configured to forward these off-site queries to
itself:

1. Select the server, click DNS, and then click Properties from the menu.

2. Click the Forwarders tab.

3. If the server's own IP address is listed, select it and click Remove.

4. After you make this change, make sure to stop and restart the DNS service.

Master List of Secondary Zones:

A secondary zone is configured with a list of the master or primary server(s). Be
sure that the server's own IP address is not listed as one of the IP master(s):

1. Select the secondary zone, click DNS, and then click Properties from the
  menu.

2. Click the General tab.

3. If the server's own IP address is listed in the IP Master(s) section, select
  it and click Remove.

Notify Lists:

Microsoft Windows NT DNS Server allows the Administrator to specify (on the
primary DNS server) any secondary DNS servers that should be notified
immediately of changes to the Zone file. Be sure that the DNS server is not
configured to notify itself:

1. Select the primary zone, click DNS, and then click Properties from the menu.

2. Click the Notify tab.

3. If the server's own IP address is listed, select it and click Remove.

Lame Delegation:

Lame delegation is defined as having a domain or subdomain delegated to a server
that is not authoritative for the domain (in other words, a zone file does not
exist for the domain on the server). There are two possible scenarios that can
cause lame delegation:

- Delegating a Child Domain to Itself

  If a child domain is created on a server and an NS record is added to that
  domain that resolves to its own IP address, an Event 7062 is generated. The
  following is an example:

   - DNS server ns1.domain.com is the primary DNS server for the domain.com
     zone. A child domain is created named child.domain.com and an NS record is
     added to child.domain.com for ns1.domain.com. This results in a child
     domain being delegated to itself. To resolve this issue, remove the NS
     record from child.domain.com. Only add NS records to child domains if you
     wish to delegate it to another server (that is, to delegate it to
     ns2.domain.com).

- Domain Delegated to Server with No Zone File

  If another DNS server has delegated a domain (either a forward lookup or
  reverse lookup domain) to a server and there is no zone file on the server
  for that domain, an Event 7062 is generated. The following are examples:

   - Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) has assigned you the Class C network
     of 192.168.1.0 and has delegated the 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain for
     reverse lookups to your DNS server. If there is no zone configured on your
     DNS server for that domain, event 7062 will be generated every time a
     query is made for that domain from the server. The DNS server will step
     through the DNS hierarchy starting at the root servers and eventually
     receive a response from the ISP's DNS server indicating that the server
     itself is authoritative for the domain and attempt to query itself. To
     resolve this issue, either create a primary or secondary zone for that
     domain, or have the ISP change the delegation.

   - Your ISP has delegated a domain to your caching-only DNS server. Because
     there are no zone files on a caching-only server, any queries that it
     makes for hosts that reside in domains for which it has been delegated
     authority will result in an event 7062 error. To resolve this issue,
     either create a primary or secondary zone file for that domain, or have
     the ISP change the delegation.
