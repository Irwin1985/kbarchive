  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If a non-administrative level user logs on interactively to your computer, it
may be possible for the user to gain local administrative privileges. A user may
load a non-Microsoft dynamic-link library (DLL) into memory having the same name
as a core operating system DLL and then programmatically change the entry in the
KnownDLLs list to point to the malicious copy. Programs then requesting the
system DLL will instead be directed to the malicious copy. When called by a
program with sufficiently high security privileges, it may be possible to bypass
typical security related activities such as adding a user to the Local
Administrators group. A remote user may also submit an arbitrary program to run
on your computer to exploit this vulnerability.

CAUSE
=====

In Windows NT, core operating system DLLs are kept in virtual memory and shared
between programs. This prevents redundant copies of the DLL in memory, and
improves memory usage and system performance. When a program calls a function
provided by one of these DLLs, the operating system refers to a data structure
called the KnownDLLs list to determine the location of the DLL in virtual
memory. The Windows NT security architecture protects in-memory DLLs against
modification, but by default it allows all users to read/write access to the
KnownDLLs list.

This vulnerability is only local to the computer where a malicious user is logged
on interactively. For example, a workstation user could exploit this
vulnerability to become a local administrator, but cannot use it directly to
become a domain administrator. This restricts the impact of this issue as
non-administrative users are not granted the ability to interactively log on to
servers (following recommended Microsoft security practices).

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: You should apply this fix to all systems that allow non-privileged users
to log in to them.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, enable stronger protection on system base objects such
as the KnownDLLs list by doing the following:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. On the Windows menu, click "HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE on Local Machine".

3. Double-click the \System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager folder.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, type "ProtectionMode" (without the
  quotation marks), click REG_DWORD in the Data Type box, and then click OK.

5. Type "1" (without the quotation marks) in the Data box, and then click OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
