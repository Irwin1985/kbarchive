-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the host supports LU6.2 persistent verification or already verified security,
and an APPC application calls TP_STARTED once, followed by multiple
[MC_]ALLOCATE requests for consecutive conversations, the User ID provided in
subsequent [MC_]ALLOCATE requests may be ignored, causing the persistent
verification session to be used.

However, if the APPC application issues a new TP_STARTED for every [MC_]ALLOCATE
request, this problem does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

The Wappc32.dll file was failing to clear the user_id field on subsequent
allocation requests (where security=AP_SAME) made over an LU6.2 session that
supports persistent verification or already verified security.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0.
This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 3.0 Service Pack 4 and
SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

APPC applications which call TP_STARTED before every [MC_]ALLOCATE will not
encounter this problem.

This problem occurs in the following conditions:

- The LU6.2 session supports either "persistent verification" or "already
  verified" security.

- The APPC application must call TP_STARTED once, followed by consecutive
  [MC_]ALLOCATE requests, with security = AP_SAME and a user_id and password is
  specified.

The SNA Server APPC API and message traces will reveal the following behavior. In
this case, the APPC application issues three consecutive MC_ALLOCATE requests
with security=AP_SAME along with userID and password on a session that supports
persistent verification. But, the Wappc32.dll file appears to resend the initial
user ID over and over, ignoring the user ID provided by the application:

1. APPC app issues MC_ALLOCATE, sends userid = WNW039, password = WHYNOT1, FMH-5
  includes userid = WNW039, password = WHYNOT1

2. APPC app issues MC_ALLOCATE, sends userid = WNWXXX, password = YYYY, FMH-5
  includes userid = WNW039, password = YYYY

3. APPC app issues MC_ALLOCATE, sends userid = XXXX, password = ZZZZZ, FMH-5
  includes userid = WNW039, password = ZZZZZ

Note that the APPC DLL always sends the same user ID, ignoring the user ID
provided in the verb control block by the application.
