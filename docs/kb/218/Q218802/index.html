-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When Key Management (KM) Server administrators choose to issue X.509 v3
certificates (or issue both v1 and v3), they receive the following error message
when they click OK on the dialog box that shows the certificate server to use:

  The KMS database had an error - c1031d9f

The following event is logged in the event viewer application log:

  Event ID: 5017
  Source: MSExchangeKMS
  Type: Error
  Category: none
  Description: KMS Admin &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;account&gt; failed to set the
  CertServer configuration.

CAUSE
=====

The organization name contains a special character such as a comma (,),
underscore (_), and so on.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Setup Program

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Srvrmax.exe | 5.5.1960.10 | 
+---------------------------+
| Srvrmin.exe | 5.5.1960.10 | 
+---------------------------+



After you obtain the fix, follow these steps to apply it:

1. Create a new folder on your hard disk, and then copy the contents of the
  Server\Setup\I386 folder from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM to this new
  folder.

2. Rename the Setup.exe file in the folder on the hard disk to Setup.old, and
  then rename the Srvrmax.exe or Srvrmin.exe file to Setup.exe. Note that the
  Srvrmax.exe file should be used for the Enterprise edition of Exchange Server
  5.5 and the Srvrmin.exe file should be used for the Standard edition of
  Exchange Server 5.5.

3. Run Setup.exe from the folder on the hard disk.

4. When the installation process is finished, apply the latest service pack for
  Exchange Server 5.5, even if it was already applied previously. For
  additional information about how to obtain the latest service pack for
  Exchange Server 5.5, click the article number below to view the article in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you are using X.509 V1 certificates, the steps listed below remove
the key history for all users. If you have users who will still be using
X.509.V1, do not run the steps below and please call Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS) and reference this article.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. From a command prompt, run net stop certsvc to stop the Certificate Authority
  Service.

2. Open the registry and change the value for the following key from "," to
  "!":

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\CertSrc\Configuration\&lt;Certificate
  Name&gt;\Subject Name Separator

  NOTE: The value should be punctuation characters only such as the comma (,),
  period (.), semicolon (;), or exclamation mark (!). The default is a comma
  (,). It also needs to be a punctuation mark that is not present in the
  organization name.

3. From a command prompt, run net stop msexchangekms to stop the KMS service.

4. Make a backup of the Kmsdata folder.

5. Delete all the files in the Kmsdata folder.

6. From a command prompt, change directory to point to the C:\Exchsrvr\Bin
  folder, and run the following command:

  "kmserver -I &lt;password&gt; -X "c=us, o=\" &lt;OrgName&gt;\",
  ou=&lt;SiteName&gt;, cn=certificate authority"" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;password&gt; is your KMS password, &lt;OrgName&gt; is your
  organization name, and &lt;SiteName&gt; is your site name.

7. Restart the services. You should now be able to use X.509 V3 certificates.
