SUMMARY
=======

This article contains specific questions and answers regarding the Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is the maximum possible bit rate for Windows applications?

  A. Windows 3.1 allows applications to select bit rates as high as 57.6
  kilobits per second (Kbps). However, how well data can be transmitted and
  received at high speeds depends on the variables listed below. With Windows
  3.1, a 19.2 Kbps XModem transfer should run well on a 20MHz 386. Factors
  affecting top bit rate in Windows applications include the following:

  a. CPU Speed. Faster CPUs allow faster data throughput with fewer errors.
     This is because they allow the COM driver to service character interrupts
     faster, which prevents UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
     overflow and allows applications to handle transfer protocols better. If
     you experience slow serial performance or a loss of characters on a
     286-based machine, try the following:

     1. Reduce the number of MS-DOS drivers and terminate-and-stay- resident
        (TSR) programs.

     2. Do not load MS-DOS 5.0 into upper memory.

     3. Add the following line to the SYSTEM.INI file:

  " FasterModeSwitch=1." (without the quotation marks)

     For more information on FasterModeSwitch and other SYSTEM.INI file
     switches, see the SYSINI.WRI file in the WINDOWS directory.

  b. Transfer Protocols. Data transmission protocols, such as XModem, YModem,
     and ZModem, vary greatly in robustness in multitasking environments. Some
     are designed to be very fast and provide little error checking; others are
     slower but provide error correction. XModem and ZModem usually work well
     with Windows, even at high speeds.

  c. Serial Port Hardware. Newer serial ports use the 16550 Universal
     Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART), which contains a buffer to
     reduce overhead and prevent overflow.

  d. System Overhead. The more applications, TSRs, and device drivers that are
     running, the busier the operating system is. This reduces overall
     execution time for every user in the system. If many programs and devices
     are active while trying to transmit data at high speeds, reduced
     throughput and transmission errors are likely to result.

2. Q. What is the maximum possible bit rate for MS-DOS applications running in
  Windows?

  A. MS-DOS serial communications applications are designed to run in a
  non-multitasking environment; therefore, they make assumptions about the
  operating system and devices that may not always be true for a multitasking
  operating system. These applications may allow the selection of speeds as
  high as 115 Kbps. While these speeds may work well in MS-DOS alone, reduced
  data throughput should be expected when running these applications in a
  multitasking operating system.

  The guidelines listed above for Windows serial communications applications
  also apply to MS-DOS-based applications. However, the following guidelines
  are important for MS-DOS-based applications running within Windows 386
  enhanced mode:

  a. Full-Screen v. Windowed v. Minimized. MS-DOS-based applications run best
     in full-screen mode; they receive foreground priority and avoid the
     overhead of display virtualization. Although MS-DOS-based applications
     running in a foreground window receive foreground execution priority, the
     overhead of updating the window can seriously reduce application
     performance. If you want to run an MS-DOS-based communications application
     in the background during a data transfer, run it as an icon rather than in
     a window.

  b. Foreground and Background Execution Priority. Windows allocates execution
     time for MS-DOS applications according to foreground and background
     priorities that are supplied in a .PIF file. If the application is not
     getting the time slices it needs to process incoming data, errors occur
     during data transfer. Increase the application's background execution
     priority in the .PIF file to prevent errors when receiving data in the
     background. Make sure that background execution is specified in the PIF
     file.

  c. Lock Application Memory Option. To allow more MS-DOS-based applications to
     run simultaneously, Windows 3.1 386 enhanced mode swaps application memory
     to disk. This can slow the execution of the MS-DOS-based applications and
     significantly reduce communications performance. You can disable this
     swapping of application memory in the MS-DOS communications application's
     .PIF file by checking the Lock Application Memory check box in the
     Advanced Options dialog box of the PIF Editor. Note that this setting
     applies only if a permanent swap file is allocated and 32-bit disk access
     is enabled.

3. Q. Does Windows 3.1 support the 16550 UART buffer?

  A. Many serial port adapters and add-in modems now use the 16550 Universal
  Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART), which contains a 16-byte character
  buffer to reduce interrupt overhead and errors during high-speed serial
  transmissions. The Windows 3.1 COM driver enables this buffer for Windows
  serial communications applications in order to reduce interrupt overhead and
  improve serial throughput at high speeds. Windows applications do not need to
  call a special API to receive this support, it is automatically enabled. To
  determine if serial ports use the 16550 UART, run the Microsoft Diagnostics
  (MSD.EXE) outside of Windows 3.1.

  Windows 3.1 does NOT enable the 16550 buffer for MS-DOS communications
  applications. When running in Windows 386 enhanced mode, 16550-aware MS-DOS
  communications applications may fail to detect and enable the UART buffer.
  This is because Windows is doing its own buffering of the COM port for the
  application. To allow 16550- aware MS-DOS communications applications to
  enable the FIFO, disable Windows' buffering of a COM port by adding
  "COMxBuffer=0" in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI file, where x= the ID of
  the COM port (for example, "COM1Buffer=0"). This may improve serial
  communications performance under certain conditions.

  Some older 16550 UART versions do not properly support the buffer and may
  cause problems. Windows can detect many of these and will not enable the
  buffer. However, if problems are encountered, the 16550 support may need to
  be manually disabled by adding "COMxFIFO=0" to the [386Enh] section of
  SYSTEM.INI file. For more information on COMxFIFO and other SYSTEM.INI
  switches, see the SYSINI.WRI file in the WINDOWS directory.

4. Q. A Windows communications application replaced the Windows 3.0 driver.
  Should this driver continue to be used with Windows 3.1?

  A. The Windows 3.1 communications driver will probably provide better support
  than some replacement communications drivers developed for Windows 3.0.
  However, if the replacement communications driver provides special device
  support or features specific to the application, continue to use it with
  Windows 3.1. If not using a 3.1 version communications driver, then add the
  following line to the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI file: "COMMdrv30=TRUE".
  For more information on COMMdrv30 and other SYSTEM.INI switches, see the file
  SYSINI.WRI in the WINDOWS directory.

5. Q. I use Pacific Commware's TurboCom with Windows 3.0. Should I use TurboCom
  with Windows 3.1?

  A. Windows 3.1 corrects most of the problems that TurboCom was developed to
  alleviate in Windows 3.0 and provides additional communications features.
  Windows 3.1 also provides Windows application support for the 16550 buffer,
  which TurboCom provides in Windows 3.0.

  Unlike TurboCom, Windows 3.1 does not enable the 16550 buffer for MS-DOS
  communications applications. However, if you follow the above guidelines for
  using fast bit rates, these applications may not require TurboCom in Windows
  3.1. Also, if you use TurboCom to run Windows-based applications at bit rates
  higher than they provide options to select, using TurboCom until the
  application is updated to support higher bit rates with Windows 3.1 may be
  desirable.

  In general, if the Windows 3.1 communications driver meets your needs, use it,
  rather than a third-party driver. This helps achieve full Windows 3.1
  compatibility.
