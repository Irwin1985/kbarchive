SUMMARY
=======

The information contained in this article is contained in the WININI.WRI file in
the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1. The WININI.WRI file may be viewed within the Windows Write utility
in the Windows Accessories Group.

The WININI.WRI file contains specific information about the entries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WIN.INI File Settings
---------------------

Windows initialization files contain information that defines your
Windows environment. Windows and Windows applications can use the
information stored in these files to configure themselves to meet your
needs and preferences.

There are two standard Windows initialization files:

1. WIN.INI, which primarily contains settings that you can use to
  customize your Windows environment according to your preferences.

2. SYSTEM.INI, which primarily contains settings that you can use to
  customize Windows to meet your system's hardware needs.

Caution: Changing settings can lead to undesirable results when you
run Windows. Before changing any setting, read "Changing Settings"
later in this document.

Format of the WIN.INI File
--------------------------

The WIN.INI file contains several sections, each of which consists of
a group of related settings. The sections and settings are listed in
the WIN.INI file in the following format:

 [section name]
 keyname=value

In this example, [section name] is the name of a section. The
enclosing brackets ([]) are required, and the left bracket must be in
the leftmost column on the screen.

The keyname=value statement defines the value of each setting. A
keyname is the name of a setting. It can consist of any combination of
letters and digits, and must be followed immediately by an equal sign
(=). The value can be an integer, a string, or a quoted string,
depending on the setting.

You can include comments in initialization files. You must begin each
line of  a comment with a semicolon (;).

Sections in the WIN.INI File
----------------------------

The sections described in the list below most often appear in the
WIN.INI file. Your WIN.INI file might not have all of these sections,
or it might have additional sections, depending on your system's
hardware and software requirements and configuration. For example, if
you install a printer or set up applications, additional sections and
settings might be inserted by your applications or the software that
controls your printer. Refer to your application's documentation for
information on those sections and settings.

The following sections appear in WIN.INI and in this document in the
following order (however, the order of these sections is not
important):

Section         Does
-------         ----

[windows]       Affects several elements of your Windows environment.

[desktop]       Controls the appearance of the screen background

Updating WIN.INI from Previous Versions of Windows
--------------------------------------------------

If you update your system to Windows version 3.1 from Windows version
3.0, Setup automatically updates your WIN.INI file by making the
following changes:

In the [windows] section, Setup adds three new settings:

KeyboardDelay=
ScreenSaverTimeout=
DosPrint=

If the following settings are already present in the 3.0 version of
the WIN.INI file, Setup will not change them. If they are not present,
Setup will add them:

Device=
Documents=
Programs=com exe bat pif

In the [extensions] section, Setup adds one new setting:

bmp=pbrush.exe ^.bmp

Setup adds two new settings, if they are not already present in the
3.0 version of the WIN.INI file:

pcx=pbrush.exe ^.pcx
rec=recorder.exe ^.rec

In the [ports] section, Setup adds:

LPT1.DOS
LPT2.DOS

Setup adds three additional settings, if they are not already present
in the 3.0 version of WIN.INI:

FILE:
COM3:=9600,n,8,1,x
COM4:=9600,n,8,1,x

Setup adds the following section and settings to support TrueType
fonts:

[FontSubstitutes]
Helv=MS Sans Serif
Tms Rmn=MS Serif
Times=Times New Roman
Helvetica=Arial

Setup adds the following sections and settings to support multimedia:

[mci extensions]
wav=waveaudio
mid=sequencer
rmi=sequencer

Setup adds the following sections and settings to support sound:

[sounds]
SystemDefault=ding.wav, Default Beep
SystemExclamation=chord.wav, Exclamation
SystemStart=tada.wav, Windows Start
SystemExit=chimes.wav, Windows Exit
SystemHand=chord.wav, Critical Stop
SystemQuestion=chord.wav, Question
SystemAsterisk=chord.wav, Asterisk

Setup adds the following section and settings to support OLE:

[embedding]
SoundRec=Sound,Sound,SoundRec.exe,picture
Package=Package,Package,packager.exe,picture
PBrush=Paintbrush Picture,Paintbrush Picture,pbrush.exe,picture

Setup also makes additional changed, depending on the applications and
devices installed on your system.

How to Read this Document
-------------------------

In this document, WIN.INI settings are listed alphabetically within
sections. However, the settings do not appear alphabetically in the
WIN.INI file. If you want to change a setting, you will have to search
for it within the appropriate section.

This document lists the syntax, purpose, and recommended method for
changing each setting using the following format:

SettingName=&lt;value-type&gt;

Default:        This is Windows' built-in value for this setting.
Purpose:        This paragraph briefly describes the function of the
setting
               and its default value (if applicable).
To change:      This sentence states the recommended method for changing
               the value of this setting.

The &lt;value-type&gt; indicates whether the value should be a number, a
letter, a range of numbers, or something else.

Changing Settings
-----------------

When the Setup program created the WIN.INI, file it assigned default
values to the settings. Some settings that are listed in this
document, may not appear in your WIN.INI file. These settings have the
default value. You might want to change one or more of these values to
change the appearance or performance of Windows to suit your needs.

&lt;B&gt;Caution&lt;/B&gt;:  Always back up your WIN.INI file before you make changes so that you can restore the original file in cause you accidentally damage
the WIN.INI file or make changes that cause problems when running
Windows.

There are two ways to change WIN.INI settings:

By using Control Panel to change most settings. This is the safest
and most recommended way because there is no need to open the
WIN.INI file, where it is easier to make mistakes. For more
information on Control Panel, see Chapter 5, "Control Panel," in the
Windows User's Guide.

By using a text editor, such as Notepad, to edit the WIN.INI file
directly. (Don't use a formatting editor; it can corrupt your
WIN.INI file.) This is the method you must use to change the
settings that cannot be changed with Control Panel. After you have
edited the WIN.INI file, you must restart Windows for the settings
to take affect. For more information on how to use Notepad, see
Chapter 12, "Additional Accessories," in the Windows User's Guide.

Caution:  Be extra careful when using a text editor to edit the
WIN.INI file. Incorrect changes to WIN.INI can cause unexpected
results when you run Windows. In addition, some editors can damage
certain characters  (those with ANSI values of greater than 127). It
is recommended that you use Notepad to change the settings that cannot
be changed with Control Panel. The listings in this document indicate
which settings you can change with Control Panel.

[windows] Section Settings
--------------------------

The [windows] section contains settings that affect the following
parts of your Windows environment:

 Applications that start when you start Windows
 Warning beep
 Printing
 Window border width
 Keyboard speed
 Mouse settings
 Definition of files as documents or programs

The [windows] section can contain the following settings:

Beep=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;

Default:        Yes
Purpose:        If this setting is enabled, Windows sounds a warning
               beep when you  attempt to do something that is not
               allowed.
To change:      Choose the Sound icon from the Control Panel window.

BorderWidth=&lt;number&gt;

Default:        3
Purpose:        Sets the width of the borders around all the windows on
               your desktop except those that have a fixed size. The
               allowed range is 1 (narrowest) to 49 (widest).
To change:      Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.

CoolSwitch=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:        1
Purpose:        Turns fast task switching on or off. A value of 1 turns
               this feature on. A value of 0 turns it off.
To change:      Choose the Desktop icon in the Control Panel window and
               select or clear the Fast "Alt+TAB" Switching check box.
____________________________________________________________
CursorBlinkRate=&lt;milliseconds&gt;

Default:        530
Purpose:        Indicates how many milliseconds elapse between each blink
of
               the selection cursor.
To change:      Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
_____________________________________________________________
Device=&lt;output-device-name&gt;, &lt;device-driver&gt;, &lt;port-connection&gt;

Default:        None
Purpose:        Defines the default printer. The &lt;output-device-name&gt; value
               can be any device name given in the [devices] section. An
               explicit port and driver must be assigned to the device.
The
               &lt;device-driver&gt; value is the filename (without the
extension)
               of the device-driver file. The &lt;port-connection&gt; value is
any
               portname given in the [ports] section.
To change:      Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window or
               the Printer Setup command from the Print Manager Options
               menu.
_____________________________________________________________
DefaultQueueSize=&lt;number&gt;

Default:        8
Purpose:        Specifies the number of messages an application's message
               queue can hold.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file. (You should never
               need to change this setting.)
____________________________________________________________
DeviceNotSelectedTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;

Default:        15
Purpose:        Specifies the default number of seconds for Windows to wait
               for a device to be switched on. A value is saved for each
               printer listed in the [PrinterPorts] section. If the device
               is not turned on during this time, Windows won't print to
the
               device. Note that for some devices, Windows immediately
               displays an error message if the device is not already
turned
               on.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file. This setting serves
               only as the system default value. To change the value for a
               particular printer, choose the Printers icon from the
Control
               Panel window or the Printer Setup command from the Print
               Manager Options menu. This changes the corresponding value
               only in the [PrinterPorts] section.
____________________________________________________________
Documents=&lt;extensions&gt;

Default:        None
Purpose:        Defines files that are considered "documents" by Windows
               File Manager. The listings in the [extensions] section also
               determine which files File Manager recognizes as document
               files, and associates them with a particular application.
The
               extensions listed here are not associated with any
               application. Use this setting to define only document file
               extensions that are not in the [extensions] section.
Separate
               extension names with a space, and do not include the
               preceding periods.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
DosPrint=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;

Default:        No
Purpose:        Specifies whether Windows should use MS-DOS interrupts
               when printing. When this setting is yes, MS-DOS interrupts
               are used. When this setting is no, printing output is sent
               directly to the port that the printer is assigned to.
To change:      Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window or
               the Printer Setup command from the Print Manager Options
               menu, and then clear the Fast Printing Direct to Port check
               box in the Connect dialog box.
____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickHeight=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:        4
Purpose:        Specifies the height (in pixels) that the mouse pointer can
               move between clicks in a double-click. If the mouse pointer
               is moved further up or down,  the two clicks will be
treated
               as separate single clicks. For example, if
               DoubleClickHeight=10, the mouse pointer cannot move
               vertically more than 5 pixels between clicks for the two
               clicks to be recognized as a double-click. If you enter an
               odd number, it is rounded up to the nearest even number.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickSpeed=&lt;milliseconds&gt;

Default:        452
Purpose:        Establishes the maximum amount of time between clicks of
               the mouse button that the system will permit for one double-
               click. The lower the value, the less time you have to click
               twice in order to effect a double-click.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________
DoubleClickWidth=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:        4
Purpose:        Specifies the width (in pixels) that the mouse pointer can
               move between clicks in a double-click. If the mouse pointer
               is moved further right or left, the two clicks will be
               treated as separate single clicks. For example, if
               DoubleClickWIDTH=10, the mouse pointer cannot move
               horizontally more than 5 pixels between clicks for the two
               clicks to be recognized as a double-click. If you enter an
               odd number, it is rounded up to the nearest even number.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
KeyboardDelay=&lt;milliseconds&gt;

Default:        2
Purpose:        Establishes how much time elapses after you hold down a key
               before the key starts to repeat.
To change:      Choose the Keyboard icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________
KeyboardSpeed=&lt;milliseconds&gt;

Default:        31
Purpose:        Establishes how much time elapses between repetitions of a
               character on the display when you hold down a keyboard key.
               This setting does not  work for all keyboards. If you
delete
               this setting from WIN.INI, Windows Setup will not set this
               speed, but the speed will still be set if you choose the
               Keyboard icon in Control Panel (even if you cancel out of
               it).
To change:      Choose the Keyboard icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________
Load=&lt;filename(s)&gt;

Default:        none
Purpose:        Specifies one or more applications that will run as icons
               when Windows is started. This value is a list of one or
more
               program filenames for applications, or documents that are
               associated with an application, each separated by a space.
               Make sure you specify the complete path if the application
or
               document is not located in the Windows directory.
To change:      Add the application to the Startup group in Program
               Manager and then, select the Minimize on Use check box in
the
               Properties dialog box.
____________________________________________________________
MenuDropAlignment=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:        0
Purpose:        Specifies whether menus open so that they are right aligned
               or left aligned with the menu title. If this setting is 0,
               menus open so that they are left aligned. If it is 1, menus
               open so that they are right aligned.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
MenuShowDelay=&lt;milliseconds&gt;

Default:        0 for 386 computers; 400 for 286 computers
Purpose:        Specifies how long to wait before displaying a cascading
               menu.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
MouseSpeed=&lt;0-or-1-or-2&gt;

Default:        1
Purpose:        Establishes the relationship between mouse movement and
               cursor movement when the value of either MouseThreshold1 or
               MouseThreshold2 is exceeded. When this occurs, Windows
causes
               cursor movement to accelerate according to the value of
               MouseSpeed. If it is 0,  there is no acceleration. If it is
               1, the cursor is moved twice the normal speed when mouse
               movement exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1. If  it is 2,
               the cursor is moved twice the normal speed when mouse
               movement exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1 or four times
               the normal speed if mouse movement exceeds MouseThreshold2.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________
MouseThreshold1=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:        5
Purpose:        Establishes the maximum number of pixels that the mouse can
               move between mouse interrupts before Windows alters the
               relationship between mouse movement and cursor movement. If
               the mouse movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is
               greater than zero, Windows moves the cursor at twice the
               normal speed.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________
MouseThreshold2=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:        10
Purpose:        Establishes the maximum number of pixels that the mouse can
               move between mouse interrupts before Windows alters the
               relationship between mouse movement and cursor movement. If
               the mouse movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is
               equal to 2, Windows moves the cursor at four times the
normal
               speed.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________
MouseTrails=&lt;number&gt;

Default:        None
Purpose:        Specifies the number of pointers shown on the screen when
the
               MouseTrails option is selected. You can specify a number
               between 1 and 7. Note: This setting is supported only if
you
               are using an EGA, VGA or SuperVGA display driver.
To change:      Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window or,
               if the Mouse dialog box in Control Panel does not include
               the MouseTrails option, use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI
file.
____________________________________________________________
NetWarn=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:        1
Purpose:        Specifies whether Windows should display a warning message
if
               your system is configured to run a network and the network
is
               not running or the wrong network is running. All Windows

Purpose:        Specifies a pattern that is used to paint the screen
               background. The eight numeric values define a bitmap eight
               pixels wide and eight pixels high. Each decimal value
               represents a byte, and each byte represents a row of eight
               pixels. The following shows the effect of setting a bit:

  Setting      Effect
  0            Sets the corresponding pixel to the
               background color specified by the Background
               setting in the [colors] section).

  1            Sets the corresponding pixel to the foreground
               color (specified the WindowText setting in the
               [colors] section).

For example, if you set the &lt;b1&gt; value to the decimal value
175, the top row of pixels in the bitmap will appear as the
binary equivalent (10101111) according to the preceding
table.

To change:      Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________

               of the file if it is not in  the Windows or system
directory.
To change:      Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________

[extensions] Section Settings

The [extensions] section contains settings that link groups of
document files with an application so that opening one of the document
files automatically starts the application.

The [extensions] section can contain settings of the following type:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;extension&gt;=&lt;command-line&gt;

Purpose:        Contains a list of filename extensions that identify
               documents, and corresponding command lines that are invoked
               when you choose a file that has  the associated extensions.

               The &lt;extension&gt; keyname is an extension of one to three
               characters. The &lt;command-line&gt; value is an ordinary DOS
               command line. The command line always begins with an
               application filename (with the .EXE extension). This can be
               followed by any command parameters the application needs,
               usually including the document filename. The caret (^)
               character can be used when the original document filename
is
               needed in the command line; the caret is replaced by the
               document filename without any extension. The most typical
               &lt;extension&gt; entries list the application name and the
               document name; for example:

               cal=calendar.exe ^.cal

               If you run a file called MYFILE.CAL after this association
               has been made, the Calendar progam will start and
               automatically open the file named MYFILE.

To change:      Choose Associate from the File menu in File Manager.
____________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________

[ports] Section

The [ports] section lists all available communications and printer
ports, and defines default values; it also lists files to which
printer output can be sent.

The [ports] section can contain up to 10 occurrences of the following
setting. Any additional occurrences are ignored by Windows.
____________________________________________________________
&lt;portname&gt;:=&lt;baud-rate&gt;,&lt;parity&gt;,&lt;word-length&gt;,&lt;stop-bits&gt;[[,p]]

Purpose:        Specifies an available output port. You can specify no more
               than 10 ports.

               The &lt;portname&gt; keyname must be the name of an output port
as
               it is recognized by MS-DOS. This keyname can be COMx:
(serial
               port, where x represents the port number), LPTx: (a
parallel
               port, where x represents the port number), EPT: (used for a
               specific IBM printer), LPTx.DOS (a parallel port used to
               bypass Windows printing and print directly to a port, where
x
               represents the port number), FILE:, or a filename.

               For COM ports, the &lt;baud-rate&gt; value specifies the port's
               baud rate; the &lt;word-length&gt; value gives the length of a
word
               (in bits); the &lt;stop-bits&gt; value gives the number of stop
               bits to be used; and the [[,p]] option specifies that
               hardware handshaking is in effect.

               LPT (parallel), EPT, FILE, and LPTx.DOSports do not take
any
               parameters.

               The LPTx.DOS ports are used (instead of the corresponding
LPT
               port) to print directly to the port and bypass the Windows'
               special output handling. This port is provides compatiblity
               with Windows version 3.0.

               Specifying a filename for the &lt;portname&gt; will direct output
               to that file. A filename, unlike the other port names, must
               not be followed by a colon (:).

               By using FILE:=, Windows will prompt you to specify a
               filename for the print file when you print.

To change COM port settings: Choose the Ports icon from the Control Panel
               window. To change or add other ports:  Use Notepad to edit
               the WIN.INI file.

LPT2.DOS=&lt;pathname&gt;
LPT3.DOS=&lt;pathname&gt;
LPT4.DOS=&lt;pathname&gt;

Default:        None
Purpose:        Enables printing directly to a parallel port. Use these
               settings to bypass Windows' special parallel port output
               handling when printing.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

[fonts] Section Settings

The [fonts] section describes one or more font files that are loaded
when Windows is started.

The [fonts] section can contain one or more occurrences of the
following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;font-name&gt;=&lt;font-file&gt;

Purpose:        Specifies a font file. The &lt;font-name&gt; keyname is the
               descriptive name of a font. The &lt;font-file&gt; value is the
               filename of a file that contains font resources.
To change:     Choose the Fonts icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________

[FontSubstitutes] Section Settings

The [FontSubstitutes] section describes fonts which are recognized by
Windows as the same typeface. This is useful if you want to work on
documents created using Windows 3.0 that include fonts whose names
have changed in Windows 3.1.

The [FontSubstitutes] section contains one or more occurrences of the
following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;font-name&gt;=&lt;font-name&gt;

Default:        Helv=MS Sans Serif
               Tms Rmn=MS Serif
               Times=Times New Roman
               Helvetica=Arial
Purpose:        Specifies the font that Windows will use in place of
               another font, only if that font is not installed on your
               system. For example, if you are viewing a document that is
               formatted in Helvetica, but Helvetica is not installed on
               your system, Windows will use Arial to display the
document.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

[TrueType] Section Settings

The [TrueType] section describes options that affect the use and
display of TrueType fonts in your Windows applications.

The [TrueType] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
OutlineThreshold=&lt;number-of-pels-per-em&gt;

Default:        256
Purpose:        Specifies the number of pels-per-em at which Windows will
               render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap
               fonts. Using bitmap fonts is faster, but requires more
               memory. If you are low on memory, decrease this value. Do
not
               specify a value over 300. If you do, you might encounter
               problems using  TrueType fonts.
To change:     Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
TTEnable=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:        1
Purpose:        Enables or disables TrueType fonts. Setting this value to 1
               enables TrueType fonts so that they are available in your
               Windows applications. Setting this value to 0 disables
               TrueType fonts. In this case, TrueType fonts are not
               available in your applications.
To change:      Choose the Fonts icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________
TTIfCollisions=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:        0
Purpose:        Specifies whether or not to use TrueType fonts in place of
               other fonts if both types of fonts are installed on your
               system and have the same font name. If this value is set to
               1, the TrueType font will be used. For example, Windows
               provides both a bitmap and a TrueType version of the Symbol
               font. If you set this value to 0, Windows will use the
               TrueType version.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
TTOnly=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:        0
Purpose:        Specifies whether or not to list only TrueType fonts in the
               fonts dialog box in Windows applications. If this value is
               set to 1, only TrueType fonts are listed. If this value is
               set to 0, all fonts installed on your system are listed.
To change:      Choose the Fonts icon from the Control Panel window.
____________________________________________________________

the following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;extension&gt;=&lt;mci-device-type&gt;

Purpose:        Associates files that have the specified extension with the
               specified MCI device driver. Windows uses the specified
               driver to play the media file associated with it.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

[network] Section Settings

Default:        1
Purpose:        Specifies whether or not to reconnect to the network
servers
               you were connected to in your previous Windows session.
This
               setting works for MSNet, Lan Manager Basic, and Lan Manager
               2.0. If this value is set to 1, you will be reconnected to
               the network servers each time you start Windows. If this
               value is set to 0, you will not be reconnected.
To change:      Choose the Networks option from the Control Panel window,
               or if the Network dialog box for your network does not
               include a reconnect option, use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI
               file.
____________________________________________________________
&lt;port&gt;=&lt;network printer path&gt;

Purpose:        Shows the path for a network printer and the port the

[embedding] Section Settings

The [embedding] section lists the OLE objects, their description, the
program that is used to create them, and their file format. This
information also appears in the Registration Info Editor. It is recommended
that you use the Registration Info Editor to register applications or edit
application information for OLE. The [embedding] section is included in the
WIN.INI file only to maintain compatibility with Windows 3.0 and 3.0
applications.

The [embedding] section can contain one or more occurrences of the
following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;object&gt;=&lt;description&gt;,&lt;description&gt;,&lt;program file&gt;,&lt;format&gt;

Purpose:        Specifies the objects used as servers for OLE. The &lt;object&gt;
               keyname specifies the name of the server object.

               The &lt;description&gt; keynames provide a description of the
               server object. The second description appears in the list
of
               registered file types in the Registration Info Editor.

               The &lt;program file&gt; keyname identifies the path and name of
               the executable file for the application that is used to
               create the object.

               The &lt;format&gt; keyname identifies the format of the file. The
               value for this setting is most often "picture", which is
               metafile format.

To change:      Run the Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) from File
               Manager or from Program Manager.
____________________________________________________________

[Windows Help] Section Settings

The [Windows Help] section includes settings that specify the size and
placement of the Help window and dialog boxes, as well as the color of
text that, when chosen, displays a macro, pop-up window, or new panel.

The [Windows Help] section can include the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
M_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
H_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
A_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;
C_WindowPosition=&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;,&lt;number&gt;

Purpose:        Defines the default size and position of the main Help
               window, and the History, Annotate, and Copy dialog boxes.

               The first &lt;number&gt; defines the x coordinate of the upper-
left
               corner. The second &lt;number&gt; defines the y coordinate of the
               upper-left corner. Both these numbers define the default
               position of the main Help window, and the History,
Annotate,
               and Copy dialog boxes.

               The third &lt;number&gt; defines the default width of the Help
               window and dialog boxes. The fourth &lt;number&gt; defines the
               default height of the Help window and dialog boxes. Both
               height and width are measured in pixels.

               The fifth &lt;number&gt; specifies whether or not the main Help
               window is maximized. A value of 1 indicates that it is
               maximized. A value of 0 indicates that the main window is
the
               default height and width. Changing this value has no effect
               on the size of the dialog boxes, since they cannot be
               maximized.

To change:      Move or size the main Help window, or the History,
               Annotate, or Copy dialog boxes. The values are updated in
the
               WIN.IN file automatically.
____________________________________________________________
JumpColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:        Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, leads to a
new
               panel of help information. For example, entering 000 000
000
               as values results in black text on a white background.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
PopupColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:        Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, displays a
               pop-up panel (the type of panel used for glossary
               definitions). For example, entering 000 000 000 as values
               results in black text on a white background.
To change:      Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
MacroColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

____________________________________________________________

[PrinterPorts] Section Settings

The [PrinterPorts] section lists the printers Windows can use and the
printer driver, port assignment, and timeout values for each printer.

The [PrinterPorts] section can contain one or more occurrences of the
following setting:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;device-name&gt;=&lt;driver-name&gt;, &lt;port-name&gt;,
&lt;DeviceNotSelectedTimeout&gt;,&lt;TransmissionRetryTimeout&gt;
[[,&lt;port-name&gt;,&lt;DeviceNotSelectedTimeout&gt;,
&lt;TransmissionRetryTimeout&gt;,...]]

Purpose:        Specifies driver, port, and timeout information for a
               printer.

               The &lt;device-name&gt; keyname is the name of the printer. The
               &lt;driver-name&gt;  value is the printer driver filename.

               The &lt;port-name&gt; value is the name of the port assigned to
the
               printer. If a printer is not assigned to a port the
               &lt;port-name&gt; value is the string specified in the NullPort
               setting (in the [windows] section).

               The &lt;TransmissionRetryTimeout&gt; value determines the amount
of
               time (in  seconds) allowed for attempted transmission
               retries.

               The &lt;DeviceNotSelectedTimeout&gt; value determines the number
of
               seconds Print Manager will wait for the device to be
switched
               on.

               If the timeout values are not specified for a particular
               port, Windows uses the default settings listed in the
               [windows] section for that port.

Caution: When changing a setting in this section, be sure it does not
conflict with a corresponding setting in the [devices] section. Problems
may occur if an installed printer does not appear in the [PrinterPorts]
section.

To change:      Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window or
               choose the Printer Setup command from the Print Manager
               Options menu.
____________________________________________________________

[devices] Section Settings

The [devices] section lists the installed printers. The settings in
this section match those in the [PrinterPorts] section, without the
timeout values. This section is necessary only for Windows version 2.x
applications, which look to the [devices] section for this
information.

The [devices] section can contain one or more occurrences of the
following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;device-name&gt;=&lt;driver-name&gt;, &lt;port-name&gt; [[,&lt;port-name&gt;,...]]

 Purpose:      Specifies an installed printer.

               The &lt;device-name&gt; keyname is the name of the printer. The
               &lt;driver-name&gt; value is the printer driver filename. The
               &lt;port-name&gt; value specifies the port that is assigned to
the
               printer. If the printer is not currently assigned to a
port,
               the &lt;port-name&gt; value is the string specified in the
NullPort
               setting (in the [windows] section).

Caution: When changing a setting in this section, be sure it does not
conflict with a corresponding setting in the [PrinterPorts] section.
Problems may occur if an installed printer does not appear in the
[PrinterPorts] section.

To change:      Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window or
               choose the Printer Setup command from the Print Manager
               Options menu.
____________________________________________________________

[Programs] Section Settings

If you use File Manager or Program Manager to open a document file
that is associated with a file type in the Registration Database, and
File Manager or Program Manager cannot find the program file that
starts the application specified by the file type, Program Manager or
File Manager will look in the [Programs] section ot the WIN.INI file
for the path to the program file. If the path is not in the [Programs]
section, Program Manager or File Manager will display a dialog box in
which you can specify the path. The path you specify is then added to
the [Program] section.

The [Program] section can contain one or more occurrences of the
following settings:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;program file&gt;=&lt;drive&gt;:&lt;directory&gt;\&lt;program file&gt;

Purpose:        Specifies the drive, directory, and executable program file
               needed to start an application.

               The &lt;program file&gt; keyname specifies the name of the
program
               file that Windows was searching for when you tried to open
               the associated data file.

               The &lt;drive&gt; keyname specifies the drive on which the
program
               file is located. The &lt;directory&gt; keyname specifies the
               directory in which the program file is located. The second
               &lt;program file&gt; keyname specifies the name of the executable
               program file, located in the specified drive and directory,
               needed to start the associated application.
____________________________________________________________

The [colors] section defines the colors for components of the Windows
display.

The colors section can contain settings of the following type:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;component&gt;=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:        The &lt;red-value&gt;, &lt;green-value&gt;, and &lt;blue-value&gt; values are
               integers  that specify the relative intensities of red,
blue,
               and green, respectively. These settings can range from 0
               (minimum intensity) to 255 (maximum intensity).
