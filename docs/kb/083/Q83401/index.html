-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows version 3.1 works correctly with Qualitas 386MAX or BlueMAX memory
managers version 5.1 and later.

Behavior of Windows Setup
-------------------------

Windows Setup should detect 386MAX or BlueMAX if they are running when you
install Windows, and Setup should take appropriate action. If you are running
386MAX or BlueMAX versions 5.1, 5.11, or 5.12, Setup upgrades several files in
your 386MAX or BlueMAX directory. These files are only used for supporting
Windows. The files are 386MAX.VXD, BLUEMAX.VXD, and WINDOWS.LOD.

The .VXD files are loaded automatically by 386MAX or BlueMAX when Windows starts
in 386 enhanced mode; they are not needed if Windows is run in standard mode.

Windows Setup automatically creates or modifies a 386MAX.PRO file in your memory
manager directory, and makes sure this file instructs the memory manager to load
the WINDOWS.LOD file when the memory manager is started. It does so by including
the line

     LOAD=&lt;path&gt;WINDOWS.LOD"

[Bin the profile file. It also makes sure the profile is being used by ensuring
that the line

     PRO=&lt;path&gt;\386MAX.PRO

is included on the line in CONFIG.SYS, which starts the memory manager.

The following sections describe known problems that may occur.

386MAX or BlueMAX Not Configured for Windows
--------------------------------------------

When you install 386MAX or BlueMAX, the installation program asks you whether or
not you intend to use Windows. If you answer No, then the program disables all
Windows support features by inserting the NOWIN3 keyword in the 386MAX.PRO file
or on the command line in CONFIG.SYS.

If you later install Windows, you must remove this keyword in order to let the
two programs run at the same time.

Software Loaded High
--------------------

Windows Setup may not be able to detect memory-resident software that is loaded
into upper memory blocks using the Qualitas 386LOAD utility.

Upgrading from to 386MAX or BlueMax 6.0 or Later
------------------------------------------------

If you have installed Windows for use with 386MAX or BlueMAX versions below 6.0,
and later upgrade to version 6.0, your memory manager profile file (normally
386MAX.PRO or BLUEMAX.PRO) still contains the line to load WINDOWS.LOD at boot
time. This is no longer required and can be removed to free up a small amount of
additional memory.

Qualitas Installation May Install QCACHE Along with SMARTDRV.EXE
----------------------------------------------------------------

Older versions of the 386MAX or BlueMAX installation programs recommend
installing the QCACHE disk cache even if SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0 is already
installed. You should never attempt to run two disk cache utilities at the same
time. Disable QCACHE.

Running ASQ Utility Under Windows
---------------------------------

The Qualitas ASQ utility (similar to Microsoft Diagnostics) is not compatible
with Windows and should not be run while Windows is running. Doing so may cause
your workstation to hang.

Using the VGASWAP Option with 386 Enhanced Mode
-----------------------------------------------

Windows 386 enhanced mode should work correctly when 386MAX or BlueMAX VGASWAP
options are enabled, provided that you do not set the UseRomFonts=1 switch in
the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. Using that setting in conjunction with
VGASWAP may cause some full-screen messages to be drawn incorrectly and be
difficult to read.

Windows May Use B000-B7FF
-------------------------

By default, Windows 3.1 uses the UMA addresses B000-B7FF. Many loadhigh managers
attempt to also use this area, causing a conflict with Windows. There are two
solutions to this problem:

1. Exclude the range B000-B7FF with the memory manager.

  -or-

2. Install MONOUMB2.386.

  a. Copy and expand the MONOUMB2.38_ file that is on your Windows disk to your
     Windows SYSTEM directory by typing the following at the MS-DOS command
     prompt:

  expand monoumb2.38_ c:\windows\system

  b. Add the following setting to the [386Enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI file:

  device=monoumb2.386

386MAX Parameter EXT=0 Not Recommended
--------------------------------------

Qualitas 386MAX program has a parameter EXT=0 that may cause problems with
Windows version 3.1. Qualitas does not recommend using this setting; Windows 3.1
does not support it. Do NOT use this setting.

If you use this setting, Windows 3.1 fails during Setup and may hang in standard
mode when you exit.
