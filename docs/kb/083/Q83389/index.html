-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The information contained in this article is taken from the SYSINI.WRI file
contained in the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for the Windows operating system
version 3.1. The SYSINI.WRI file may be viewed with Windows Write.

The [NonWindowsApp] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains settings that affect
the performance non-Windows applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The [NonWindowsApp] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________

CommandEnvSize=&lt;bytes&gt;

Default:  0 with MS-DOS versions earlier than 3.2.
         Otherwise, the value for the /e: parameter in the
         shell= command line in the CONFIG.SYS file.
Purpose:  Specifies the size of the COMMAND.COM environment.
         Note that running batch files with the extension
         .BAT starts COMMAND.COM, so this setting also
         applies to batch files. The value for this setting
         must be either 0, or between 160 and 32768. A
         value of 0 disables this setting. If the value is
         not valid, it will be rounded up to 160 or down to
         32768. If the value is less than the current size
         of the actual environment, this setting will be
         disabled, as if it were set to 0. If you have
         specified the environment size in a PIF file for
         COMMAND.COM, the PIF file setting overrides this
         setting.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

DisablePositionSave=&lt;Boolean&gt;

Default:  0
Purpose:  When disabled, the position and font used in a
         non-Windows applications is saved in the
         DOSAPP.INI file when you quit the application. If
         enabled, the position and fonts used by a non-
         Windows application whose settings have not been
         previously saved in the DOSAPP.INI file will not
         be saved. If enabled, the setting can be
         overridden for each non-Windows application by
         selecting the Save Settings On Exit check box in
         the Font dialog box.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

FontChangeEnable=&lt;Boolean&gt;

Default:  1 on systems that use Windows 3.1 grabbers. 0 on
         systems that use Windows 3.00 grabbers
Purpose:  Provides the ability to change the fonts when
         running non-Windows applications in a window on
         systems that use version 3.00 of the grabbers
         (usually 3.00 display drivers). Windows version 3.1
         of the video grabbers (used in 3.1 display
         drivers) include built-in support for changing
         fonts when running non-Windows applications in a
         Window. If you are using a 3.00 grabber that has
         not been updated to include the ability to change
         fonts and you want to use this feature, enable
         this setting. However, with this setting enabled,
         your screen may lose characters and the cursor may
         change size and positition slightly.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

GlobalHeapSize=&lt;kilobytes&gt;

Default:  0
Purpose:  Specifies the size of a buffer in conventional
         memory that Windows allocates when running in
         standard mode. This buffer can be used to share
         information among all non-Windows applications
         that are started from Windows. This setting has no
         effect when Windows is running in 386 enhanced
         mode.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file. (You
           should never need to change this setting.)
____________________________________________________________

LocalTSRs=&lt;list-of-TSR-applications&gt;

Default:  DOSedit, ced
Purpose:  Specifies which terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
         programs work properly if they are copied to each
         instance of a virtual machine. When you start
         Windows, it detects any TSR programs that are
         currently running. If the TSR is on the LocalTSRs
         list, Windows will place a copy of the TSR in each
         virtual machine you run. Many TSR's will not run
         properly if they are added to this list. Make sure
         your TSR is fully compatible with Windows and can
         be copied to a virtual machine before adding it to
         the list.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

MouseInDOSBox=&lt;Boolean&gt;

Default:  1 if an MS-DOS mouse driver with the extension
         .COM or .SYS that supports the use of a mouse with
         a non-Windows application is loaded. Oherwise, the
         default is 0.
Purpose:  Specifies whether the mouse is supported when
         running a non-Windows application in a window.
         Mouse support for non-Windows applications running
         in a window is automatically available if you are
         using a Windows 3.1 version of the grabbers. If
         you are using a Windows 3.00 version of the
         grabbers and you want mouse support, enable this
         setting. If you do not want mouse support, disable
         this setting.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

NetAsynchSwitching=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:  0, unless an application is running that supports
         the use of the Task Switcher API by the NETBIOS.
Purpose:  Specifies whether or not you can switch away from
         an application (running in standard mode) after it
         has made an asynchronous network BIOS call. If
         disabled, you cannot switch away from an
         application after it has made an asynchronous
         network BIOS call. Switching away from some
         applications that make  these calls might cause
         your system to fail. Once Windows detects an
         asynchronous NetBIOS call, you cannont switch away
         from the application, even if no more of these
         calls are made. Enable this setting if you are
         sure that the applications you use will not
         receive network messages while they are inactive.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

ScreenLines=&lt;number&gt;

Default:  25
Purpose:  Specifies the number of lines that will be
         displayed on the screen when running a non-Windows
         application. An application that specifies a
         different screen mode can override this setting.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________

SwapDisk=&lt;drive-colon-directory&gt;

Default:  The directory pointed to by the TEMP environment
         variable; if there is no TEMP variable, then the
         default is the root directory of your first hard
         drive (usually labeled C:). If you do not have a
         hard disk, then the default is the root directory
         of your first floppy drive (usually labeled A:).
Purpose:  Provides the name of the disk drive and directory
         to which Windows running in standard mode swaps
         non-Windows applications.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
